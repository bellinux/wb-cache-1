5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the <b>cabinet</b> <b>legs,</b> the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|R

50|$|Integrated audio {{equipment}} {{has a long}} history, beginning with {{the integration of the}} record player and the wireless receiver. Such units were usually called radiograms or stereograms. Very often these were designed as items of household furniture, with a large wooden <b>cabinet</b> on <b>legs.</b> These units were originally monaural, and featured a single integrated loudspeaker in {{the main body of the}} cabinet. By the 1960s these units had become smaller, and had developed to include stereophonic reproduction. The necessity of having suitable separation of the speakers meant that the single cabinet designs evolved into three-box designs, and the main box could become much smaller. By the beginning of the 1970s systems were starting to be made of plastic and other materials rather than wood.|$|R
50|$|In 1842, Whistle-binkie: Stories for the Fireside was {{published}} and contained the rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. The poem {{would go on}} to become known in other countries, in translation, and made Miller famous at the time.In 1871, Miller's leg became ulcerated and he had to retire from <b>cabinet</b> making. The <b>leg</b> became infected and led to his death in 1872 aged 62. By then Miller was destitute and was buried at Tollcross. Later a memorial to Miller was erected on the Glasgow Necropolis.|$|R
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter <b>cabinet</b> on <b>legs.</b> Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|R
40|$|Art deco <b>cabinet</b> {{on short}} <b>legs.</b> Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller {{served as a}} soldier in World War I, {{spending}} time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1981. updatedDigital imag...|$|R
40|$|Dr Jüri Kermik {{from the}} Design and Craft Programme, Faculty of Arts, was invited guest {{exhibitor}} at the EcoDesign 2011 exhibition in Finland (14 - 18 September). EcoDesign is a prestigious annual event launched in 2009 and held {{as part of}} the Helsinki Design Week. The theme of the 3 rd International EcoDesign was MultiFunction. The exhibition presented ecological and multifunctional furniture from 100 internationally recognized designers from 11 countries including Shigeru Ban, Karim Rashid, Eero Aarnio and Björn Dahlström. Kermik’s design STANDPOINT minimises the amount of material and parts but extends the degree of multifunctionality through detailing, modularity and options for assembly. STANDPOINT utilises only four inter-connectable components for a maximum adjustability. Rather than attempting to define a fixed proposition, Kermik invites the user to create an object to be acted upon. Component parts: four wooden interconnectable and adjustable arms/legs, tray(s) and a box. Compatibles: lampshades, coat hangers, hooks, umbrellas, tools, instruments, clothes, books, maps, flowers, candles etc. Combinations: tripod, easel, stick-leg stand, pedestal, lampstand, crutch, sewing stand, display cabinet, telescope mount, workstand, trestle, plant stand, display stand, deadman, drinks <b>cabinet,</b> cake stand, <b>leg,</b> standard lamp, prop, sawhorse, coat hanger, clothes rack, buttress, music stand, bracket, stick measure, straight edge, mirror stand, notice board, tool box, tool rack, book case, adjustable square, compass, stilt, sign support, gun mount, bookstand, tray stand, magazine rack, key cabinet, valet stand, umbrella stand, candlestand, trivet, navigator’s level...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{study is}} an {{analysis}} and {{a comparison of}} traditional furniture styles in China and Korea in terms of size, style of leg, and metal mounts. The {{study was limited to}} the household wardrobes, cabinets, and chests of both countries from the fifteenth to the early twentieth century. A total of 141 examples (65 examples of Chinese furniture, 76 of Korean) included illustrations from publications and actual pieces from the Portland Art Museum and six antique shops in Oregon and California. A work sheet was developed to record observations of the sample. For statistical analysis the binomial probabilities table, contingency table analysis, and t-test were used; level of significance was established at 0. 05. All Chinese wardrobes and 82. 2 percent of the <b>cabinets</b> had straight <b>legs.</b> Chinese chests had either legs of horse's hoof style or no legs. The most frequent motif of Chinese hinges and lock shields was the square, and the most frequent motif of the pulls was the leaf. Chinese circle lock shields tended to appear with circle hinges, and square lock shields with square hinges. More than half of Korean wardrobes had horse's hoof <b>legs.</b> Of Korean <b>cabinets,</b> 66. 7 percent had straight legs and 64. 7 percent of chests did not have legs. The square motif appeared most often on Korean hinges and lock shields. The most frequent motif of Korean pulls was the circle. Whereas Korean circle lock shields tended to appear with circle hinges, Korean square lock shields did not tend to have square hinges. The overall features of Chinese furniture in this study were quite different from Korean. Even though both Chinese and Korean furniture were simple and straight in structure, Chinese furniture was simpler. Usually a piece of Korean wardrobe or cabinet consisted of several stories, and the front was symmetrically divided into many rectangular panels and drawers. Chinese wardrobes were significantly larger than Korean in height, width, and depth; the width and depth of Chinese cabinets were significantly larger than those of Korean. Chinese chests, however, were significantly smaller than Korean in height and width. For both Chinese and Korean furniture, wood grains served as an important-decorative element; but the wood grains on Korean furniture were more distinct and arranged more variedly. Usually, on a piece of Korean furniture the designs of wood grains were symmetrically arranged; vertical and horizontal grains were combined. Metal mounts were used as decorative as well as functional elements for the furniture of both countries, but Korean furniture had more kinds and amounts of metal mounts than Chinese. Even though each country had its preferred motifs and its own motifs on metal mounts, the majority of both Chinese and Korean metal mounts were of geometric motifs...|$|R
