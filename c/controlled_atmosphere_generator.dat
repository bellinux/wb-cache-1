The program consists of pulldown time and energy use models for a membrane air separator, an ammonia fractionating burner, and a catalytic oxygen burner. Predicted results subsequently became input to an interactive computer program, Fruit Storage Refrigeration Energy Simulation (FruSTRES), which was developed to simulate energy use by cold storage ammonia refrigeration systems. The resulting model package was then used to predict overall annual energy use in fruit storages, based on number and size of rooms, building construction, equipment operation (both refrigeration and CA), commodity stored, storage period(s), and weather conditions. Redacted for Privacy The CAS accurately predicted the pulldown time of each type of equipment under normal operation. The resulting model package (CAS and FruSTRES), will be an invaluable tool in design and analyses of ammonia refrigeration and atmosphere generation systems used in common and <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> fruit storages. °Copyright by Pichaya Boonpraso...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage vs {{conventional}} refrigerated storage on the metabolism of Moorpark and Large Early Montgamet apricot and Elberta peach fruits were studied. The <b>controlled</b> <b>atmospheres</b> studied were 0. 0 percent CO 2 - 5. 0 percent O 2; 2. 5 percent CO 2 - 5. 0 percent O 2; 5. 0 percent CO 2 - 2. 5 percent O 2; 7. 5 percent CO 2 - 5. 0 percent O 2; {{as compared to}} conventional refrigerated storage. Nitrogen percent {{was assumed to be}} the difference between the total CO 2 and O 2 content minus 100. Fruits were periodically removed from the storage and analyzed for firmness, fleshy pericarp color, total pectins, pH, titratable acidity, total and free reducing sugars, tannins, organic acids, and amino acids. <b>Controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage had both beneficial and detrimenta 1 effects on stored apricot and peach fruits. The general retardation of the respiration rate and consequent delay of the climateric rise due to <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> are important in prolonging the storage life of the fruit. Apricot fruits stored in 2. 5 to 5. 0 percent CO 2 and 2. 5 to 5. 0 percent O 2 maintained superior quality for 15 to 30 days longer than did conventionally refrigerated fruit. Moorpark fruit could be stored longer than Large Early Montgamet fruit, mainly because of mesocarp browning in the latter variety of fruit. The results indicated that the storage life of Elberta peach fruits were not substantially increased in <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage. Apricot fruit stored in <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> treatments ripened at a reduced rate and produced less yellow pigments of the fleshy pericarp tissue than the conventional refrigerated fruit. There was a retardation of the de-greening processes of the fruit stored in CO 2 concentrations higher than atmospheric air. It appeared that high concentrations of CO 2 had an inhibitory effect on chlorophyll degradation. Succinic acid coupled with high tannin concentrations, induced by CO 2, apparently caused browning of the mesocarp tissue of the fruit in <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage at a more rapid rate than conventional refrigerated stored fruit. The organic and amino acids of peach and apricot fruits had a variable response to <b>control</b> <b>atmosphere</b> treatment. The organic acids, particularly malic acid, were reduced in concentration, while succinic acid accumulated. Succinic acid accumulation was dependent upon the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere. It was suggested that CO 2 had a toxic or inhibitory effect on the succinic oxidase enzyme system which resulted in succinic acid accumulation. The accumulated succinic acid, thereby, may have had a toxic effect on the mesocarp tissue of the fruit and caused part of the browning. Aspartic acid decreased in concentration under higher CO 2 treat-ments, while alanine and glutamic acid increased. Total sugar concen-tration was generally not effected by <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage. The metabolism of free reducing sugars in higher CO 2 treatments was markedly reduced in the apricot fruit. The beneficial aspects of <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> on stored fruit appeared to be the increased length of the storage period for apricot fruit, as well as a reduced rate of metabolism. The storage life of apricot fruit was extended 15 to 30 days in the appropriate atmosphere. The adverse effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> storage of apricot and peach fruit appeared to be: the inhibitory or toxic effect of CO 2 on certain enzyme systems; the accumulation of certain metabolites, which may have been toxic to the fruit tissue; the increased rate of tissue browning, the inhibitory effect of CO 2 on the de-greening and color development mechanisms...|$|R
