All are written with compound time signatures (6/8 or 9/8), except number 7, which is in 6/4.|$|E

In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E

25|$|Many of the neighborhood's {{streets are}} narrow and some curve at odd angles.

25|$|Earthworm Jim 3D is a {{platform}} game, {{the third in}} the Earthworm Jim series. It is a sequel to Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2, and the first game in the series to not be developed by Shiny Entertainment, as the rights had been sold to Interplay Entertainment, who handed the franchise off to VIS Entertainment. The game suffered a difficult, prolonged development cycle that was repeatedly delayed until it was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. The game was not received well, with critics claiming that the <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> originals was lost, and that despite the long development period, the game still felt sloppy and lacked previously promoted features.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when his third book was brought out he had retired {{for a short time}} to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as he tells us, of his {{unprofitable}} attendance to the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to have felt the <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.|$|E

25|$|Since ski trails {{were first}} cut in 1961, Breckenridge Ski Resort {{has made the}} town a popular {{destination}} for skiers.

25|$|The Ulysses mosaic {{is a work}} {{inspired}} by the Odyssey: the Greek hero is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses’s hands {{are tied to the}} main mast so that he will not succumb to the fatal <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sirens’ music. Ulysses’s companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand {{at the base of a}} rocky crag. They are depicted with the bust of a woman, but with the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses’s boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is over-sized. The mosaic has been dated to around 260-268 CE; it was discovered in the “house of Ulysses and the pirates”.|$|E
25|$|A restless, {{creative}} man, J.P. {{found it}} hard to settle down in any profession, and the family moved often. In 1963 they relocated to Lagunitas, a small town located in western Marin County, California, into a house bought for the young family by J.P.’s parents. San Geronimo Valley was a sleepy, rural community, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, hippies and musicians were drawn to the beauty and lush <b>charm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. For a short time both the Grateful Dead and the band Big Brother and the Holding Company lived in rustic summer houses or camps nearby. The Pickens house overflowed with hippies, visiting artists and musicians from the Quicksilver Messenger Service, Electric Flag and The Youngbloods. The pastoral roads surrounding the house were filled with hippie families living in converted schoolbuses. Many of the young players in the local acid rock scene were fascinated with J.P.'s rapid fire banjo playing, fueled by his love for the east Indian music of Ravi Shankar especially, and he would play raga-like extended compositions loosely based on old bluegrass standards, on his banjo. Many jam sessions were held at the Lagunitas house, lost to posterity but still alive in the recorded psychedelic music of the time; David Meltzer has said his and J.P.'s attempts to fuse jazz, folk, bluegrass, east Indian and rock n roll were ahead of their time, helping to create a musical genre now highly prized, fondly called Marin County Raga Folk.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} a large {{fraction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proton spin comes from a contribution due to a nonperturbative intrinsic <b>charm</b> component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proton.
