50|$|Beekeepers may {{remove the}} entire {{honeycomb}} to harvest honey. Honey bees consume about 8.4 lb (3.8 kg) of honey to secrete 1 lb (454 g) of wax, {{so it makes}} economic sense to return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey. The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the honey extractor. If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused {{in a number of}} ways, including making sheets of <b>comb</b> <b>foundation</b> with hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, plastic <b>comb</b> <b>foundation</b> {{has become}} widely used by beekeepers {{but it has}} not been studied to see if it hinders {{recruitment}} communication by reducing the transmission of the comb vibrations produced by bees performing waggle dances. We used laser vibrometry to compare combs built with beeswax foundation vs. plastic foundation in terms of transmission of dance vibrations. We also used behavioral experiments to compare the recruitment effectiveness of dances performed on combs built with beeswax foundation vs. plastic foundation. We found that combs built with plastic foundation are markedly poorer at transmitting the 250 Hz vibrations produced by dancing bees. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of reduced effectiveness of dances performed on combs built with plastic foundation vs. combs built with beeswax foundation. Evidently, a comb built with plastic foundation provides a fully suitable substrate for waggle dance communication...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarroa {{destructor}} preferentially invades larger {{honey bee}} brood cells. Consequently, {{it was expected}} that brood in old combs with reduced-size cells would be less infested than the brood in new comb cells. An old brood comb was placed in each of eight Africanized honey bee colonies, along with a new, naturally constructed comb (without <b>comb</b> <b>foundation).</b> The mean percentage of brood cells infested with V. destructor was significantly higher in the old combs (22. 6 %), than in the new combs (9. 75 %), even though the inside width of the cells was significantly smaller in the old (4. 58 mm) than in the new combs (4. 85 mm). Within the range where there was an overlap in the width of brood cells between old and new combs, which was from 4. 5 to 4. 9 mm, the old comb cells were over four times more frequently infested with mites than were the new comb cells. Some factor other than cell size makes old brood comb cells much more attractive to V. destructor than newly constructed brood comb...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} beehive {{was developed}} in Senegal nearly 15 years ago. The entire design {{is focused on the}} cost of the hive and the special conditions of tropical apiculture. It is very different to imported modern hives but is no less effective. Indeed, all modern hives are designed in the same way, with 80 -litre capacity to store honey, about 20 frames to make it possible to remove the combs, sheets of imprinted wax <b>comb</b> <b>foundation</b> and an extractor for collection purposes. A hive of this kind costs African farmers about CFAF 80, 000 / Euros 122 ! In contrast, the horizontal hive costs less than CFAF 5, 000 / Euros 7. 60 and it is just as easy to use as traditional hives. Its main strong points are that it is made of cement (cheaper and stronger than wood), it is horizontal (with no stand) and not vertical, the frames are easily made from sticks that are very cheap and the sheets of imprinted foundation are replaced by simple strips of ordinary wax. The honeycombs are not totally 'framed'. They can be extracted using traditional methods and the purchase of a modern extractor is not essential. This kind of hive can easily be made by beekeepers themselves and will give the same honey yield as a modern hive for a very small investment.

40|$|Although beeswax {{adulteration}} {{represents one}} of the main beeswax quality issues, there are still no internationally standardised analytical methods for routine quality control. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish an analytical procedure suitable for routine detection of beeswax adulteration using FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. For the purpose of this study, reference IR spectra of virgin beeswax, paraffin, and their mixtures containing different proportions of paraffin (5 - 95 %), were obtained. Mixtures were used for the establishment of calibration curves. To determine the prediction strength of IR spectral data for the share of paraffin in mixtures, the Partial Least Squares Regression method was used. The same procedure was conducted on beeswax-beef tallow mixtures. The model was validated using <b>comb</b> <b>foundation</b> samples of an unknown chemical background which had been collected from the international market (n = 56). Selected physico-chemical parameters were determined for comparison purposes. Results revealed a strong predictive power (R 2 = 0. 999) of IR spectra for the paraffin and beef tallow share in beeswax. The results also revealed that the majority of the analysed samples (89 %) were adulterated with paraffin; only 6 out of 56 (11 %) samples were identified as virgin beeswax, 28 % of the samples exhibited a higher level of paraffin adulteration (> 46 % of paraffin), while the majority of the analysed samples (50 %) were found to be adulterated with 5 - 20 % of paraffin. These results indicate an urgent need for routine beeswax authenticity control. In this study, we demonstrated that the analytical approach defining the standard curves for particular adulteration levels in beeswax, based on chemometric modelling of specific IR spectral region indicative for adulteration, enables reliable determination of the adulterant proportions in beeswax...|$|E
40|$|International audienceProtection {{of honey}} combs from wax moth Galleria mellonella {{involves}} the use of physical, biological or chemical control methods. Chemical control may results of residues in the extracted honey. The presence of residues of p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene in honey were investigated by means of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry (GC/MS). The method was linear between 5 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 1 ìg/kg and 200 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Limits of detection were 1 ìg/kg and 0. 1 ìg/kg respectively. The relative standard deviations were 2. 59 % and 7. 92 % for p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene respectively. Application of the method to 90 unifloral Greek honeys revealed that in 25. 6 % of the samples the concentration of either one of the pesticides overreached the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) value. Maximum concentrations were 163. 03 ìg/kg of honey for p-dichlorobenzene and 193. 74 ìg/kg of honey for naphthalene. Naphthalene was found in traceable amounts in 78. 9 % of the samples, but only 5. 6 % of them contained concentrations above the MRL value. This indicates the use of pre-contaminated honey <b>comb</b> <b>foundations</b> or built <b>combs.</b> Nevertheless, because naphthalene is naturally present in some plant species growing in Greece, the contribution of nectar from such a floral source should not be debarred...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the modern}} Demaree method, the queen {{is placed in}} the bottom box, along with one or two frames of brood (but {{containing}} no open brood), as well as one or two frames of food stores, and empty <b>combs</b> or <b>foundation.</b> A queen excluder is placed above the bottom box, thereby restricting the queen to the bottom box but allowing bees to move freely between the bottom box {{and the rest of the}} hive. The original hive, along with all open brood, is placed above the queen excluder. The method works best if the nurse bees are remove far away from the queen. The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the brood nest at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the brood nest and the queen excluder. If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create emergency cells. After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the emergency cells, and then either removes the queen excluder (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the swarming impulse is over.|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{declines in}} honey bees for crop {{pollination}} threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed {{production in the}} United States. A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007 – 08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60 % of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47 % had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all <b>comb</b> and <b>foundation</b> wax samples (98 %) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, {{with an average of}} 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3. 1 ppm).

40|$|American foulbrood disease (AFB), {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus larvae, is a disease of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and other honey bee species (Apis sp.). It is distributed world wide. Spores of the bacterium can infest larvae of the bees, ultimately leading {{to the death of}} the larva or pupa. Although often spores are present in bee colonies, it only sporadically leads to serious disease symptoms, and to the death of the colony. In most countries the disease is under an obligation of notification, and control is often carried out by the government. Until 2005 this was also the situation in the Netherlands, where the disease was controlled using a ‘stamping out’ procedure. However, since the fall of 2005 the beekeepers are responsible for the control of AFB. Therefore PPO Bee Unit together with the Dutch beekeepers organizations has developed material for disease recognition, made a script for AFB control and organized training meetings for bee health officers. In the new control script the strict ‘stamping out’ approach (destroying the whole apiary) has been abandoned. Now only the visibly diseased colonies will be eliminated, the other colonies of the apiary will be cleaned and restarted on <b>foundation</b> <b>comb</b> (limited stamping out) ...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{design of}} support {{structure}} including foundation and turbine tower {{is among the}} most critical challenges for offshore wind turbine. With development of offshore wind industry heading for deeper ocean areas, new support structural concept such as a full lattice tower could be proven to be more advantageous than others when consideration of cost, safety and even environment aspects, etc are taken into. This thesis first gave introduction of present industrial applications of hybrid support structural concept <b>combing</b> a lattice <b>foundation</b> and monotower in relatively deep water areas before the presenting and introduction of challenges with the transition piece component. Conceptual model of transition piece design for a full lattice tower support structure proposal was discussed extensively which included consideration of structural form, functional requirement, mechanical condition, etc. A mechanical model of transition piece with regards to boundary condition and load conditions was also provided. Design and analysis of two different types of transition piece models under various load conditions were performed during preliminary design and with conclusion drawn, a refined final design of transition piece model for the full lattice tower support structural concept which has also included more practical aspects was assessed through investigation of its performance under varying load conditions and different load cases. This refined final design was found to be the most optimal design fulfilling all relevant requirements at a comparable structural cost. Conclusion and recommendation was therefore given in the last part. This thesis work is serving for a novel proposal of support structural concept for future offshore wind industry and relevant present experience is in fact nonexistent. The work applied present industrial information of hybrid support structure as basis along with consideration of offshore wind turbine structural and operational mechanism and their respective requirement. Structural analysis of transition piece design was conducted by means of finite element analysis technique and structural load conditions were simulated through up-to-date numerical modeling code for offshore wind turbine structure. Due to absence of relevant verification sources, advice and correction of the thesis content is much appreciated. </p...|$|R
