Each author emphasizes a particular aspect of industrial organization — internal and external organization, innovation, and <b>cross-entry</b> — and each elaborates Marshall's much discussed notion of evolutionary principles. Marshall sought coordination of developing knowledge and feared atrophy through concentration, drawing evidence from empirical studies of firms succeeding one another.

As demand is uncertain, entry options should be exercised at the optimal time, trading off the market share gain against the option to wait until more information is revealed, while anticipating competitors' entry behaviour. When the strategic investment grants a strong competitive advantage, the innovator can optimally choose the timing of entry; in case of weaker advantage, the investing firm enters just before its competitor would. In a context of increased uncertainty, the value of waiting to invest rises, but {{the value of a}} strategic investment increases even more. In some cases, strategic investment can act as a threat to discourage <b>cross-entry,</b> making parallel monopoly sustainable. entry; growth opportunities; real options; strategic investment; technological innovation...|$|E
