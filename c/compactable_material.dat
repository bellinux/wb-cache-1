40|$|MSWI {{bottom ash}} is a well-graded highly <b>compactable</b> <b>{{material}}</b> {{that can be}} used as a road material in unbound pavements. Achieving the compactness assumed in the design of the pavement is of primary concern to ensure long term structural stability. Regulations on road construction in a number of EU countries rely on standard tests originally developed for natural aggregates, which may not be appropriate to accurately assess MSWI bottom ash. This study is intended to assist in consistently assessing MSWI bottom ash compaction by means of the Proctor method. This test is routinely applied to address unbound road materials and suggests two methods. Compaction parameters show a marked procedural dependency due to the particle morphology and weak particle strength of ash. Re-compacting a single batch sample to determine Proctor curves is a common practise that turns out to overvalue optimum moisture contents and maximum dry densities. This could result in wet-side compactions not meeting stiffness requirements. Inaccurate moisture content measurements during testing may also induce erroneous determinations of compaction parameters. The role of a number of physical properties of MSWI bottom ash in compaction is also investigated. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Three- {{different}} groups of materials were chosen to investigate the uniaxial compaction of particulate solids. Dentritic and cubic sodium chloride were chosen as plastically deforming, dicalcium phosphcte and sugar as fragmentary and styrocell, homopolymer and copolyrinier as non-compactable materials. The uniaxial compaction of the materials was continuously followed by measurement. of 1 -. h e applied force, the force transmitted radially to the die wall and the upper punch displacement. The data obtained was presented {{in the form of}} Mohr circles, stress pathways (shear-mean compaction stress planes) and a three dimensional representation in mean compaction stress, shear stress and volume change. The yield loci evaluated from Mohr circles and shear-mean compaction stress relationships of <b>compactable</b> and non-compactable <b>materials</b> were found to be similar in shape. The unloading stress profiles were however more informative. All unloading shear-mean compaction stres's curves of the <b>compactable</b> <b>materials</b> cross the mean compaction stress axis to give negative values of shear stress and reach a minimum value of T min' which was material and compaction p.,- essure dependent. The unloading curves of non-compactable materials gaye approximately zero shear. The parameters evaluated from the characteristic stress profiles were correlated to the tensile strength and hardness of compacts. Mathematical expressions have been proposed for the shear-mean compaction stress relationships of the materials investigated. TI he materials were characterised before and after compaction in terms of specific surface aroa, porosity and mechanical strength of compacts with ccrnpaction pressure.

40|$|International audienceMany of {{aggregate}} composites {{are made}} of small size particles mixed with a highly compliant rubbery polymer. When the loading leads to high pressures, the behaviour gets closer to this of cohesive, frictional, and <b>compactable</b> <b>materials.</b> When this kind of material is subjected to an impact, the loading domain {{is the case of}} high pressure (from 100 to 1000 MPa) and high strain rate (roughly 1000 s- 1). An experimental study is led by using the technique of the SHPB. The specimens are small cylinders placed in a ring which creates a passive confinement by opposing to the radial displacements. The instrumentation of the ring allows to estimate the radial stress and the radial displacement. The main point is that it makes possible the follow-up of the spherical and deviatoric parts of the stress and strain tensors during the test, without restrictive hypothesis on the behaviour of the material. The results show a high sensitivity to the strain rate. The stresses evolutions show that the frictional phenomenon is sensitive even under high pressures...|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{are very}} {{important}} in pharmaceutical formulation for taste masking, drug protection, and drug release modification. Most film coatings are applied using polymer solutions {{but the use of}} organic solvents implies some disadvantages, like solvent exposure, solvent disposal and product contamination by residual. Furthermore, such solvents are flammable and toxic for operators and their use cannot be considered pollution-free. Although the use of water as a coating-solvent eliminates many of these disadvantages, it could lead to other problems like processing time increase and long-term stability issues for some products. Among the various solventless processes, compression coating retains some importance, for example to delay or to control drug release, to associate incompatible drugs in the fixed dose combination, to target two drugs in different areas of the gastrointestinal tract, to obtain a pulsatile time-dependent release and to incorporate poorly <b>compactable</b> <b>materials</b> in the core. This coating procedure has been shaded by the difficulty to develop a manufacturing process able to localize the core {{in the center of the}} coated tablet. In the last years different manufacturing methods have been proposed to overcome this inconvenient. In particular a one-step dry-coating tablet manufacturing method implemented by Ozeky et al. is noteworthy for producing thinner coatings. Recently we have developed a thermal procedure to obtain, from a direct compression (DC) tablet containing a cross-linked polycarboxylic acid and a cellulose derivative, a bioadhesive matrix able to control the drug release. The mechanism controlling drug release is based on the formation of a non-erodible water-swellable matrix, whose behaviour can be modulated on the basis of thermal procedure and excipient composition. The unique features of this procedure make it also applicable to the manufacturing of coated tablets. Here we illustrate the preliminary experimental evidence gathered using this matrix in compression-coated tablets...|$|R
40|$|Black cotton soil {{have the}} {{tendency}} to shrink when their moisture content is decrease and swell when their moisture content is increased. Quarry wastes, is the one, which is produced in plenty of quantity. In each crusher unit about 20 - 25 % of the production is left out as the waste material-stone dust. In bulk use of quarry dust is possible through geotechnical applications as, back-fill material, embankment, sub base material. It is a byproduct of the acetylene gas production. CCR (Calcium Carbide Residue) as a treatment of soil, is a technique to save money and time on construction projects. Transform of clay soil into workable, <b>compactable,</b> friable <b>material</b> when CCR used. By CCR stabilization chemical changes in unstable clay soil which have long term effects. Experiments performed on stone dust and CCR combined at different percentage with expansive soil. The test results such as Standard Proctors test, California bearing ratio, and unconfined compression strength obtain on black cotton soil. From this study conclusion drawn {{that the combination of}} equal amount of stone dust and CCR is more effective, which is (10 %- 10 %) than the addition of stone dust and CCR individually, to the black cotton soil in controlling the swelling behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{long-term}} impermeability of clay {{barriers in}} waste disposal facilities and hydraulic struc-tures is {{of critical importance}} to environmental, gricultural, and industrial concerns. Changes in the oxidation state of Fe in the constituent clays of compacted clay barriers may degrade the hydraulic conductivity of these structures because other properties related to hydraulic onductivity, such as swelling, gel microstructure, and particle size, are greatly altered by the oxidation state. Two Na-saturated smectites (SWa- 1 and API 25) were reduced by sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 204), both in suspension a d in situ after consolidation, {{to examine the effects}} of structural Fe reduction on hydraulic onductivity. Results indicated that the hydraulic onductivity depended on both the oxidation state and the consolidation history of the clay. The hydraulic onductivity ofclay reduced in suspension before consolidation was lower than that of oxidized clay. Initially reduced smectite, thus, may be <b>compactable</b> toa less-permeable <b>material</b> with higher bulk density. But reduction of smectite in situ after consolidation i creased the hydraulic conductivity and its variability. The oxidized state of clay liners should, therefore, be preserved...|$|R
