40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a state of}} the art of path choice and traffic {{assignment}} models in road emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> reported. The approaches proposed in literature are classified, distinguishing two approaches for path choice and three approaches for traffic assignment (static, pseudo dynamic and dynamic). In literature, several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> available: at the beginning models specified in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> applied in emergency conditions. Afterwards, a first generation of models specified in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>was</b> proposed. After 9 / 11 and Katrina Hurricane a second generation of emergency <b>conditions</b> models <b>was</b> specified. Evolution of models applied in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper: first, models in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated; second, models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated. In the last ten years several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> have <b>been</b> carried out.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period.

That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
