5|$|Ācārya Haribhadra (8th century CE) {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of anekāntavāda. He was the first {{classical}} author to write a doxography, a <b>compendium</b> <b>of</b> a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's <b>Compendium</b> <b>of</b> Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later <b>compendium</b> <b>of</b> Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E

5|$|Islamic society paid careful {{attention}} to medicine, following a hadith enjoining the preservation of good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as {{the theory of the}} four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi (ca. 854–925/935) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized that fever {{was a part of the}} body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume <b>compendium</b> <b>of</b> Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' <b>Compendium</b> <b>of</b> Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events.

The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students {{in their study of}} the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss.

5|$|There are 18 Japanese book National Treasures that do {{not belong}} to any of the above categories. They cover 14 works of various types, {{including}} biographies, law or rulebooks, temple records, music scores, a medical book and dictionaries. Two of the oldest works designated are biographies of the Asuka period regent Shōtoku Taishi. The Shitennō-ji Engi, alleged to have been an autobiography by Prince Shōtoku, described Shitennō-ji, and may have been created to promote the temple. The Shitennō-ji Engi National Treasure consists of two manuscripts: the alleged original discovered in 1007 at Shitennō-ji and a later transcription by Emperor Go-Daigo. Written by imperial order in the early 8th century, the Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu is the oldest extant biography of Shōtoku. It consists of a collection of anecdotes, legendary and miraculous in nature, which emphasize Shōtoku's Buddhist activities for the sake of imperial legitimacy, and stands at the beginning of Buddhist setsuwa literature. The oldest extant manuscript of the 803 Enryaku Kōtaishiki, a <b>compendium</b> <b>of</b> rules concerned with the change of provincial governors from 782 to 803, has been designated as a National Treasure.|$|E
5|$|The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{containing}} his hagiography, {{prayers to}} him, and hymns to be chanted in church services on his feast day, was printed in Venice in 1690. The book was reprinted with {{small changes in}} 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy of the Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, {{as part of a}} compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region. A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed in Venice (1819) and Athens (1868). Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared in Venice (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of Srbljak, a <b>compendium</b> <b>of</b> akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book Lives of the Serbian Saints, published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.|$|E
