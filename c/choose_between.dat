5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> them, {{and they may not}} all decide to recognise the same one.
