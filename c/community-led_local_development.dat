Therefore, this paper examines earlier research into <b>community-led</b> <b>local</b> <b>development</b> (CLLD) initiatives in rural areas of Europe to develop {{our understanding of the}} meaning and scope of rural social innovation. We draw on a Schumpeterian view where innovations emerge from new combinations of resources that bring about positive changes and create value in society. A Schumpeterian social innovation framework is derived as the basis for re-analysing data from previous evaluations of LEADER policy in five different national contexts. This elicits a clearer understanding of social innovation in a rural development context, identifying different processes and outcomes that create social value. As the CLLD agenda and the demand for innovation in Europe gather pace, our aspirations are to inform future research and other initiatives on how to integrate social innovation into the design and evaluation of new rural development policies and programmes...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the general concept of {{knowledge}} society and deals with regional development theories which emphasize local environment as an important part of rural development. The following two questions were studied: (1) What is the early experience of municipalities when establishing a Community School? (2) In which other municipalities would it be possible and appropriate to build such a school? For this purpose, both secondary and primary research methods were combined with data collection techniques – document study, observation, and questioning. Because the examined problem is set in the context of <b>community-led</b> <b>local</b> <b>development</b> (CLLD), violation of the ‘bottom-up’ approach principle is also highlighted. The paper presents the first experiences in the establishment of seven Community Schools within the Pilsen region and based on them also recommendations for the feasibility and suitability of establishing this type of school in other rural municipalities. The results show that the educational sector is not assisting in the modernization of rural schools with regard to community education and that the possibility of the contemporary and meaningful existence of schools in small rural municipalities remains ignored...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>community-led</b> <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> this {{research}} aims to understand the blend of top down and bottom up influences that combine in campaigns for improved rural broadband provision. The representativeness of the membership of rural community broadband initiatives and the motivations and dominant arguments behind their campaigns are analysed {{from the perspective of}} neo-endogenous development, which concerns endogenous actors linking to exogenous networks and resources to raise “the potential of local areas to shape their own futures” (Ray, 2001, p 4). A sample of community-led broadband initiatives in the UK and Netherlands are studied as a precursor to two in-depth case studies in the province of Groningen and the county of Lincolnshire. The identification of key success factors enables an assessment of the scope for different rural regions to overcome the digital divide. The role of actors from within the community, the level of financial and other material resources available to them, their organisational and communication skills, network relations and the area specific/place-based nature of the arguments will all be analysed to test the theory of neo-endogenous rural development. Findings can be used to advise other community broadband initiatives and to advise policymakers how best to assess the degree (if any) and type of support that can boost community-led initiatives...|$|E

40|$|The Cohesion policy {{regulations}} for the 2014 - 20 programme period provide a new framework for supporting integrated territorial development approaches in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). In {{the context of}} European Regional Development Fund, some of these approaches are obligatory (i. e. ring-fenced budgets for urban development) whereas others are voluntary (e. g. Integrated Territorial Investments and <b>Community-led</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Development).</b> These approaches {{are part of a}} longer term shift and reflect increased awareness of place-based theory in policy aspirations, recognising that an integrated mix of policy interventions is needed to fully exploit development potential of territories. Besides finding more efficient and targeted ways to implement territorial development policies, such approaches reflect the new commitment to territorial cohesion in the EU Treaty and ambitions to give local actors greater influence and decision-making powers in local economic development plans.

Together with these objectives and according to the spirit of European integration, the European Union wants to stimulate a more intense and purposeful participation of citizens in decision-making processes {{that is one of the}} main European challenges towards 2020.

40|$|In {{advanced}} countries, {{rural areas}} are a complex web of social, political and historical factors. In addition, {{several kinds of}} uncertainties are usually present. As a consequence, frequent mismatches arise in practise between measures and rural development goals and priorities. To overcome this pitfall, a key factor {{is represented by the}} acquisition of relevant knowledge from local stakeholders. In line with this idea, the European Commission encourages the <b>Community-Led</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Development</b> approach delivered by Local Action Groups. The aim of the study is to show the suitability of a participatory approach, namely backcasting, to the outline of the Local Action Plan of a specific LAG. Within this framework, a participative backcasting experience was carried out with the stakeholders of the LAG ‘Daunia Rurale’ in order to detect their needs and the strategic actions to carry out. The study provided stakeholders and policy makers with a rational approach and an operational tool to recognise the needs and design the actions for the specific endogenous potential of the investigated area. The proposed method proved to be rather innovative in CLLD contexts for the detection of expressed needs of local stakeholders and the definition of the LAP. We submitted some questionnaires to stakeholders and looking at their results (either at the ones on the niceness of the workshop or at the strategy-validation ones), some encouraging remarks can be drawn. Backcasting has been particularly helpful to local stakeholders and decision makers in identifying the steps to give a clear direction to rural development. What we learn from this case study represents a valuable outcome that can support practitioners, policy makers and researchers in understanding how to design medium- to long-term planning development strategies in rural areas...|$|E
