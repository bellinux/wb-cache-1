5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} <b>centre</b> <b>panel.</b> He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>centre</b> <b>panel,</b> Mary {{is shown}} in a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand {{on either side of}} her. Both are dressed in black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through the open doorway at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E

The church has an undecorated medieval tub font on a 19th-century pedestal.

500|$|The triptych's <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> {{measures}} [...] {{and the two}} {{side panels}} measure [...] each. The left panel is a market scene, the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> shows peasants harvesting grapes from a row of vines and the one to the right is {{an image of a}} farmer sharpening his scythe as two others labour in the background. The triptych was originally intended to be displayed alongside another one of Jovanović's paintings, Migration of the Serbs, which had been commissioned by the Patriarchate of Karlovci. The Patriarch's dissatisfaction with the latter and his insistence that it be altered to his liking resulted in only the Vršac triptych being sent to Budapest, as Jovanović was not able to make the necessary revisions to Migration of the Serbs in time. The triptych was met with acclaim at the Exhibition and Jovanović was awarded a gold medal for his work, with critics praising his mastery of pleinairism. The painting is now on permanent exhibition at the Vršac City Museum.|$|E
500|$|The left panel shows villagers and city-dwellersSerbs, Hungarians and Germansmeeting in Vršac's main {{square to}} sell and {{purchase}} items, as well as simply to converse. The scene is set around mid-morning. It occurs {{against the backdrop of}} a row of shiny, white-washed buildings and the spire of the town's main church is also visible in the background. All the figures are dressed in costumes traditionally worn by their compatriots, making it easier for the viewer to discern their ethnicity. [...] "They interact with ease", the art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "and an aura of general good will envelops the scene". The <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> depicts a group of peasants in the countryside gathering grapes from a row of vines. The panel to the right shows villagers harvesting their ripened wheat. Two figures are seen bending over in the background, sickles in hand, while a third sharpens his scythe in the foreground. The artist's signature, Joanowits P, {{can be found in the}} bottom right-hand corner of the <b>centre</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lochner's {{identity}} remained unknown for centuries, and {{no other}} known works {{were associated with the}} Dombild altarpiece. In 1816 Ferdinand Franz Wallraf identified him as Philipp Kalf, based on a reading of a name inscribed on the cloth of a figure on the right of the <b>centre</b> <b>panel.</b> He misinterpreted markings on the stone floor pictured in Annunciation to read 1410, which he took as the year of completion. Johann Dominicus Fiorillo discovered a 15th-century record that read [...] "in 1380 there was an excellent painter in Cologne called Wilhelm, who had no equal in his art and who depicted human beings as if they were alive". In 1850 Johann Jakob Merlo identified [...] "Maister Steffan" [...] with the historical Stefan Lochner.|$|E

500|$|There are no signed {{paintings}} by Lochner, and his identity was not established until the 19th century. J. F. Böhmer in an 1823 article identified the Dombild (meaning [...] "Cathedral picture") or Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints with a work mentioned in {{an account of}} a visit to Cologne in 1520 in the diary of Albrecht Dürer. The notoriously thrifty artist paid 5 silver pfennig to see an altarpiece by [...] "Maister Steffan" [...] some seventy years after Lochner's death. Although Dürer fails to mention specifically which of Maister Steffan's panels he had seen, his description matches exactly the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> of the Dombild Altarpiece. The altarpiece is referred to {{in a number of}} other records. It was repaired and re-gilded in 1568, and mentioned in Georg Braun's Civitates Orbis Terrarum in 1572.|$|E
500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{figure is}} clearly {{identifiable}} as a pope from his clothing. It seems trapped and isolated within {{the outlines of}} an abstract three-dimensional glass cage. This framing device, described by Sylvester as a [...] "space-frame", was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career. A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case, falling {{just in front of}} the pope's face and partially covering his eyes. It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty, but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon's later works, may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist. Apart from its symbolic meaning, it has a compositional function, framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines. Such an object reappears most prominently in the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> of his 1973 Triptych, May–June 1973, where it is clearly a dangling light bulb. For Bacon, these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer, alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off, curtains open or closed.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historians are}} unsure {{as to whether}} the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych. They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel {{representing}} the Adoration of the Magi at the centre, or, as the German art historian J.D. Passavant speculated in 1841, the lost <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> may have been a Nativity. It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes, the central panel may have been stolen. Art historian Erwin Panofsky believed the Crucifixion and Last Judgement panels were intended as a diptych. He argued {{that it would have been}} unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the [...] "sumptuous treatment" [...] afforded these two panels. This approach is reminiscent of the medieval reliquaries. Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded. There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format. Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{constant}} flow of modifications were made as production progressed. A [...] "blown" [...] cockpit hood, manufactured by Malcolm, {{was introduced in}} an effort to further increase the pilot's head-room and visibility. Many mid to late production VBs – and all VCs – used the modified, improved windscreen assembly with the integral bullet resistant <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> and flat side screens introduced with the Mk III. Because the rear frame of this windscreen was taller than that of the earlier model the cockpit hoods were not interchangeable and could be distinguished by the wider rear framing on the hood used with the late-style windscreen.|$|E
2500|$|The Tempest was {{a single}} engine fighter {{aircraft}} that excelled at low-level flight. In service, its primary role soon developed into performing [...] "armed reconnaissance" [...] operations, often deep behind enemy lines. The Tempest was particularly well suited to the role because of its high speed at low to medium altitudes, its long range when equipped with two 45-gallon drop tanks, the good firepower of the four 20mm cannon and the good pilot visibility. The three-piece windscreen and side windows of the Tempest had directly benefited from examination of captured Focke Wulf Fw 190s, improvements included the careful design and positioning of the frame structure, blind spots being reduced to an absolute minimum. It had a bullet-resistant <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> made up of two layers, the outer 1.5 in (38mm) thick and the inner 0.25 in (6.5mm).|$|E

50|$|The 160Z colour {{scheme was}} based on the Datsun 280Z Zap car and came out in canary yellow with red, orange and yellow inlayed black decals, colour matched high back seats and Mexican stripe-cloth {{stitched}} in the <b>centre</b> <b>panels.</b> The 160Z also had front and rear spoilers; however, the front spoiler differed from the 140Z. Earlier models included a black rubber rear spoiler, whilst others had a colour matched yellow fibreglass rear spoiler - there is speculation as to whether Datsun-Nissan South Africa could no longer procure rubber spoilers or whether they felt the fibreglass spoiler was lighter and more durable than the rubber one.|$|R
2500|$|As styling {{development}} commenced it was realised that {{to design}} another coach {{to match the}} success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by utilising the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with [...] overriders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.|$|E
2500|$|The L21 had a {{parasol wing}} {{constructed}} in three pieces around two wooden spars. [...] The outer panels were tapered, with sweep only on their trailing edges. [...] On its first flight and tests the <b>centre</b> <b>panel</b> was also tapered {{and the overall}} span was [...] but these early flights revealed an instability around the longitudinal axis. [...] This was cured by extending the centre section span, making it just under half the new overall span of [...] and giving it a rectangular plan. The wing was plywood covered from the forward spar to the leading edge, forming a torsion resisting box, and had internal wire bracing. [...] An unusual feature that the L21 shared with the L20 and the earlier L15 was the supplementation of conventional ailerons with short chord tip flaps, each with an area of , rotating on axes toward {{the leading edge of}} the wing and connected to the ailerons by rods and cranks. [...] Both before and after the wing extension lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the end of the centre section, taking them well outside the engines on the final version. [...] The L21's engines were wing mounted just outside the cabane struts, each cylinder with a tall, ram's horn exhaust discharging over the wing. [...] They were fed from a tank in the central part of the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The aisles {{are divided}} from the nave by an arcade of Tuscan columns and round arches. [...] At {{the west end}} is a gallery which is {{supported}} by a pair of unfluted wooden Doric columns. Below the gallery is a triptych form war memorial to parish men who died serving in World War I, with mosaic of St Michael in the <b>centre</b> <b>panel,</b> dedicated by the parents of Lieutenant Thomas Chesters Bowler who is among those listed on the outer panels. [...] The ground floor of the tower is used as a vestry. [...] At the east end of the south aisle is the Lady Chapel which is entered through an oak screen. In the chapel is a Jacobean communion table with a 19th-century marble top. The 19th-century red sandstone reredos has carved panels and painted inscriptions. Above this is a painting of the Last Supper which has been attributed to Bonifazio Veronese. In the south wall of the chapel is the chest tomb of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. It consists of a recumbent 15th-century praying effigy with dogs at its feet and a 19th-century tomb chest and arch. High on the east wall of the chapel is the coat of arms of Queen Anne. At the east end of the north aisle in the north wall is the chest tomb to Sir John Talbot, founder of the grammar school who died in 1550. It consists of a 16th-century alabaster effigy of a praying knight with a 19th-century tomb chest and arch. Under the gallery is a red and yellow sandstone font dated 1661 with a wooden cover and a hexagonal table made from the sounding board of the former 18th-century pulpit. On the north aisle wall are two boards containing the Ten Commandments. In the nave is an 18th-century brass chandelier. In the chancel is a painted and gilded altar. Around it is a three-sided framework with figures on the tops of posts. The choirstalls are dated 1885. The carved wooden eagle lectern and the hexagonal carved wooden pulpit date from the 19th century. Amongst the memorials is a brass plaque to the memory of the composer Edward German. [...] A window in the north aisle contains fragments of medieval glass. The stained glass in the apse depicts the Ascension between images of StPeter and St Paul. It was made by Warrington in 1860. In the south aisle is a window dated 1868 with glass by Ward and Hughes. [...] The three-manual pipe organ results from a rebuilding of an earlier organ by Peter Conacher in 1894. [...] It was restored and altered in 1966 by Hill, Norman & Beard. [...] There is a ring of eight bells, seven of which were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester, five in 1714 and two in 1767; the other bell is by John Taylor & Co and is dated 1842.|$|E

25|$|The {{other major}} changes {{were to the}} interior. The {{dashboard}} layout of the original 110 from 1983 (which was in turn {{very similar to that}} used on the Series III from 1971) was replaced with a full-width fascia and different instrumentation. Instruments came from the Discovery 3, and some of the <b>centre</b> <b>panels</b> come from the Ford Transit. Whilst some interior fittings from the British Leyland parts bin - some of which dated back to the 1970s - were finally dropped, the steering column switchgear (sourced from the Mk.1 Austin Metro) and the ignition switch (from the Morris Marina) was carried over from the previous interior. A new heater and ventilation system improved de-misting and heater performance.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>centre</b> <b>panel's</b> spatial depth marks an {{advancement}} in van Eyck's technique, especially {{when compared to}} his similar 1436 [...] or van der Paele panel, {{both of which are}} comparatively flat. The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin {{at the far end of}} the pictorial space, making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown. The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne. This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the Lucca Madonna and van der Paele panels.|$|R

50|$|He {{delighted in}} urns and sphinxes and {{interlaced}} gryphons, in amorini with bows and torches, in trophies of musical instruments and martial weapons, and in flowering arabesques which were always graceful if sometimes rather thin. The <b>centre</b> <b>panels</b> of his walls and ceilings were often occupied by classical and pastoral subjects painted by Cipriani, Angelica Kauffman or her husband Antonio Zucchi, and sometimes by himself. These nymphs and amorini, with their disengaged and riant air and classic grace, were not infrequently used as copies for painting upon that satinwood furniture {{of the last}} quarter of the 18th century which has never been surpassed for dainty elegance, and for the popularity of which Pergolesi was in large measure responsible; they were even reproduced in marquetry.|$|R

Fragments of the thin silver plate are preserved along with the figure and nail holes in the board indicate that had once been completely covered. The outline of a mandorla with associated holes in the sunken panel suggest that an earlier ornament was attached to it.|$|R
