500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, if we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E
500|$|On 11 September 2012, it was {{reported}} that AJ would seduce Roxy Mitchell and they would spend the night together in Masood and Zainab's house after an evening of drinking. At the time, it was unknown if it would be a one-off or if a longer relationship would start. An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they [...] "hit it off" [...] because she loves [...] "a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box." [...] They added that they have [...] "great chemistry" [...] but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man, [...] "AJ will have to fight [...] for her affections" [...] if he wants her. An insider also told the Daily Star that the two [...] "can't keep their hands off each other" [...] and [...] "Roxy is more than up for it." [...] They added that [...] "Zainab would go mental if she knew what they were up to under her roof and {{it remains to be seen}} whether they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with. [...] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful." [...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E
500|$|The video {{stood out}} conspicuously to Aguilar for its chaotic texture through the rapid editing of the {{multiple}} shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an [...] "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation", she added. Since chaos has traditionally {{been associated with the}} female ontogenetic principle as opposed to male principle of order, the video in turn came to be associated with duality between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc. Aguilar also drew parallel between Metropolis and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work. However, unlike Metropolis which portrayed repression of a rebellious proletariat, the chaotic nature of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] video showed freedom instead. Caryn James from The New York Times added that [...] "asked about the video, [...] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism—'I was chained to my desires'—to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options." [...] Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her [...] "crotch-grabbing", saying that [...] "if male singers like Michael Jackson <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> why can't women?" [...] Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images {{in the beginning of the}} video, but contrasted them with her [...] "crotch-hugging" [...] male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, [...] "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 2, 2006, Representative Ray LaHood (R-IL) {{called for}} the page program to be {{temporarily}} suspended. He stated that [...] "this is a flawed program. The fact that a member of Congress is sending e-mails to a page and that he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> [...] obviously there are problems." [...] Two more Representatives, Jon Porter (R-NV) and Kay Granger (R-TX) also supported LaHood's recommendation to suspend the page program until an outside team could evaluate its security protocol. Hastert announced on October 5, 2006 that he was launching an investigation to evaluate and make improvements to the page program.|$|E
2500|$|In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two {{intellectuals who}} commit a murder simply {{to prove they}} <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The two {{characters}} and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, {{were supposed to be}} homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy {{to be part of the}} experience, but wondered [...] "what the film would have been like had [...] shot it normally" [...] and [...] "had he not had to worry about censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{dropping}} out of Carnegie Tech in early 1963, he relocated to Los Angeles {{with the intent of}} being involved with the growing West Coast beatnik subculture and to play with his older brother Carson Parks as the Steeltown Two (later enlarged to three), which eventually became the folk group the Greenwood County Singers. The group included future RCA Records producer and recording artist Rick Jarrard. Parks later said of this decision, [...] "Going to California meant I escaped John Cage. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can't remember, the highbrow angst." [...] The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco. One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future Byrds member David Crosby, who at the time remarked to friend David Lindley, [...] "If they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> so can we." [...] While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show Art Linkletter's House Party but was not accepted. Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England {{to be part of the}} Brandywine Singers, earning up to $3,000 a week.|$|E
