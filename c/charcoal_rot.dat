40|$|Large changes {{introduced}} in the sugar beet production technology in the Vojvodina Province over last 40 years resulted in changes in the etiology and harmfulness of different agents of sugar beet root diseases. Improvements in cultivation practices reduced the harmfulness of some diseases while increased the harmfulness of others. Some disease agents became obsolete, but others gained importance. New agents of root diseases were found. The most frequent damages, persisting {{over long periods of}} time were caused by seedling damping-off, Fusarium root <b>rot,</b> <b>charcoal</b> root <b>rot,</b> parasitic (Rhizomania) and non-parasitic root bearding. The parasitic damping-off caused by several fungal species but most frequently by Phoma betae occurred at the time when multigerm seeds were used in combination with extensive cultural practices. The agents of seedling diseases completely lost their significance as the consequence of switching to fungicide - treated monogerm seeds, earlier planting and improved soil tillage. In the period of intensive use of agricultural chemicals, seedling damping-off occurred frequently due to the phytotoxic action of chemicals (insecticides, herbicides and mineral fertilizers). In some years, frosts caused damping- off of sugar beet seedlings on a large scale in the Vojvodina Province. Poor sugar beet germination and emergence were frequently due to spring droughts. Sometimes they were due to strong winds. The occurrence of Fusarium root <b>rot</b> and <b>charcoal</b> root <b>rot</b> intensified on poor soils. Fusariosis symptoms were exhibited as plant wilting and different forms of root rot. In recent years root tip rot has occurred frequently in the first part of the growing season causing necrosis and dying of plants. Lateral roots tended to proliferate from the healthy tissue, giving the root a bearded appearance similar to Rhizomania. Fusarium oxysporum was the most frequent agent of this fusariosis. F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. solani have also been identified in recent years as the agent of root rot, but its importance was much lower. <b>Charcoal</b> root <b>rot</b> and plant wilting (Macrophomina phaseolina) have caused extensive damages in sugar beets, especially under the conditions of severe drought and high temperatures in summer. In some years, it was the dominant agent of root rot. Mixed infections caused by fungi from the genera Fusarium and M. phaseolina were encountered frequently. The extent of damage caused by these diseases was reduced by improved pro- duction technology. Rhizomania of sugar beet (caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus) was identified in Serbia in the 1970 s. Results of recent investigations have shown that BNYVV is widespread in Vojvodina, since the virus was found on 36, 7 % (24, 674 ha) of acreages from 67, 213 ha of total sugar beet acreages inspected on incidence of BNYVV in the period from 1997 to 2004 year. In the last few years, the occurrence of Rhizoctonia root rot (Rhizoctonia solani) was registered in some localities in Vojvodina...|$|R

50|$|The {{pathogen}} M. phaseolina {{affects the}} fibrovascular {{system of the}} roots and basal internodes of its host, impeding the transport of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant. As a result, progressive wilting, premature dying, loss of vigor, and reduced yield are characteristic symptoms of M. phaseolina infection. The fungus also causes many diseases like damping off, seedling blight, collar rot, stem rot, <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot,</b> basal stem rot, and root rot. Although brown lesions may form on the hypocotyls or emerging seedlings, many symptoms occur during or after flowering, including grey discoloration of the stem and taproots, shredding of plant tissue in the stem and top of the taproot, and hollowing of the stem. Small black dots may form beneath the epidermis of the lower stem and in the taproot, giving the stems and roots a charcoal-sprinkled appearance. When the epidermis is removed, small and black microsclerotia (a sign of the disease) may be so numerous that they give a greyish-black tint to the plant tissue. In addition, reddish-brown discoloration and black streaks can form in the pith and vascular tissues of the root and stem.|$|E

40|$|Mortality in Pinus sp. in Sardinia - in particular, P. radiata D. Don - was {{investigated}} between 1976 and 1978. Preliminary studies had revealed {{an association between}} Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. (the causal agent of <b>charcoal</b> root <b>rot</b> disease) with affected plants. The disease occurred on plants of different ages in 24 of the main P. radiata plantantions and nurseries. In every case, the presence of M. pllaseolina was confirmed. The disease varied in spread and severity from rather low to very high values. It was also recorded on P. pinea L., P. halepensis Mill., P. patula Schl. et Cham., P. pinaster Sol. and P. nigra Arn. ssp. Laricio (Poir.) Palabin Coste. The occurrence of infection, the symptomatological progress of thc disease and microscopic characteristics of affected tissues wcrc invcstigntcd both {{in the field and}} in the laboratory. Data concerning the incidence of disease - which first became serious in 1975, showed a low value in 1976 and 1977 and increased again in 1978 - were obtained by field obscrvation and trials in experimental plots.

The line source (LS) sprinkler irrigation technique which produces a gradient of water deficit stress due to decreasing {{amount of water}} supply with increasing distance from the sprinkler line was used to study the relationships between applied water levels, time of inoculation {{and the degree of}} <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> incidence. Grain yields were reduced in proportion to the deficit in water supply along the gradient, whereas the incidence of <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> increased.

30|$|Post-flowering drought {{stress is}} {{associated}} with <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> and Fusarium stalk rot disease which leads to significant lodging and yield loss (Rosenow and Clark 1995; Tesso et al. 2004). However, the disease severity is high under hot and humid conditions (Tesso et al. 2012). Stalk rot is characterized by degradation of pith tissue near {{the base of the}} stalk as a result of senescence of the stalk pith cells (Tesso et al. 2012) resulting in reduced transportation of nutrients and water, and breakage of the stalk at the zone of infection causing lodging (Hundekar and Anahahosur 1994). <b>Charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> of sorghum is caused by Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. and is a serious problem under high soil temperature and low moisture by a prolonged dry period, particularly during the grain filling stage (Hassan et al. 1996). Fusarium stalk rot (caused by Fusarium spp.) is more severe when drought and high temperature stress occurs during grain development followed by wet, cool conditions near physiological maturity (Tesso et al. 2012). Several studies have been conducted to understand the influence of drought stress (Diourte et al. 1995; Seetharama et al. 1991; Tenkouano et al. 1993), nitrogen and plant growth (Cloud and Rupe 1994) and inheritance of resistance to Fusarium spp. and M. phaseolina. Seetharama et al. (1991) reported high incidence of <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> and low grain yield in drought stressed sorghum plants. However, there was little attempt to identify genotypes in exotic germplasm collections that might serve as potential resistance sources to Fusarium stalk and <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> for breeding programs. Even though drought and disease stresses commonly occur in sorghum production environments (Rosenow et al. 1996), there is little information on the interaction of drought on disease severity and drought tolerance in exotic sorghum germplasms. Of the total (44, 773) accessions in the world sorghum germplasm collections, only 9, 889 (22 %) are photoperiod insensitive which are extensively used in breeding programs. The available genetic resources in sorghum are still under unexploited for diseases and drought stress tolerance (Rosenow and Dahlberg 2000). Thus, it is necessary to screen genotypes under both irrigated and dryland conditions to document environments that favor disease development. Evaluation of new germplasm based upon secondary traits that are associated with drought and disease tolerace is of paramount importance.. In the present study, 44 plant introductory (PI) and 84 minicore photoperiod insensitive germplasm accessions were evaluated along with 12 adapted lines. We hypothesized that there is genetic variation among the PI lines and sorghum minicore germplasm for post-flowering drought stress, Fusarium stalk rot (F. thapsinum) and <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> (M. phaseolina) resistance. Identifying potential sources with post-flowering drought tolerance traits will combat disease development and result in increased grain yield. This study was conducted with the following objectives: (i) evaluate and identify sorghum exotic germplasm for drought, Fusarium stalk rot, and <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> tolerance, and (ii) to identify traits confering tolerance to drought and stalk rots diseases.|$|E

In a 2 -year field experiment, five composts (4 ton/ha) prepared from residues of Calotropis procera, Prosopis juliflora, Azadirachta indica, Acacia nilotica, and on-farm weeds were tested on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) to determine their effectiveness in limiting the Â  severity of <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> caused by M. phaseolina {{in relation to the}} microbial population dynamics, microbial activity and the seed yield of cowpea. Â  In general, compost-amended plots retained 8. 9 % higher moisture than unamended plots. The microbial population increased in amended plots during the crop season. Populations of total fungi and actinomycetes were heighest in Calotropis compost-amended soil, while total bacteria were maximum in weed- compost amended soil. Microbial activity in amended plots was Â  26. 3 % higher than in unamended plots. Among trace elements, Â  uptake of Zn, Mn, Fe and Cu was Â  heighest Â  in plants grown in weed-compost amended soil followed by A. nilotica compost-amended soil. Soil amendment with the composts significantly reduced Â  plant mortality due to <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot.</b> The lowest mortality was recorded in plants amended with A. nilotica compost (5. 5 %) followed by P. juliflora compost (5. 8), while the Â  highest plant mortality (11. 5 %) from <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> occurred in the unamended control {{on the basis of the}} pooled average of two years. There was a significant inverse correlation between microbial activity and <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> incidence in cowpea at 20 days after planting. Composts also had a beneficial effect on yield, with a 28. 3 % increase in seed yield in P. juliflora compost-amended plots. These results suggest that in resource-deficient farming, certain on-farm wastes can be effectively utilized for managing soil-borne pathogens, as well as Â  for Â  enhancing crop productivity. </span...|$|E
40|$|<b>Charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> {{of maize}} caused by Macrophomina phaseolina, is a severe disease {{particularly}} in spring season grown crop. Twenty four infected maize stem {{samples were collected}} from major maize growing districts of Punjab comprising of Kasur, Okara, Pakpatan and Sahiwal to assess the variability. Based on colony pigmentation, the cultures were assigned to four major groups on PDA and corn meal medium. The sensitivity of isolates to copper sulphate at three different levels of concentrations was found to differ to 500, 1500 and 2500 concentrations tested. But with Benomyl, the growth of all isolates was completely inhibited. Highest growth was observed in pH 7. 0, closely followed by pH 6. 5 indicating preferential range to be between pH 6. 5 and 7. 0. Variation due to change in temperature range clearly indicate isolates preference towards higher temperature range between 35 ÂºC and 40 ÂºC. All the fungicides inhibited the growth of M. phaseolina significantly. Maximum inhibition efficacy was shown by Benomyl (86 %) and Carbendazim (82 %) while Captan showed the minimum (44 %). Similarly, all the test plants inhibited the growth of M. phaseolina significantly, maximum in case of Datura stramonium (84 %) and Azadirachta indica (79 %) and the minimum (42 %) inhibition with Dalbergia sissoo. Percent inhibition was significantly higher at higher concentrations of all the plants as compared to other concentrations. Survival of plants was also found to be maximum, where seeds were treated with Datura stramonium (84 %) and A. indica (81 %) at 100 % concentration. Nineteen germplasm lines of maize screened out of which one accession of maize was found resistant, nine moderately resistant, eight susceptible and one is highly susceptible. <b>Charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> was least in MMRI-yellow, followed by BL- 71 and Pak Afgoyee. Employment of new source of resistance sources like local genotypes mentioned above can be efficiently exploited in resistance breeding programme to manage <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> of maize. Management of <b>charcoal</b> <b>rot</b> of maize revealed that the seed treatment with Benomyl and seed treatment with Datura stramonium showed superior results...|$|E
