5|$|In Tamaulipas and {{southern}} Texas, the ranges {{of the marsh}} rice rat and the related Oryzomys couesi meet; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the <b>contact</b> <b>zone,</b> probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E

Traditionally, two species were {{recognised in the}} genus Barnardius, the Port Lincoln parrot (Barnardius zonarius) and the mallee ringneck (Barnardius barnardi), but the two species readily interbred at the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> and are now considered one species. Currently, four subspecies are recognised, each with a distinct range.|$|E
5|$|Thompson and Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of the}} Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a migratory path linking these southern populations to northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. Thompson and Russell suggest that this <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{studies of}} the palustris–couesi <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> in Texas {{published}} in 1979, using more specimens and characters, indicated that the two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, O.couesi has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, {{some of the other}} forms synonymized under O.couesi or O.palustris were resurrected as separate species—Oryzomys nelsoni from the Marías Islands, western Mexico, and Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican Oryzomys, reaffirmed the distinctness of O.nelsoni, and reinstated O.peninsulae from the tip of the Baja California Peninsula and O.albiventer from interior Mexico as species. Still, O.couesi included 22 synonyms, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on O.couesi and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of the marsh rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E

In autopolyploids, heteroploid cross-compatibilities might depend on parental ploidy, but tests of this hypothesis in autopolyploid systems {{with more than}} two ploidies are lacking. Here, we study Jacobaea carniolica, which comprises diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid individuals regularly forming <b>contact</b> <b>zones.</b> Seeds obtained from in situ cross-pollinations within and among cytotypes were subjected to DNA flow cytometry and greenhouse germination experiments. Hybrid fitness and parental effects on hybrid fitness were tested with regression models comparing fitness parameters of early life stages. Irrespective of the direction of crosses, seed viability and seedling survival in diploid-polyploid crosses were substantially lower than in tetraploid-hexaploid crosses. In contrast, seedling growth traits indicated neither transgressive character expression nor any selection against hybrid offspring. Congruent with a model of genome dosage effects, these traits differed between reciprocal crosses, especially of diploids and tetraploids, where trait values resembled those of the maternal parent. The strong effect of parental ploidy on offspring fitness in heteroploid crosses may cause <b>contact</b> <b>zones</b> involving exclusively polyploid cytotypes to be less stable over longer terms than thos...|$|R

5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the <b>contact</b> <b>zone,</b> and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{populations of}} Oryzomys couesi, those in southernmost Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico, are {{classified}} as the subspecies aquaticus, which {{was described as a}} separate species, Oryzomys aquaticus, in 1891. Here the range of O.couesi meets that of the marsh rice rat; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In the <b>contact</b> <b>zone,</b> couesi occurs further inland, while the marsh rice rat lives along the coast. In experimental conditions, the two fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to populations further to the south, aquaticus is larger and paler and has a more robust skull. Specimens from Tamaulipas are slightly darker than those from Texas. The Cytb sequences of specimens of aquaticus form a separate group, but cluster among specimens of O.c.couesi from further south.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae {{was first}} {{collected}} in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 {{as a full}} species of Oryzomys. It was retained as a distinct species related to O.couesi and O.palustris until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz swept it, and other outlying populations {{of the same species}} group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of O.palustris. Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition (1981) of Mammals of North America, arguing that O.peninsulae differed less from mainland Oryzomys populations (currently classified as O.couesi mexicanus) than some other forms he included in O.palustris differed from each other. After studies of the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> between North American O.palustris and Central American O.couesi in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) made clear that the two are distinct from each other, O.peninsulae remained as a subspecies of O.couesi. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican Oryzomys and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct Oryzomys species in the region. O.peninsulae and another isolated population, O.nelsoni from the Islas Marías, were both retained as separate species, as was O.albiventer from montane mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, O.couesi mexicanus, of Oryzomys couesi.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1877, {{the first of}} many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species Oryzomys couesi and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> in Texas, where O.couesi and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica and Oryzomys peninsulae from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, O.couesi as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of O.couesi and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, Oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the <b>contact</b> <b>zone.</b> Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid zones provide {{excellent}} {{opportunities to}} study processes and mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. Here we investigated sex-specific clines of molecular markers in hybrid zones of morphologically cryptic yet genetically highly-diverged evolutionary lineages of the European common vole (Microtus arvalis). We analyzed {{the position and}} width of four secondary <b>contact</b> <b>zones</b> along three independent transects {{in the region of}} the Alps using maternally (mitochondrial DNA) and paternally (Y-chromosome) inherited genetic markers. Given male-biased dispersal in the common vole, a selectively neutral secondary contact would show broader paternal marker clines than maternal ones. In a selective case, for example, involving a form of Haldane’s rule, Y-chromosomal clines would not be expected to be broader than maternal markers because they are transmitted by the heterogametic sex and thus gene flow would be restricted. Consistent with the selective case, paternal clines were significantly narrower or at most equal in width to maternal clines in all <b>contact</b> <b>zones.</b> In addition, analyses using maximum likelihood cline-fitting detected a shift of paternal relative to maternal clines in three of four <b>contact</b> <b>zones.</b> These patterns suggest that processes at the <b>contact</b> <b>zones</b> in the common vole are not selectively neutral, and that partial reproductive isolation is already established between these evolutionary lineages. We conclude that hybrid zone movement, sexual selection and/or genetic incompatibilities are likely associated with an unusual unidirectional manifestation of Haldane’s rule in this common European mammal...|$|R

500|$|The {{hooded crow}} (Corvus cornix) [...] and carrion crow (Corvus corone) are two {{closely related species}} whose {{geographical}} distribution across Europe is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. It is believed that this distribution might have resulted from the glaciation cycles during the Pleistocene, which caused the parent population to split into isolates which subsequently re-expanded their ranges when the climate warmed causing secondary contact. Poelstra and coworkers sequenced almost the entire genomes of both species in populations at varying distances from the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> {{to find that the}} two species were genetically identical, both in their DNA and in its expression (in the form of mRNA), except for the lack of expression of a small portion (<0.28%) of the genome (situated on avian chromosome 18) in the hooded crow, which imparts the lighter plumage colouration on its torso. Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the <b>contact</b> <b>zone,</b> but the all-black carrion crows on the one side of the <b>contact</b> <b>zone</b> mate almost exclusively with other all-black carrion crows, while the same occurs among the hooded crows {{on the other side of}} the <b>contact</b> <b>zone.</b> It is therefore clear that it is only the outward appearance of the two species that inhibits hybridization. The authors attribute this to assortative mating (rather than to ecological selection), the advantage of which is not clear, and it would lead to the rapid appearance of streams of new lineages, and possibly even species, through mutual attraction between mutants. Unnikrishnan and Akhila propose, instead, that koinophilia is a more parsimonious explanation for the resistance to hybridization across the <b>contact</b> <b>zone,</b> despite the absence of physiological, anatomical or genetic barriers to such hybridization.|$|E
