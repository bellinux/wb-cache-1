2500|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{incorporates the}} fore stock, the charging handle, the forward assist, the gas operating system, the barrel, the bolt and bolt <b>carrier</b> <b>assembly.</b> AR-15s employ a modular design.

Upper receivers are available with barrels of different weights, lengths, calibers, and rail systems with various sights and accessories. The standard AR-15 rifle uses a 20" [...] barrel.

2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30Â° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt <b>carrier</b> <b>assembly</b> provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E

40|$|Although {{molecular}} {{and physical}} mechanisms of fibroblast matrix assembly {{have been widely}} investigated, the role of adhesive ligand presentation on matrix assembly has only been recently probed (Pereira et al. Tissue Eng., 2007). In the present study, various-sized albumin-derived nanocarriers (ANCs) were fabricated as nanoscale organization units for functionalization with the cell adhesion domain of fibronectin. The adhesion, morphology, and matrix assembly of human dermal fibroblasts were compared on substrate-deposited, ligand-ANCs of varying size. At early time points, fibroblast attachment, stress fiber formation, and spreading were higher on functionalized, larger-sized carriers than on smaller <b>carriers.</b> Matrix <b>assembly</b> was greatest at the highest ligand density on larger nanocarriers but was undetectable at the same ligand density on smaller carriers. Tracking of fluorophore-encapsulated ANCs showed that larger carriers were displaced less than smaller carriers and that atomic force microscopy of ligand-ANCs binding to adherent cells demonstrated that the larger ligand-ANCs required larger dissociation forces. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} the greater inertia of larger adhesive nanocarriers may generate more cellular tension, which in turn, promotes up-regulation of matrix assembly. Thus, the size of the nanocarrier and the density of ligand on that nanocarrier combine to dictate the early kinetics of fibroblast matrix assembly. These insights may be useful for understanding cell-matrix interactions, as well as for development of bioactive materials with defined cell-adhesive activities such as wound repair and matrix remodeling events...|$|R

Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning {{the movements of the}} American carriers immediately before the battle.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{mitochondrial}} inner membrane harbors three protein translocases. Presequence translocase and carrier translocase {{are essential}} for importing nuclear-encoded proteins. The oxidase assembly (OXA) translocase is required for exporting mitochondrial-encoded proteins; however, different views exist about its relevance for nuclear-encoded proteins. We report that OXA plays a dual role in the biogenesis of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. First, a systematic analysis of OXA-deficient mitochondria led toÂ an unexpected expansion of the spectrum of OXA substrates imported via the presequence pathway. Second, biogenesis of numerous metabolite carriers depends on OXA, although they are not imported byÂ the presequence pathway. We show that OXA is crucial for the biogenesis of the Tim 18 -Sdh 3 module of the carrier translocase. The export translocase OXA is thus required for the import of metabolite <b>carriers</b> by promoting <b>assembly</b> of the <b>carrier</b> translocase. We conclude that OXA is of central importance for the biogenesis of the mitochondrial inner membrane...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembling peptide-based {{materials}} are playing {{an important role}} in fabricating drug delivery carriers; however, they are often limited by several challenges, such as precise structure modulation, desirable nanoscale size, and sufficient circulation lifetime in the body. To address this issue, herein one type of injectable dipeptide-based nanocarriers with well modulated size and structure has been developed by adjusting glutaraldehyde (GA) -assisted cationic dipeptide (CDP) assembly. After loading a model photosensitive drug (Ce 6) and further decorating CDP nanoparticles (NPs) with heparin polymers (Hep), the desired dipeptide-based NPs are achieved with an average diameter of 100 rim and surface charge of - 25 mV, which are favorable for the enhanced permeability and retention effects. Significantly, the dipeptide-based NPs with Ce 6 loading have a longer circulation lifetime against opsonization than free Ce 6 solution, and subsequently, they achieve the best anticancer efficiency in vivo. They do not cause body weight loss or induce bad immune activation in organs, implying good biosafety of the designed carriers. Taken together, dipeptide-based delivery <b>carriers</b> through GA-assisted <b>assembly</b> may provide a new alternative for developing precisely controlled nanostructures toward effective antitumor therapy. </p...|$|R
