50|$|The DIGIC DV 5 {{first seen}} in the Canon XC10 and the Canon EOS C300 Mark II, which both were {{announced}} on 8 April 2015 right before the NAB Show. The XC10 uses a single DIGIC DV 5, while the C300 Mark II uses a dual DIGIC DV 5 implementation. Both are capable of 4k at 24, 25 and 30fps with 4:2:2 <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> in the XF-AVC H.264 codec.|$|E
5000|$|Sony {{has also}} {{announced}} a higher compression mode called [...] "SR Lite". As with the 440 and 880 mode, SR Lite utilizes the MPEG-4 Part 2 Simple Studio Profile but decreases the bit rate down to 220 Mbit/s for 60i and 183 Mbit/s for 50i. SR Lite is locked at 4:2:2 <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> but still maintains at 10 bit pixel depth. It {{also allows for}} 50 and 60p {{at the cost of}} a doubled data rate (440 Mbit/s for 60p).|$|E
50|$|Different codecs use {{different}} chroma subsampling ratios as appropriate to their compression needs. Video compression schemes for Web and DVD {{make use of}} a 4:2:1 <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> pattern, and the DV standard uses 4:1:1 sampling ratios. Professional video codecs designed to function at much higher bitrates and to record a greater amount of color information for post-production manipulation sample in 3:1:1 (uncommon), 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 ratios. Examples of these codecs include Panasonic's DVCPRO50 and DVCPROHD codecs (4:2:2), and then Sony's HDCAM-SR (4:4:4) or Panasonic's HDD5 (4:2:2). Apple's Prores HQ 422 codec also samples in 4:2:2 color space. More codecs that sample in 4:4:4 patterns exist as well, but are less common, and tend to be used internally in post-production houses. It is also worth noting that video codecs can operate in RGB space as well. These codecs tend not to sample the red, green, and blue channels in different ratios, since there is less perceptual motivation for doing so—just the blue channel could be undersampled.|$|E

50|$|Initially, Color QuickDraw {{was only}} capable of {{operating}} with 1, 2, 4 and 8-bit video cards, which {{were all that}} was available at the time. Soon after however, 24-bit video cards appeared (so-called true color), and QuickDraw was updated again to support up to 32 bits per pixel (in reality, 24 bits, with 8 unused) of color data ("32-Bit QuickDraw"). The architecture always allowed for this, however, so no new APIs were necessary. The color data structures themselves allowed a color depth of 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 and 24 bits, yielding 1, 4, 16, 256, 32,768 and 16,777,216 colors respectively, or 4, 16 and 256 scales of grey. QuickDraw took care of managing the resampling of colors to the available color depths of the actual video hardware, or transfer between offscreen image buffers, including optionally dithering images down to a lower depth to improve image quality. A set of <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> utilities were also added so that programmers could generate optimal color palettes for use with indexed video devices.|$|E

40|$|Image matting is {{the problem}} of {{determining}} for each pixel in an image whether it is foreground, background, or the mixing parameter, ”alpha”, for those pixels that are a mixture of foreground and background. Matting is inherently an ill-posed problem. Previous matting approaches either use naive <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> methods to estimate foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, or use propagation-based methods to avoid <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> under weak assumptions about image statistics. We argue that neither method itself is enough to generate good results for complex natural images. We analyze the weaknesses of previous matting approaches, and propose a new robust matting algorithm. In our approach we also sample foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, but more importantly, analyze the confidence of these samples. Only high confidence samples are chosen to contribute to the matting energy function which is minimized by a Random Walk. The energy function we define also contains a neighborhood term to enforce the smoothness of the matte. To validate the approach, we present an extensive and quantitative comparison between our algorithm and a number of previous approaches in hopes of providing a benchmark for future matting research. 1...|$|E

40|$|For {{about twenty}} years the {{standard}} <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> method for RGBA volume data {{has been the}} interpolation of opacity-weighted colors. In this work, we discuss the underlying approximations and derive an improved sampling method, which avoids some of these approximations.

Moreover, we show that the same improvement {{can be applied to}} downsampling filters. Finally, we propose a procedure to design improved downsampling filters for the generation of pyramid RGBA volume data such as mipmap volume textures. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel alpha matting method with local and nonlocal smooth priors. We observe that the {{manifold}} preserving editing propagation [4] essentially in-troduced a nonlocal smooth prior on the alpha matte. This nonlocal smooth prior and the well known local smooth prior from matting Laplacian complement each other. So we combine them with a simple data term from <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> in a graph model for nature image matting. Our method has a closed-form solution and can be solved efficiently. Com-pared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method pro-duces more accurate results according to the evaluation on standard benchmark datasets. 1...|$|E

In consequence, the new scheme can now be used as part of a complete NLO QCD calculation for processes with arbitrary parton masses and multiplicities. We assess its overall performance through a detailed comparison with results based on Catani-Seymour subtraction.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} digital {{forensic}} techniques {{have been developed to}} authenticate digital signals. One important set of forensic techniques operates by estimating signal processing com-ponents of a digital camera’s signal processing pipeline, then using these estimates to perform forensic tasks such as camera identifica-tion or forgery detection. However, because these techniques are capable of estimating a camera’s internal signal processing compo-nents, these forensic techniques can be used for reverse engineer-ing. In this paper, we propose integrating an anti-forensic module into a digital camera’s processing pipeline to protect against foren-sic reverse engineering. Our proposed technique operates by remov-ing linear dependencies amongst an output images interpolated color values and by disrupting the <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> grid.

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{anti-aliasing}} {{has been}} operat-ed as a post-processing step accompanied by deferred shading in real-time applications. It {{is difficult to}} detect and remove sub-pixel level rendering artifacts employ-ing screen-resolution shading or geometric information only. Although sub-pixel resolution geometry is helpful, the large size of geometry buffer (G-buffer) will cause texture fetch overhead. In this paper, we present a new post-processing sub-pixel anti-aliasing algorithm via re-liable triangle-based geometry extracted from the ren-dering pipeline (TGAA). The geometry information is employed to recover sub-pixel level structures by esti-mating coverage areas of relevant triangles. The method shows good scalability in performance since geometry buffer is stored efficiently and is inexpensive to access. In addition, a linear rather than nearest neighbor <b>color</b> <b>sampling</b> process is incorporated into geometric filter to generate a more accurate anti-aliasing result. The im-plementation {{results show that the}} algorithm is efficient and scalable in generating high-quality anti-aliasing im-ages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Digital color cameras acquire color images {{by means}} of a sensor on which a color filter array (CFA) is overlaid. The Bayer CFA is the most popular, but the design of {{alternative}} CFAs has actually received very few attention. We propose in this article new CFAs having random patterns; that is, their filters are arranged non-periodically. We base this design on a theoretical analysis of the spectral characteristics of CFAs, showing that the chrominance should be modulated at the highest possible frequency. Hence, random patterns with blue noise properties are particularly adequate for <b>color</b> <b>sampling.</b> Our new CFAs yield demosaicked images where the artifacts appear as incoherent noise, which is less visually disturbing than the moire ́ structures that appear with periodic CFAs. Thus, this short study aims at pointing out the potential benefits of using random CFAs and the need for new generic demosaicking algorithms that would be able to exploit at best their properties.
