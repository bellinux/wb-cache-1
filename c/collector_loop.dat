50|$|There are 52 {{homes in}} this {{subdivision}} that contain {{an array of}} 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-watts of thermal power. A glycol solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the heat exchanger within the community’s Energy Centre. This {{is known as the}} Solar <b>Collector</b> <b>Loop.</b> The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50 °C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.|$|E
40|$|AbstractParabolic trough solar {{collection}} {{technology has}} been widely deployed in concentrated solar power (CSP) generation plants all over the world. In a large-scale CSP plant, a solar field consists of hundreds of parabolic solar <b>collector</b> <b>loops.</b> Due to the parallel loop arrangement (Fig. 1) and non-unifoum solar collection, mal-distributions of heat-transfer-fluid flow (HTF, synthetic oil) among different loops commonly occur during transient operation. Many solar <b>collector</b> <b>loops</b> have to be pushed out of tracking phase to avoid oil overheating and degradation, which causes significant loss in solar energy collection and power generation. Such collector defocusing and refocusing operation results in large transient variation of HTF temperature, which further brings challenges to energy-efficient operation and maintenance of the coupled thermal power generation unit. Advanced transient analysis, control and fault diagnosis tools are desired to achieve safer CSP plant operation and transient solar power harvesting. In this paper, a distributed transient optical-thermal-fluid model of parabolic trough collector is developed and validated with field data from a 100 MWth CSP plant. Transient model predictions are in fair agreement with experimental field data, which provide a quantitative tool for solar energy harvesting. Conceptual active flow control strategies are further introduced to regulate the HTF temperature and maintain high solar collection efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{designed}} to use CPC collectors to collect solar energy and to generate steam for industrial process heat purposes. The system is divided into two loops with the collectors in the <b>collector</b> <b>loop</b> to operate a pre-heater and the collectors in the boiler loop to heat water to elevated pressures and temperatures. A flash boiler is used to throttle the heated water to steam. Two types of CPC collectors are chosen. In the <b>collector</b> <b>loop</b> the CPC collectors are fitted with concentric tube receivers. In the boiler loop the collectors employ heat pipes to transmit heat. This design is able to alleviate the scaling and plumbing problems. A fragile receiver tube can also be employed without rupture difficulties. The thermal processes in the collectors were analyzed using a computer modeling. The results were also used to develop a thermodynamic analysis of the total system. Calculations show that the design is technically feasible.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{test facility}} for solar {{heating and cooling}} has been constructed to evaluate the operation and performance of an LBLdeveloped solar controller that has promising commercial potential. The LBL controller {{was designed to be}} intermediate in performance between a simple differential thermostat and an on-line microprocessor. The PROM~based controller operates the solar system according to a preprogrammed algorithm that translates operating state conditions (fluid temperatures, switch positions, comparator outputs) into a set of operating instructions (open or close valves, turn pumps on or off). The operating algorithm can be changed by reprogramming or exchanging the plug-in integrated circuit component, or by changing the sensors selected for comparison. The experimental solar heating system can be operated using different control algorithms, input meteorological conditions, and output load demands. In FY 1979 the test facility became operational and initial testing began. Emphasis has been on refinement of system instrumentation and the development of necessary computer software to run the facility and perform data analysis. Preliminary energy balance experiments with the load and collector loops under microcomputer control were successfully completed in November 1979.

When testing for thermal performance, power output is calculated from measurements of mass flow, heat capacity and temperature difference between in- and outlet of the collector row.

For the application of the commonly used steady-state testing analysis fluctuation especially in inlet temperature, irradiance and mass flow rate must be kept within a very small range.

The produced steam can directly be used for process heat applications.

In the present paper, a two-phase pressure drop analysis of typical {{steam generation}} plants with different layouts is presented. A static model has been developed for this purpose. Parametric studies have shown that, due to the elevated pressure drops, the length of a <b>collector</b> <b>loop</b> within a DSG plant is limited. Consequently, in bigger plants collector loops need to be installed in parallel. In each <b>collector</b> <b>loop</b> so-called Ledinegg instabilities occur. When collector loops are installed in parallel, there are additional flow instabilities. Those parallel flow instabilities occure due to shading of one or several collector loops.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and demonstrates procedures to model and optimize the collector field of a parabolic trough {{solar thermal power}} plant. The collector field of such a plant is universally organized into parallel loops of solar collectors. Heat transfer fluid returning from the energy conversion plant is heated to a moderately high temperature in the field. Typically fluid enters a <b>collector</b> <b>loop</b> around 270 °C and leaves at 380 °C. The fluid is {{then returned to the}} plant to generate steam. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the collector field and the energy conversion system of a typical parabolic trough solar thermal power plant are modeled. The model is compared with actual performance data and is enhanced and verified as necessary. Originally, the collectors in the plants under consideration were provided with evacuated tube receivers of the highest feasible efficiency without much regard for cost effectiveness. In practice, these receivers have failed at an unexpected rate and need replacement. It is unlikely that a very expensive evacuated tube receiver is now the most cost effective for every location in a <b>collector</b> <b>loop.</b> In particular, a receiver optimized for 270 °C operation may not be optimal at 380 °C.

Both heat exchangers studied are immersed helically coiled, one made with corrugated stainless steel tube, and the other made with finned copper tube with smooth inner surface. A test apparatus has been designed and a simple test procedure applied in order to study heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of both coils. Thereafter, the resulting experimental data was used to perform a parameter identification of the heat exchangers, in order to obtain a TRNSYS model with its corresponding numerical expression. Also a representative small-scale combisystem model was designed in TRNSYS, in order to study the influence of both heat exchangers on the solar fraction of the system, when working at different flow rates. It has been found that the highest solar fraction is given by the corrugated stainless steel coil, when it works at the lowest flow rate (100 l/hr). For any higher flow rate, the studied copper coil presents a higher solar fraction. The advantageous low flow performance of stainless steel heat exchanger turns out to be beneficial for the particular case of solar thermal systems, where {{it is well known that}} low flow <b>collector</b> <b>loops</b> lead to enhanced store stratification, and consequently higher solar fractions.

Due to the technology development, the technical requirements and the increasing number of manufacturers, the test loop reached its maximum capacity.

High solar collector temperatures can also produce scalding temperatures in the hot water storage [...] a potentially danger for residents. Recognizing {{the harmful effects of}} stagnation, a mechanism for limiting the temperature of solar collectors was developed. During the course of this study, a detailed heat transfer and thermal analysis was conducted to arrive at a suitable design. Based on this analysis, a prototype collector was constructed and tested under typical stagnation conditions. The results of these tests confirmed the operation of an integral temperature-limiting configuration. An important feature of the implemented design is that it operates “passively”, requiring no user intervention or external power source. As well, the operation of the solar collector is not affected during normal (i. e., non-stagnation) conditions. This paper describes the analysis, design and operation of solar collectors equipped with temperature control features...|$|R
40|$|A first Ultimate Trough® (UT) <b>collector</b> {{demonstration}} <b>loop</b> {{was successfully}} integrated in an existing {{solar power plant}} in California and is now put into operation. Its huge dimensions of one Solar Collector Assembly (SCA) with an aperture of 7. 5 m and a length of 247 m makes it the largest parabolic trough collector ever built and operated. It is expected that this collector reduces the solar field cost by 20 to 25 %. The fabrication and erection of a collector with the present dimensions exceeds present knowledge and experience. To provide safety {{for the design of}} upcoming solar thermal power plants with the same collector, it was decided to demonstrate all fabrication and erection procedures as they will be applied in series production. The paper describes the part manufacturing, as well as site assembling procedures, transportation and new developed erection tools. Furthermore, it gives an overview on the assembly process on site. The UT collector is designed to avo id complex and costly SCE alignment procedures in the field. The principles and results of the new SCE alignment method are presented. With this new parabolic trough collector a major step towards solar field cost reduction has been achieved. The development process has reached the final step, and the Ultimate Trough has reached market maturity. It is now planned to be applied for commercial collector field applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{compared}} {{the impacts of}} using copper nanofliud to enhance the efficiency of flat solar <b>collectors</b> with closed <b>loop</b> and under forced convection heat transfer circumstances to traditional work fluids. Various concentrations of nanoparticles in water and water/glycol, from 250 ppm to 3000 ppm, were examined for volume fraction impact. Results indicate that the laboratory tests were different from those under real conditions {{because of the high}} concentration of nanoparticles used in laboratory tests; however, by using nanofluid (even with low concentrations around 0. 3 %) solar collector efficiency improved (3. 2 %). Results have also shown that the use of copper nanofluid in ethylene glycol as the base fluid causes a significant reduction in collector efficiency, due to the increase in viscosity. However, using higher flow rates caused the heat transfer rate to rise because of increased turbulence. 1...|$|R
