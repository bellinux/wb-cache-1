Complicating the development of sampling plans for western flower thrips (WFT) Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) in greenhouse crops are the facts that they are small, difficult to detect, and attack a variety of crops, which may be grown concurrently within the same greenhouse. Binomial sampling was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} sampling plans based on complete enumeration. This work included comparison of incidence-mean models across diverse plant species (impatiens, cucumber, and marigold) to determine the possibility of using a generic model for sampling WFT in mixed crops. Data from laboratory-processed flower samples revealed that infestation rates calculated using a tally threshold of three thrips per flower provided the best estimates of thrips population densities in each tested crop and in the <b>combined</b> <b>crops</b> (composite data set). Distributions of thrips populations were similar across the three plant species, indicating potential for development of a generic sampling plan for mixed floral crops. Practical sampling methods for simple and complex flowers tested in the greenhouse (in situ) were evaluated via construction of binomial count operating characteristic functions. In the case of simple flowers (impatiens), visual inspections provided adequate estimates of thrips infestation rates at a low tally threshold, which ultimately enabled accurate estimation of thrips densities. However, visual inspection and tap-sampling of complex flowers (marigold) provided unreliable results. These findings indicate that use of binomial sampling methods in mixed floral crops will require development of more accurate sampling technique...|$|E

40|$|Early {{growth is}} a {{critical}} phase of the crop cycle, which lasts from emergence {{to the beginning of}} competition between plants and is sensitive to sowing conditions and species characteristics. Providing tools to improve the management of this critical phase in intercrops is a challenge for agroecology as these cropping systems are the subject of renewed interest for their ability to maintain yields while requiring fewer inputs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate variations in early growth under different sowing conditions in different species with contrasted seed and seedling characteristics (seed mass, hypogeal or epigeal emergence, and legume and non-legume species), especially species used as intercrops. Experiments were carried out in glasshouses using different sowing depths and levels of mineral nutrition, first for each species separately, then in mixed sowings. In the first set of experiments, biomass at emergence and relative growth rate after emergence were measured and then modelled as a function of seed mass, mineral nutrition, and time to emergence. Predictive equations were tested by comparing simulations with biomass measured in the second set of experiments, for two intercrops grown under varied sowing conditions. Finally, simulations were run to analyse variations in the early growth of two intercrops (durum wheat/pea or alfalfa) under a wider range of sowing conditions (seed mass, sowing depth, and with or without mineral nutrition). Biomass at emergence was positively correlated with seed mass, and in epigeal species, was also negatively impacted by time to emergence. Relative growth rate was highly stimulated by mineral nutrition whereas its response to time to emergence varied among species. The amount of seminal reserves at emergence (in hypogeal species) and the cotyledon specific mass (in epigeal species) were correlated with the establishment of the relative growth rate. When evaluated, the model was shown to satisfactorily predict the early growth of two intercrops. Used as a simulation tool, the model indicated that all the sowing techniques tested can have a major influence on total biomass and on the proportion of each component species when competition begins. This model can thus contribute to the management of sowing techniques for sole as well as <b>combined</b> <b>crops</b> whose effects are difficult to predict and are also difficult to analyse from field experiments alone because of the number of possible combinations and interaction...|$|E

40|$|Tillage systems play a {{significant}} role in agricultural production throughout Iowa and the Midwest. It has been well documented that increased tillage intensities can reduce soil organic matter in the topsoil due to increased microbial activity and carbon (C) oxidation. The potential loss of soil organic matter due to tillage operations is much higher for high organic matter soils than low organic matter soils. Tillage effects on soil organic matter can be magnified through soil erosion and loss of soil productivity.

40|$|Grain sorghum is {{the major}} dryland summer crop {{produced}} in the subtropical region of Australia. Production variability is great and the consequent uncertainty about likely production restricts marketing options and contributes to instability in grain price. Improved methods for predicting regional production would assist marketing decisions for farmers and grain traders. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether reliable regional grain sorghum production predictions could be generated by <b>combining</b> <b>crop</b> simulation and geographic information system technologies. We used historical shire production data to test the approach using hindcasting. Geographical data bases of landscape and soil attributes were used to define arable land boundaries and soil properties. Geographical data bases of daily rainfall and climate were overlaid and used to drive a spatial simulation of sorghum production for all shires in Queensland for the period 1977 - 1988. The results of the simulation were compared with production statistics at the shire and aggregate state levels. The spatial integrity of the prediction system was examined by comparing maps of predicted and reported shire production for specific years. There was a general tendency for the simulated yields per unit area to be greater and more variable (from year to year) than the historical shire production data. This probably reflected the fact that the simulation assumed perfect management and pest-free conditions. The relatively coarse spatial interpolation of rainfall would likely also contribute to this outcome. Linear regression relationships were developed between historical and simulated data at the shire scale to calibrate the simulated yields. Estimates of total production for each shire (in any year) were derived from the predicted yield per unit area, which was derived from the regression correction of the simulated yield, and the reported area planted. Excellent agreement between predicted and reported production occurred both at the individual shire and aggregate state (r = 0. 96) scales. This approach was compared with use of mean shire yield as the estimate of predicted yield per unit area to examine the contribution of the yield simulation procedure to production prediction. Significant improvement in production prediction was attributed to the yield simulation. The spatial distribution of shire production estimates was examined by categorising and mapping shire production predictions. Comparisons with reported production estimates showed the integrity of the spatial distribution was largely retained. Hence, we conclude that reliable shire and state sorghum production estimates can be generated by <b>combining</b> <b>crop</b> simulation and geographic information system technologies. The procedure is suitable for further development for use in real-time. By updating estimates as a season progresses, improved timeliness and accuracy of production forecasts could be achieved...|$|R
