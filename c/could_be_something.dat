500|$|British philosopher John Locke {{argued that}} moral rules cannot be {{established}} from conscience because {{the differences in}} people's consciences would lead to contradictions. Locke {{also noted that the}} conscience is influenced by [...] "education, company, and customs of the country", a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie, who argued that the conscience should be seen as an [...] "introjection" [...] of other people into an agent's mind. Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience, arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God's existence. He uses the example of the internalization by humans of social pressures, which leads to the fear of going against these norms. Even if a supernatural cause is required, he argues, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> other than God; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of monotheism than polytheism.|$|E

The development team chose to develop the game for the Nintendo 3DS because they felt that its 3D capabilities could produce a [...] "tense, scary experience with a realistic atmosphere that could make players feel like there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> lurking around every corner." [...] The developers decided to give the game an episodic structure with short and varied chapters to make it suitable for playing on a portable game console. The Raid mode was designed so that players could [...] "bring the game to their friends house and enjoy it with friends face to face, as they talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, praising it as [...] "a skillfully {{assembled}} 130minutes at the movies, with actors {{capable of doing}} absurd things with straight faces, and action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics", while Richard Corliss of Time considered it [...] "maybe the first great film of the post-human era". The New York Times said it deftly combined action and humor, stating [...] "The only time you won't be watching the screen is when your eyes have squeezed shut because you're laughing so hard." [...] The Telegraph appreciated the presence of Johnson and Diesel together, calling it a [...] "cosmic event", and added that director Lin had revitalized the series, saying [...] "the start and finish here, defying every imaginable law of physics, are series highs." [...] Empire also heaped praise on Johnson, saying [...] "How to re-ignite an ageing franchise? Drop [...] on it. The best thing, by far, in Fast Five ... Dwayne Johnson hulks through the movie leaving testosterone trails in his wake." [...] However, Empire took {{the view that the}} film itself was [...] "not, by any normal criteria, a good film", arguing that it was too long, although conceding that the action scenes, in particular the final car chase, made the film [...] "the most entertaining in the series." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out London also commented that the film was too long and criticized the simplistic characters and dialog, but she called the film [...] "slick" [...] and stated that these criticisms could be overlooked because [...] "it doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Variety focused on the roles of Johnson and Diesel, lamenting the current lack of 1980s-style [...] "brawny" [...] leading men and of the [...] "manly men" [...] typical of the 1950s and 1960s, and calling their pairing [...] "a welcome injection of tough-guy vigor". Variety commented that, based on Fast Five, a [...] "sixth entry <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> worth waiting for". The New Yorker called the action scenes [...] "spectacular", praising director Lin by saying his [...] "direction and the sharp editing never confuse or lose momentum", but also found the film too long and criticized the dialog, labeling it [...] "subpar [...] Ocean's Eleven-style banter". [...] On the characters, The New Yorker considered Walker and Diesel [...] "serviceable", but singled out Johnson for praise for bringing a [...] "hip, comic knowingness to his role ... his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along." ...|$|E

[...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something.</b> Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E

6000|$|But the {{attempts}} to discredit Carlyle's religious sentiment must absolutely fall to the ground. The profound security of Carlyle's sense of {{the unity of the}} Cosmos is like that of a Hebrew prophet; and it has the same expression that it had in the Hebrew prophets--humour. A man must be very full of faith to jest about his divinity. No Neo-Pagan delicately suggesting a revival of Dionysius, no vague, half-converted Theosophist groping towards a recognition of Buddha, would ever think of cracking jokes on the matter. But to the Hebrew prophets their religion was so solid a thing, like a mountain or a mammoth, that the irony of its contact with trivial and fleeting matters struck them like a blow. So it was with Carlyle. His supreme contribution, both to philosophy and literature, was his sense of the sarcasm of eternity. Other writers had seen the hope or the terror of the heavens, he alone saw the humour of them. Other writers had seen that there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> elemental and eternal in a song or statute, he alone saw that there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> elemental and eternal in a joke. No one who ever read it will forget the passage, full of dark and agnostic gratification, in which he narrates that some Court chronicler described Louis XV. as 'falling asleep in the Lord.' 'Enough for us that he did fall asleep; that, curtained in thick night, under what keeping we ask not, he at least will never, through unending ages, insult the face of the sun any more ... and we go on, if not to better forms of beastliness, at least to fresher ones.' ...|$|E

He had been dragged down to very elemental things indeed by the manifest completeness of Lady Harman's return to her husband. He had had at last to look at himself starkly for the male he was, to go beneath the gentlemanly airs, the refined and elegant virilities of his habitual poses. Either this thing was unendurable--there were certainly moments when it came near to being unendurable--or it was not. On the whole and excepting mere momentary paroxysms it was not, and so he had to recognize and he did recognize with the greatest amazement that there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else besides sexual attraction and manoeuvring and possession between a beautiful woman and a man like himself. He loved Lady Harman, he loved her, he now began to realize just how much, and she could defeat him and reject him as a conceivable lover, turn that aside as a thing impossible, shame him as the romantic school would count shame and still command him with her confident eyes and her friendly extended hands. He admitted he suffered, let us rather say he claimed to suffer the heated torments of a passionate nature, but he perceived like fresh air and sunrise coming by blind updrawn and opened window into a foetid chamber, that also he loved her with a clean and bodiless love, was anxious to help her, was anxious now--it was a new thing--to understand her, to reassure her, to give unrequited what once he had sought rather to seem to give in view of an imagined exchange.|$|E
