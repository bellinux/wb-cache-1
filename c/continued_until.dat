5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several ski jumping competitions, which <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> the early 1940s. The {{original}} slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with borax for a summer competition. Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope {{was built on the}} mountain, and the revived competitions <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> 1971.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> 1912 when, due to {{flooding}} {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E

An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{railways}} in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though the streets and along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at {{the eastern end of}} the harbour, to connect with ferries to mainland Europe. Due to declining business, goods traffic ceased in 1972, but passenger services <b>continued</b> <b>until</b> they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of Native American settlements dates {{back as far}} as 3000 BC; the Jeffers Petroglyphs site in southwest Minnesota contains carvings thought to date to the Late Archaic Period (3000 BC to 1000 BC).
