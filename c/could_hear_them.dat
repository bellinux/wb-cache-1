5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them,</b> but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
25|$|Bakari {{reported}} having no life jacket and only minimal swimming skills, but {{she managed to}} hold on to a piece of fuselage wreckage. Most of the time that was to elapse before her rescue was night. She reported later that initially there must have been other survivors as she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> after the crash but later the voices became silent. In the morning of the next day Bakari came to realize she was alone at sea having been drifting for hours without food and water. She also {{reported having}} seen a ship on the horizon that was, however, too far away to take notice of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'm; {{it was so}} lonesome in the rain, {{and this}} place seemed kinder like home, and I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>'em</b> talkin' outside, and Sanch he found vittles, and I was pretty comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|The natives {{were not}} yet in sight, though he <b>could</b> plainly <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{approaching}} across the plantation. They must be very near.|$|R
60|$|The {{young lady}} uttered {{a cry of}} surprise, {{and for a few}} moments they were so still that the {{listener}} <b>could</b> distinctly <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> breathe.|$|R
25|$|UPCI {{doctrine}} also {{distinguishes between}} {{the fruit of}} the Spirit, as mentioned in Galatians 5:22–23, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as that sign and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 2:33, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> and could see them speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose the}} exterior and some interior of Freemasons' Hall in Camden as the stand-in for Thames House, the real-life headquarters of MI5, as they felt both buildings shared a similar architecture. However the Grid set, {{the offices of}} the protagonists, was filmed in a closed medical school in Kensington. Sometime after filming concluded for the first series, the building was demolished. Several other locales around London were used as filming locations. The scenes leading up to Mary's apprehension in [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill" [...] were filmed at Borough Market in Southwark. The same episode made use of Covent Garden. [...] "One Last Dance" [...] had scenes filmed in Roehampton and New Zealand House. In the latter's case, the actors were filmed on the top floors, where the wind forced the actors to raise their voices so the sound unit <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> Scenes were filmed in Hampstead Heath in [...] "Traitor's Gate", while one scene was filmed in Trafalgar Square and at London Bridge for [...] "The Rose Bed Memoirs". The last two episodes held several scenes filmed at a high-end house in Highgate owned by a silk merchant, in particular the opera house and bar Jools frequents, and the DG's (Director General of MI5) office. Rural scenes were filmed across the South East of England, including in areas in Surrey, and outside Maidstone in Kent. In the series finale, the exterior of Sizewell nuclear power stations in Suffolk was used as a double for the fictional Sefton B power station.|$|E
60|$|So {{they turned}} and went around the bend in the passage, where {{they were out of}} sight of the cave and Mister Yoop <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} from him, {{and looked into the}} fire. Her firm full tones sank so low, when she spoke next, that he <b>could</b> barely <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|Marguerite {{felt as if}} she <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> talking it {{over and}} vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|R
2500|$|The media gave {{a lot of}} {{attention}} to the innings at the time. Some still regard it as the most explosive innings ever. Nottinghamshire's George Gunn said Alletson had hit the ball harder than anyone he had seen. Years later he told John Arlott: [...] "Ted sent his drives skimming; you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> hum; he drove several at the Relf brothers and the ball fizzed through them as if they were ghosts. I have never seen another innings like it." ...|$|E
60|$|Thesel and Lorna {{were now}} {{so close that}} Lane <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Pony <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{stirring}} {{about for}} a good while down-stairs. His father came in from uptown at last, and asked: [...] "Has Pony come in?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{peculiar}} wakefulness {{seemed to}} have seized upon me, which appeared, moreover, to afflict the other passengers as well. In {{the darkness of the}} car I <b>could</b> distinctly <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> groaning at intervals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abnormal? I don't call it abnormal," [...] I began, and I was {{sensible}} of my wife's thoughts {{leaving her}} own injuries for {{my point of}} view so swiftly that I <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> whir.|$|R
60|$|It was Valentine's Day. Through {{his bedroom}} window {{he could see}} the trees of the park, where the birds were in song, though he <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> He had never been {{interested}} in Nature--full-blooded men with short necks seldom are.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{talking in}} low, earnest tones; but was so engrossed {{by his own}} {{thoughts}} that he {{made no attempt to}} distinguish the words.|$|E
60|$|Just {{below the}} window {{two men were}} speaking. She <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> quite {{distinctly}} now--and soon one of the voices--clearer than the other--struck her ear with unmistakable familiarity.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{bowed and}} smiled, and pushed by {{him toward the}} door of the parlor. Hartley {{followed}} her in, and Bert <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> rattling away at the stove.|$|E
60|$|It {{was several}} hours after Friday {{came back to}} me before they came back to their boat; and we <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{foremost}} of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and <b>could</b> also <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, {{and not being able to}} come any faster, which was very welcome news to us.|$|R
50|$|Controversially, after Norway had {{announced}} the votes, Katie Boyle (the presenter) {{said that she}} <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> and would return to them. However, everyone else did <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> When Katie went back to Norway again the votes had been changed, thus changing {{the outcome of the}} contest and giving the victory to Norway's neighbours Denmark at Switzerland's expense.|$|R
60|$|The {{merchants and}} traders {{and others who}} {{suffered}} cried out loudly for protection, so loudly that the governors of these provinces <b>could</b> not help <b>hearing</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop that!" [...] said Billy and {{the troop}} horse together, and I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> stamp and shiver. An elephant's trumpeting is always nasty, {{especially}} on a dark night.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Thomas Ryder {{went out}} of the room, and Mr. Warren went with him. They left the door ajar, so she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> talking in the hall. Mr. Warren said: ...|$|E
60|$|Outside I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{calling for}} me. I {{glanced at the}} clock. It was {{within a few minutes}} of the time fixed for our departure. Mr. Bundercombe nodded to me.|$|E
6000|$|She {{abruptly}} {{left the}} table, {{and went to}} the window. When her back was turned to Rufus, she spoke. [...] "Am I a disgrace to him?" [...] she asked, in tones so faint that he <b>could</b> barely <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "I have had my fears of it, before now." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his still seminal work, The Castrati in Opera, Angus Heriot wrote: [...] "Today we can {{but guess}} what the great singers of the past can have sounded like; but one might hazard a guess {{that of all the}} castrati, <b>could</b> we <b>hear</b> <b>them,</b> Pacchierotti would please us most …" ...|$|R
5000|$|Pink Cadillac was {{produced}} by Knox Phillips and Jerry Phillips. Their father, legendary Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, produced two of the album's tracks. Recording took place at Sam Phillips Recording Studio in Memphis between January and May 1979. The album features Prine indulging his love for early rock and roll, with the singer telling David Fricke in 1993, [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} noisy, something like if you had a buddy with a band and you walked into his house and you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>'em</b> practicing in the basement." [...] Although the album may have {{come as a surprise to}} some of his fans, Prine had recorded songs with rock and roll arrangements on his previous albums.|$|R
6000|$|Then I exploded; the air {{was filled}} with my fragments, and you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> whiz. I said, [...] "Oh Livy, if it sounds like that I will never do it again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> all," [...] said Alice, with sincerity {{that made}} Mrs. Mavering laugh as light-heartedly as Dan himself, and {{that seemed to}} suggest the nest thing to her.|$|E
6000|$|When I flew to Blackmoor Vale, [...] Whence the green-gowned faeries hail, Roosting {{near them}} I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> [...] Speak of queenly Nature's ways, [...] Means, and moods,--well known to fays.|$|E
60|$|Dropping {{from her}} berth, {{she began to}} dress in the dark, but found it {{difficult}} to keep her footing on the slanted deck, which lurched and threw her against the lockers, while the planking worked and shook with the throb of engines. Evelyn <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them,</b> but the strong vibration showed that they were running fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} where the joke comes in," [...] she said, and took the Hoppers away to a distance, where the Horners <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "You know," [...] she then explained, [...] "those neighbors of yours are not very bright, poor things, and {{what they think is}} a joke isn't a joke at all--it's true, don't you see?" ...|$|R
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors <b>could</b> easily <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|R
