40|$|Despite {{the current}} {{interest}} in using <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> for fisheries management, {{few studies have}} actually examined the benefits for invertebrate fisheries such as scallops. This study details the dynamics of a population of great scallops Pecten maximus (L.), within a <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> and an adjacent fished area off the Isle of Man, over a 14 yr period (1989 to 2003). Scallop densities were very low in both <b>areas</b> when the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> was set up, but increased at an accelerated rate over time within the <b>closed</b> <b>area.</b> Scallop densities also increased on the adjacent fishing ground, {{but not to the}} same extent. Consequently, the density of scallops above the minimum legal landing size (110 mm SL) was more than 7 times higher in the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> than in the fished area by 2003. There was also a shift towards much older and larger scallops in the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> and, correspondingly, lower estimates of total mortality. Experimental dredging of 2 plots within the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> confirmed that fishing drove these differences in population dynamics and structure. These patterns of scallop density, age and size structure resulted in the exploitable biomass (adductor muscle and gonad) of scallops being nearly 11 times higher in the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> than in the fished area by 2003, and the reproductive biomass was 12. 5 times higher. This is significant for fisheries management because the build up of high densities of large P. maximus individuals enhanced local reproductive potential and therefore the likelihood of export of larvae to the surrounding fishing grounds. Along with these direct benefits of <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> protection, juvenile scallops had higher survival and individual growth rates in the <b>closed</b> <b>area,</b> apparently in response to reduced fishing disturbance. Although juvenile scallops are not subject to direct removal by fishing, protection during this critical phase therefore appeared to assist the recovery of the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> population. In summary, this study joins a growing number indicating that the use of <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> offers a range of benefits over more traditional methods of managing fisheries. Fisheries for relatively sedentary and long-lived species such as P. maximus appear to be particularly suitable for this type of management. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> (marine {{protected}} areas, marine reserves, no-take zones) {{has been}} suggested as a possible solution to the perceived global fisheries crisis. However, to optimize the design and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> we need to understand the interaction between larval dispersal, adult mobility, and fishing mortality. In this paper, a simple, spatially explicit dynamic population model was developed {{to examine the effects of}} these interacting factors on optimal closure size and resulting yields. The effect of using one large or several smaller <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> was also examined. Our model confirmed previous results: <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> do not improve the yield of populations that are optimally managed or underexploited and, as mobility increases, optimum closure size increases. The model also predicted some interesting counter-intuitive results; for overexploited stocks, the greatest benefit from <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> can be obtained for stocks with highest mobility, although this may require closure of 85 % of the total area. For the tested parameter settings, adult spillover had greater potential to improve yield than larval export, and using several small <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> rather than a single larger one had the same effect as increasing the mobility of the population. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

40|$|The {{submitted}} diploma thesis undertakes {{problems of}} the entrance of Fire Rescue Service forces to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and objects. The theoretical part of the diploma thesis focuses on problems of Integrated Rescue System, shows its units cooperated during the actions with the necessity of {{the entrance to the}} <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and specifies legislation focused to this type of incidents. It names the ways of entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> according to possible fire-fighting accesses, admission port to the objects and their technical provision in case of defalt in rescue of people. The main part of the diploma thesis in theoretical part is shot to the specification of fire-fighting technics, technical and material means, used for emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> at Fire Rescue Service Moravian-Silesian Region, Regional Fire Rescue Service Karviná. At the conclusion of the theoretical part there are the most important aspects of tactics of Fire Rescue Service forces in actions described, where they are obliged to open closed obstructions for the entrance and to enter the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> regarding to solve technical help, fires or rescue of people. Because Police of the Czech Republic is the component of the Integrated Rescue System it takes part in most cases of Fire Rescue Service´s actions. That is the reason why I introduced the tactics in the actions of Fire Rescue Service force relating to the Fire Protection, very interesting methods of entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> used by special Police force. In the practical part of the diploma thesis there are methods and ways of emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> using modern methods and technical support. To explain described methods of entrance and making obstructions up, I used the experiences obtained during my professional Fire Rescue Service. After the analysis of the separate methods there is an evaluation of their implementation and risks or complications during the actions. All methods and ways of emergency entrance are illustrated by photos. Then there is a summary of events from 2007 to 2012 when I was included to Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná. This summary shows frequency of actions in entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> in Moravian-Silesian Region in 2012. Next there is an analysis of means of Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná, used for opening and entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas.</b> The effect of the analysis is to detect facilities for effective implementation of actions. On the basis of results the optimalisation was suggested to guarantee preparedness for these actions. In conclusion a ?door and window opener? is designed, including the verification of functionality. The technical documentation and direction for use are in enclosures. In conclusion of the practical part of the diploma thesis there is a discussion and evaluation of all aims of the work as practical processes of emergency entrance of Fire Rescue Service (FRS) forces to <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> evaluation of different types of rescuing people, FRS data processing and designing of the ?door and window opener?. At the end of the discussion the exploratory question was confirmed which evaluated facilities of FRS for emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> their insufficiency or necesity of inovation and, of course, if the door and window opener suggested in this work will improve the entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and the action standard...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{closures}} {{are widely}} used in marine conservation and fisheries management {{and it is important}} to understand their contribution to achieving management objectives. Many previous evaluations of <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> effects have used before-after comparisons, which, without controlling for a full range of factors, cannot ascribe changes in fleet behaviour to area closures per se. In this study we used a counterfactual approach to disentangle the effect of two <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> on fishing location from other competing effects on the behaviour of the Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. Our results revealed an inconsistent effect of the one of the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> between years, after taking into account the influence of environmental conditions on fleet behaviour. This suggests that the policy of <b>closing</b> the <b>area</b> per se was not the main driver for the fleet allocating its effort elsewhere. We also showed a marked difference in effect between the two <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> resulting from their different locations in the fishery area. These findings highlight the need to account for other key fleet behavioural drivers when predicting or evaluating the contribution of area closures to achieving conservation and fishery management objectives...|$|R
