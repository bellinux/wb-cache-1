40|$|Section 1501 allows all of {{the members}} of an {{affiliated}} group of corporations to elect to file a consolidated return. A consolidated return permits the includible members of an affiliated group of corporations to combine their incomes into a single return. The detailed rules for filing consolidated returns are found in regulations promulgated pursuant to a broad delegation of authority in section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, the regulations reflect a “single entity” approach that attempts to treat the several members of a consolidated group {{in the same manner as}} divisions of a single corporation. This article explains the most important general principles governing consolidated returns and is intended to provide an overview of the consolidated return regulations for lawyers who are generally unfamiliar with the detailed rules. Among other topics, the article explains (1) the rules governing eligibility to file a consolidated return, (2) the computation of <b>consolidated</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> including relevant limitations on the use of net operating losses, (3) intercompany transactions and distributions, (4) stock basis adjustments, and (5) earnings and profits calculations. It explains both the rules in the consolidated return regulations and the differences from the rules that otherwise would govern had the corporations not elected to file a consolidated return...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we provide {{evidence}} consistent with nonprofit organizations managing their <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> to near zero {{by examining the}} cross-sectional distribution of <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> as reported on IRS form 990 -T. We find an unusually large number of nonprofits that report <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> profitability {{in the range of}} [- 0. 01, 0. 01). Further analysis finds that various frictions and restrictions impede nonprofits from reporting near zero <b>taxable</b> <b>income.</b> We find that the likelihood that a nonprofit reports near zero <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> is decreasing in size and when the taxable activity has a tax-exempt counterpart. We also find that charitable nonprofits are less likely to report near zero <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> than are hospitals. Finally, we find that the use of a paid CPA preparer is associated with a higher probability of reporting near zero <b>taxable</b> <b>income...</b>|$|R

50|$|The rate {{of income}} tax in Germany ranges from 0% to 45%. The German income tax is a {{progressive}} tax, {{which means that}} the average tax rate (i.e., the ratio of tax and <b>taxable</b> <b>income)</b> increases monotonically with increasing <b>taxable</b> <b>income.</b> Moreover, the German taxation system warrants that an increase in <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> never results in a decrease of the net income after taxation.
