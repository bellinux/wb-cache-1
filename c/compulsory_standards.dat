Before 1979, all unions had systems of elections and were democratic. In most the members elected union executives directly. However, it was thought that indirect elections (e.g. where members voted for delegates, who elected executives in conference) made a minority of unions more [...] "out of touch" [...] and militant than was natural. Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, section 46, requires that members have direct voting rights for the executive, which cannot stay in office for more than five years. In addition, rules were passed (though there was little evidence of problems before) saying no candidate may be unreasonably excluded from an election, all voters are equal, and postal ballots must be available. In practice, UK union elections are often competitive, although voter turnouts (without electronic voting) tend to be low. Minor procedural irregularities that would not affect outcomes do not undermine an election, but otherwise a Certification Officer can hear complaints about malpractice, make inquiries, and issue enforcement orders, which can in turn be appealed to the High Court. For example, in Ecclestone v National Union of Journalists Jake Ecclestone, who had been the Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists for 40 years, was dismissed by the executive. He attempted to run for election again, but the executive introduced a rule that candidates had to have the executive's [...] "confidence". Smith J held the union had no express rule stating the executive could do this, nor could any be construed consistently with the democratic nature of the union's constitution. The executive's [...] "new rule" [...] was also contrary to TULRCA 1992 section 47, which prohibits unfair exclusions of candidates. Where statute is not explicit, standard principles of construction apply. There have been dissenting views, notably in Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union, over the extent to which principles of natural justice may override a union's express rules. However, the better view appears that construction of a union's rules consistently with statutory principles of democratic accountability do require that express rules are disapplied if they undermine the [...] "reasonable expectations" [...] of members. In addition, [...] "best practice" [...] standards will be used to interpret union rules. In AB v CD, where the union's rules were silent on what would happen when an election was tied, the court referred to the Electoral Reform Society's guidance.|$|E

5000|$|Corporate governance, though {{used in many}} senses, is {{primarily}} concerned with {{the balance of power}} among the main actors in a corporation: directors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. A combination of a state's corporation law, case law developed by the courts, and a corporation's own articles of incorporation and bylaws determine how power is shared. In general, the rules of a corporation's constitution can be written in whatever way its incorporators choose, or however it is subsequently amended, so long as they comply with the minimum <b>compulsory</b> <b>standards</b> of the law. Different laws seek to protect the corporate stakeholders to different degrees. Among the most important are the voting rights they exercise against the board of directors, either to elect or remove them from office. There is also the right to sue for breaches of duty, and rights of information, typically used to buy, sell and associate, or disassociate on the market. The federal Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, requires minimum standards on the process of voting, particularly in a [...] "proxy contest" [...] where competing groups attempt to persuade shareholders to delegate them their [...] "proxy" [...] vote. Shareholders also often have rights to amend the corporate constitution, call meetings, make business proposals, and have a voice on major decisions, although these can be significantly constrained by the board. Employees of US corporations have often had a voice in corporate management, either indirectly, or sometimes directly, though unlike in many major economies, express [...] "codetermination" [...] laws that allow participation in management have so far been rare.|$|E

The integrated simulation model presented here enables {{assessment of the}} economic and environmental impact of dairy farming with a focus on nitrogen pollution at the catchment level. Our approach extends the value of the DairyNZ Whole Farm Model (Beukes et al., 2005) as an environmental policy tool by building and integrating nitrogen discharge functions for specific soil types and topography using a metamodelling technique. A hybrid model is created by merging the merits of differential evolution and non-linear optimisation to expedite policy simulations, in which farm profits and nitrogen discharges obtained from the differential evolution optimisation process are assembled to form a profit–pollution frontier. This frontier is then subject to constrained optimisation based on non-linear optimisation in order to predict producer responses to alternative pollution control policies. We apply this framework to derive marginal abatement costs for heterogeneous farm types and find that abatement costs for intensive farms are lower than for moderate and extensive farming systems. We further conclude that abatement can be achieved more cheaply using a <b>compulsory</b> <b>standard</b> or threshold tax than using a standard emissions tax...|$|R

40|$|When {{decisions}} about developing standards {{are left to}} individual firms, there are many advantages including a flexible response to market evolution, accommodation to rapid technology change, and avoidance of costly coordination. However, the market process does not necessarily lead to compatible standards, especially {{when there is no}} clear market dominator. Standards Institutions generally facilitate better communication among market participants, which may discourage early and/or primitive incompatible standards to emerge in the market. However, expenditures on institutional standards-setting can lead to diminishing returns, or even be counter-productive because institutional standards usually take longer to produce and are slower to respond to technology development. Government agencies can specify <b>compulsory</b> <b>standards</b> to avoid incompatibility. In addition, governments can tie their policy on standardization closely with their industrial, trade, and/or regulatory policies. However, many exogenous factors handicap a government's effective involvement. Government often fails to respond to the dynamics of technology development and consumer demand, and to pick up the "right technology". This study first discusses why two different models have emerged in the two regions.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{tractable}} simplification of Gold's (1965, 1967) inductive inference model based on neural networks. In this way, we can introduce explicitly institutions in a learning model. In particular, the hidden layer of neural network {{is shown to}} perform certain functions-data preprocessing and uncertainty and complexity reduction-that are typically attributed to institutions. In an evolutionary context based on selection and successive generations, we study under what circumstances individuals employing particular institutions-that improve their learning capabilities-are successful. Simultaneously, {{we are interested in}} how this process determines the adoption of different institutions in the population. From this perspective, this paper can be considered a contribution to the literature dealing with the emergence of a dominant design. We record lock-in phenomena as well as ``adoption externalities. However, our main goal is that of showing that {{in the context of a}} major change in the environment, the more rigid and strictly specialized an institution is, the longer and more complex the learning process will be of any economic actor subject to the by-now obsolete institution.

40|$|Standards are {{documents}} that establish a basis, example, or principle for firms to conform to, linked to uniform units of measurement. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>standards</b> are enforced through national legislation and industry membership requirements {{and tend to}} cover health and safety, competence standards, occupational safety, land-use planning, licensing of businesses, and consumer protection. Voluntary standards go beyond these to suggest best practice and are usually coupled with training manuals for companies {{to make the necessary}} improvements to meet the requirements. Although certification of quality in hotels has a long tradition, it has focussed on environmental concerns only fairly recently, and is now starting to consider sociocultural issues. Most programmes have developed as bottom-up initiatives with little knowledge of each other and generally operate as specific responses to manage the key negative impacts or challenges of a particular subsector in a particular location. In the last 10 years, they have moved on dramatically {{to become one of the}} buzzwords of sustainable tourism and ecotourism, considered as a potential mechanism to combat greenwashing but not without a fair share of skeptics (Morris, 1997). This chapter will discuss the development of sustainability standards from local efforts to make business improvements to becoming part of the suite of governance and regulatory tools of the global tourism industry. The key propositions of this discussion are that standard setting and certification are valuable tools to bring stakeholders together in their sustainability efforts, and they can be part of a suite of tools to encourage improvement. At the same time it is necessary to proceed with caution and not take certification as the answer to greening the industry. This chapter outlines current developments in the sector to create a basis to critically understand and analyse key issues in the application of sustainability standards. This leads to the discussion of efforts to globalise standards, and the challenges encountered. Finally the chapter considers the range of stakeholders that can have an impact on developing standards, and hypothesises how the tourism industry could change through sustainability standard enforcement, considering both its feasibility and desirability...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{more and more}} {{companies}} are voluntarily reporting about topics related to their social and environmental responsibility {{in order to keep}} the different stakeholders informed. Corporate social disclosures (CSD) can be defined as the provision of financial and non-financial information relating to an organization's interaction with its physical and social environment, as stated in corporate annual reports or separate social reports (Guthrie and Mathews, 1985). CSD includes details of the physical environment, energy, human resources, products and community involvement matters. The important role of corporate social and environmental reporting, also referred to as sustainability reporting, has been since long acknowledged by the actors of the economic and political scene. However, it is also well recognized that the biggest gap in sustainability reporting is the absence of global, harmonized and compulsory standards/guidelines for reporting, as opposed to well established standards for financial reporting. This gap is real, serious and critical since the absence of such global set of formal standards unfairly offers a wide margin of freedom for the companies to include or omit at will any information from their reports. The body of existing reports becomes interesting to study not only for what companies are disclosing but also for what they are not disclosing. (Koehler & Chang, 1999). The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of social and environmental reporting, or sustainability reporting in the Finnish oil and energy sector through the case of the leading company in the sector, Neste Oil Corporation, during the period spanning the years between 1992 and 2008. Towards this goal, the sustainability reports related to this period have been carefully analyzed according to predefined criteria. The results of the study show evidence of significant variation in the reporting practices of Neste Oil Corporation during the study period from 1992 to 2008. The findings demonstrate that the company's reporting evolved over four distinct periods or phases spanning intervals of few consecutive years. The grouping of similar reports is based on the correspondence of these reports with the following criteria: scope of the sustainability reports, dominant themes/topics in the reports, reporting framework utilized in the reports, stakeholders explicitly addressed in reports and the inferred perception of sustainability reporting in this period. The findings also confirm the urgent need for defining global <b>compulsory</b> <b>standards</b> for sustainability reporting, especially under the expanding threats posed by climate change.

40|$|This {{study has}} empirically tested the fitness of a {{structural}} model {{in explaining the}} influence of two exogenous variables (perceived enjoyment and attitude towards ICTs) on two endogenous variables (behavioural intention and teachers' Information Communication Technology (ICT) usage behavior), based on the proposition of Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989 a). The sample was 212 teachers from Business Education faculties of 13 tertiary colleges in the northwestern region of Nigeria. As {{one of the major}} developing countries in Africa, Nigeria has invested a lot of resources in ICTs {{for the past several years}} to ensure the appropriate uptake and integration of technology across the important sectors of the country's economy, especially the education sector. Unfortunately, the country's standard of ICT adoption has remained low for many years. Congruently, its educational sector has remained incapacitated by lack of adequate ICT facilities and lack of skilled ICT-manpower, with school teachers using obsolete tools in the classroom, and some of them buying and using ICTs out of their own volition. Teachers' use of ICTs in tertiary schools' has remained poor in Nigeria, and research initiatives on ICT usage behaviour are rare and predominantly descriptive in nature. Past studies have dwelt on investigating the influence of physical infrastructural facilities on teachers' use of technology in the classroom. The current study has investigated the influence of teachers' perceptive beliefs, attitudes and intentions on their technology usage behaviour, using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings have shown that teachers' perceived enjoyment of ICTs influences their ICT usage behaviour in the classroom (β =. 281, p <. 05); teachers' perceived enjoyment of ICTs influences their intention to use ICTs (β =. 740, p <. 001); teachers' ICT attitude influences their intention to use ICTs (β =. 122, p <. 05); teachers' ICT attitude influences their ICT usage behaviour (β =. 512, p <. 001) and teachers' behavioural intention influences their ICT usage behaviour ICTs (β =. - 368, p <. 05). Teachers' behavioural intention to use ICTs has, however, predicted a decrease in their self-reported ICT usage behaviour. This study will benefit school leaders, curriculum planners and researchers in technology acceptance behaviour in Africa, by giving them guidance in taking decisions concerning teachers' perceptions and intentions of using ICTs in the classroom. The study will play a vital role in filling up the research gap that exist in technology acceptance behaviour among business education faculties across tertiary institutions in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. Future research on the subject matter may attempt to investigate the moderating roles of voluntariness and <b>compulsory</b> <b>standards</b> in influencing teachers' ICT usage behaviour...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since its conception decades ago, pulse oximetry-the non-invasive measurement of arterial blood oxygen saturation in real-time-has proven its worth by achieving and maintaining its rank as a <b>compulsory</b> <b>standard</b> of patient monitoring. However, the use of oversimplified models to describe and implement the technology has limited its applicability and has had its evolution at a near standstill for the past decade. Currently available technology relies on empirical calibrations that consist of the correlation between simultaneous measurements from pulse oximeters and invasively acquired arterial blood samples from test subjects, mainly because the mathematical models underlying the technology are not sufficiently descriptive and accurate. Advances in knowledge of human tissue optical properties, computing power and sensing technology all contribute to a new realm of expansion for pulse oximetry modelling. This research project aims to develop a methodology for improving optophysiological models of pulse oximetry {{through the use of}} a validated Monte Carlo simulation platform for optical propagation in arbitrary geometries. The platform aims to arrive at a model that can predict the widest range of empirical outcomes while maintaining the highest possible level of accuracy. To this end, an empirical platform and a corresponding experimental protocol is developed towards an increasingly repeatable standard, thus providing an empirical output for validation of simulated data. Subsequently, the parameters and coefficients of the optophysiological model at the core of the simulation platform are iterated until a high level of correlation is achieved in their outputs. This gives way to a new approach to the opto-physiological modelling of pulse oximetry...|$|R
