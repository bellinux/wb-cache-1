30|$|Discussing the {{cognitive}} psychological background of driving, Montel et al. [7] explain that “drivers refer to <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>roads</b> when they analyse {{the roads and}} environments they are driving on. They also associate to such <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>roads</b> certain specific expectancies related to the events they may encounter on such roads. … One challenge for the engineers is to take drivers’ categories into account when designing roads {{in such a way}} that drivers’ information processing and decision making will be more appropriate to the situations encountered.” Montel’s paper shows results from a survey related to urban streets. The goal of the survey was to identify drivers’ <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> urban streets based on 65 photographs of various urban streets. Drivers were asked to classify streets and then to describe the events they expected to meet in the different classes of streets.|$|R

It is an all-purpose {{dual carriageway}} road type built to near motorway standards, but without motorway classification or motorway restrictions. High-quality dual carriageways have full grade-separated access {{and do not}} have junctions with minor roads.

National secondary roads are designated with route numbers higher than those used for primary roads, but with the same [...] "N" [...] prefix.

40|$|AbstractThe {{traffic volume}} is {{frequently}} used measure <b>of</b> <b>road</b> capacity. Traffic volumes {{are suitable for}} urban planning, construction and upgrading of roadways or land-use planning decisions, while {{it is necessary to}} plan the construction <b>of</b> <b>road</b> infrastructure in the next few decades ahead on the basis <b>of</b> prognosis <b>of</b> <b>road</b> traffic. This paper outlines the problems of calculating the traffic volumes in Czech Republic. Especially the authors focus on the verification of methodical procedure for the determination of resulting traffic volumes using the short-term traffic surveys. The methodology TP 189 for determining the Annual Average Daily Traffic volumes (AADT) reflects the conversion coefficients which were statistically derived from long-term measurements of traffic intensities. It can be assumed that different traffic characters exist on different types <b>of</b> <b>roads,</b> for which no coefficients are set yet.

30|$|It is {{important}} for researchers {{to be aware of}} the shortcomings (i.e. reporting bias – social desirability and incorrect memory recall) of self-reporting and take the appropriate measures to mitigate them. Studies emphasising the method used should be made to promote an in-depth understanding of self-reporting traffic crashes. Furthermore, research papers should be more explicit in explaining the method of self-reporting by clearly stating how the data collection was conducted, how the targeted respondents were approached, the total number of respondents, the response rate, the recall period used and which <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> users (i.e., age and type) were included in the study.|$|E
40|$|Data were {{collected}} on pedestrian, cyclist and moped-rider traffic fatalities from 1968 to 1972. Use is made only of statistics available. The variables that were considered were related to demographic factors (sex and age), locality characteristics, vicinity factors, other circumstances and {{the severity of the}} accident. Total traffic accidents to pedestrians, cyclists and moped riders involve many more males than females. The smaller the population of a municipality, the more low-speed traffic fatalities there are per 100000 inhabitants. Total collisions of low-speed traffic occur mainly with private cars. Statistics on the nature of injuries show that the most common injuries suffered by the low-speed <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> user are head injuries and after that leg injuries.
