50|$|The color hue modulates {{the phase}} of a {{subcarrier}} named <b>color</b> <b>carrier.</b> In PAL system the polarity of the phase in each frame is reversed to neutralize the undesirable phase shifts introduced during transmission. Thus the effect of undesirable phase shift is positive in one frame and negative in the second frame. Averaging the two, {{the effect of the}} undesirable phase shifts in two consecutive frames cancel each other.|$|E
5000|$|The colorburst is a 10 period {{signal of}} <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> (3.58 MHz in System M and 4.43 MHz in System B and System G). It is {{superimposed}} {{on the back}} porch of the CVS. The peak to peak amplitude is about 300 mV. That means that, when the color signal has a low luminance, its DC component is comparable to that of the colorburst. All dark colors have {{more or less the same}} DC component as the colorburst. But light colors have a higher luminance and hence a higher DC component.|$|E
5000|$|To {{measure the}} {{percentage}} of differential gain, the standard sawtooth signal with superimposed <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> is used. (4.43 MHz. in PAL and 3.58 MHz. in NTSC) The sawtooth represents the CVS with all possible levels between 0.3 V to 1 V. The waveforms are shown in the accompanying image frame. The top figure shows the input. Note that the amplitude of the superimposed color signal is constant. The middle figure shows the distorted output. In this example, color signal superimposed on a high level luminance signal has been attenuated.The bottom figure shows the same waveform after passing through a high pass filter to facilitate measuring.

We consider both no-fading and standard Rayleigh fading channel models. Our results show that, under no-fading, slotted ALOHA can achieve at least one-third (or half under Rayleigh fading) of the throughput capacity of node <b>coloring</b> scheme whereas <b>carrier</b> sense based scheme can achieve almost the same throughput capacity as node coloring.

50|$|The {{color space}} is {{three-dimensional}} {{by the nature}} of the human vision, so after subtracting the luminance, which is carried by the base signal, the <b>color</b> sub <b>carrier</b> still has to carry a two-dimensional signal. Typically the red (R) and the blue (B) information are carried because their signal difference with luminance (R-Y and B-Y) is stronger than that of green (G-Y).|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} {{spectrum of the}} modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies {{on the fact that}} frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near harmonics of the horizontal scanning rate, while the <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband luma signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. In other words, the combination of luma and chroma is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical frequency-division multiplexing systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.|$|E
50|$|The Toaster was {{announced}} at the World of Commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in December 1990 for the Commodore Amiga 2000 computer system, {{taking advantage of the}} video-friendly aspects of that system's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of $2,399. The Amiga was unique among personal computers in that its system clock at 7.16 MHz was precisely double that of the NTSC <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency, 3.579 MHz, allowing for simple synchronization of the video signal. The hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the Amiga 2000's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots, and therefore cannot be used with the A500 or A1000 models. The card has several BNC connectors in the rear, which accepts four video input sources and provided two outputs (preview and program). This initial generation system is essentially a real-time four-channel video switcher.|$|E
50|$|When a {{transmitter}} broadcasts an NTSC signal, it amplitude-modulates a {{radio-frequency carrier}} with the NTSC signal just described, while it frequency-modulates a carrier 4.5 MHz higher with the audio signal. If non-linear distortion {{happens to the}} broadcast signal, the 3.579545 MHz <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> may beat with the sound carrier to produce a dot pattern on the screen. To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, designers adjusted the original 15,750 Hz scanline rate down {{by a factor of}} 1.001 (0.1%) to match the audio carrier frequency divided by the factor 286, resulting in a field rate of approximately 59.94 Hz. This adjustment ensures that the sums and differences of the sound carrier and the color subcarrier and their multiples (i.e., the intermodulation products of the two carriers) are not exact multiples of the frame rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots to remain stationary on the screen, making them most noticeable.|$|E
5000|$|The NTSC field refresh {{frequency}} in the black-and-white system originally exactly matched the nominal 60 Hz frequency of alternating current power {{used in the}} United States. Matching the field refresh rate to the power source avoided intermodulation (also called beating), which produces rolling bars on the screen. Synchronization of the refresh rate to the power incidentally helped kinescope cameras record early live television broadcasts, as it was very simple to synchronize a film camera to capture one frame of video on each film frame by using the alternating current frequency to set {{the speed of the}} synchronous AC motor-drive camera. When color was added to the system, the refresh frequency was shifted slightly downward by 0.1% to approximately 59.94 Hz to eliminate stationary dot patterns in the difference frequency between the sound and <b>color</b> <b>carriers,</b> as explained below in [...] "Color encoding". By the time the frame rate changed to accommodate color, it was nearly as easy to trigger the camera shutter from the video signal itself.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{evaluate}} {{local capacity}} of wireless ad hoc networks with several medium access protocols {{and identify the}} most optimal protocol. We define local capacity as the average information rate received by a receiver randomly located in the network. We analyzed grid pattern protocols where simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a regular grid pattern, pure ALOHA protocols where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to a uniform Poisson distribution and exclusion protocols where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to an exclusion rule such as node <b>coloring</b> and <b>carrier</b> sense protocols. Our analysis allows us to conjecture that local capacity is optimal when simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a grid pattern based on equilateral triangles and our results show that this optimal local capacity is at most double the local capacity of simple ALOHA protocol. Our results also show that node <b>coloring</b> and <b>carrier</b> sense protocols approach the optimal local capacity by an almost negligible difference.

5000|$|This {{means that}} the {{vertical}} color resolution is halved relative to NTSC. The later PAL system also displays half the vertical resolution of NTSC (i.e., the same as SECAM). Although PAL does not eliminate half of vertical color information during encoding, it combines color information from adjacent lines at the decoding stage, in order to compensate for [...] "color sub carrier phase errors" [...] occurring during the transmission of the Amplitude/Phase-Modulated <b>color</b> sub <b>carrier.</b> This is normally done using a delay line like in SECAM (the result is called PAL D or PAL Delay-Line, sometimes interpreted as DeLuxe), but can be accomplished [...] "visually" [...] in cheap TV sets using PAL-S (PAL simple) decoders. Because the FM modulation of SECAM's <b>color</b> sub <b>carrier</b> is insensitive to phase (or amplitude) errors, phase errors do not cause loss of color saturation in SECAM, although they do in PAL. In NTSC, such errors cause color shifts (hence the [...] "Hue" [...] control on all NTSC TV sets to adjust the color phase with a constant bias).|$|R
5000|$|The U-matic {{machines}} were always made with Stereo, and both Betamax and VHS recorded the audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head. However the relatively slow tape speed of Beta and VHS was inadequate for good quality audio, and significantly limited the sound quality. Betamax's release of Beta Hi-Fi {{in the early}} 1980s was quickly followed by JVCs release of HiFi audio on VHS (model HR-D725U). Both systems delivered flat full-range frequency response (20 Hz to 20 kHz), excellent 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (in consumer space, {{second only to the}} compact disc), dynamic range of 90 dB, and professional audio-grade channel separation (more than 70 dB). In VHS the incoming HiFi audio is frequency modulated ("Audio FM" [...] or [...] "AFM"), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and recorded using the same high-bandwidth helical scanning technique used for the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS used depth multiplexing, in which the modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the <b>color</b> <b>carrier</b> (below 1.6 MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use the same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process is audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) ...|$|E
50|$|Around 1984, JVC added Hi-Fi audio to VHS (model HR-D725U, in {{response}} to Betamax's introduction of Beta Hi-Fi.)

VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS's implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called depth multiplexing.

Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi-Fi's backward compatibility with non-Hi-Fi VCRs, virtually all studio home video releases produced after this time contained Hi-Fi audio tracks, in addition to the linear audio track. Under normal circumstances, all Hi-Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi-Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi-Fi playback, though only early high-end Hi-Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility.|$|E

So even before SECAM came to Eastern European countries, most viewers (other than those in East Germany and Yugoslavia) could not have received Western programs.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a metric for performance evaluation of medium access schemes in wireless ad hoc networks known as local capacity. Although deriving the end-to-end capacity of wireless ad hoc networks {{is a difficult}} problem, the local capacity framework allows us to quantify the average information rate received by a receiver node randomly located in the network. In this article, the basic network model and analytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network to derive the local capacity of various medium access schemes. Our goal is to identify the most optimal scheme and also to see how does it compare with more practical medium access schemes. We analyzed grid pattern schemes where simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a regular grid pattern, ALOHA schemes where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to a uniform Poisson distribution and exclusion schemes where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to an exclusion rule such as node <b>coloring</b> and <b>carrier</b> sense schemes. Our analysis shows that local capacity is optimal when simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a grid pattern based on equilateral triangles and our results show that this optimal local capacity is at most double the local capacity of ALOHA based scheme.

50|$|Most TVs {{currently}} sold in SECAM countries support both SECAM and PAL, {{and more}} recently composite video NTSC as well (though not usually broadcast NTSC, that is, they cannot accept a broadcast signal from an antenna). Although the older analog camcorders (VHS, VHS-C) were produced in SECAM versions, none of the 8 mm or Hi-band models (S-VHS, S-VHS-C, and Hi-8) recorded it directly. Camcorders and VCRs of these standards sold in SECAM countries are internally PAL. They use an internal SECAM to PAL converter for recording of broadcast TV transmitted in SECAM. The result could be converted back to SECAM in some models; most people buying such expensive equipment would have a multistandard TV set and as such would not need a conversion. Digital camcorders or DVD players (with the exception of some early models) do not accept or output a SECAM analog signal. However, this is of dwindling importance: since 1980 most European domestic video equipment uses French-originated SCART connectors, allowing the transmission of RGB signals between devices. This eliminates the legacy of PAL, SECAM, and NTSC <b>color</b> sub <b>carrier</b> standards.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{chromatic}} sensitivity of <b>carriers</b> of <b>color</b> deficiency, specifically in relation to dependence on retinal illuminance, and to reference these findings to the corresponding red-green (RG) thresholds measured in normal trichromatic males. Thirty-six carriers of congenital RG color deficiency and 26 normal trichromatic males participated in the study. The retinal illuminance was estimated by measuring the pupil diameter and the optical density of the lens and the macular pigment. Each subject's color vision was examined using the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test, the Ishihara and American Optical pseudoisochromatic plates, and the Nagel anomaloscope. Carriers of deuteranopia (D) and deuteranomaly (DA) had higher RG thresholds than male trichromats (p < 0. 05).

Variation in the L:M ratio and hence the absolute M-cone density may be the principal factor underlying the poorer chromatic sensitivity of D carriers in the low photopic range. The increased sensitivity of PA carriers at lower light levels is consistent with the pooling of signals from the hybrid M' and the M cones and the subsequent stronger inhibition of the rods. The findings suggest that signals from hybrid photopigments may pool preferentially with the spectrally closest "normal" pigments...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency {{evaluates the}} risk of {{granular}} pesticides to birds using an LD 50 s/ft 2 -risk index. The index does not include avian response to granular characteristics, pesticide load per granule, or weather conditions, and it assumes that avian risk increases as granule availability increases. Fensulfothion was formulated on granular pesticide carriers to evaluate the effects of carrier type (silica, clay, and corncob), pesticide load per granule (1 / 2, 1 / 8, and 1 / 32 of the LD 50), granule color (blue, white, and uncolored), and granule size (large and small) on captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In the initial experiments, silica and clay granules posed a greater risk to the birds than did corncob granules, and the risk from the granular pesticide decreased as the pesticide load per granule decreased. Findings regarding granular size and <b>color</b> were inconclusive. <b>Carrier</b> type was further evaluated by offering formulations on the three granular carriers to house sparrows that were given less food than the birds in the first evaluations. In this instance, corncob granules posed a greater risk to the birds than did clay or silica granules. When house sparrows were offered silica, clay, and corncob granules (formulated with fensulfothion) on dry or wet soil, the granular carriers on dry soil posed the greater risk to birds. Wet soil significantly reduced the risk to the birds from corncob and silica granules, whereas the risk from clay granules was not significantly reduced on wet soil. Captive house sparrows were offered silica granules formulated with fensulfothion at 1 / 2 the LD 50 per granule at application rates of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, or 2000 LD 50 s/ft 2. A significant negative correlation between brain ChE activity and the natural logarithm of application rate indicated {{that the relationship between}} avian risk and granule availability was asymptotic rather than linear. The information now available regarding avian response to pesticide granules as a source of grit should be included in risk assessment models to increase the accuracy of predicting avian exposure.

40|$|Narrative is a {{fundamental}} way for human beings to understand the world. Its argumental structure and elements are successful set to communicate ideas. Since the Technicolor emerged in 1930, animation films have included new tools for storytelling 1. According to Brian Dunnigan, at the present times, the storytelling is refracted through framing, light, and shade, color, texture, objects, sounds, movement, shot. 2 In order to generate a visual impact that creates emotions in viewers, it must achieve a successful merger between the elements of storytelling and narrative structure. Visual narrative or storytelling involve two {{important aspects of the}} cognitive perception: the conscious and subconscious. Color is one of the cognitive storytelling elements, its interpretation is captured by the subconscious and it is considered an emotional resource due to its psychological background. On the other hand, the character is also part of cognitive perception and storytelling tool, but this is interpreted consciously, character is considered as a logical resource. Integrating both resources it can get a visual narrative balance, which would help to recognize the style in a movie. According to Borwell and Thompson 3, the film’s techniques application, is known as movie’s style. Differences in the use of cinematographic technique intensify the contrasts and contribute to the persuasiveness of the film. The filmmaker has to choose which techniques to employ, from shot, camera movements, composition, costumes and color, as well as, story, narrative structure and character. Ghibli and Disney have organized their cinematographic techniques in different ways, so it would be unfair to say that one narrative style is better than the other, it depends of perception of beauty which varies according to society. However the present study seeks to determine the differences between Ghibli and Disney narrative style, taking as reference color and female character design. Contemplating the harmonious interaction between color and character design within the narrative structure combined with the other elements of storytelling result {{in the style of the}} film. Filmmakers have long considered color as an important aspect of the staging, capable of providing motifs-actions that will be developed throughout the film. Faber Birren 4 believes that <b>color</b> is a <b>carrier</b> of expression, effectiveness, sense and symbolism, getting their own language and meaning. Ghibli and Disney are perfect example about color effects as a storytelling agent, It can be classified in two aspects: dynamics of color and color as a narrative sequence. The dynamics of color analyzes how color acts and is perceived into a stage, its meaning and symbolism regardless of the character's actions. The narrative sequence studies how color termologic evolves in scene’s development. On the other hand, character archotypes and design was always one of the priorities into an story, due to, without a character there was no story to tell. All the narratives are based on character’s conflicts and actions to solve it. Colors and character design are essential for a correct balance in storytelling, directly influence two cognitive levels of the mind (conscious, subconscious), which makes them powerful tools to convey a messages and emotions to the viewers...|$|R
