However, almost 20 years later, in 1997, the movie Rushmore received his permission to use his songs [...] "Here Comes My Baby" [...] and [...] "The Wind", showing a new willingness on his part to release his music from his Western [...] "pop star" [...] days. This was followed in 2000 by the inclusion of [...] "Peace Train" [...] in the movie Remember the Titans, in 2000 by the use in Almost Famous of the song [...] "The Wind", and in 2006 the inclusion of [...] "Peace Train" [...] on the soundtrack to We Are Marshall.

2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."
