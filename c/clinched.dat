40|$|<b>Clinching</b> is a {{technology}} for joining component parts {{from the same}} or different materials {{and it is also}} a low-cost technique that has proved its worth many times over in industry. The prerequisite for using <b>clinching</b> technology is sufficient material forming properties since component parts are substantially deformed around the joining point. Unfortunately, the formability of magnesium alloys at room temperature is low, which is why cracks might form in component parts with <b>clinching.</b> However, its formability improves significantly if this material is heated to temperatures in excess of 220 ° C. This is the reason why crack-free <b>clinch</b> joints can only be made by heating component parts to 220 ° C. Heating also requires more time, which impairs this technique's economic efficiency. This paper will present the two new <b>clinching</b> techniques of dieless <b>clinching</b> and dieless rivet <b>clinching.</b> The dieless <b>clinching</b> technique is excellent for joining magnesium materials in comparison to conventional <b>clinching</b> techniques. While local component heating takes at least 3 - 6 seconds with conventional <b>clinching.</b> Dieless <b>clinching</b> needs less than 1 second for heating. This paper explains and describes these techniques and their benefits specifically for joining magnesium materials. It will not only explicate parameter studies on the im-pact of tool or rivet geometries, but also the combination of dieless <b>clinching</b> and adhesive bonding...|$|R
