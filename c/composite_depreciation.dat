50|$|To {{calculate}} <b>composite</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate, divide depreciation {{per year}} by total historical cost.To calculate depreciation expense, multiply the result {{by the same}} total historical cost. The result, not surprisingly, will equal to the total depreciation per year again.|$|E
40|$|During the {{production}} process waste is generated. Waste is also generated in the household sector during consumption. The disposal of waste affects both the current generation as well as future generation, and is a major environmental concern for both developed and developing economies. The {{first law of thermodynamics}} states that matter (or energy) can neither be created nor destroyed, but during the process of production and or consumption, matter is taken from the environment, transformed and returned to the environment. When it is returned to the environment, it is not returned in the same form in which it was extracted. If it was, then the problem of waste management would not exist. Thus, the returning of the material in a transformed form creates a problem with regard to the assimilation of the waste by the environment. Furthermore, the second law of thermodynamics, that is the law of entropy, states that for all processes entropy either is constant or increases. Entropy is a thermodynamic quantity which always increases for irreversible processes, giving direction in time for processes which might otherwise appear reversible from energy considerations alone. The above law rules out the possibility of a 100 % recycling of waste. The environment is a <b>composite</b> asset. <b>Depreciation</b> of the environmental asset will reduce the services that the environment could provide for future generations. Therefore, the objective of development should be to minimise the undue depreciation of this asset...|$|R

In particular it analyzes the depreciation method used to measure the consumption of health care resources, the validity of the depreciation process and the subsequent allocation procedures. As defined by the Uniform Chart of Accounts, the usefulness of depreciation in determining {{the total cost of}} providing health care is attenuated by the fact that a major portion of a facility's capital assets are excluded from the depreciation process, the rate of depreciation understates the estimated useful service life of the assets, double counts certain expenses, and makes no provisions to periodically evaluate and adjust the <b>composite</b> rate of <b>depreciation.</b> Comparisons are made between depreciation accounting in the military health service system and the civilian health care sector. Issues raised with the implementation of depreciation accounting within the Uniform Chart of Accounts are addressed and recommendations are made that may enhance the usefulness of the depreciation methodology.
