5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Vibbards 26-year {{career on}} the Hudson was to remain remarkably free of accidents. The steamer was {{involved}} in a tragedy in 1876 however, when on August 30, while entering the slip at the foot of 24th Street, North River, about 6 pm, she collided with a small boat which <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> bows. The two young men in the boat were thrown into the water, and one of them, an 18-year-old named William Koster, went missing and was presumed drowned.|$|E
25|$|Underway {{again on}} 6 December, Balao {{spent two days}} in {{training}} exercises and practice approaches with Coucal as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol. No surface contacts came {{during the first two}} weeks, but her luck changed on 27 December when two s and two s <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> track. The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no sign of damage. The warships were long gone at their high speed.|$|E

500|$|During {{the battle}} Nelson, {{in command of}} , wore out of line and {{performed}} a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. Nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. The move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed [...] "Nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates". When the Spanish retreated Jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. The British had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.|$|E

On 1 May 1942 she was operating with [...] as an escort to Convoy PQ 15, and {{collided with the}} destroyer , which had manoeuvred to avoid a mine and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> bow in dense fog. Punjabi was cut in two and King George V had [...] of her bow badly damaged. King George V entered the Gladstone Dock in Liverpool on 9 May for repairs by Cammell Laird, and returned to Scapa Flow on 1 July 1942. The battleship did not leave Scapa Flow until 18 December when she finally resumed convoy escort duty, providing distant cover for the Arctic convoy JW 51A.|$|E
500|$|Mitzeee begins being stalked. Her portrayer Shenton said Mitzeee {{was unaware}} of who the stalker was and that [...] "Mercedes hasn't even <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> mind. She thinks it's a crazed fan". The viewers learn that it was Mercedes. The {{stalking}} stopped but later was resumed when Mitzeee and Riley begin a relationship. Shenton explained that the stalker had a key to Mitzeee's flat and had been watching her every move, and said that [...] "not only has the stalker come back, but they've come back {{on a whole new}} level". Shenton added that at this point [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She actually thinks that it's Lynsey and accuses her, because it seems to make sense".|$|E

500|$|Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe {{compiled}} {{his list}} of most annoying TV characters. Jenny came second on the list and he stated: [...] "Wow. The gods of narcissism blessed Jenny bigtime. She was just too, too self-centered. She sucked {{the life out of}} everyone who <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> path." [...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to fuck with Jenny's head. As if Jenny's head needed the encouragement".|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most popular {{accounts}} of the battle relate that Brooklyn slowed when Tecumseh <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> path, and Farragut asked why she was not moving ahead. The reply came back that torpedoes were in her path—to which he allegedly replied, [...] "Damn the torpedoes." [...] The story did not appear in print until several years later, and some historians question whether it happened at all.|$|E
2500|$|During the Age of Conquest, Narnia {{remained}} at peace {{for hundreds of}} years after its creation until Jadis the Witch-Queen returned as the White Witch in 898. She conquered Narnia and reigned as a tyrant in 900, using her wand to turn anyone who <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> into stone. With her magic she covered the land in perpetual ice and snow, making it [...] "always winter and never Christmas"; so began Narnia's Age of Winter. Though she claimed to be Queen of Narnia and [...] of Cair Paravel, Jadis ruled from her own fortress in the north, where her halls were lined with Narnians she had turned to stone.|$|E
2500|$|Two other {{letters from}} Peckham, moreover, show {{that some people}} thought she urged Edward to rule harshly and {{that she could be}} a severe woman who did not take it lightly if any one <b>crossed</b> <b>her.</b> Thus he warned a convent of nuns that [...] "if they knew what was good for them," [...] they would accede to the queen's wishes and accept into their house a woman the convent had refused, but whose {{vocation}} Eleanor had decided to sponsor. Record evidence from the king's administrations shows that Hugh Despenser [...] "The Elder" [...] who agreed to allow the queen to hold one of his manors for a term of years in order to clear his debt to her, thought it well to demand official assurances from the King's Exchequer that the manor would be restored to him as soon as the queen had recovered the exact amount of the debt.|$|E

2500|$|At about 0200, San Francisco trained her guns on [...] At {{the same}} time, {{she became the}} target of [...] off her {{starboard}} bow and of a destroyer which had <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on San Francisco whose port [...] battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard [...] battery out of commission. San Francisco swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound San Francisco. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless. Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander Herbert E. Schonland, but he thought his own efforts were {{needed to keep the}} ship [...] "afloat and right-side up", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the conn. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{residents}} {{are coming up}} with plans {{to get into the}} castle and steal Excalibur, but Zelena already knew a way in, having studied the place, on the condition that her powers were restored. As Regina, Hook, David, and Robin sneak their way into the castle, Regina asked Mary Margaret to watch Zelena, with her cuff still on. At the same time, Arthur had other plans for {{the residents}}, as he showed Guinevere a potion that melts anything that it touches. It also turns out that Zelena had double <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> fellow Storybrookers by tricking Mary Margaret with fake contractions, before knocking her out and tying her up. When they reached the Round Table, Regina freezes Arthur, and they are ready to take the sword from Arthur, only to discover that Zelena was working with Arthur and tethered Merlin to Excalibur, which now bears an inscription of his name. (This spell introduced Dark Magic into Merlin's body.) Despite David's pleas, Arthur uses the sword to summon Merlin. As Merlin and Emma are returning to Camelot, Emma discovers that Merlin is missing, even as he appears in front of Arthur. Arthur forces Merlin to disarm the others, but Merlin informs him that Emma had passed her test, and that he had what he needed to unite Excalibur. However, Arthur refuses to give Merlin the sword, in hopes of obtaining more glory, before ordering Merlin to make the [...] "intruders" [...] disappear.|$|E
