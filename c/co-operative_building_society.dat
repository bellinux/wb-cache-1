40|$|This thesis uses Hong Kong’s {{empirical}} data to refute “Olson’s conjecture,” which {{stated that it}} is harder for a smaller group than a larger group to disintegrate. It investigates {{the rise and fall}} of the civil servants’ <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society,</b> which was a special form of housing arrangement for civil servants in Hong Kong that began in the 1950 s. The focus is on the voluntary dissolution of civil servants’ co-operative building societies. Members of a society have a choice to maintain the status quo or opt for dissolution to potentially increase the value of their properties. Olson’s group theory (Olson 1965) and neo-classical economics factors were adopted to evaluate the decision time (i. e., from 1985 until the dissolution date) of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society.</b> Group size, land value, the real option value of redevelopment, and the overall housing market sentiment were significant factors that affected the timing of the dissolution of each <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society.</b> published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the article are the questions: 1) {{what is the role}} of rent in {{financing}} housing economy in Poland and 2) which are the arguments pro and contra applying economically justified rents in Poland. In Poland there is a two-level system of rents. In state-owned and privately owned houses rents are low. Much higher rents are paid by members of <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>societies.</b> This results in economic differentiation of the population depending on whether they live in state-owned or privately owned houses on the one hand and in co-operative houses on the other. In consequence of the low rents in state-owned and privately owned houses it is necessary to cover part of the cost of housing management from the state funds. The authoress considers the advisability and possibility of applying the present rents to the requirements of financing upkeep costs, repairs and housing investments.
