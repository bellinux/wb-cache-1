The change in frequency is indicated by a frequency discriminator. This gives the value of the added capacitance. The change in magnification factor gives the power factor.

Performance of moisture meters could be improved by calibration with NIR-predicted density. Furthermore, the in-line moisture <b>meter</b> <b>calibrated</b> by NIR-predicted density reasonably fulfilled the performance requirement of in-line moisture meter for softwood lumber. However, it is uncertain that the density calibration using NIR spectroscopy is applicable to commercial-size lumbers that often contain knots.

40|$|Numerous {{changes in}} {{electrical}} grid schemes, like {{the inclusion of}} renewable energy, the rise of non-linear loads {{and the emergence of}} electric vehicle charging, increases variable power quality conditions of the grid. In this dynamic scenario where energy could flow in both directions and the waveforms could be highly distorted, accuracy becomes a crucial factor for the correct measurement of electrical energy and power values. Errors in the assessment of these values have significant ramifications for revenue, billing and/or control. This non-ideal power quality scenario produces an error in electricity meters, that is not yet well known since there is no standardised procedure to <b>calibrate</b> <b>meters</b> under typical or emerging distorted waveform conditions. Current standards relevant for revenue energy meters like EN 50470 - 3 : 2006 allows measurements error up to ± 2. 5 % while local regulations could be even more permissive.

50|$|The {{principle}} of Law of Similarity is used extensively for theoretical and experimental fluid machines. With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity {{is the foundation}} for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined {{at the time of}} calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and sonic flow. To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the <b>calibrated</b> <b>meter</b> and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period.
