5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have <b>clean</b> <b>white</b> plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E

25|$|In the Orthodox Jewish community, {{women may}} test whether {{menstruation}} has ceased; this ritual {{is known as}} the hefsek taharah. The woman takes a bath or shower near sunset, wraps a special cloth around her finger, and swipes the vaginal circumference. If the cloth shows only discharges that are white, yellow, or clear, then menstruation is considered to have ceased. If discharge is red or pink, it indicates that menstruation continues. If it is any other color, like brown, it is subject to further inquiry, often involving consultation with a rabbi. The ritual requires that the cloth used to perform this test is first checked carefully to ensure that it is clean of any marks, colored threads, or specks; the cloth itself can be any <b>clean</b> <b>white</b> cloth, although there are small cloths designed for this ritual, known as bedikah cloths (meaning checking).|$|E
500|$|After touring some {{offices of}} real fashion magazines, Jess Gonchor gave the Runway offices a <b>clean,</b> <b>white</b> look meant {{to suggest a}} makeup compact ("the chaste beiges and whites of {{impervious}} authority," [...] Denby called it). Miranda's office bears some strong similarities to the real office of Anna Wintour, down to an octagonal mirror on the wall, photographs and a floral arrangement on the desk Gonchor later told Women's Wear Daily that he had based the set on a photo of Wintour's office he found online; the similarity led Wintour to have her office redecorated after the movie's release. The magazine itself {{is very similar to}} Vogue, and one of the covers {{on the wall of the}} office, showing three models, is a direct homage to the August 2004 cover of that magazine.|$|E
500|$|The album That's the Way It Is, {{produced}} {{to accompany}} the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson notes, [...] "The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise {{the fact that the}} album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very <b>clean</b> <b>white</b> pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis." [...] After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.|$|E

It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met.

500|$|Across the park, {{different}} ages of exposed rocks are seen. Stoneyfell quartzite, composed mostly of quartzite with sandstone and some siltstone, is the youngest. Woolshed flat shale is older and {{is composed of}} siltstone, dolomite and some sandstone. The oldest regular exposure is Montacute dolomite, which is a blue-grey dolomite with magnesite, siltstone and sandstone. Quarries {{in the south of}} the park have been mined for Stoneyfell Quartzite. This type of quartzite is a <b>clean,</b> <b>white,</b> feldsparthic quartzite with interbedded thin siltstone layers up to [...] thick occurring at gaps of [...] Ripple marks in this rock clearly indicate its shallow water origin. Next to Newman's Nursery is a quarry with grey to blue silicaceous dolomite used for road material. It contains traces of pyrite and is overlain by phyllite. Tea Tree Gully freestone, as found in the largest quarry in the park, is a feldsparthic sandstone bedded with quartzite. Decay of the feldspar has enabled it to be cut and dressed as a quality building stone. The Tea Tree Gully iron (or silver) mine lies in an iron-rich fault zone. The ore body is ironstone, 150m long, 50m wide and 30m thick (490ft by 160ft by 100ft). It is primarily limonite, detrital quartz and silica. It is thought to have been chemically deposited during the Paleogene and Neogene periods, 2mya to 66mya.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{has been}} {{variously}} reported {{as being a}} blonde or redhead, whereas her nickname, [...] "Black Mary", suggests a dark brunette. Her reported eye colour was blue. Reports of the time estimated her height at 5 feet and 7 inches (1.70 metres). Detective Walter Dew, in his autobiography, claimed to have known Kelly well by sight and described her as [...] "quite attractive" [...] and [...] "a pretty, buxom girl". He said she always wore a <b>clean</b> <b>white</b> apron but never a hat.

2500|$|In his memoirs, {{published}} {{fifty years}} later in 1938, Dew {{made a number of}} claims about being personally involved in the Ripper investigation. [...] Dew claimed to know Mary Jane Kelly by sight. [...] "Often I saw her parading along Commercial Street, between Flower and Dean Street and Aldgate, or along Whitechapel Road", he wrote. [...] "She was usually in the company of two or three of her kind, fairly neatly dressed and invariably wearing a <b>clean</b> <b>white</b> apron, but no hat." [...] Dew also claimed to {{have been one of the}} first police officers on the murder scene, though none of the records mentioning those people who were present list his involvement. Dew wrote that he saw Kelly's mutilated body in her room in Miller's Court and that he regarded it as [...] "the most gruesome memory of the whole of my Police career." [...] Dew wrote that Kelly's open eyes were photographed in an attempt to capture an image of her killer, but police doctors involved in the case had already determined that such an effort would be futile. Dew stated that Emma Smith was the first Ripper victim, a view that has often been contested by Ripperologists, [...] and opined that [...] "Someone, somewhere, shared Jack the Ripper's guilty secret." ...|$|E
