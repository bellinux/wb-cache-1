25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

40|$|The {{article is}} deals for new {{experimental}} equipment for effective test adhesion for selected <b>coating</b> <b>STEEL,</b> applied cold on the coated metal sheet with Al (aluminum). Explanation {{to the word}} STEEL: <b>STEEL</b> <b>coating</b> has significant anti- corrosive properties and he is resistant for main oxidizing agents such as acids, alkalis, salt vapors etc. Resists tem- peratures to 600 ?C and create an elastic film that is resistant to abrasion, {{as soon as it}} was to complete po-lymerization. It is very simple to applied to metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Dries quickly and is dry to the touch after 90 to 120 seconds. STEEL is the best possible solution anywhere, if needs arises powerful local protection against atmospheric and corrosive agents or to elevated temperatures. STEEL is also useful as a method for protect of welds on stainless steels instead of traditional staining procedures. Broad application is in automotive industry to modify the surfaces of block vehicle, car-body repairs, welds needing protection, in heating industry for example boilers, in air condition with heat exchanger and in shipping industry.

The sliding wear tests {{have been carried}} out using a pin-on-disc of configuration under applied normal load of 50 N for 20 min with heating the ultra-high strength boron steels up to 800 o C. Characterizations of tribolayers formed on the contacting surfaces between the tribopairs of the AlCrN <b>coated</b> tool <b>steels</b> and the ultra-high strength boron steels have been studied. It was found on the tribolayers of the AlCrN <b>coated</b> tool <b>steels</b> that microcracking and oxides containing Fe and Cr to increase friction coefficient were formed at the early stage of sliding wear, followed by the generation of the smeared oxide layers containing Fe transferred from the tribopair to decrease friction coefficient.

40|$|Due to the {{excellent}} anticorrosion performance, galvanized steels {{are widely used}} {{in a variety of}} structural applications for corrosion protection of steel structure exposed to atmospheric environment, especially marine atmosphere. In this work, the corrosion behavior of two representative zinc-aluminum hot-dip <b>coated</b> <b>steels,</b> Galvalume(GL) and Galfan(GF), under cyclic wet-dry conditions, was investigated by weight loss method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) measurement. The wet-dry cycle tests were carried out by exposure to alternate conditions of 1 h immersion in seawater and drying for 3 h and 11 h at 298 K and 60 % relative humidity (RH). During the wet-dry cycles, the polarization resistance was continuously monitored and its reciprocal was considered as an index of corrosion rate. Results show that the anticorrosion performance of GL coating was better than that of GF coating in all tests. The effects of the formation of stable simonkolleite layer and other influence parameters, such as elemental composition of coating materials, on the corrosion of two <b>coated</b> <b>steels</b> were discussed...|$|R

Several experimental investigations have let {{to the development}} of a (TiAlCN/TiAlN/TiAl) and (TiAlZrN/TiAlN/TiAl) coatings in preference to the traditional TiN coating. In the current paper research conducted on fretting wear of a (TiAlCN/TiAlN/TiAl) and a (TiAlZrN/TiAlN/TiAl) multilayer coatings deposited by reactive DC (magnetron sputtering) of Ti-Al and Ti-Al-Zr alloys on AISI 4140 steel. Fretting wear tests (20. 000 cycles at 5 Hz) were conducted in ambient conditions, where the interaction between normal load and displacement amplitude determines the fretting regime. The influence of the normal load and displacement amplitude on the coefficients of instantaneous coefficient of friction and stabilized coefficient of friction is different from the two multilayer <b>coated</b> <b>steels.</b> The PVD <b>coating</b> (TiAlZrN/TiAlN/TiAl) reduces the friction. The worn volume of <b>coated</b> AISI 4140 <b>steel</b> is sensitive to normal load and displacement amplitude.
