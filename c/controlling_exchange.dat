This paper investigates the robustness of damping control implemented by the ESS to the variations of power system operating conditions. It proposes a new analytical method based on the well-known equal-area criterion and small-signal stability analysis. By using the proposed method, it is concluded {{in the paper that}} damping control implemented by the ESS through controlling its active power exchange with the power system is robust to the changes of power system operating conditions. While if the ESS damping control is realized by controlling its reactive power exchange with the power system, effectiveness of damping control changes with variations of power system operating condition. In the paper, an example of power system installed with a battery ESS (BESS) is presented. Simulation results confirm the analytical conclusions made in the paper about the robustness of ESS damping control. Laboratory experiment of a physical power system installed with a 35 kJ/ 7 kW Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) was carried out to evaluate theoretical study.

The first period was investigated intensively, including flux measurements by continuous wet denuders at six heights, as well as by filter packs and passive flux samplers. The aerodynamic gradient method and eddy covariance were applied to estimate friction velocity (u*), sensible heat fluxes (H) and latent heat fluxes (λE), with best estimates provided by inter-comparisons for each. The measurements represent a major exercise in data acquisition and processing, and provide approximately 30 days of semi-continuous fluxes. The largest errors in estimating the NH 3 fluxes arise from the concentration profile measurements. Fluxes from the ripening canopy were bi-directional, varying in the range − 150 to 180 ng m− 2 s− 1, with the largest emission fluxes during the day, and both emission and deposition occurring at night. Larger net emissions {{were measured}} following cutting of the rape (up to 620 ng m− 2 s− 1), with an overall mean of 57 ng m− 2 s− 1 compared with 16 ng m− 2 s− 1 prior to cutting.

As a reservoir of chemically active HOx radicals, it is also linked to many chemical processes like the natural destruction of ozone. In order to improve our knowledge of the amount and variability of water in the middle atmosphere, the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) on board the Odin satellite, launched in February 2001, observes several thermal emission lines of water vapour in the 485 - 580 GHz spectral range from the Earth's limb. Bands around 489. 9 and 490. 4 GHz are used to study water vapour and its isotopes, on the basis of four observation days per month. Vertical profiles of H 2 O- 16, H 2 O- 18, and HDO are retrieved between roughly 20 and 70 km in the stratosphere and mesosphere. A strong water vapour line at 557 GHz is simultaneously measured in a second band, providing information in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere between about 40 and 100 km. Measurements of H 2 O- 17 at 552 GHz in monthly intervals complete the picture of middle atmospheric water vapour provided by Odin. The measurements of the isotope HDO in the 20 - 70 km altitude range allow to study the isotopic depletion of water, potentially supplying information on the origin of stratospheric water vapour: transport of tropospheric air through the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) vs in-situ chemical production by methane oxidation. The unique measurements of the isotopes H 2 O- 18 and H 2 O- 17 may provide a crucial test for our understanding of the complex mass-dependent and mass-independent chemical reaction mechanisms <b>controlling</b> <b>exchange</b> of heavy isotopes of oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Controlling {{magnetism}} via voltage in {{the virtual}} absence of electric current {{is the key to}} reduce power consumption while enhancing processing speed, integration density and functionality in comparison with present-day information technology. Almost all spintronic devices rely on tailored interface magnetism. Controlling magnetism at thin-film interfaces, preferably by purely electrical means, is therefore a key challenge to better spintronics. However, there is no direct interaction between magnetization and electric fields, thus making voltage control of magnetism in general a scientific challenge. The significance of controlled interface magnetism started with the exchange-bias effect. Exchange bias is a coupling phenomenon at magnetic interfaces that manifests itself prominently in the shift of the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop along the magnetic-field axis. ^ Various attempts on <b>controlling</b> <b>exchange</b> bias via voltage utilizing different scientific principles have been intensively studied recently. The majority of present research is emphasizing on various complex oxides. Our approach can be considered as a paradigm shift away from complex oxides. We focus on a magnetoelectric antiferromagnetic simple oxide Cr 2 O 3. From a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts, we show that the (0001) surface of magnetoelectric Cr 2 O 3 has a roughness-insensitive, electrically switchable magnetization. Using a ferromagnetic Pd/Co multilayer deposited on the (0001) surface of a Cr 2 O 3 single crystal, we achieve reversible, room-temperature isothermal switching of the exchange-bias between positive and negative values by reversing the electric field while maintaining a permanent magnetic field. This is a significant scientific breakthrough providing a new route towards potentially revolutionizing information technology. ^ In addition, a second path of electrically controlled exchange bias is introduced by exploiting the piezoelectric property of BaTiO 3. An exchange-bias Co/CoO bilayer is deposited on the surface of BaTiO 3 substrate which allows for tunable stress in the adjacent Co thin film. This stress induces strain in the Co film thus alters its magnetic anisotropy. The change of the magnetization orientation at the Co/CoO interface tunes its exchange bias and coercivity and provides a route to study the interface magnetism of the exchange bias heterostructure from a new perspective. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{capital mobility}} {{and the subsequent}} difficulty in <b>controlling</b> <b>exchange</b> rates, intermediate exchange-rate regimes have remained widespread, especially in emerging and developing economies. This piece of evidence hardly fits the "impossible Trinity" theory arguing that it becomes difficult to control the exchange rate without a "hard" device when capital flows are freed. Calvo and Reinhart (2000) have suggested several explanations for such "fear of floating": exchange rate pass-through, liability dollarization, dollar invoicing of domestic and external transactions, and an underdeveloped market for currency hedging make it more desirable to stabilize the nominal exchange rate. However, the New-Keynesian model, which has become the main workhorse for studying exchange-rate regime choice since the 1990 s, typically opposes fixed nominal pegs to free-floating regime, without considering intermediate regimes. We intend to fill this gap here by comparing the performance of "extreme" regimes to that of an intermediate regime where monetary authorities care both about inflation and about nominal exchange-rate deviations from the steady state, when a small economy is hit by several types of shocks. Without nominal wage rigidities, our results {{are in line with}} the New-Keynesian literature arguing in favor of inflation-targeting regimes. However, when nominal wage rigidities are taken into account, we find the intermediate regime to be appropriate for an economy that is mainly hit by productivity and foreign-interest shocks, which is often the case in emerging and developing economies. The free-floating regime (with inflation targeting) seems more adequate if the economy experiences mostly demand shocks and foreign prices shock. Finally, the fixed peg regime is always dominated by either the free-floating or the intermediate regime. A fully-fledged analysis of intermediate regimes should of course account for the fear-of-floating-type advantages of such regimes, as well as for their shortcomings in terms of costly reserve-accumulation and/or recurrent crises. Our results however suggest that, by concentrating on two extreme regimes (fixed nominal pegs and free floats), by neglecting wage rigidities and/or by assuming that floating countries can engineer an "optimal" interest-rate feedback rule, the existing New-Keynesian literature may have exaggerated the merits of free-floating regimes to the detriment of "soft" pegs.

Phosphorus exchanged from suspended sediments transported from Lagunitas Creek into the bay during a storm event in March 1991 did not result in a significant input of phosphate to the bay water column. Laboratory experiments, using suspended particles collected during this storm, showed that phosphate was not released from these particles in response to increased salinity. These particles did, however, have a high capacity to buffer the phosphate concentration of solutions in which they were suspended by both adsorbing and desorbing phosphate. The generally higher phosphate concentrations in "inner" Tomales Bay compared with Lagunitas Creek may in fact promote adsorption rather than desorption of phosphate from suspended sediments delivered to the bay from the creek. The porewaters of cores collected from two sites in the bay were depleted in phosphate relative to ammonium and DIC released stiochiometrically from organic matter decomposition. Results from sequential extraction of these sediments showed that phosphate is removed from the porewaters by adsorption. Bioturbation and the relatively refractory nature of the organic matter deposited to these sediments promotes suboxic degradation reactions, in particular iron and manganese reduction. While these reactions do not account for a high percentage of the organic matter rematerialized in these sediments, these reactions are important in recycling iron and manganese oxides within the sediments, thereby providing fresh adsorption sites deep within the sediments. Burial of this adsorbed/exchangeable phosphorus phase was a sink for approximately 15 % of the phosphate released from organic matter decomposition. An additional sink of phosphate released to the porewaters from organic matter decomposition remains to be identified. This sink may be either authigenic precipitation of carbonate fluorapatite, or incorporation into metal oxides. The net flux of phosphate from the sediments to the overlying water column is principally supported by organic matter decomposition occurring in the upper few centimeters of sediments. Additionally throughout most of the year, the rate of organic matter decomposition in the surface sediments is sufficient to overwhelm the capacity of the sediments to buffer porewater phosphate concentrations. Consequently, removal of porewater phosphate by adsorption does not greatly influence the net benthic phosphate flux...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} field control of ferromagnetism {{has been a}} long sought after effect, due to the large number of potential applications in electronic/magnetic devices. Large currents (and hence large powers) are required to generate the large magnetic fields needed to control the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material in a thin film electronic device, which is incompatible with planar integrated circuit technology. Alternatively, creating large {{electric field}}s at these scales requires minimal current (and hence minimal power) and is already well established. By exploiting a magnetoelectric material, magnetization can be manipulated in a scalable planar low-power device through the application of electric field. Using this type of device architecture could lead to huge advances in magnetic memory and storage, as well as provide a crucial first step to creating low-power spintronic devices as a replacement for traditional electronics that are reaching the limit of scaling. One possible way to achieve the electric control of ferromagnetism is by <b>controlling</b> <b>exchange</b> bias, the shift of a magnetic hysteresis curve along the applied field axis due to interface interactions between coupled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) materials. If it is possible to shift exchange bias through the coercive field of the FM, magnetization can be reversed. Reaching this goal requires a careful understanding of antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism and the interactions between the two when coupled (exchange bias). The main focus of this thesis will be the design, fabrication, characterization, and understanding of an electric field effect device where we are able to reversibly modulate between two exchange bias states with opposite polarity in a thin film ferromagnet by coupling it to a multiferroic (ferroelectric/antiferromagnetic) material. The multiferroic material BiFeO 3 (BFO), an AFM and ferroelectric (FE) with coupled AFM/FE order parameters, is a prime candidate material for affecting change in exchange bias systems. When coupled to a thin film ferromagnet such as the colossal magnetoresistive manganite La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 (LSMO), one can envision a system where FE order is switched in BFO, which induces a change in AFM order in BFO, which induces a change in exchange bias in LSMO. Here, an electric field effect device is created using BFO as the dielectric and LSMO as the conducting channel to realize just such a system. Heteroepitaxially deposited BFO (3 nm) /LSMO (200 nm) heterostructures are grown on SrTiO 3 (100) substrates and subsequently patterned into field effect devices using a fabrication process involving photolithography and argon ion milling. These devices are then characterized through magnetotransport measurements to characterize the magnetic properties of the LSMO channel with respect to BFO FE polarization. Through these measurements this thesis shows, for the first time, exchange bias is directly controlled with electric field without temperature cycling or any electric or magnetic field cooling/biasing. This effect is reversible and comes concurrently with the modulation of channel resistance (sometimes over 300 %), the modulation of magnetic coercivity, and magnetic Curie temperature. Based on these results and the current understanding of exchange bias we propose a model to understand the electric control of exchange bias. In this model the coupled antiferromagnetic/ferroelectric order in BFO along with the modulation of interfacial exchange interactions due to ionic displacement of Fe 3 + in BFO relative to Mn 3 +/ 4 + in LSMO cause exchange bias modulation...|$|E
