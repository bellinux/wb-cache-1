5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with <b>Campylobacter</b> or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of <b>Campylobacter</b> involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause {{gastroenteritis}} in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are <b>Campylobacter,</b> Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of <b>Campylobacter</b> gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E
5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic <b>Campylobacter</b> species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|February: Gastroenterological Society of Australia rejects Marshall's {{abstract}} {{to present}} his research at their yearly conference. They deem it in the bottom 10% of papers submitted. The same abstract is accepted for presentation at a <b>Campylobacter</b> workshop in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in <b>Campylobacter</b> and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and <b>Campylobacter</b> species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and <b>Campylobacter</b> species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and <b>Campylobacter</b> are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} <b>Campylobacter</b> pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the parasitic worm Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic <b>Campylobacter</b> species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with <b>Campylobacter</b> species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a <b>Campylobacter</b> infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis. For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of <b>Campylobacter</b> enteritis occur annually in the U.S., accounting for 5–7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom during 2000, <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni was involved in 77.3% in all cases of laboratory confirmed foodborne illness. About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor <b>Campylobacter</b> in their gut.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> {{can spread}} through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread {{from one person}} to another. However, {{activities}} such as changing an infected person's diapers or sexual contact with an infected person can lead to infection. Regardless of where they are from, any puppies and dogs may carry <b>Campylobacter</b> germs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> organisms can be {{detected}} by performing a Gram stain of a stool sample with high specificity and a sensitivity of ~60%, but are most often diagnosed by stool culture. Fecal leukocytes should be present and indicate the diarrhea to be inflammatory in nature. Methods currently being developed to detect the presence of <b>campylobacter</b> organisms include antigen testing via an EIA or PCR.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} zoonotic pathogens causing foodborne diseases are , <b>Campylobacter,</b> Caliciviridae, and Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|Currently growing {{resistance}} of the <b>Campylobacter</b> to fluoroquinolones and macrolides is of a major concern.|$|E
25|$|Microaerophile {{bacteria}} Actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, <b>Campylobacter</b> rectus, and Eikenella corrodens {{also may}} play a role in chronic periodontitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> spp. are {{a common}} cause of {{bacterial}} diarrhea, but infections by Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and some strains of Escherichia coli are also a frequent cause.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{diseases}} showing similar symptoms. For instance, abdominal pain and tenderness {{may be very}} localized, mimicking acute appendicitis. Furthermore, Helicobacter pylori {{is closely related to}} <b>Campylobacter</b> and causes peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|Other {{less common}} infections {{are caused by}} gonorrhea, chlamydia, Mycoplasma, herpes, <b>Campylobacter,</b> {{improper}} hygiene, and some parasites, notably Trichomonas vaginalis. Women who have diabetes develop infectious vaginitis more often than women who do not.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} is an RF-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often {{precipitated by}} genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella, Shigella or <b>Campylobacter)</b> and sexually transmitted infections (with Chlamydia trachomatis).|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, the UK's Food Standards Agency {{warned that}} two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was {{contaminated}} with <b>campylobacter,</b> affecting an estimated {{half a million people}} annually and killing approximately 100.|$|E
25|$|Asymptomatic {{subclinical}} infection may help spread these diseases, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, <b>Campylobacter,</b> Salmonella, Shigella, V. cholerae, and Yersini. For example, as of 1984 {{it was estimated}} that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacteriosis is an {{infection}} by the <b>Campylobacter</b> bacterium, most commonly C. jejuni. It {{is among the}} most common bacterial infections of humans, often a foodborne illness. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever and pain.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacteriosis {{is caused}} by <b>Campylobacter</b> {{bacteria}} (curved or spiral, motile, non–spore-forming, Gram-negative rods). The disease is usually caused by C. jejuni, a spiral and comma shaped bacterium normally found in cattle, swine, and birds, where it is nonpathogenic, but the illness can also be caused by C. coli (also found in cattle, swine, and birds), C. upsaliensis (found in cats and dogs) and C. lari (present in seabirds in particular).|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{is associated}} with the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6 and by the presence of enthesitis as the basic pathologic lesion and is triggered by a preceding infection. The most common triggering infection in the US is a genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Other bacteria known to cause reactive arthritis which are more common worldwide are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., and <b>Campylobacter</b> spp.|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and <b>Campylobacter.</b> The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin {{can be used}} in children, and {{tetracycline}} in adults. Some studies show, however, that erythromycin rapidly eliminates <b>Campylobacter</b> {{from the}} stool without affecting the duration of illness. Nevertheless, children with dysentery due to C. jejuni benefit from early treatment with erythromycin. Treatment with antibiotics, therefore, depends on the severity of symptoms. Quinolones are effective if the organism is sensitive, but high rates of quinolone use in livestock means that quinolones are now largely ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Catalase {{is usually}} {{located in a}} {{cellular}} organelle called the peroxisome. Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in photorespiration (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms). Hydrogen peroxide {{is used as a}} potent antimicrobial agent when cells are infected with a pathogen. Catalase-positive pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni, make catalase to deactivate the peroxide radicals, thus allowing them to survive unharmed within the host.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{in chicken}} farms may be unsanitary, {{allowing}} {{the proliferation of}} diseases such as salmonella, E. coli and <b>campylobacter.</b> Chickens may be raised in very low light intensities, sometimes total darkness, to reduce injurious pecking. Concerns have been raised that companies growing single varieties of birds for eggs or meat are increasing their susceptibility to disease. Rough handling, crowded transport during various weather conditions {{and the failure of}} existing stunning systems to render the birds unconscious before slaughter, have also been cited as welfare concerns.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, for {{the second}} year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. The focus was on the {{handling}} of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the <b>campylobacter</b> bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. She points to the examples set by Scandinavian societies.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{infection}} of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella species, brucella species and <b>campylobacter</b> species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} Roosevelt {{was exposed to}} an infectious agent at the Boy Scout Jamboree in late July. However, the two-week interval {{before the onset of}} his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis, and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS. There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni, a major causative agent of GBS.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria <b>Campylobacter</b> (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
