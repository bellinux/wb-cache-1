6000|$|Here was a storm! To order {{a cohort}} {{to enter the}} church and bring away the body was easy enough: to make them do it, {{in the face of}} certain death, not so easy. Besides, it was too early yet for so desperate a move as would be {{involved}} in the violation of a church .... So Orestes added this fresh item to the long column of accounts which he intended to settle with the patriarch; cursed for half an hour in the name of all divinities, saints, and martyrs, Christian and Pagan; and wrote off a lamentable history of his wrongs and sufferings to the very Byzantine court against which he was about to rebel, in the comfortable assurance that Cyril had sent, by the same post, a <b>counter-statement,</b> contradicting it in every particular.... Never mind.... In case he failed in rebelling, it was as well to be able to prove his allegiance up to the latest possible date; and the more completely the two statements contradicted each other, the longer it would take to sift the truth out of them; and thus so much time was gained, and so much the more chance, meantime, of a new leaf being turned over in that Sibylline oracle of politicians--the Chapter of Accidents. And for the time being, he would make a pathetic appeal to respectability and moderation in general, of which Alexandria, wherein some hundred thousand tradesmen and merchants had property to lose, possessed a goodly share.|$|E

6000|$|The {{author of}} the Second Burnett Prize Essay (Dr. Tulloch), who [...] has {{employed}} {{a considerable number of}} pages in controverting the [...] doctrines of the preceding chapter, has somewhat surprised me by [...] denying a fact, which I imagined too well known to require [...] proof—that there have been philosophers who found in physical [...] explanations of phenomena the same complete mental satisfaction [...] which we are told is only given by volitional explanation, and [...] others who denied the Volitional Theory on the same ground of [...] inconceivability on which it is defended.

60|$|The {{theory of}} {{persecution}} seems {{to rest on}} the following assumptions. 1. A duty implies a right. We have a right to do whatever it is our duty to do. 2. It is the duty and consequently the right of the supreme power in a state to promote the greatest possible sum of well-being in that state. 3. This is impossible without morality. 4. But morality can neither be produced or preserved in a people at large without true religion. 5. Relative to the duties of the legislature or governors, that is the true religion which they conscientiously believe to be so. 6. As there can be but one true religion, at the same time, this one it is their duty and right to authorize and protect. 7. But the established religion cannot be protected and secured except by the imposition of restraints or the influence of penalties on those, who profess and propagate hostility to it. 8. True religion, consisting of precepts, counsels, commandments, doctrines, and historical narratives, cannot be effectually proved or defended, but by a comprehensive view of the whole as a system. Now this cannot be hoped for from the mass of mankind. But it may be attacked, and the faith of ignorant men subverted by particular objections, by the statement of difficulties without any <b>counter-statement</b> of the greater difficulties which would result from the rejection of the former, and by all the other stratagems used in the desultory warfare of sectaries and infidels. This is, however, manifestly dishonest and dangerous, and there must exist, therefore, a power in the state to prevent, suppress, and punish it. 9. The advocates of toleration {{have never been able to}} agree among themselves concerning the limits to their own claims; have never established any clear rules, as to what shall and what shall not be admitted under the name of religion and conscience. Treason and the grossest indecencies not only may be, but have been, called by these names: as among the earlier Anabaptists. 10. And last, it is a 'petitio principii', or begging the question, to take for granted that a state has no power except in case of overt acts. It is its duty to prevent a present evil, as much at least as to punish the perpetrators of it. Besides, preaching and publishing are overt acts. Nor has it yet been proved, though often asserted, that a Christian sovereign has nothing to do with the eternal happiness or misery of the fellow creatures entrusted to his charge.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Owen {{explains}} that Wen fu {{is a work}} of “both literature and literary thought, ” [...] "a work of such originality that it could not have been anticipated from the works that preceded it.... nothing like it ever had been written concerning literature..." [...] The work introduced new vocabulary of terms which remain influential, although in many cases, problematic. Moving away from questions such as the ethical purpose of literature, its social context, or the expression of personality, Lu Ji turns to the Neo-Taoist theory of mind and its cosmological basis. This philosophical stance describes the poet's mind as wandering through the microcosmos which is within his own body in search of encounters which form the origin of literary work. The fu as a poetic form was known for its verbal display, usually cataloging and listing an array of items in order to say everything that could be said on a topic. Lu presents this philosophical stance in a series of balanced elements which unfold in an orderly way. For instance, Lu balances what the poet learns from thinking against what is learned from reading. These antithetical elements are then amplified and repeated in different contexts, often with statements and <b>counter-statements</b> in order to avoid being one-sided.|$|R
40|$|Current {{creativity}} {{research is}} dominated by attention to the individual, with increasingly less attention paid to creativity in its context, in groups, and in filmmaking as a collaboratively creative enterprise. This study answers the research call to explore filmmaking as an exemplar for collaborative creativity. Utilizing the stories told on DVD extras on special edition releases of feature films, this study analyzes how collaborative creativity is storied. In turn, these stories reveal specific communication forms, practices, and strategies that enrich theoretical conceptions of collaborative creativity. Following dramatistic concepts elaborated by Kenneth Burke, this rhetorical analysis finds three emergent patterns of communication [...] mythic, historic, and symbolic [...] in the discourses of making-of-documentaries (MODs) that illuminate collaborative creativity. As mythic patterns, MODs utilize {{the structure of the}} quest tale to organize the plot, drama, and rhetoric of collaborative creativity told in MODs. Audiences, then, are invited to re-experience the journey, and every MOD symbolically and ritually repeats and re-actualizes the cosmogony. As historic patterns, filmmakers converse in history with filmmaking predecessors, traditional industry practices, and present collaborators. Through their various roles as fans, critics, and memorialists, filmmakers renovate and commemorate film history, offering creativity theory criteria by which novelty is evaluated. As symbolic patterns, MOD discourse spotlights the metaphors filmmakers use to create collaborative environments and to characterize directors 2 ̆ 7 performances. Together these metaphors create a guiding and habitable ideology for production work that improves upon 2 ̆ 2 vision 2 ̆ 2 as one guiding metaphor for creativity. This analysis enriches theoretical accounts of creativity by approaching collaborative creativity obliquely, as space-off, and rhetorically, as inducements to success stories in organizations. Taking communication as central to collaborative creativity, this study offers three <b>counter-statements</b> to traditional conceptions of creativity: creativity is shared, not possessed; collaborative creativity emerges within human drama; and collaborative creativity lives and finds its meaning in performance...|$|R

I shall first give Sansovino's, which is the popular one, and then note the points of importance in the <b>counter-statements.</b> Sansovino says {{that the success of}} the pursuit of the pirates was owing to the ready help and hard fighting of the men of the district of Sta. Maria Formosa, for the most part trunkmakers; and that they, having been presented after the victory to the Doge and the Senate, were told to ask some favor for their reward. [...] "The good men then said that they desired the Prince, with his wife and the Signory, to visit every year the church of their district, on the day of its feast. And the Prince asking them, 'Suppose it should rain?' they answered, 'We will give you hats to cover you; and if you are thirsty, we will give you to drink.' Whence is it that the Vicar, {{in the name of the}} people, presents to the Doge, on his visit, two flasks of malvoisie[34] and two oranges; and presents to him two gilded hats, bearing the arms of the Pope, of the Prince, and of the Vicar. And thus was instituted the Feast of the Maries, which was called noble and famous because the people from all round came together to behold it. And it was celebrated in this manner:...." [...] The account which follows is somewhat prolix; but its substance is, briefly, that twelve maidens were elected, two for each division of the city; and that it was decided by lot which contrade, or quarters of the town, should provide them with dresses. This was done at enormous expense, one contrada contending with another, and even the jewels of the treasury of St. Mark being lent for the occasion to the [...] "Maries," [...] as the twelve damsels were called. They, being thus dressed with gold, and silver, and jewels, went in their galley to St. Mark's for the Doge, who joined them with the Signory, and went first to San Pietro di Castello to hear mass on St. Mark's day, the 31st of January, and to Santa Maria Formosa on the 2nd of February, the intermediate day being spent in passing in procession through the streets of the city; [...] "and sometimes there arose quarrels about the places they should pass through, for every one wanted them to pass by his house." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{narrative}} style doesn't {{keep the}} audience at distance, {{so that it can}} reflect on the things that happened, but rather lets them experience the occurrences; so the plot is narrated linearly. Similar experiences of various characters, for instance, scenes in which students tell their parents about their day at school, are realized as cross-cutting and thus demonstrate the range of different perceptions of the day. The film is narrated {{from the perspective of a}} third person, although particular scenes provide individual characters' subjective points of view. An example for this is the scene in which Karo is in the schoolhouse at night, or the scene at the end when Wenger is arrested by the police and driven away. While on the one hand Wenger is filmed in low angle shot and sings rock music in the opening sequence, on the other hand he seems depressed in this last scene. [...] "Slow motion shots reflect his tormenting self-reproaches." [...] The change to the subjective view of the thoughtful character corresponds to the dramatic composition throughout the film. This change is meant to initiate reflections on the part of the audience.

The UN Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, adopted on the 18 th of December 2008, marked a milestone in UN history, formally placing the concerns of sexual and gender minorities on the General Assembly’s human rights agenda for the first time. However, immediately following the Declaration, a <b>counter-statement</b> was issued by 57 member states, opposing {{the mere mention of}} the “so-called notions of sexual orientation and gender identity”. The Declaration and <b>counter-statement</b> bring to the fore an issue which has long been a concern of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual and intersex (LGBTI) rights movement – the capacity of international human rights law to uphold the rights of sexual and gender minorities. Human rights violations based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity remain prevalent in virtually every country and as awareness of these violations has grown, sexual orientation and gender identity have been increasingly promoted by human rights advocates. Such arguments have often been grounded in the emerging paradigm of sexual and gender rights, but the idea of sexual and gender rights remains highly contested and deeply controversial. Many analysts have questioned whether the United Nations framework is an appropriate mechanism for advancing the concerns of sexual and gender minorities. This dissertation contributes to this movement by presenting a case for the enshrinement of sexual and gender rights in UN human rights law...|$|E
40|$|What the Spirit Knows: Charles Williams and Kenneth Burke {{examines}} the Arthurian poetry of Charles Williams using a methodology derived from Kenneth Burke. This is {{an experiment in}} literary criticism of a Christian poet using a methodology that is not specifically Christian. Key critical ideas found in Burke are utilized in reading poems from Taliessin Through Logres and Region of the Summer Stars. Burke 2 ̆ 7 s work on form and symbol (primarily from <b>Counter-Statement)</b> is addressed first. Form in an individual poem (using 2 ̆ 2 Taliessin 2 ̆ 7 s Song of the Unicorn) and in an entire cycle is examined. Burke lists several uses for symbol in <b>Counter-Statement,</b> and an example {{of each of these}} from Williams 2 ̆ 7 poetry is described. Burke relates the ideas of substance and scapegoat (with the latter being a special case of the former). Williams also had much to say poetically about substance and the relations of people within Cities, Kingdoms, and other normal social groups. Scapegoating occurs in Burke when a victim is at once identified substantially with a group, yet symbolically cast from the group to bear some punishment that symbolically expiates the sin of the entire group. Williams does not treat the scapegoat as traditionally as he might, chiefly due to his Christian orientation. Burke is perhaps most famous for his introduction of the Pentad: five elements present in motivation within a work. Williams is able to mold the Arthurian myth to his own purposes through his manipulation of the elements of the Pentad. For Burke, rhetoric is largely a question of identification. He also shows that the poet 2 ̆ 7 s identification with his own creation often betrays itself within the text. Since Williams strongly identified himself with Taliessin, several examples of the narrator betraying the beliefs and feelings of the poet are discussed. Burke 2 ̆ 7 s use of the hierarchical dialectic as a form of entelechy is compared to Williams use of dualism within the Christian belief system...|$|E

Most notable among these forms is the Petrarchan sonnet, this "bipartite structure " consisting of an octet and a sestet which, Fuller writes, is convenient for "observation and conclusion, or statement and <b>counter-statement</b> " (p. 2), which is thus, through the very imbalance in the form, a particularly adequate support for a balanced assessment. Not many twentieth-century poets still use the sonnet form to shape their explorations of the world; none I would say does it with such earnest if not desperate intensity as Hill. True, his sonnets, as almost everything he writes, are elaborately second-hand, not in the sense of second-best, but because of an intertextual apparatus which keeps the writer carefully apart from what is written; no reader here can confuse the speaking voice with th...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} Kenneth Burke 2 ̆ 7 s “key” concept for the “new” rhetoric: “identification. ” This concept has attained preeminence in rhetorical theory and criticism because it is the term by which Burke 2 ̆ 7 s “new” rhetoric is to be distinguished from the “old. ” Despite the acknowledged importance of “identification,” however, current understandings have oftentimes conceived of this “key” term through the restricted lens of the “old” rhetoric. Therefore, this study traced the evolution of Burke 2 ̆ 7 s thinking on the subject of identity from his first major work of non-fiction, <b>Counter-Statement</b> (1931) and through the more mature discussion of identification and division culminating in A Rhetoric of Motives (1950) and “Rhetoric—Old and New” (1967), to better understand the expanded role of these concepts in the “new” rhetoric. The central lesson that we can draw from this project is that the “key” term of the “new” rhetoric is not an abstract and unchanging concept. Specifically, Burke 2 ̆ 7 s preoccupation with “health” and “sickness” served as a blueprint for the development of his hyper-critical attitude necessary for the artist as citizen keeping watch over the “health” of his/her interpretations and participation in a “diseased” culture. When applied beyond the context of literature, Burke 2 ̆ 7 s concept of “identification” and “division” provide a prescriptive social vocabulary concerned with the “health” of our interpretations as evidenced in our relationships with others. Thus, the goal of identification and division in the “new” rhetoric cannot be reduced to matters of expediency, but to the proper governance of the self acting in society. ...|$|E
