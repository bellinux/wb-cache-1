The CSDGB system consists of seven main subsystems arranged in series namely Uncaser, Bottle Washer, Electronic Inspection Station, Filling <b>Machine,</b> <b>Crowner,</b> Coding <b>Machine</b> and Case Packer. Considering exponential distribution for probable failures and repairs, mathematical modeling is performed using Markov Approach (MA). The differential equations have been derived {{on the basis of}} probabilistic approach using transition diagram. These equations are solved using normalizing condition and recursive method to drive out the steady state availability expression of the system i. e. system’s performance criterion. The performance optimization of system has been carried out by varying the number of particles and number of generations. It has been observed that the maximum availability of 90. 27 % is achieved at flock size of 55 and 90. 84 % at 300 th generation.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: AuTi alloys with 1. 6 % to 1. 7 % (wt%) Ti provide {{sufficient}} bond strength to veneering ceramics, but {{the strength of}} entire metal-ceramic restorations fabricated from these alloys is not known. However, this information is important to assess the clinical performance of such materials. PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the fracture strength and thermal shock resistance of metal-ceramic crowns with AuTi frameworks produced by milling or casting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Frameworks of the alloy Au- 1. 7 Ti- 0. 1 Ir (wt%) (Esteticor Vision) were produced by milling or casting (test groups). A high-gold alloy (Esteticor Special) {{was used as the}} control. The frameworks were veneered with ceramic (VMK 95). Specimens (n= 7) were loaded until fracture. Loads at failure (N) were recorded and the mean values statistically evaluated using 1 -way analysis of variance and a post hoc Dunnett test (alpha=. 05). To assess the crazing resistance of the veneering ceramic, 6 additional crowns of each group were subjected to a thermal shock test. Fractured surfaces were documented by scanning electron microscopy. Coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials used were measured (n= 2) to assess the thermal compatibility between alloys and ceramic. RESULTS: The mean fracture strength of the <b>crowns</b> with <b>machined</b> AuTi frameworks (1294 +/- 236 N) was significantly lower (P=. 012) than that of the cast AuTi frameworks (1680 +/- 150 N), but statistically not different than the high-gold alloy (1449 +/- 159 N). Bonding failure to the AuTi alloy predominantly occurred at the alloy-oxide interface. For the high-gold alloy, more ceramic residues were observed. In the thermal shock test, crowns with milled AuTi frameworks showed significantly higher thermal shock resistance compared to the other groups. The coefficients of thermal expansion (Esteticor Vision cast: 14. 5 microm/m. K; Esteticor Vision milled: 14. 3 microm/m. K; Esteticor Special cast: 13. 7 microm/m. K) did not correlate with the results of the thermal shock test. CONCLUSION: The in vitro fracture strength of crowns with milled AuTi frameworks is lower than that obtained with cast AuTi frameworks, but comparable to those crowns produced with a high-gold alloy...|$|R
30|$|In {{the piston}} {{manufacturing}} plant, a {{gravity die casting}} process is {{carried out in the}} foundry to make the piston with the help of semiautomatic die machines without external pressures. The resultant pistons are sent for cleaning up the surface of the piston from the risers and runners and later, the strength, hardness, and other foundry defects are evaluated. Then a bunch of pistons is placed in the piston blank for its machining operations after which a fixture seat machine is used. Then, two rough grooves are made on the piston by using a carbide tool tip to fit a pin in them. Subsequently, another hole is drilled on the piston for oil passage and then finishing is given to the rough grooves using a diamond tool. Later, the piston is shaped into an oval to ensure its smooth movement within the cylinder using the carbide tool. In the next process, finish <b>crown</b> and cavity <b>machines</b> are used to put a rough cavity first and then a finish cavity on the piston. Further, valves are made on the piston using the diamond tool followed by a rounding-off operation on the corners of piston. Then, circlip grooves are made on the piston {{in the absence of any}} coolant and air pressure. After that, deburring, cleaning, and surface treatment operations are performed. Final inspections are carried out on the manufactured piston under some operational tests before packing.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Marginal fit {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} in the success of fixed restoration. The aim of this study was to {{evaluate}} the fitness of feldespatic crowns made from additional silicon impression and gypsum cast by CAD/CAM.   Materials and Methods: 10 intact extracted upper premolar teeth were used for this experimental study. After preparation of the mounted teeth with radial shoulder finish line, 2 Vita Mark II feldespatic CAD/CAM <b>machined</b> <b>crowns</b> were fabricated for each tooth (one from scanning the additional silicone impression of the prepared tooth and the other one from the plaster model). Marginal gap of each crown was measured using SEM in two points on the mesial and 2 points on the buccal surface. Data were analyzed using Paired t-test with SPSS version 17 software (P< 0. 05).   Results: The mean of marginal gaps in crowns fabricated from additional silicone and model plaster were (155. 13 ± 37. 11) and (130. 18 ± 12. 35), respectively. However, no significant difference emerged between marginal gaps of the two methods (P= 0. 055). Also, the mean of marginal gaps in crowns fabricated from additional silicone and model plaster was higher in mesial (157. 82 ± 44. 41) compared to buccal (127. 50 ± 24. 26) region (P= 0. 003).   Conclusion: Marginal fit was not significantly differen ce between crown s made of the plaster casts and silicone molds and both methods showed the same results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} surface electromyographic activity (sEMG) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) during semi-squat exercise on vibration platform compared with semi-squat exercise performed on a Smith machine. Twenty-three recreationally active students (15 males and 8 females) were exposed to six different loads in one of both exercise modes: vibration or Smith machine. The subject performed a squat in six experimental conditions; the load differed per experimental condition. For each subject the exercise mode (n = 2) and the different loads per mode (n = 6) were assigned in a random order to check the influence of vibration magnitude (acceleration: m s (2)) as well as weight (kg) on sEMG and RPE. Two-way ANOVA for RPE, lumbar and lower-body sEMG revealed a significant weight main effect (P < 0. 01) and a significant acceleration main effect (P < 0. 01). The results from this study demonstrate that the training stimulus resulting from an isometric semi-squat exercise on a vibration platform (acceleration: from 12 to 89 m s (2)) is similar to the training stimulus of an isometric semi-squat exercise on Smith machine (weight: from 20 to 70 kg) according to lower-body sEMG and RPE. However, the impact of semi-squat on vibration platform exercise for lumbar muscle is relatively small compared with semi-squat on Smith <b>machine.</b> <b>Crown</b> Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|PURPOSE. Marginal fit {{is a very}} {{important}} factor considering the restoration’s long-term success. However, adding porcelain to copings can cause distortion and lead to an inadequate fit which exposes more luting material to the oral environment and causes secondary caries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the marginal fit of 2 different all-ceramic crown systems before and after porcelain veneering. This study was also intended to verify the marginal fit of crowns originated from green machining of partially sintered blocks of zirconia (Lava CAD/CAM system) and that of <b>crowns</b> obtained through <b>machining</b> of fully sintered blocks of zirconia (Digident CAD/CAM system). MATERIALS AND METHODS. 20 crowns were made per each system and the marginal fit was evaluated through a light microscope with image processing (Accura 2000) at 50 points that were randomly selected. Each crown was measured twice: the first measurement was done after obtaining a 0. 5 mm coping and the second measurement was done after porcelain veneering. The means and standard deviations were calculated and statistical inferences among the 2 groups were made using independent t-test and within the same group through paired t-test. RESULTS. The means and standard deviations of the marginal fit were 61. 52 ± 2. 88 μm for the Digident CAD/CAM zirconia ceramic crowns before porcelain veneering and 83. 15 ± 3. 51 μm after porcelain veneering. Lava CAD/CAM zirconia ceramic crowns showed means and standard deviations of 62. 22 ± 1. 78 μm before porcelain veneering and 82. 03 ± 1. 85 μm after porcelain veneering. Both groups showed significant differences when analyzing the marginal gaps before and after porcelain veneering within each group. However, no significant differences were found when comparing the marginal gaps of each group before porcelain veneering and after porcelain veneering as well. CONCLUSION. The 2 all-cerami...|$|R
60|$|That {{all these}} governments of {{confusion}} will drift towards war, with a spacious impulse {{and a final}} vehemence quite out of comparison greater than the warlike impulses of former times, is a remarkable {{but by no means}} inexplicable thing. A tone of public expression, jealous and patriotic to the danger-point, is an unavoidable condition under which democratic governments exist. To be patriotically quarrelsome is imperative upon the party machines that will come to dominate the democratic countries. They will not possess detailed and definite policies and creeds because there are no longer any detailed and definite public opinions, but they will for all that require some ostensible purpose to explain their cohesion, some hold upon the common man that will ensure his appearance in numbers at the polling place sufficient to save the government from the raids of small but determined sects. That hold can be only of one sort. Without moral or religious uniformity, with material interests as involved and confused as a heap of spelicans, there remains only one generality for the politician's purpose, the ampler aspect of a man's egotism, his pride in what he imagines to be his particular kind--his patriotism. In every country amenable to democratic influences there emerges, or will emerge, a party machine, vividly and simply patriotic--and indefinite upon the score of any other possible consideration between man and man. This will hold true, not only of the ostensibly democratic states, but also of such reconstituted modern monarchies as Italy and Germany, for they, too, for all their legal difference, rest also on the grey. The party conflicts of the future will turn very largely on the discovery of the true patriot, on the suspicion that the <b>crown</b> or the <b>machine</b> in possession is in some more or less occult way traitorous, and almost all other matters of contention will be shelved and allowed to stagnate, for fear of breaking the unity of the national mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the back plane after press quenching of case hardened crown wheels of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from ingot cast material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} crown wheels has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the <b>crown</b> wheels, hard <b>machining</b> has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the back plane of the crown wheels. In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the crown wheels. This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the crown wheel type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg originating from ingot cast material. The crown wheel types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. Crown wheels manufactured from ingot cast material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the back plane was measured with the measuring probe FARO after press quenching. The slope of the crown wheels was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the crown wheel. The results confirmed that the crown wheel type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the ingot casting technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of crown wheels and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the cast ingot are the cause of the variations in slope of the back plane of the crown wheel type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} back plane of the crown wheel after press quenching, the chemical composition and the original position of the crown wheel in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the crown wheels. The results of this thesis show that, for the crown wheel type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the ingot casting technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other crown wheel types ingot or continuously cast material can be used...|$|R
