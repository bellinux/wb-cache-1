40|$|Abstract—Social network {{analysis}} {{can be an}} important help for military and <b>criminal</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysis.</b> In real world appli-cations, there is seldom complete knowledge about the network of interest – we only have partial and incomplete information about the nodes and networks present. Community detection in networks is an important area of current research in social {{network analysis}} with many applications. Finding community structures is however a challenging task and despite significant effort no satisfactory method has been found. Here we study the problem of community detection in noisy and uncertain networks with missing and false edges and propose methods for detecting community structures in them. The method is based on sampling from an ensemble of certain networks that are consistent with the available information about the uncertain networks. I...|$|E

In this paper we introduce associative search as a search along the networks of association between objects like people, places, other organizations, products, events, services, and so on. We also propose an associative search model based on the 5 WH associated concepts of a crime, i. e. WHAT (what has happened), WHO (who {{was involved in the}} crime), WHEN (the temporal information of the crime), WHERE (the geo-spatial information of the crime) HOW (the modus-operandi used in committing a crime). We have employed Formal Concept Analysis theory to reveal the associations, highlighting Hot Spots, offender‘s profile and its associated offenders in a criminal activit...|$|E

40|$|<b>Criminal</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Analysis</b> (CIA) faces a {{challenging}} task in handling high-dimensional data {{that needs to}} be investigated with complex analytical processes. State-of-the-art crime analysis tools do not fully support interactive data exploration and fall short of computational transparency in terms of revealing alternative results. In this paper we report our ongoing research into providing the analysts with such a transparent and interactive system for exploring similarities between crime cases. The system implements a computational pipeline together with a visual platform that allows the analysts to interact with each stage of the analysis process and to validate the result. The proposed Visual Analytics (VA) workflow iteratively supports the interpretation of obtained clustering results, the development of alternative models, as well as cluster verification. The visualizations offer a usable way for the analyst to provide feedback to the system and to observe the impact of their interaction...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>criminal</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysis</b> process {{there are}} {{relatively}} well established and understood approaches to explicit externalisation and representation of thought that include theories of argumentation, narrative and hybrid approaches that include both of these. However the focus of this paper is on the little understood area of how to support users in the process of arriving at such representations from an initial starting point where little is given. The work is based on theoretical considerations and some initial studies with end users. In focusing on process we discuss the requirements of fluidity and rigor and how to gain traction in investigations, the processes of thinking involved including abductive, deductive and inductive reasoning, how users may use thematic sorting in early stages of investigation and how tactile reasoning may be used to externalize and facilitate reasoning in a productive way. In the conclusion section we discuss the issues raised in this work and directions for future work...|$|E

To achieve these objectives, algorithms must also be accurate, unbiased and just. In this paper, we examine how European data protection law regulates automated profiling and how this regulation impacts police and intelligence algorithms and algorithmic discrimination. In particular, we assess {{to what extent the}} regulatory frameworks address the challenges of algorithmic transparency and accountability. We argue that while the law regulates both algorithms and their discriminatory effects, the framework is insufficient in addressing the complex interactions that must take place between system developers, users, oversight and profiled individuals to fully guarantee algorithmic transparency and accountability. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In <b>criminal</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysis</b> to {{complement}} the information entailed and to enhance transparency of the operations, it demands logs of the individual processing activities within an automated processing system. Management and tracing of such security sensitive analytical information flow originated from tightly coupled visualizations into visual analytic system for criminal intelligence that triggers huge amount of analytical information on a single click, involves design and development challenges. To lead to a believable story by using scientific methods, reasoning for getting explicit knowledge of series of events, sequences and time surrounding interrelationships with available relevant information by using human perception, cognition, reasoning with database operations and computational methods, an analytic visual judgmental support is obvious for criminal intelligence. Our research outlines the requirements and development challenges of such system as well as proposes a generic way of capturing different complex visual analytical states and processes known as analytic provenance. The proposed technique has been tested into a large heterogeneous event-driven visual analytic modular analyst’s user interface (AUI) of the project VALCRI (Visual Analytics for Sensemaking in Criminal Intelligence) and evaluated by the police intelligence analysts through it’s visual state capturing and retracing interfaces. We have conducted several prototype evaluation sessions with the groups of end-users (police intelligence analysts) and found very positive feedback.

40|$|The {{field of}} social network {{analysis}} has received increasing attention during the past decades and {{has been used to}} tackle a variety of research questions, from prevention of sexually transmitted diseases to humanitarian relief operations. In particular, social network analyses are becoming an important component in studies of criminal networks and in <b>criminal</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>analysis.</b> At the same time, intelligence analyses and assessments have become a vital component of modern approaches in policing, with policy implications for crime prevention, especially in the fight against organized crime. In this study, we have a unique opportunity to examine one specific Swedish street gang with three different datasets. These datasets are the most common information sources in studies of criminal networks: intelligence, surveillance and co-offending data. We use the data sources to build networks, and compare them by computing distance, centrality, and clustering measures. This study shows the complexity factor by which different data sources about the same object of study have a fundamental impact on the results. The same individuals have different importance ranking depending on the dataset and measure. Consequently, the data source plays a vital role in grasping the complexity of the phenomenon under study. Researchers, policy makers, and practitioners should therefore pay greater attention to the biases affecting the sources of the analysis, and be cautious when drawing conclusions based on intelligence assessments and limited network data. This study contributes to strengthening {{social network analysis}} as a reliable tool for understanding and analyzing criminality and criminal networks...|$|E
