50|$|SMPTE 367M, {{also known}} as SMPTE D-11, is the SMPTE {{standard}} for HDCAM. The standard specifies compression of high-definition digital video. D11 source picture rates can be 24, 24/1.001, 25 or 30/1.001 frames per second progressive scan, or 50 or 60/1.001 fields per second interlaced; compression yields output bit rates ranging from 112 to 140 Mbit/s. Each D11 source frame is composed of a luminance channel at 1920 x 1080 pixels and a <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> at 960 x 1080 pixels. During compression, each frame's luminance channel is subsampled at 1440 x 1080, while the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> is subsampled at 480 x 1080.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} problem, luminance {{interference in}} chroma, is {{the appearance of}} a colored noise in image areas with high levels of detail.

50|$|The UV {{representation}} of chrominance was chosen over straight R and B signals because U and V are colour difference signals. In other words the U and V signals tell the television {{to shift the}} colour of a certain pixel without altering its brightness. Or the U and V signels tell the monitor to make one colour brighter {{at the cost of}} the other and by how much it should be shifted. The higher the (or the lower when negative) the U and V values are, the more the saturated (colourful) the pixel gets. The closer the U and V values get to zero, the lesser it shifts the colour meaning that the red, green and blue lights will be more equally bright, producing a greyer pixel. This is the benefit of using colour difference signals, i.e. in stead of telling how much red there is to a colour, but it tells how much it is more red than green or blue. In turn this meant that when the U and V signals would be zero or absent, it would just display a greyscale image. If R and B were to have been used, these would have non-zero values even in a B&W scene, requiring all three data-carrying signals. This was important {{in the early days of}} colour television, because old black and white TV signals had no U and V signals present, meaning the color TV would just display it as B&W TV out of the box. In addition, black and white receivers could take the Y′ signal and ignore the U- and V-colour signals, making Y′UV backward-compatible with all existing black-and-white equipment, input and output. If the colour-TV standard wouldn't have used colour difference signals, it could mean a colour TV would make funny colours out of a B&W broadcast or it would need additional circuitry to translate the B&W signal to colour.It was necessary to assign a narrower bandwidth to the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> because there was no additional bandwidth available. If some of the luminance information arrived via the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> (as it would have if RB signals were used instead of differential UV signals), B&W resolution would have been compromised.|$|E

The hierarchical schema is used for the compression of the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel.</b> Here we are using four predictors. For the prediction we are using the upper, right, left diagonal and right diagonal for the image compression. The arithmetic coding is used for the error signal calculation. This provides better compression of the images on the boundary as compared to the existing system based on the hierarchical prediction.

An edge-based AWB algorithm is performed using initial estimates instead of using a full color image. The AWB gain is obtained by using a predefined achromatic region and initial estimates in the edge region to prevent color failure situations when more than one uniform object existed in the image. In order to improve the performance and the computational complexity, the region is classified into flat, edge, and pattern regions at each pixel. Based on these preclassified region, the color demosaicing process with color constancy is performed {{to reduce the number}} of interpolation errors using the AWB gain and local statistics of the initial estimates.|$|E
30|$|In image {{processing}} in general, a well-known procedure for image enhancement is {{to enhance the}} luminance channel only while keeping the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> unchanged (Gonzalez and Woods 2002). Due to psycho-visual redundancy, human eyes are {{more sensitive to the}} enhancement of brightness than color. There are a several well-known methods available for enhancing the grayscale image, which can be broadly divided into two categories. Techniques such as contrast stretching (CS) (Wang and Bovik 2002), high boost filtering (HBF) (Srivastava et al. 2009) and unsharp masking (UM) (Polesel et al. 2000) work on the local gradient of the image. On the other hand, techniques such as histogram equalization (HE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) (Zuiderveld 1994) and brightness preserving dynamic fuzzy histogram (BPDFHE) (Sheet et al. 2010) work on the global gradient of the image. The global gradient methods are effective for the low contrast images that contain a single object or no apparent contrast change between object and background (Cheng and Shi 2004).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{denoising}} of chrominance channels of color images. We propose a variational framework involving TV reg-ularization that modifies the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> while preserving the input luminance of the image. The main issue of such a problem {{is to ensure that}} the denoised chrominance together with the original luminance belong to the RGB space after color format conversion. Standard methods of the literature simply truncate the converted RGB values, which lead to a change of hue in the denoised image. In order to tackle this issue, a " RGB compatible " chrominance range is defined on each pixel with respect to the input luminance. An algorithm to compute the orthogonal projection onto such a set is then introduced. Next, we propose to extend the CLEAR debiasing technique to avoid the loss of colourfulness produced by TV regularization.

30|$|Step two {{includes}} a luminance enhancement using modified Retinex and chrominance enhancement using enhancement map and histogram rescaling in color space CIELCh. Detailed discussion {{can be found}} in Section 4.2. The proposed NECI method is inspired by a computational model of multi-scale Retinex [12, 13], while an additional logarithm function is applied to mask image (estimation of background using Retinex filter) for local contrast calculation to avoid introducing halo effect or amplifying blocking or ringing effect of the compressed image. For chrominance enhancement, applying Retinex independently to three color channels (RGB) usually results in false colors and hue-shift. In the proposed work, only luminance channel is used for a local contrast calculation, and the enhancement information is used as reference map applying to <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> in color space CIELCh so that a balanced enhancement of chromatic components can be achieved. A histogram rescaling operation is followed for black and white point correction at the end of contrast enhancement, and only 99 % of histogram is used to remove the influence of a few pixels with extreme intensities. The chrominance enhancement and histogram rescaling will be also discussed in Section 4.2.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Human Visual System {{is found}} to be less {{sensitive}} to the highly textured area of the image. Moreover, in all colours the blue is least sensitive to the HVS (Human Visual System). While working on colored images when using the mathematical and biological models of HVS, the preferred colour model must be HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) colour model rather than RGB colour model because it most closely defines how the image is interpreted by HVS. The high visual transparency in the technique is achieved by making use of highly textured block in luminance channel for watermark insertion. Moreover, the choice of selecting appropriate area for watermark insertion is also influenced by making use of ‘Hue ’ property of the image in the <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> to enhance the visual transparency even more. Watermark is made highly robust against different types of attacks by performing the watermark insertion in transformed domain and making use of the transformation functions such as DWT, DCT and SVD. The results demonstrated the robustness of the technique against various types of attacks and comparison through aforesaid results the technique is proven to be more robust against previous techniques making use of HSI colour model.

30|$|However, image {{enhancement}} is not another application of detail retrieval or color constancy. These algorithms cannot be directly applied to this domain {{because most of}} them lead to several dramatic modifications such as light condition changes, color temperature alterations, and additional artifacts introduced or amplified. These techniques work efficiently indeed when serving as tools of extracting image details. However, disregarding light conditions of scene may result in unnaturally sharpened image appearance or dramatic white balance changes which are usually unwanted. Based on our previous work [10], we propose in this paper an algorithm of automatic Natural Enhancement of Color Image (NECI) method. There are four steps to realize this enhancement. At first, the image appearance is rendered by content-dependent global mapping for light cast correction, and then a modified Retinex filter is applied to enhance the local contrast. Histogram rescaling is used afterwards for normalization purpose. At last, the texture details of image are enhanced by emphasizing the high-frequency components of image using multi-channel decomposition of Cortex Transform [11]. In the contrast enhancement step, luminance channel is firstly enhancement, and then a weighing map is calculated by collecting luminance enhancement information and applied to <b>chrominance</b> <b>channel</b> in color space CIELCh which enables a proportional enhancement of chrominance compared with the luminance.
