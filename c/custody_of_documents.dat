5000|$|Michele Morris, an Akron, Ohio, {{employment}} lawyer, believes {{both the}} nexus and totality tests have proved deficient at protecting privacy at work, {{and in so}} doing undermined what the Court sought to accomplish in Mancusi. Instead, she argues, courts should look to the relationships among employees, and between employees and supervisors. [...] "The nexus test ignores the realities of workplace delegation of duties", she writes. It does not consider that the process of work delegation may create several parties with an interest in a document: the person who initiates the project, the person who actually prepares the document, and the person who has <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the <b>document.</b> Consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Mancusi v. DeForte, all parties are likely to have an expectation of privacy that the document will only be shared with those within the workplace who are entitled to access. The totality test also, in her opinion, fails because while it considers, as the nexus test does not, an employee's efforts to exclude others from a space instead of their ability or authority to do so. [...] "An employee's right to exclude {{is a direct result of}} the employment relationship, whereas efforts to exclude may not be." [...] If this mistaken emphasis continued, she fears, private-sector workers will be under the same reasonable-suspicion standard the Court put public employees under in O'Connor.|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} {{evidence}} in criminal proceedings are digital {{and an increasing}} amount of evidence is being gathered during crime investigation in Norway. The prosecuting authority’s obligation to present information about criminal cases {{in the best way}} possible leads to the presentation of large amounts of evidence. Then the judges must decide whether the evidence is going to be used. In Norwegian criminal jurisdiction both law and law practice are having troubles in keeping up with the speed of technological development, and today there are no guide lines as to the handling of digital forensic data. The technology is evolving so quickly that the lawyers and judges are having difficulties in keeping up to date with the latest developments and as a consequence often lack the technical competence they need. Digital evidence and how this type of evidence is being handled is the focus of this master’s thesis. It gives an introduction to Norwegian criminal law and jurisdiction. The three phases of digital forensics are then laid out from a technological point of view. The chain <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>documents</b> used as evidence is explained. In addition, the thesis offers a look at relevant research in Norway, Europe and the USA. To meet the legal requirements, a digital document used as evidence must be valid. The thesis raises the question as to whether metadata is able to ensure this validity. Metadata is information about a document’s properties. If metadata is to be used to determine the validity <b>of</b> a <b>document,</b> the information has to be correct, true and non-manipulated. The thesis aims {{to find out exactly what}} kind of metadata is being generated when a digital document is created, whether metadata can be manipulated, and if so, how and by whom. The research shows that several metadata is generated. It is possible to manipulate and generate new metadata after the initial creation <b>of</b> a <b>document.</b> Several actors are able to manipulate – both software and personal actors. To claim that metadata is capable of ensuring the validity <b>of</b> a <b>document</b> – e. g. that timestamps are trustworthy information or that an expert witness can detect manipulation, is not correct. The thesis concludes that metadata can not ensure the validity <b>of</b> digital <b>document</b> evidence because it is possible to manipulate this information...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{experiences}} with food safety issues {{combined with a}} growing demand for high-quality food and feed products have increased interest in systems to aid in food traceability efforts. Implementation of a traceability system in the bulk grain supply chain is a complex task. Food safety concerns are increasing in the United States as bulk commodities are commingled for domestic and export purposes without traceability systems and quality management controls. Recent food safety events [...] aflatoxin in grains, salmonella in spinach and tomatoes, and melamine in feed and food [...] caused illness or death in humans and animals.

50|$|<b>Custody</b> <b>of</b> Infants Act of 1839 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The {{bill was}} greatly {{influenced}} by the reformist opinions of Caroline Norton. Norton had a failed marriage with her husband. Her pamphlets arguing for the natural right of mothers to have <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> their children won much sympathy among parliamentarians. The need for the reform in the <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> children area had already {{been the subject of}} parliamentary actions before 1839. However, because of Norton's intense campaigning, Parliament passed the <b>Custody</b> <b>of</b> Infants Act 1839 and included there many of her reformist ideas. This changed dramatically the way that <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the children after divorce was granted. If previously in the majority of the cases the child custody was awarded to the father, the <b>Custody</b> <b>of</b> Infants Act of 1839 permitted a mother to petition the courts for <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> her children up to the age of seven, and for access in respect of older children. This was the starting point of a new doctrine in the area <b>of</b> child <b>custody,</b> called Tender years doctrine. Nowadays the child or children are awarded to the best fit Parent.|$|R
