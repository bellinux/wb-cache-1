This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] in-situ extraction of bitumen from oil sands, particularly steam assisted gravity drainage, has been the fastest growing production technology in the industry. Integrated with upgrading operations to enhance the fuel quality, the process consumes significant amounts of energy, which are currently mostly derived from burning natural gas. On the other hand, considerable amounts of petroleum coke residues are generated in the refineries. This petcoke ends up stockpiled as a waste byproduct with associated environmental concerns. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the feasibility of integrating a petroleum <b>coke</b> <b>residue</b> gasification plant to the energy infrastructure of an integrated SAGD/upgrading facility.

Two plant configurations are compared, one without and one with CO 2 capture and storage. The gasification-based polygeneration plant is modeled with the Aspen Plus flowsheeting software. Two levels of energy demands (i. e. high and low energy scenarios), reflecting the range of variability in the energy requirements of extraction and upgrading operations (e. g. steam to oil ratio), are considered. The net efficiency for polygeneration plant was determined to be in the range of 48 – 58 %.

40|$|The Leidenfrost effect {{influences}} substantially {{the contact}} of a liquid droplet {{with a hot}} surface. Contact between the liquid and solid is crucial for cooling applications such as fire-fighting, hot-mill steel rolling, thermal power plants and microprocessor cooling. In automotive or aerospace internal combustion engines, the combustion chamber is pressurized prior to ignition. Despite various effects of elevated pressure, the combustion process needs to be controlled. The reaction time in a combustion chamber is limited, but mixture preparation involves prior evaporation. Fuel in contact with a combustion chamber wall evaporates in a uncontrolled manner. Furthermore, the fuel reacts with lubricants and decomposes into <b>coke</b> <b>residue.</b> The fundamental physics of the Leidenfrost effect are yet to be fully understood. This applies especially {{to the influence of}} pressure on the Leidenfrost effect. For the question, if injected water droplets would stay in contact with the heated combustion chamber wall, current models would need to be extrapolated from ambient pressure, although there is no validation experiment available. This experimental study addresses the influence of elevated pressure on the Leidenfrost effect, providing observations and measurements suitable to validate theories, hence extending the knowledge about the Leidenfrost effect. The experiment is implemented inside a pressure chamber and results for single water droplets impinging onto a hot aluminium substrate are presented. The droplet impingement Weber number was 5. The experiments were conducted at chamber pressures from 1 to 25 bar (0. 1 to 2. 5 MPa) and wall temperatures from 100 to 460 °C (373 to 733 K). Based on video observations, phenomenological boiling states are identified and mapped on a pressure-temperature diagram. The various states of impact behaviour shift to higher temperatures with increasing pressure. Nucleate boiling and critical temperature models of the bulk liquid serve as the lower and the upper bounds for the transition for all observed states of droplets, respectively. A new nucleation model, accounting for the fluid flow inside the impacting droplet, agrees reasonably well with experimental results for the nucleate boiling in the experiment. All previous theories and correlations predict transition temperatures which are constant or deviate from experimental values at elevated pressures. Therefore, the theoretical part of this study tests refined hypotheses for transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling. A Landau instability model and a bubble percolation model propose explanations for transitions in the boiling phenomena, but these models deviate from experimental results. Refinement of these approaches is still needed with respect to the characteristic length of instability and the active nucleation site count. The experimentally observed onset of the transition state exhibits a linearity between the reduced pressure value and the reduced contact overheat. The boiling states are further quantified with the measurement of the residence time upon the target. In the wetting state at ambient pressure, the residence time is equal to the evaporation time of the droplets. Residence time is lower for the transition and the Leidenfrost rebound states. The droplet detaches from the surface prior to complete evaporation. Residence time thresholds mark the observed transition state. Asymptotic rebound time marks the rebound state. The time thresholds follow the state borders in the pressure-temperature map. Secondary droplets are detected with the shadowgraph technique. Characterization of the secondary droplets has been achieved using a new image processing algorithm. It is based on the irradiance model of a semi infinite screen. The Sauter mean diameter of the secondary droplets in transition boiling state increases with increasing pressure. An increasing trend of the Sauter mean diameter of secondary droplets to the bubble departure diameter was observed...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and kinetic {{modeling}} {{studies were}} carried out on the conversion a wood-oil obtained from high pressure liquefaction of aspen poplar wood to liquid hydrocarbon fuels and useful chemicals in a fixed bed micro-reactor using HZSM- 5 catalyst. Similar experiments were conducted using silicalite, H-mordenite, H-Y and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Preliminary vacuum distillation studies showed that the wood-oil was made up of volatile and non-volatile fractions. A maximum yield of 62 wt% volatiles at 200 °C, 172 Pa was obtained. The volatile fraction consisted of over 80 compounds. These compounds were comprised of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, furans, phenols and some hydrocarbons. The characteristics of the oil showed that it was unstable with time, i. e., its physical properties and chemical composition changed with time probably due to the reaction of free radicals or the oxidative coupling of some of the wood-oil components. However, when the oil was mixed with tetralin, the stability improved. Upgrading studies were first conducted over inert berl saddles in the presence and absence of steam (i. e. non-catalytic treatment/blank runs). Yields of hydrocarbons were between 16 and 25 wt% of the wood-oil. High residue fractions of between 32 to 56 wt% were obtained after processing. Some portions of wood-oil formed a carbonaceous material (char or coke) when exposed to the experimental temperatures. The chars (coke) fraction increased with temperature from 4. 7 to 12. 5 wt% when processing with steam and 8. 0 to 20. 4 wt% when processing without steam. Catalytic upgrading studies were first carried out using HZSM- 5 catalyst in the presence and absence of steam. The results showed that approximately 40 to 65 wt% of the oil could be converted to a hydrocarbon-rich product (i. e. desired organic liquid product (distillate). This contained about 45 to 70 wt% hydrocarbons with selectivities ranging between 0. 47 to 0. 88. This fraction was highly aromatic in nature and consisted mainly of benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX compounds) and other alkylated benzenes within the gasoline boiling point range. The yield and selectivities were strong functions of the process time and temperature. A comparison between the two processes, i. e. upgrading in the presence and absence of steam, showed that about 30 to 45 % reduction in coke formation and 5 to 18 wt% increase in organic distillate could be achieved when processing in the presence of steam. These changes were probably due to changes in the rates of cracking, deoxygenation, aromatization and polymerization reactions resulting from the competitive adsorption processes between steam and wood-oil molecules in addition to changes in contact time of molecules. However, the selectivity for hyqrocarbons decreased in the presence of steam. Yields of organic distillate fractions of between 72 to 93 wt% and hydrocarbon yields and selectivities of 44 to 51 wt% and 0. 93 to 1. 13, respectively, were obtained when wood-oil volatile fraction was upgraded over HZSM- 5 after separation from the non-volatile fraction by vacuum distillation. The spent HZSM- 5 catalyst could be easily regenerated and reused with little change in its performance. The yields and selectivities for hydrocarbons when upgrading with the other catalysts were between 9 and 22 wt%, and 0. 12 and 0. 29, respectively for silicalite, 16 and 28 wt%, and 0. 22 and 0. 28, respectively for H-mordenite, 15. 5 and 21 wt%, and 0. 17 and 0. 21, respectively for H-Y and S. 5 and 26. 2, and 0. 13 and 0. 36, resrectively for silica-alumina. Compared to HZSM- 5 (yield between 34 and 43 wt%, selectivity of 0. 66 to O. SS) these yields and selectivities were much lower. These experiments also showed that the pore size, acidity and shape selectivity of the catalyst influenced the distribution of hydrocarbons in terms of the carbon number. The yield and selectivity of H-mordenite and H-Y (large pore zeolites) were mostly for kerosene range hydrocarbons (C 9 to C 15) and for silicalite and HZSM- 5 (medium pore zeolites) for gasoline range hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon fraction from amorphous silica-alumina did not show any defined distribution. The performance followed the order: HZSM- 5 > H-mordenite> H-Y> Silicalite, Silica-alumina. With the aid of model compound reactions involving acetic acid methyl ester, propanoic acid, 4 -methylcyclohexanol, methylcyclopentanone, 2 -methylcyclopentanone, methoxybenzene, ethoxybenzene, phenol, 2 -methoxy- 4 -(2 -propenyl) phenol, a synthetic and wood-oil volatile, two reaction pathways were proposed to explain the chemical steps through which the final products of upgrading were obtained. Also, reaction pathways were proposed for each chemical group. These experiments showed that the final products were formed probably through cracking, deoxygenation, olefin formation, oligomerization, hydrogen and hydride transfer, cyclization, isomerization, alkylation and polymerization reactions. Rate models were derived based upon the two reaction pathways and the power law rate model. The rates of formation of products followed the general order: Organic distillate> Hydrocarbons> Residue> Coke> Gas >Aqueous Fraction. Estimates of the values of the kinetic parameters showed that the rate constants ranged between 10 - 6 (aqueous fraction) and 1. 81 (volatile fraction), activation energies between 6. 7 - 76. 0 x 10 3 KJ/Kmol and reaction orders from 0. 7 (gas formation) to 2. 5 (residue formation). Two mathematical models were derived based on the integral reactor design equation and on the two reaction pathways. This was used to estimate the yield of products. The models predicted the experimental results fairly accurately. Model discrimination showed that the model based on coke and residue formation from both volatile and non­-volatile fractions of the wood-oil best predicted the experimental results. Hydrocarbon selectivity relations which were based on <b>coke,</b> <b>residue</b> and combined coke and residue as undesired products were also derived. Application of these relations showed that lower temperatures and concentrations were most appropriate for higher hydrocarbon selectivity. However, this was at the expense of higher conversions...|$|E

Butyric acid is an important industrial chemical, which can be further converted into a number of commercial compounds e. g. acetate butyrate, butyl acetate and butanol. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that has vast applications in the field of pharmaceutical and food industry. In addition, arginine can replace inorganic nitrogen as nitrogen source in fertilizers. It can be produced via fermentation of sugars using engineered microorganism like E. Coli, but like butanol its concentration is restricted to approximately 12 g/L. Due to low concentration of these useful chemicals in the resulting fermentation broths recovery of these chemicals remain challenging with today’s options and therefore  novel recovery process should be developed. In this study, zeolite adsorbents were used to recover butanol, butyric acid and arginine from model and real fermentation broths. Zeolite MFI adsorbent efficiently adsorbed butanol from model solutions with a saturation loading of 0. 11 g/g- zeolite. On the other hand, adsorption of butyric acid was found to be strongly pH dependent, with high adsorption below and little adsorption above the pKa value of the acid. A structured adsorbent in the form of steel monolith coated with a silicalite- 1 film was also used and performance was evaluated by performing breakthrough experiments at room temperature using model ABE fermentation broths and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional adsorbent sin the form of beads. Desorption studies showed that a high quality butanol product with purity up to 95. 2 % for butanol-water system and 88. 5 % for the ABE system can be recovered with the structured silicalite- 1 adsorbent. Further, zeolite X adsorbents in the form of powder and extrudates was used to recover arginine from a real fermentation broth and also from aqueous model solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time recovery of arginine from real fermentation broths using any type of adsorbent is reported. Arginine loading of 0. 15 g/g was observed at pH 11 using zeolite X powder. The selectivity for arginine over ammonia and alanine from the fermentation broth at pH 11 was 1. 9 and 8. 3, respectively, for powder and 1. 0 and 4. 1, respectively, for extrudates. Synthesis gas (CO + H 2) can be produced e. g. by gasification of lignocellulose biomass. This synthesis gas can be used to produce methanol, which subsequently may be converted into gasoline using zeolite ZSM- 5 catalyst. However, during Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) process, undesirable carbon <b>residue</b> (<b>coke)</b> is formed that gradually reduces the activity of catalyst. It was hypothesized that intracrystalline defects in the zeolite formed during conventional synthesis may accelerate the deactivation rate by coke formation. In this work, a novel ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst essentially free of intracrystalline defects was synthesized and evaluated in the  MTG reaction,. The novel catalyst showed significantly higher resistance towards deactivation by coke formation as compared to a reference catalyst containing defects. ...|$|R
