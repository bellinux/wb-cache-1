5000|$|In any case, the periwigged investors had {{in certain}} respects no choice when they shifted to {{acceptance}} credit and <b>commission</b> <b>trade,</b> for instance. This {{can be seen}} as a rational [...] "second best" [...] strategy when British, French and Spanish protectionism closed markets to the Dutch, and they lacked the military means to force retraction of protectionist measures (as they had often been able to do in the 17th century). Also, apart from protectionism, the old comparative advantage in trade simply disappeared when foreign competitors imitated the technological innovations that had given the Dutch a competitive advantage in shipping and industry, and it turned into a disadvantage when the Dutch real-wage level remained stubbornly high after the break in the upward secular trend in price levels after 1670.|$|E

Reforming trade agreements was a top priority. In 1922, acting on the Commission's weighty report, >i>Reciprocity and Commercial Treaties>/i> (1919), the State Department initiated a trade-agreements policy centered on the unconditional form of the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. But after observing the program for a decade, Taussig urged that "the whole present policy should be scrapped. " This essay examines the evolution of U.

5000|$|The {{original}} “green guides” {{were created}} by the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission.</b> The Federal <b>Trade</b> Commission’s slogan is “protecting America’s consumers,” so naturally they created these “green guides” to “to help marketers avoid making environmental claims that are unfair or deceptive under Section 5 of the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> Act”. [...] In order to guide consumers away from dishonest environmental claims the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> issued two brochures called “Eco-Speak: A User’s Guide to the Language of Recycling” and “Sorting out ‘Green’ Advertising Claims”. Not only does the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> guide the consumer, but it also issues a brochure for businesses called “Complying With the Environmental Marketing Guides”. This guide provides businesses with the complete guides and a review of green marketing claims. The Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> issued their first guide in 1992 and since then has updated them in 1996 and 1998. Most recently the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> has proposed a revision of their guides in October 2010. Due to the proliferation of products claiming to be green in the marketplace {{in recent years the}} Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> began this third revision process early as the Commission held several workshop meetings open to the public to discuss green marketing issues. These workshops covered carbon offsets, “green” product packaging, building products and textiles claiming to be green. Through this review process the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> is able to gain feedback from the public as well as perform a cost-benefit analysis, determine the efficacy of their guides, and decide whether to maintain, modify, or discard the current set of guides and rules.|$|R
