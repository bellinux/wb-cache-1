5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The <b>crystallographic</b> <b>structure</b> and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E

5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and <b>crystallographic</b> <b>structure</b> perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recently, 6 <b>crystallographic</b> <b>structures</b> of the {{pharmacologically}} important human serotonin {{transporter protein}} (5 -HTT) were reported.

Materials & methods: The membrane helical segments of 5 -HTT were identified using a KD-hydropathy plot. The classification of membrane helical residues into 4 groups (Lipid-facing, Lumen-facing, Right and Left) was done using a novel method considering residue positions.

This {{movement}} of the reactive site loop can also be induced without cleavage, with the resulting <b>crystallographic</b> <b>structure</b> being identical to that of the physiologically latent conformation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). For this reason the conformation of antithrombin in which the reactive site loop is incorporated uncleaved into {{the main body of the}} protein is referred to as latent antithrombin. In contrast to PAI-1 the transition for antithrombin from a normal or native conformation to a latent conformation is irreversible.|$|E
2500|$|The early black-and {{white vector}} {{displays}} could somewhat distinguish for example a molecular structure from its surrounding electron density map for <b>crystallographic</b> <b>structure</b> solution work by drawing the molecule {{brighter than the}} map. [...] Color display makes them easier to tell apart. [...] During the 1970s two-color stroke-writing Penetron tubes were available, but not used in molecular computer graphics systems. [...] In about 1980 Evans & Sutherland made the first practical full-color vector displays for molecular graphics, typically attached to an E PS-2 or MPS (MPS or Multi-Picture-System refers to several displays using a common graphics processor rack) graphics processor. [...] This early color display (the CSM or Color-Shadow-Mask) was expensive (around $50,000), because it was originally engineered to withstand the shaking of a flight-simulator motion base and because the vector scan was driven by a pair (X,Y) of 1Kw amplifiers. These systems required frequent maintenance and the wise user signed a flat rate Service Contract with E The newer E PS-300 series graphics processors used less expensive color displays with raster scan technology and the entire system could be purchased {{for less than the}} older CSM display alone.|$|E
