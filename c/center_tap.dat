25|$|The New Haven's {{traction}} power system was originally constructed {{to operate at}} 11 kV, 25Hz, using power supplied by the Cos Cob Power Station. The power station was shut down around 1986 and Metro-North converted the {{traction power}} system to 60Hz operation. Traction power is converted from utility-supplied 115 kV (single phase) to 27 kV (single phase with <b>center</b> <b>tap),</b> which is distributed using an auto-transformer system. Power is supplied to the catenary at 12.5 kV, 60Hz.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to simulate the sense antenna by tapping a feed off the loop {{it would have been}} associated with. This is normally accomplished by placing a <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> in the tuning inductor, and then feeding that signal into the circuit as if it were from another antenna. Since the center-tap causes the signal from both vertical sections to be balanced, it creates a signal similar to a single vertical mast. When used with aperiodic windings, the sense circuit has to be wired into the receiver side, along with the tuning capacitor.|$|E
25|$|A full-wave bridge {{rectifier}} converts {{the whole of}} the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output. Mathematically, this corresponds to the absolute value function. Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped transformer, or four diodes in a bridge configuration and any AC source (including a transformer without <b>center</b> <b>tap),</b> are needed. Single semiconductor diodes, double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.|$|E
40|$|In {{the mid to}} late sixties, Dr. Neville Mapham worked {{extensively}} as {{an application}} engineer in the Semiconductor Products Department of the General Electric Company, where he specialized in inverters and the high frequency operation of silicon controlled rectifiers. His success in the power electronics field produced three equivalent parallel output resonant converter configurations, the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> supply, the bridge, and the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> load. To further expand on Dr. Mapham's work, this thesis simulates, analyzes, and designs the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> supply and bridge topologies. Simulation of both configurations is conducted utilizing PSpice software. In addition, the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> supply converter is constructed and studied in the Power Systems Laboratory. For design purposes, a specific listing of hardware components is given. Series connection through a transformer of the Mapham bridge is investigated and implementation issues are addressed. U. S.

50|$|Volts <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> (VCT) {{describes}} the voltage output of a <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> transformer. For example: A 24 VCT transformer will measure 24 VAC across the outer two taps (winding as a whole), and 12 VAC from each outer tap to the center-tap (half winding). These two 12 VAC supplies are 180 degrees {{out of phase}} with each other, thus {{making it easy to}} derive positive and negative 12 volt DC power supplies from them.|$|R
2500|$|If the AC {{supply is}} fed via a {{transformer}} with a <b>center</b> <b>tap,</b> a rectifier circuit with improved harmonic performance can be obtained.

2500|$|The {{desire to}} power {{electronic}} equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty {{with respect to}} the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a power transformer introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60Hz) hum into audio stages. The invention of the [...] "equipotential cathode" [...] reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded <b>center</b> <b>tap.</b>|$|E

The second method uses the same <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> transformer topology at the microphone body, but at the microphone preamp, a matched pair of resistors spanning the signal lines in series creates an [...] "artificial center tap".|$|E

50|$|A {{drawback}} of {{the voltage}} mode operation {{is that the}} stress on switch transistors is high during the cross over time, when both the voltage and current are high. This drawback is alleviated by using current mode operation. This is achieved by inserting an inductor in the transformer <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> supply. This inductor drops the <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> voltage down when the dI/dt would be very high in voltage mode. This improved version is called current-fed Royer oscillator in some books.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the two grids are {{connected}} to {{opposite ends of the}} center-tapped secondary of the final IF transformer. The <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> of the secondary is then connected to ground through a parallel-connected resistor and capacitor circuit. This causes the tube to act as a full-wave grid leak detector. In some circuits, the <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> also provides AVC bias voltage to the converter and/or IF amplifier. Some Wunderlichs, like the Wunderlich B, have a diode plate or a second grid that provide AVC bias voltage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason for}} {{providing}} the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field. However, the premises concerned will also require the [...] "normal" [...] North American 120 V supplies, {{two of which}} are derived (180 degrees [...] "out of phase") between the [...] "neutral" [...] and either of the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> phase points.|$|R
5000|$|A {{phantom group}} is {{composed}} of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a phantom circuit. Here the phantom circuit is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself {{and at the same}} time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The [...] "side circuits" [...] within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called [...] "repeating coils". The <b>center</b> <b>taps</b> are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the <b>center</b> <b>taps.</b> This cancels crosstalk from the phantom circuit to the side circuits. Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires. Phantoming declined with the adoption of carrier systems.|$|R

5000|$|In North America, a {{high-leg}} delta {{supply is}} sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> is grounded and connected as a neutral {{as shown in}} the second diagram. This setup produces three different voltages. If the voltage between the <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> (neutral) and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 V (100%), the voltage across any two phases is 240 V (200%), and the neutral to [...] "high leg" [...] voltage is â‰ˆ 208 V (173%).|$|E
50|$|A {{unipolar}} {{stepper motor}} has one winding with <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> per phase. Each section of windings is switched on for each direction of magnetic field. Since in this arrangement a magnetic pole can be reversed without switching {{the direction of}} current, the commutation circuit can be made very simple (e.g., a single transistor) for each winding. Typically, given a phase, the <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> of each winding is made common: giving three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor. Often, these two phase commons are internally joined, so the motor has only five leads.|$|E

The <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> of a transformer is connected to ground, and the equipment is supplied by two line wires each 60 volts to ground (and 120 volts between line conductors). The <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> is not distributed to the equipment and no neutral conductor is used.

Using the program, 2 - and 4 -kilovolt-ampere transformers are designed for frequencies from 200 to 3200 Hz and the efficiency of a basic transistor inverter is estimated...|$|R
50|$|The Foster-Seeley {{discriminator}} is {{a widely}} used FM detector. The detector consists of a special center-tapped transformer feeding two diodes in a full wave DC rectifier circuit. When the input transformer is tuned to the signal frequency, {{the output of the}} discriminator is zero. When there is no deviation of the carrier, both halves of the <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> transformer are balanced. As the FM signal swings in frequency above and below the carrier frequency, the balance between the two halves of the center-tapped secondary is destroyed and there is an output voltage proportional to the frequency deviation.|$|R

50|$|Each station {{contains}} two 115 kV (single phase) to 50 kV (single phase with <b>center</b> <b>tap)</b> transformers {{to convert the}} utility supplied transmission voltage to 50kV traction voltage. Output circuit breakers, and a capacitor based filter network are installed. The filter banks suppress the high frequency (that is anything above 60 Hz) harmonics on the catenary lines generated by locomotives' solid-state traction motor inverters. The filters also provide reactive power support and correct for power factor. Amtrak's 60 Hz electrification distributes power using Â±25 kV from ground via a <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> of the 115/50 kV transformers. This system {{is also known as}} 2 x 25 kV.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two <b>center</b> <b>taps,</b> and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|R

The essence of the design is the production of a pulse-width modulated square wave signal which is obtained by comparing the audio signal with a highly linear triangle wave; the high frequency modulated square wave is then used to drive power MOSFETS which deliver the signal to the load. The amplifier is powered by a <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> transformer in a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit. Enhancement of the amplifier includes the addition of a 10 band per channel graphic equalizer with a range of 32 Hz to 16 kHz...|$|R

50|$|All {{transmission}} lines within the 25 Hz system are two-wire, single-phase, 138 kV. The <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> of each 138 kV/12 kV transformer {{is connected to}} ground, thus the two {{transmission lines}} are tied to Â±69 kV with respect to ground and 138 kV relative to each other.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} the {{single-phase}} load {{is much greater than}} the three-phase load, load balancing will be poor.

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} AC Module is {{typically}} applied to transform DC in AC. As a novel solution, <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> topology is proposed for design of inverter into a Module Integrated Converter (MIC). Main contribution of converter with tapped inductor topology is {{to generate a}} bigger AC voltage to output, depending on the duty cycle and turn ratio of tapped inductor. The topology chose is convenient because is small, simple and cheap. To achieve a sinusoidal signal output the inverter is controlled with Sine Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM). The novel converter proposed and its control system is evaluated {{by means of the}} electronic simulator. The simulation results obtained is appreciated that the proposed converter working in a photovoltaic system increases the voltage gain, increases the efficiency and reduced the harmonic distortion with respect to traditional converters...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{degradation}} of photovoltaic modules was examined. It is {{found that the}} extent of electrochemical damage {{is dependent on the}} integrated leakage current. The PV electrochemical degradation mechanisms in the two polarities are different: (1) degradation rates in the two polarities are of the same order of magnitude; (2) <b>center</b> <b>tapped</b> grounded arrays are a preferred system configuration to minimize electrochemical degradation. The use of thicker pottant layers and polymer substrate films to reduce equilibrium leakage current values is suggested. A metallized substrate layer, if used, should be isolated from the pottant and the frame by polyester layers, and EVA modules appear to be consistent with 30 year life allocation levels for electrochemical damage. Temperature acceleration factors are well behaved and moderately well understood; humidity acceleration factors vary radically with module construction and materials and require additional research...|$|R

In October 2005, CHHS was awarded a $1.484 million grant to run nationwide DHS COOP training program, and CHHS teams have since delivered the course to first responders in location {{as far away as}} California, Alaska, and Guam. In fall 2007, CHHS organized and hosted the first national conference on emergency preparedness for vulnerable populations.
