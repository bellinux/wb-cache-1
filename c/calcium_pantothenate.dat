5000|$|After the {{efficient}} completion of RDX synthesis, John Sheehan {{had the experience}} of applying organic chemistry to real-life problems. Having struggled against pneumonia and mastoiditis in his earlier years, Sheehan was eager to start working on antibiotics. He wrote, [...] "If my doctors had had a course of treatment as effective as that made possible by penicillin, I would probably not have lost that year." [...] In 1941, he accepted a position at Merck & Co. in Rahway, New Jersey. He worked there until 1946 as a senior research chemist under the supervision of Dr. Max Tishler. Sheehan had good results for his work on many projects, including those on <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> streptomycin, and vitamin B6. However, he wanted to pursue the synthesis of penicillin, which was hard in an industrial setting driven by results given that many scientists of his time believed that it was impossible. John Sheehan's work attracted the attention of Arthur C. Cope, who {{was the head of the}} Department of Chemistry at the M.I.T. at the time. He decided to join the M.I.T. faculty as an assistant professor at a salary that was half of what he made at Merck. Within his first few years at M.I.T., John Sheehan was already recognized for his ingenuity in synthetic organic chemistry, especially for his new methods of synthesis of peptides, three new syntheses of β-lactams, first synthesis of the penicillin ring system, and his work on several other natural products.|$|E

40|$|Background and Design: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effects of a}} formula composed of millet extract, wheat germ oil, <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate</b> and L-cystine in women with diffuse alopecia by using Digital Phototrichogram (Trichoscan). Materials and methods: We evaluated female patients who presented to Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Department of Dermatology between January 2008 and November 2008 with the complaint of diffuse hair loss. Digital phototrichogram was performed in the frontal and occipital regions of the patients. Using this method, anagen: telogen ratios were determined. 53 female patients whose ages were between 18 and 50 and who were diagnosed as having telogen effluvium type diffuse alopecia were included in the study. The patients were given a capsule containing 140 mg millet extract, 271 mg wheat germ oil, 2 mg L-cystine and 10 mg <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate</b> three times a day for three months. The criteria for assessing the efficacy of the therapy included number of hair loss per day, hair pull test and digital phototrichogram. Results: The reduction of daily average hair loss after the treatment was statistically significant. Statistically significant difference was found between the pre- and post-treatment results of the hair pull test. Before the treatment, the average anagen ratio was determined to be 69. 0 ± 11. 2 in the frontal region, and 72. 3 ± 9. 4 in the occipital region. After the treatment, the anagen ratio increased to 76. 4 ± 11. 2 in the frontal region and to 79. 9 ± 8. 6 in the occipital region. The increase in the anagen hair rate in the frontal and occipital regions after the treatment was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: As a result, {{it was found that the}} formula composed of millet extract, wheat germ oil, L-cystine and <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate</b> may be effective in the treatment of telogen effluvium.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2001. Micropropagation {{methods are}} often used to {{supplement}} existing clonal programmes for Eucalyptus species. However, genotypic differences among clones require the implementation of clone-specific protocols, an expensive and labour-intensive exercise. Hence, this study aimed at determining high-yielding hybrid-specific rather than clone-specific, micropropagation protocols for E. grandis x nitens (GN), E. grandis x nitens (NH), and E. grandis x urophylla (GU). Different conditions for surface sterilisation, bud-break (3 protocols, 2 media), multiplication (4 media), elongation (2 protocols) and rooting (4 media) were tested. A single successful surface sterilisation approach was possible for all clones of the tested hybrids (0. 0 - 11. 8 % contamination, 0. 0 - 22. 9 % necrosis). It involved rinsing nodal explants in a fungicide mixture (lg/l Benlate, 1 g/ 1 boric acid, 0. 5 ml/ 1 Bravo, Tween 20) for 15 minutes followed by calcium hypochlorite (10 g/l with Tween 20) for three minutes. Results at each culture stage were dependent on genotypes, and results indicated here represent ranges in values among the clones of each hybrid. The highest bud-break values for GN clones (87 - 90 %) and NH clones (17 - 75 %) were achieved on a medium containing MS, 0. 1 mg/ 1 biotin, 0. 1 mg/l <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 0. 04 mg/ 1 NAA, 0. 11 mg/l BAP and 0. 05 mg/ 1 kinetin. In GU clones, bud-break values on this medium (84 - 97 %) {{were not significantly different}} to those achieved directly on a multiplication medium (80 - 91 %) (MS, 0. 1 mg/l biotin, 0. 1 mg/l <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 0. 2 mg/l BAP, 0. 01 mg/ 1 NAA). Shoot multiplication yields for GN clones (4 - 13 shoots/bud) and GU clones (2 - 6 shoots/bud) were achieved on a medium consisting of MS, 0. 1 mg/ 1 biotin, 0. 1 mg/l <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 0. 2 mg/ 1 BAP and 0. 01 mg/l NAA. As genotypic effects were highly significant among NH clones, a single multiplication medium for all clones of this hybrid could not be determined. The best method of elongation for clones of all three hybrids involved culturing shoots on MS, 0. 1 mg/l <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 0. 1 mg/ 1 biotin, 0. 35 mg/ 1 NAA, 0. 1 mg/l kinetin and 0. 1 mg/ 1 IBA, under photoperiod conditions, rather than total darkness, for 6 weeks. This resulted in 82. 3 - 86. 6 % elongation and shoot lengths increasing by 22. 9 - 35. 2 mm for GN clones, 80. 2 - 82. 3 % elongation and an increase in length of 24. 7 - 32. 2 mm for NH clones and 70. 8 - 78. 1 % elongation, and shoot elongation of 21. 6 - 29. 3 mm for GU clones from passage 1 - 2. For all the above stages, media contained 20 / 25 g/l sucrose and 3. 5 g/l Gelrite, and cultures were maintained at 25 °C ± 2 °C day/ 21 °C night with a 16 h light/ 8 h dark photoperiod (PPFD 66 µmol/m 2 /s). In terms of rooting, cultures on different media were initially subjected to a 72 hour period of total darkness at room temperature, then a 16 h light/ 8 h dark photoperiod (PPFD 37 µmol/m 2 /s) at 24 °C day/ 21 °C night for 7 days. This was followed by a 16 h light/ 8 h dark photoperiod (PPFD 66 µmol/m 2 /s) at 25 °C ± 2 °C day/ 21 °C night for 21 days. Tested clones of the three hybrids were all rooted successfully (56 - 93 % rooting in GN clones, 36 - 76 % rooting in NH clones and 46 - 96 % rooting in GU clones) on a medium containing ¼ MS, 0. 1 mg/l biotin, 0. 1 mg/l <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 0. 1 mg/l IBA, 0. 22 g/ 1 CaCI 2. 2 H 20, 0. 185 g/l MgS 04. 7 H 2 O, 15 g/l sucrose and 3. 5 g/ 1 Gelrite. Predicted yields from the established protocol are also presented (168 - 667 plants of E. grandis x nitens (GN), 35 - 854 plants of E. grandis x nitens (NH) and 54 - 349 plants of E. grandis x urophylla from 100 initial nodal explants, depending on the clone).

40|$|The {{group of}} {{chemically}} identified B-vitamins which comprises thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid and pyridoxine, {{has recently been}} augmented by a new member, pantothenic acid. This substance {{has been identified as}} a derivative of $-alanine (1), namely, N- (a-’y-dihydroxy- $,fl-dimethyl-butyryl) -‘-a 1 anine (2); it has since been synthesized (3) and made available in the form of its dextrorotatory calcium salt. Pantothenic acid was first recognized as a growth factor for yeast by R. J. Williams (4), who coined the name pantothenic acid (meaning ubiquitous) because it was found to be present in a great variety of foodstuffs. The vitamin nature of this substance was discovered simultaneously by Jukes (5) and Woolley et a 2. (6), who found that “chick dermatitis, ” an experi-mental deficiency disease, can be cured by the addition of pantothenic acid to the diet. The rAle of pantothenic acid in nutrition of rats has been studied by several investigators (7 - 12). In young rats, lack of pantothenic acid causes failure to grow, impairment of the fur, inflammation of the nose and hemorrhages, particularly into the adrenal cortex. Black rats maintained on diets free from pantothenic acid develop a conspicuous greying of the hair; the depigmentation is prevented or cured by the administration of pantothenic acid (13, 14). Rats which receive pantothenic acid in addition to the other crystalline factors of the B-complex reach maturity and are reproductive (15, 16).

30|$|Leaves from tobacco plants {{grown as}} {{described}} above were cut in 0.5 to 1.0  cm 2 fragments and then were cultured in 20  mL of INFTAB medium (MS salts, 100  mg/L myo inositol, 1  mg/L <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> 1  mg/L nicotinic acid, 1  mg/L pyridoxine, 1  mg/L thiamine, and 0.01  mg/L biotin) with 200 μL of Agrobacterium GV 3101 containing the pCam-PSC-APA construct. After 48  h in the dark at 25  °C, leaf fragments were transferred to solid INFTAB medium containing 1  mg/L benzylaminopurine, 300  mg/L timentin and 5  mg/L phosphinothricin. Shoots were generated after 4 – 5  weeks, isolated and transferred to MS medium with 300  mg/L timentin and 5  mg/L phosphinothricin for root formation. Tobacco plants with roots were transferred to a greenhouse after 3 – 4  weeks for acclimatization. After verifying the genomic integration of the APA by PCR and {{the expression of the}} GUS transgene, the seeds were collected for further analysis.|$|E
40|$|A semiautomated {{method for}} {{microbiological}} vitamin assays is described, which includes separate automated {{systems for the}} preparation of the cultures and for the measurement of turbidity. In the dilution and dosage unit based on the continuous-flow principle, vitamin samples were diluted to two different dose levels at a rate of 40 per hr, mixed with the inoculated test broth, and dispensed into culture tubes. After incubation, racks with culture tubes were placed on the sampler of an automatic turbidimeter. This unit, based on the discrete-sample system, measured the turbidity and printed the extinction values at a rate of 300 per hr. Calculations were computerized and the results, including statistical data, are presented in an easily readable form. The automated method is in routine use for the assays of thiamine, riboflavine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, <b>calcium</b> <b>pantothenate,</b> nicotinic acid, pantothenol, and folic acid. Identical vitamin solutions assayed on different days gave variation coefficients for the various vitamin assays of less than 10 %...|$|E
