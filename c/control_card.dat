40|$|A {{powerful}} enhancement to the DMAP alter capability {{was developed}} and is available on all RPK-supported versions of COSMIC/NASTRAN. This enhancement involves the addition of two alter <b>control</b> <b>cards,</b> called INSERT and DELETE, to the Executive <b>Control</b> Deck. These <b>cards</b> allow for DMAP alters {{to be made by}} referencing DMAP statements by their module names rather than by their statement numbers in the rigid format DMAP sequence. This allows for increased user convenience and flexibility and makes alters more meaningful to the user. In addition, DMAP alter packages employing the alter <b>control</b> <b>cards</b> will be much less susceptible to future changes in rigid format DMAPs than alter packages employing the standard ALTER <b>control</b> <b>cards.</b> The usage of the cards is illustrated by examples...|$|R
