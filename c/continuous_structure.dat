5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter is {{the cavity}} {{created in the}} solar wind by the planet's magnetic field. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction, Jupiter's magnetosphere is {{the largest and most}} powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System, and by volume the largest known <b>continuous</b> <b>structure</b> in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Wider and flatter than the Earth's magnetosphere, Jupiter's is stronger by an order of magnitude, while its magnetic moment is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973.|$|E

Although the complex is one <b>continuous</b> <b>structure,</b> it was built incrementally, Anna terminal was added in 1988 to the pre-existing Kamaraj terminal. The first part to be built was the international terminal which had two aero-bridges followed by the domestic terminal with three aero-bridges. After {{the completion of the}} domestic terminal, the old terminal at Meenambakkam was used exclusively for cargo. Recently the international terminal was extended further south by adding a new block which includes three aero-bridges. At present, the new international block is used for departures while the older building is used for arrivals.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{structures}} one deals with in Computer Science have a discrete and effective character: (finite) graphs, nets, trees in programming and formal languages, algorithms over finite strings or natural numbers, circuits etc [...] . By <b>continuous</b> <b>structures</b> we mean "smooth" spaces, usually of cardinality not less than continuum, where interesting topological or order properties give some information on, say, classes of functions over them. By discussing results from various areas of Mathematical Computer Science, we stress the role of <b>continuous</b> <b>structures</b> as tools for proving results about discrete or even finite structures. In particular we overview results concerning functionals in computability theory, trees in lambda calculus, boolean circuits in complexity theory and relate the finitary/combinatorial nature {{of the problems with}} their continuous solutions. We mostly focus on the methodology, and just hint to the technical aspects of the results presented. 2. 1 Introduction In order [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Fractional {{derivative}} rheological {{models were}} recognised {{to be very}} effective in describing the viscoelastic behaviour of materials, especially of polymers, and when applied to dynamic problems the resulting equations of motion, after a fractional state-space expansion, can still be studied in terms of modal analysis. But the growth in matrix dimensions brought about by this expansion is in general so fast as to make the calculations too cumbersome. In this paper a discretization method for <b>continuous</b> <b>structures</b> is presented, based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method, aimed at reducing the computational effort. The solution of the equation of motion is approximated by a linear combination of shapefunctions selected among the analytical eigenfunctions of standard known structures. The resulting condensed eigen-problem is then expanded in a low dimension fractional statespace. The Fractional Standard Linear Solid is the adopted rheological model, but the same methodology {{could be applied to}} problems involving different fractional derivative linear models. Examples regarding two different <b>continuous</b> <b>structures</b> are proposed and discussed in detail...|$|R

50|$|The Magellanic Stream {{is seen as}} a “long, <b>continuous</b> <b>structure</b> with a {{well-defined}} velocity and column density gradient.” The velocity {{at the tip of the}} Magellanic Stream is hypothesized to be +300 km/s in the Galactic-standard-of-rest (GSR) frame. Stream clouds are thought to have a lower pressure than other HVCs because they reside in an area where the Galactic halo medium is more distant and has a much lower density. FUSE found highly ionized oxygen mixed in with the Magellanic Stream. This suggests that the stream must be embedded in hot gas.|$|E
