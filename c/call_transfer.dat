2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} PC industry, declines in prices along with {{commensurate}} increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities {{to engage in}} upselling. As a result, the company was selling {{a greater proportion of}} inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting [...] "got in the way," [...] aimed to reduce <b>call</b> <b>transfer</b> times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional [...] "bloatware" [...] on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the [...] "Dell Hell" [...] prominent on Internet search engines.|$|E
