A novel event-triggering scheme is proposed, which has some advantages over traditional ones with a <b>continuous</b> <b>detector.</b> Considering {{the effect of}} the transmission delay, a delay system model for the analysis is firstly constructed. Then, based on the model and Lyapunov functional method, criteria for the stability with an H∞ norm bound and criteria for the co-design of both the feedback gain and the trigger parameters are derived.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the diffusion coefficient of a solute in a solid matrix (polymers, gels, adsorbents) is often determined based on batch kinetics experiments performed when a given amount of matrix is put into a stirred cell containing a defined volume of diluting fluid (gas or liquid). There is, however, a strong trend to develop smaller and smaller volume set-ups (due to, for instance, the cost of either the solute or the matrix in biological or pharmaceutical fields). Furthermore, a continuous monitoring of the solute concentration in the release (or exhaustion) medium is obviously attractive and frequently applied, {{in place of a}} sequential manual sampling protocol. This option demands, however, most often a continuous recirculation loop to be implemented on the cell volume, so that a <b>continuous</b> <b>detector</b> (such as spectrophotometric, conductimetric or refractive index) can be used. The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of such a recirculation loop, which may affect significantly the hydrodynamics (fluid residence time distribution) as well as the dynamics (delayed signal) of the experimental kinetics, in order to evaluate the impact on the diffusion coefficient determination. Numerical simulations covering a broad range of situations have been performed, and an experimental validation on a system consisting of alginate hydrogel beads as a model matrix and pullulan molecules (molecular weight ranging between 730 and 880 000) as model solute is reported.

40|$|The {{detector}} is {{the functional}} unit within a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner, serving {{to convert the}} energy of radiation emitted from a patient into positional information, and as such contributes significantly {{to the performance of}} the scanner. Excellent spatial resolution in continuous detectors that are thick has proven difficult to achieve using simple positioning algorithms, leading to research in the field to improve performance. This thesis aims to investigate the effect of modifications to the scintillation light spread within the bulk of the scintillator to improve performance, focusing on the use of laser induced optical barriers (LIOBs) etched within thick continuous crystals, and furthermore aims to translate the effect on detector performance to scanner quantitation in patient studies. ^ The conventional <b>continuous</b> <b>detector</b> is first investigated by analyzing the various components of the detector as well as its limitations. It is seen that the performance of the detector is affected by a number of variables that either cannot be improved or may be improved only at the expense of greater complexity or computing time; these include the photodetector, the positioning algorithm, and Compton scatter in the detector. The performance of the detectors, however, is fundamentally determined by the light spread within the detector, and limited by the depth-dependence of the light spread and poor performance in the entrance region, motivating efforts to modify this aspect of the detector. ^ The feasibility and potential of LIOBs to fine-tune this light spread and improve these limitations is then studied using both experiments and simulations. The behavior of the LIOBs in response to optical light is investigated, and the opacity of the etchings is shown to be dependent on the parameters of the etching procedure. Thick crystals were also etched with LIOBs in their entrance region in a grid pattern in order to improve the resolution in the entrance region. Measurements show an overall improvement in spatial resolution: the resolution in the etched region of the crystals is slightly improved (e. g., ~ 0. 8 mm for a 25 mm thick crystal), though in the unetched region, it is slightly degraded (e. g., ~ 0. 4 mm for a 25 mm thick crystal). While the depth-dependence of the response of the crystal is decreased, the depth-of-interaction (DOI) performance is degraded as well. Simulation studies informed by these measurements show that the properties of the LIOBs strongly affect the performance of the crystal, and ultimately further illustrate that trade-offs in spatial resolution, position sampling, and DOI resolution are inherent in varying the light spread using LIOBs in this manner; these may be used as a guide for future experiments. ^ System Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate the added benefit of improved detector spatial resolution and position sampling to the imaging performance of a whole-body scanner. These simulations compared the performance of scanners composed of conventional pixelated detectors to that of scanners using continuous crystals. Results showed that the improved performance (relative to that of 4 -mm pixelated detectors) of continuous crystals with a 2 -mm resolution, pertinent to both the etched 14 mm thick crystal studied as well as potential designs with the etched 25 mm thick crystal, increased the mean contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) of images by ~ 22 % for 5. 5 mm spheres. ^ Last, a set of experiments aimed to test the correspondence between quantification in phantom and patient images using a lesion embedding methodology, so that any improvements determined using phantom studies may be understood clinically. The results show that the average CRC values for lesions embedded in the lung and liver agree well with those for lesions embedded in the phantom for all lesion sizes. In addition, the relative changes in CRC resulting from application of post-filters on the subject and phantom images are consistent within measurement uncertainty. This study shows that the improvements in CRC resulting from improved spatial resolution, measured using phantom studies in the simulations, are representative of improvements in quantitative accuracy in patient studies. ^ While unmodified thick continuous detectors hold promise for both improved image quality and quantitation in whole-body imaging, excellent performance requires intensive hardware and computational solutions. Laser induced optical barriers offer the ability to modify the light spread within the scintillator to improve the intrinsic performance of the detector: while measurements with crystals etched with relatively transmissive etchings show a slight improvement in resolution, simulations show that the LIOBs may be fine-tuned to result in improved performance using relatively simple positioning algorithms. For systems in which DOI information is less important, and transverse resolution and sensitivity are paramount, etching thick detectors with this design, fine-tuned to the particular thickness of the crystal and application, is an interesting alternative to the standard detector design.

Radon concentrations ranged 53. 4 - 292. 5 BqL(- 1) in the hot spring waters, and 18 - 56 Bqm(- 3) in outdoor air.

Radon concentrations ranged 53. 4 - 292. 5 BqL(- 1) in the hot spring waters, and 18 - 56 Bqm(- 3) in outdoor air. Systematic diurnal variation of radon concentration in the investigated hotel rooms was determined. The rising of radon levels in the rooms was largely attributed to the guests' bathing with hot spring water and the inefficient ventilation. Spring water use in the hotel rooms had radon transfer coefficients from 1. 6 x 10 (- 4) to 5. 0 x 10 (- 3). The results of this study show that hot spring water flow during bath filling is by far the dominant mechanism by which Rn- 222 is released into the air of the hotel rooms...|$|R
40|$|Although superconducting {{nanowire}} single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) {{are well}} studied regarding {{the detection of}} infrared/optical photons and keV-molecules, no studies on continuous X-ray photon counting by thick-film detectors have been reported so far. We fabricated a 100 nm thick niobium X-ray SNSPD (an X-SNSPD), and studied its detection capability of photons with keV-energies in <b>continuous</b> mode. The <b>detector</b> is capable to detect photons even at reduced bias currents of 0. 4 %, which is {{in sharp contrast to}} optical thin-film SNSPDs. No dark counts were recorded in extended measurement periods. Strikingly, the signal amplitude distribution depends significantly on the photon energy spectrum.

40|$|Piling driving {{sound is}} known to impact harbour {{porpoise}} (Phocoena phocoena) distribution, but to date detailed knowledge on the combined spatial and temporal components of this impact over longer time periods remains lacking. From May to September 2016, pile driving was taking place at the Nobelwind wind farm located on the Bligh Bank in Belgium. In this period, porpoise activity was recorded using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) using <b>Continuous</b> Porpoise <b>Detectors</b> (C-PoDs), at various distances from the construction site (1 – > 55 km). In this study, we compared porpoise detections before, during and after pile driving. During piling, porpoise detections decreased at stations located up to 20 km from {{the location of the}} piling event. At larger distances (20 - 55 km), porpoise detections either remained the same or increased slightly during piling events, which may be due to displaced porpoises entering the area. Underwater sound levels were extrapolated for the different locations. Pile driving sound levels at the furthest distance where reductions in porpoise detections were observed were ~ 159 dB re 1 μPa (Lsub>z-p), which is close to the threshold level for major disturbance for harbour porpoise proposed in literature...|$|R
