5|$|After {{years of}} {{planning}} and a year of construction, WhiteWater World {{opened to the public}} on 8 December 2006. The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A$56million. These included The Green Room, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The Rip, The BRO, Temple of Huey, <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Waves, Wiggle Bay, and Pipeline Plunge. Since then, four additional water slides: two called Little Rippers, one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex, have been added.|$|E
5|$|Frank Welker as Abu, Aladdin's kleptomaniac pet monkey with {{a high-pitched}} voice. The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their {{movements}} for Abu's character. In {{the three years}} it took to record the film, Welker did not meet Weinger or Williams. Welker also voices Jasmine's tiger Rajah and the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Wonders. Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu, while Rajah was animated by Aaron Blaise.|$|E
5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the <b>cave</b> <b>of</b> Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which {{in the darkness of the}} night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E

5|$|South African cave {{sites have}} {{also contributed to}} the data {{regarding}} this shift with accurate dating due to deposits of volcanic ash, which have allowed these sites to be dated to between 999 and 49 thousand years ago. The <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Hearths and Montague Cave in South Africa contain evidence of Acheulian technologies, as well as later MSA technologies, however {{there is no evidence of}} crossover in this region.|$|E
5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the authentic site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

5|$|For {{the ancient}} Mediterraneans, saffron {{gathered}} around the Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments. Herodotus and Pliny the Elder, however, rated rival Assyrian and Babylonian saffron from the Fertile Crescent as bestto treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets. Greek saffron from the Corycian <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Mount Parnassus was also of note: the color offered by the Corycian crocus {{is used as a}} benchmark in the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of Martial.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the <b>cave</b> <b>of</b> Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the <b>cave</b> <b>of</b> Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} these may be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one that may well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E
5|$|In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is {{the burial}} {{place of the}} sahaba (companion) of the prophet Muhammad, Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century. Al-Dari {{and his family were}} granted {{trusteeship}} over the Hebron Hills, including Bayt Jibrin, and were assigned as the supervisors of the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> the Patriarchs (Ibrahimi Mosque) in Hebron. His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage. Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam (shrine) for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} {{numbered}} caves, Badami {{is home to}} many other cave monuments and medieval era temples. On {{the other side of}} the lake, near the Bhutanatha temple, is a 7th-8th century Chalukya period <b>cave</b> <b>of</b> small dimensions. Inside, there is a carved statue seated over a sculpted throne with reliefs showing people holding chauris (fans), a Pipal tree, elephants, and lions in an attacking pose. On one side of the statue is a chakra, on the other a conch shell. The statue wears abundant jewelry and a thread over its chest. The face of this statue is damaged and missing its face.|$|E

5|$|The glass {{industry}} in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|WhiteWater World opened {{three weeks}} ahead of {{schedule}} on 8 December 2006 {{after a week of}} previews. The park opened with ten attractions, including The Green Room, The Rip, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The BRO, The Temple of Huey (3 individual slides), Pipeline Plunge, Wiggle Bay and the <b>Cave</b> <b>of</b> Waves. At this time, the park featured many Australian and world firsts: The Rip and Super Tubes Hydrocoaster were both Australian firsts; The BRO was a world first; and The Green Room was Australia's biggest Tornado slide. After six months of operation Macquarie Leisure announced that WhiteWater World attracted 247,360 visitors, producing a revenue of $8.7million and a profit of $4million.|$|E
