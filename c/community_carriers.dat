Former Mayor Gilles de Robien had envisioned {{the creation of a}} tram, but the choice of dedicated bus lanes had been preferred for reasons of cost and attendance. His successor, Mayor , had been considering the development of a [...] in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted {{for the creation of a}} tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north-south [...] was scheduled for 2018/2019. Following the , which were a defeat for most municipal and <b>community</b> <b>carriers</b> of the project, the new mayor of Amiens Brigitte Fouré and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole Alain Gest decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate) and despite a project announcement of trams on tyres (of TVR type). Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network. Indeed, in December of the same year, the Community Council approved funding for a study (the sixth in 20 years) relating to the establishment of a rapid transit [...] (BHNS), which should enter into service in March 2019, and whose vehicles could be electric.|$|E
40|$|The term air {{cabotage}} {{refers to the}} carriage of air traffic between two points within {{the territory of the}} same state. This carriage is generally reserved to the aircraft of the territorial state and is thus inaccessible to foreign carriers. This thesis gives a brief account of the origins of the concept of cabotage in maritime law and of its introduction in the early international air law conventions. The thesis then proceeds to focus on the problem of {{air cabotage}} in the North-American context and particularly on the current bilateral negotiations between the USA and Canada at which cabotage rights in the USA are being sought by Canada. It further projects on the EEC context, where air transport liberalization measures toward the completion of a single integrated market will eventually (perhaps very soon) lead to the availability for <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> of cabotage rights within any EEC Member State. The creation of a "Community cabotage area" where only <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> would be able to carry Community traffic is also analyzed. Finally, the consequences of these developments are examined as far as EEC Member States' obligations under the Chicago Convention and relations with third states are concerned.

30|$|As {{shown in}} the table above, both UK and Germany will benefit {{to a large extent}} from the {{interpretation}} (of Article 3 d) that allowances will be auctioned according to the emissions share of the administered airlines. This could be justified by the fact that both countries administer most large network carriers, particularly those from non-EU countries, and will have to bear a relatively high administrative burden. However, given that air transport markets are widely liberalised and at least for intra-European flights of <b>Community</b> <b>carriers</b> the nationality does not matter any more, such an interpretation seems to be problematic from an equity point of view. Therefore a very thorough interpretation of Article 3 d is highly recommendable.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{developments}} in molecular genetics {{have made it}} possible to identify carriers of the cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation, regardless of family history, before they have an affected child. Using these techniques, population or 'community' carrier screening can offer informed reproductive choice to individuals and couples who would not otherwise know of their risk of having a CF child. AIM: This study set out to assess the views of general practitioners (GPs) on <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening for CF and to consider the factors that influence their willingness to offer it themselves. METHOD: A self-administered questionnaires was sent to all 616 GPs in four areas of North Thames (West) Region. RESULTS: Two-thirds of respondents indicated that identifying carrier couples to offer genetic counselling before conception was a very important benefit of <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening. Two-thirds felt that general practice was the most appropriate place in which to offer it, and similar proportions that the most appropriate times to do so were when a close relative was diagnosed and when seeking family planning. About half wanted to offer <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening themselves; this was related to experience with CF patients and CF carrier testing, and estimates of the numbers of CF carriers in the practice. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable support among GPs for <b>community</b> <b>carrier</b> screening for CF in general practice, particularly in the context of family planning services. Knowledge and experience of CF increase GPs' willingness to offer it themselves...|$|R

This study was performed {{to determine whether the}} pathogenic CA-MRSA isolate in clinical infections was genetically related to the MRSA isolates in <b>community</b> <b>carriers.</b> We prospectively collected a total of 42 CA-MRSA isolates (23 clinical infection isolates and 19 colonization isolates) in a local region of Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests, staphylococcal toxin assays, SCCmec typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and spa (staphylococcal protein A) typing were performed with all isolates. Thirty-four (81 %) of 42 CA-MRSA isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 72 in the MLST analysis. The distribution of STs did not differ significantly between colonization and clinical infection isolates (89. 5 % [17 / 19] vs. 73. 9 % [17 / 23], P = 0. 26). Among the ST 72 -MRSA isolates, spa type t 664 (18, 52. 9 %) and t 324 (8, 23. 5 %) were common in both groups.

40|$|Summary. Stool carrier {{rates of}} Escherichia coli serogroups 4, 6, and 75 were {{determined}} on admission and discharge for 190 patients. Persons {{who were in}} the hospital 3 weeks or longer had an intestinal carrier rate of 46 % com-pared to a rate of 28 % in individuals who had no recent hospital contact. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics increased the susceptibility for acquisition of certain specific serologic groups. This was apparently not re-lated to replacement of sensitive E. coli by drug-resistant forms. Studies were made to determine the environmental source for colonization of hos-pitalized patients and the risk of urinary infection in stool carriers of these strains. A survey of inanimate objects of medical and urological wards dem-onstrated infrequent isolation of 04, 06, and 075, indicating that extraintestinal foci were an unlikely source for hospital-acquired E. coli. Hemagglutination titers with determination of group-specific 0 antibody failed to demonstrate any deficiency in hospitalized patients who became colonized with certain coliforms.

40|$|We first {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the background and characteristics of international air transport agreements. In a second part of the lecture we then look at the efficiency of new horizontal air service agreements (ASAs) signed by the European Union with several countries. These agreements were signed in order to bring existing bilateral ASAs into legal conformity with the 2002 ECJ judgment on “nationality clauses” and to increase competition. Based on OAG data analyses, literature reviews and stakeholder interviews, we find that market access is hardly facilitated and hence traffic hardly stimulated in cases in which bilateral frequency limitations or other restrictions are still in place. Also, horizontal agreements have not resolved day-to-day problems EU carriers face on the operational level in countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia or Ukraine.

40|$|ESBL-producing {{bacteria}} {{are present in}} wildlife and the environment might serve as a resistance reservoir. Wild gulls {{have been described as}} frequent carriers of ESBL-producing E. coli strains with genotypic characteristics similar to strains found in humans. Therefore, potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria between the human population and wildlife need to be further investigated. Occurrence and characterization of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish wild gulls were assessed and compared to isolates from humans, livestock and surface water collected in the same country and similar time-period. Occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is about three times higher in gulls compared to Swedish <b>community</b> <b>carriers</b> (17 % versus 5 %) and the genetic characteristics of the ESBL-producing E. coli population in Swedish wild gulls and Swedish human are similar. ESBL-plasmids IncF- and IncI 1 -type carrying ESBL-genes blaCTX-M- 15 or blaCTX-M- 14 were most common in isolates from both gulls and humans, but there was limited evidence of clonal transmission. Isolates from Swedish surface water harbored similar genetic characteristics, which highlights surface waters as potential dissemination routes between wildlife and the human population. Even in a low-prevalence country such as Sweden, the occurrence of ESBL producing E. coli in wild gulls and the human population appears to be connected and the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is likely a case of environmental pollution...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal protein A (spa) is an {{important}} virulence factor which enables Staphylococcus aureus to evade host immune responses. Genotypes known as "spa-types", based on highly variable Xr region sequences of the spa-gene, are frequently used to classify strains. A weakness of current spa-typing primers is that rearrangements in the IgG-binding region of the gene cause 1 - 2 % of strains to be designated as "non-typeable". RESULTS: We developed an improved primer which enabled sequencing of all strains, containing any type of genetic rearrangement, in a large study among <b>community</b> <b>carriers</b> and hospital inpatients in Oxfordshire, UK (6110 isolates). We identified eight novel spa-gene variants, plus one previously described. Three of these rearrangements would be designated "non-typeable" using current spa-typing methods; they occurred in 1. 8 % (72 / 3905) asymptomatically carried and 0. 6 % (14 / 2205) inpatient S. aureus strains. Some individuals were simultaneously colonized by both formerly non-typeable and typeable strains; previously such patients would {{have been identified as}} carrying only currently typeable strains, underestimating mixed carriage prevalence and diversity. Formerly non-typeable strains were found in more spa-types associated with multilocus sequence type ST 398 (35 %), common among livestock, compared to other groups with any non-typeable strains (1 - 4 %), suggesting particular spa-types may have been under-represented in previous human studies. CONCLUSIONS: This improved method allows us to spa-type previously non-typeable strains with rearrangements in the spa-gene and to resolve cases of mixed colonization with deletions in one or more strains, thus accounting for hidden diversity of S. aureus in both community and hospital environments...|$|E
40|$|A key {{question}} {{that so far}} has received relatively little attention in the germane literature {{is that of the}} changes at various airports {{as a result of the}} EU liberalization policies. That is, presently, most major European airports still benefit from the so-called home-carrier phenomenon where the country's publicly or semi-publicly owned carrier uses the country's main airport as its gateway hub and, consequently, the home-carrier is also the principal user of this airport (in terms of proportion of total aircraft movements, number of passengers transported, connections, slots ownership, etc.). The country's main airport has substantially benefited from these monopoly conditions of airline captivity, strongly determined by the bilateral system of international air transport regulation. Therefore, European major airports were used to operate in essentially different markets, compared to the increasingly competitive markets of their home based carriers. This partly explains relative stability of transport volumes and financial results of European major airports compared to the relatively volatile financial results of most European national airlines. However, the liberalization of European aviation is likely to change this situation. Market access is open now to all <b>community</b> <b>carriers,</b> i. e. carriers with majority ownership and effective control in the hands of EU citizens. Ticket prices are free, governments can only intervene in case of dumping or excessive pricing. A community airline can choose its seat in any of the 15 member states. Licensing procedures are harmonized between member states. In the last few months <b>community</b> <b>carriers</b> have had unrestricted route access within the EU. Most probably this development will be extended to countries inside and outside Europe. Last year the European Commission got the mandate to start negotiations with 10 other European countries. In the meantime the EC has also started negotiations with the USA on so-called soft rights. In the meantime, open skies agreements have been concluded between the USA and most of the EU member states to facilitate strategic alliances between airlines of the states involved. As a result of this on-going liberalization the model of the single 'national' carrier using the national home base as its single hub for the designated third, fourth and sixth freedom operations will stepwise disappear. Within the EU the concept of the national carrier has already been replaced by that of the community carrier. State ownership in more and more European carriers is reduced. On the longer run mergers or even bankruptcy will further undermine the "single national carrier - single national hub" model in Europe. In the meantime, strategic alliances between national carriers in Europe will already reduce the airlines' loyalty to a single airport. Profit maximization and accountability to share holders will supersede the loyalty of these newly emerging alliances, probably looking for the opportunities of a multiple hub network to adequately cover the whole European market. As a consequence, some European airports might see a substantial decline in arriving, departing and transfer traffic, thus in revenues and financial solvency, as well as in their connection to other inter-continental and intra-European destinations. At the same time, other airports might realize a significant increase in traffic as they will be sought after by the profit maximizing airlines as their major gateway hubs. Which will be the losing airports and which will be the winning ones? Can airports anticipate the actions of airlines in deregulated markets and utilize policies which will improve their relative position? If so, what should be these anticipatory policies? These questions become the more urgent, since an increasing number of major European airports will be privatized in the near future. Although increasing airport congestion in Europe will also be reflected in a growing demand pressure for airport slots, this is not a guarantee for a stable transport volume growth of individual airports. The more volatile the market is, the more vulnerable privatized airports become. Therefore, the main issue of this study is the analysis of the opportunities of major European airports to become a central hub as a result of the network choices made by the new European airlines in a completely liberalized market. In a previous study (Berechman and de Wit, 1996), we already explored the potential of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol of becoming the major West-European hub, once European aviation markets are deregulated. A major hindrance of that study was the use of a single hub-and-spoke network. For example that model could not analyze the viability of different combinations of European hubs within a multiple hub network of alternative airline alliances. In this study, we have formulated the model of a multi-hub network where two West-European airports are used for inter-continental and intra-European travel to enable a more realistic analysis of hub choice. Like the previous one also this multi-hub model is primarily used to assess the potential ability of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for becoming a major West-European hub. Thus, in particular, the policy tests focus on this airport in a double hub network...|$|E

Despite lower transmission rates for asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> and <b>community</b> sources, these transmission routes have a substantial effect on hospital-onset CDI because of the larger reservoir of hospitalized carriers and persons in the <b>community.</b> Asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> and <b>community</b> sources should be accounted for when designing and evaluating control interventions. 26982504 PMC 480695...|$|R
