25|$|The Walschaerts gear can {{be linked}} to inside or outside {{admission}} valves. This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission valves (slide valves and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the <b>combination</b> <b>lever</b> below the valve stem rather than above.|$|E
5000|$|Deeley {{valve gear}} - fitted to several express {{locomotives}} on the Midland Railway. The <b>combination</b> <b>levers</b> were driven, as normal, from the crossheads. Each expansion link was driven from the crosshead {{on the opposite}} side of the engine.|$|R
25|$|To this end, the H {{class had}} a {{significantly}} different arrangement for its third cylinder. A German Henschel & Son conjugated valve gear mechanism, driven from the <b>combination</b> <b>levers</b> of the Walschaert valve gear for the outside cylinders, was utilised in favour of the Gresley mechanism. The inside cylinder was also positioned further forward of the outside cylinders and drove the leading coupled axle, with the outside cylinders driving the second coupled axle.|$|R
50|$|The early Nautilus {{machines}} were a <b>combination</b> of <b>lever</b> and cable machines. They also had optional, fixed {{elements such as}} a chinning bar. Universal Gym Equipment pioneered the multi-station style of machines.|$|R
25|$|Holcroft’s {{process of}} driving the middle {{cylinder}} {{directly from the}} <b>combination</b> <b>lever</b> contrasted to the approach taken by Sir Nigel Gresley, who used {{an extension of the}} valve spindles on the outside valve gear to operate the middle cylinders of his locomotives. This variant therefore held an advantage over Gresley’s design, as the Holcroft valve gear would be immune to variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the conjugation levers when in heavy use.|$|E
25|$|To {{lay out the}} Walschaerts gear, the {{proportions}} of the <b>combination</b> <b>lever</b> must be chosen. The total movement of the valve rod in mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the valve lap. The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to {{the distance between the}} valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the <b>combination</b> <b>lever)</b> instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E

50|$|The {{auxiliary}} crankshaft drove {{both the}} eccentric rods and the <b>combination</b> <b>levers</b> of the valve gear. The piston valves {{were of the}} outside admission type. The valve heads were connected by a double girder arrangement, each actuated by a vertical rocking shaft located between the two girders and midway between the two heads, with a further connecting link pivoted just behind the valve head nearest the front. A sealed oscillating shaft drove the offset upper rocker arm and link, and the whole assembly worked inside the exhaust space of the steam chest. The advantage of having admission steam working on the outside faces of the valves meant that the volume under maximum pressure was completely sealed at the ends with no glands susceptible to leakage.|$|R

500|$|In the {{following}} months, the two railway companies ran comparative exchange trials {{between the two}} types from which the Great Western emerged triumphant with 4079 Pendennis Castle. The LNER learned valuable lessons from the trials {{which resulted in a}} series of modifications carried out from 1926 on number 4477 Gay Crusader. Changes to the valve gear included increased lap and longer travel, in accordance with Great Western practice; this allowed fuller exploitation of the expansive properties of steam and reduced back pressure from the exhaust, transforming performance and economy; the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that had previously been impossible. There followed a complete redesign of the valve gear, which was applied to 2555 Centenary in 1927, {{with the rest of the}} class being modified in due course. Locomotives with modified valve gear had a slightly raised running plate over the cylinders in order to give room for the longer <b>combination</b> <b>lever</b> necessary for the longer valve travel. Another modification was made in 1927 when number 4480 Enterprise was fitted with a [...] boiler. This was closely followed by two other locomotives which also incorporated variations in the cylinder diameter and superheater size for comparative purposes. This led Gresley to make a radical departure from Churchward practice by increasing the number of large tubes containing superheating elements, hence increasing the superheater surface area in contact with the hot gases, thus raising steam temperature. The presence of the larger superheater could be recognised from the square covers on either side of the smokebox, a feature that the locomotives retained throughout the rest of their existence.|$|E

25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} cassette decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi cassette decks, in contrast to cassette recorders and cassette players, often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers.

Initially all were top loading, usually with cassette on one side, and VU meters and recording level controls on the other side.

2500|$|The {{valve gear}} {{assembly}} originally designed by Holcroft {{for use on}} the N1 class regulated {{the timing of the}} valve events that admitted steam into the cylinder, increasing efficiency whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effects of hammerblow on the track. Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight. This was achieved by using the <b>combination</b> <b>lever</b> assembly that controlled the fore and aft movement of the valve spindle, which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam through the ports.|$|E

50|$|A general action button is used {{to perform}} {{a wide range of}} {{movements}} in Tomb Raider, such as picking up items, pulling switches, firing guns, pushing or pulling blocks, and grabbing onto ledges. Regular items to pick up include ammo, and small and large medi-packs. Game-specific items are keys and artefacts required to complete a stage. Any item that is collected is held onto in Lara's inventory until it is used. The puzzles that the player encounters across each level vary: pulling specific <b>combinations</b> of <b>levers,</b> a course of timed jumps, avoiding a certain trap or collecting several keystones. Throughout each stage, one or more secrets may be located. Discovering these secrets is optional, and when the player has found one a tune plays. The locations of these secrets vary in difficulty to reach. Some are hidden along the roadside in bushes, others require the completion of a hidden course or optional puzzle to be found. The player is usually rewarded with extra items.|$|R

5000|$|The CZ 75 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{high-capacity}} 9mm pistols with a manual safety similar to that of the Browning Hi-Power. This allows the CZ 75 to be carried with the hammer cocked with safety applied and a round chambered, ready for use simply by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition 1. It is somewhat unusual for double-action pistols to have this [...] "cocked and locked" [...] type of safety; most such as the Walther P38 and the Beretta 92F have a <b>combination</b> safety/decocking <b>lever</b> (as do some later versions of the CZ 75). The trade-off of this configuration is that to uncock the hammer for a double-action first shot, the hammer must be dropped manually by pulling the trigger while lowering the hammer with the firer's thumb under control. Once lowered in this manner, a double-action first shot can be achieved in a similar manner to other double-action pistols without actuating any controls. Subsequent shots will be single-action unless the hammer is again manually lowered.|$|R
5000|$|The Manayunk Wall is a steep road in Northwest Philadelphia {{used by the}} Philadelphia International Cycling Championship, in 1985, {{and every}} year subsequently. The road, a <b>combination</b> of <b>Levering</b> Street and Lyceum Avenue, was located by Jerry Casale and David Chauner and named by Chauner. It begins at Main Street and Levering Street in Manayunk, {{proceeds}} on worn cobblestone Cresson Street under the railway, then back on to Levering Street. While most of the Wall is part of Levering Street, it becomes Lyceum Avenue [...] at Tower Street (at N40 01.631 W75 13.313). The steepest section, 17 per cent, starts after a slight left turn at the intersection with Tower Street (N40 01.652 W75 13.277), and ends at Fleming Street (N40 01.726 W75 13.226). It becomes less steep as it crosses Manayunk Avenue and enters Roxborough. It nearly flattens and ends at Pechin Street in Roxborough, where news crews broadcast the race.
