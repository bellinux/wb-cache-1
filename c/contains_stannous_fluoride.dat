5000|$|When Gleem II with {{fluoride}} and [...] "green sparkles" [...] {{was introduced}} within several years, the brand achieved a 9% {{share of the}} toothpaste market. However, this portion declined to around 6% {{with the introduction of}} new competing brands. Gleem's main decline was promotion geared toward its take-over competitor, Crest. The difference between Gleem and Crest is Gleem was strictly a 'toothpaste' and originally contained no fluoride. Fluoride was later introduced into Gleem after Crest was first sold in 1955, as a form of consumer competition. While Gleem remained a toothpaste, Crest advanced into flavored 'pastes,' 'gels,' and so on. Until its discontinuance, the Gleem toothpaste package stated 'CONTAINS NO SUGAR' in bold print. Crest has been known to carry increments of sugar as well as artificial flavoring and coloring, aimed at coaxing young children and preteen enticement to prompt oral hygiene. In 1963, Gleem carried a 17-percent share of the toothpaste market in third place, with an advertising budget at $7.1 million. Gleem continued to become less prevalent when the American Dental Association granted Crest approval for the ADA logo. In addition, Crest <b>contains</b> <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> which has been said to strengthen and protect tooth enamel, calcium and fight gingivitis and bacterial infection, but is often irritant, abrasive and stains, while sodium fluoride (contained in Gleem) is more gentle, does not stain, but requires more application (longer or more brushings) to further prevent bacterial infections and can have little effect with calcium.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the influence of fluoride in certain mouthwashes on the risk of corrosion through galvanic coupling of orthodontic wires and brackets. Two titanium alloy wires, nickel-titanium (NiTi) and copper-nickel-titanium (CuNiTi), and the three most commonly used brackets, titanium (Ti), iron-chromium-nickel (FeCrNi) and cobalt-chromium (CoCr), were tested in a reference solution of FusayamaMeyer artificial saliva and in two commercially available fluoride (250 ppm) mouthwashes, Elmex® and Meridol®. Corrosion resistance was assessed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-MS), analysis of released metal ions, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) study of the metal surfaces after immersion of different wire-bracket pairs in the test solutions. The study was completed by an electrochemical analysis. Meridol® mouthwash, which <b>contains</b> <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride,</b> was the solution in which the NiTi wires coupled with the different brackets showed the highest corrosion risk, while in Elmex® mouthwash, which contains sodium fluoride, the CuNiTi wires presented the highest corrosion risk. Such corrosion has two consequences: deterioration in mechanical performance of the wire-bracket system, which would negatively affect the final aesthetic result, and the risk of local allergic reactions caused by released Ni ions. The results suggest that mouthwashes should be prescribed according to the orthodontic materials used. A new type of mouthwash for use during orthodontic therapy could be an interesting development in this field...|$|E

40|$|Toothpaste {{can be used}} as {{a vehicle}} for {{substances}} to improve the oral health of individuals and populations. Therefore, it should be recommended based on the best scientific evidence available, and not on the opinion of authorities or specialists. Fluoride is the most important therapeutic substance used in toothpastes, adding to the effect of mechanical toothbrushing on dental caries control. The use of fluoride toothpaste to reduce caries in children and adults is strongly based on evidence, and is dependent on the concentration (minimum of 1000 ppm F) and frequency of fluoride toothpaste use (2 '/day or higher). The risk of dental fluorosis due to toothpaste ingestion by children has been overestimated, since there is no evidence that: 1) fluoride toothpaste use should be postponed until the age of 3 - 4 or older, 2) low-fluoride toothpaste avoids fluorosis and 3) fluorosis has a detrimental effect on the quality of life of individuals exposed to fluoridated water and toothpaste. Among other therapeutic substances used in toothpastes, there is evidence that triclosan/copolymer reduce dental biofilm, gingivitis, periodontitis, calculus and halitosis, and that toothpastes <b>containing</b> <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> reduce biofilm and gingivitis...|$|R

This study investigates the contribution of plaque-left-behind and saliva towards substantivity of three antibacterial toothpastes versus a control paste without antibacterial claims. First, volunteers brushed 2 weeks with a control or antibacterial toothpaste. Next, plaque and saliva samples were collected 6 and 12 h after brushing and bacterial concentrations and viabilities were measured. The contributions of plaque and saliva towards substantivity were determined by combining control plaques with experimental plaque or saliva samples and subsequently assessing their viabilities. Bacterial compositions in the various plaque and saliva samples were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The viabilities of plaques after brushing with Colgate-TotalA (R) and Crest-Pro-HealthA (R) were smaller than of control plaques and up to 12 h after brushing with Crest-Pro-HealthA (R) plaques still contained effective, residual antibacterial activity against control plaques. No effective, residual antibacterial activity could be measured in saliva samples after brushing. There {{was no significant difference}} in bacterial composition of plaque or saliva after brushing with the different toothpastes. Plaque-left-behind after mechanical cleaning contributes to the substantive action of an antibacterial toothpaste <b>containing</b> <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> (Crest-Pro-HealthA (R)). The absorptive capacity of plaque-left-behind after brushing is of utmost clinical importance, since plaque is predominantly left behind in places where its removal and effective killing matter most.

40|$|PosterBackground: Periodontal {{diseases}} are inflammatory {{conditions of the}} tooth supporting tissues. Although bacterial byproducts {{have been linked to}} periodontal diseases, host responses have also been implicated. This includes the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are released from human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and induce connective tissue degradation. Fluoride has been shown to have inhibitory effects on MMPs in solution. The effects of fluoride on MMP expression from HGFs have not yet been examined. Methods: HGFs cultured from a sample of clinically non-inflamed gingival connective tissues were incubated with <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and sodium fluoride to determine their effects on cell proliferation. HGFs were then incubated with or without <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> or <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> at the highest concentrations that did not affect cell proliferation and analyzed for MMP expression. Results: The highest concentrations that did not affect proliferation with respect to HGFs were 0. 004 % <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and 0. 0125 % sodium fluoride. At these levels, MMP expression in HGFs did not differ significantly from untreated HGFs. Conclusions: MMP expression in HGFs was unaffected by treatment with <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> or sodium fluoride at the concentrations tested. Although these concentrations of sodium <b>fluoride</b> and <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> with respect to HGFs are lower than some fluoridated mouth rinses and dentifrices, the exact concentrations to which HGFs are exposed following exposure to a fluoridated medicament is unknown.

An acquired pellicle was formed on dentin samples by incubation in clarified, pooled, stimulated human saliva for 24 hours. The specimens were subjected to 5 daily cycles, each consisting of 5 of min demineralization (0. 3 %/ 15. 6 mM citric acid, pH 2. 6, 6 &# 8217;/day) and 60 min of re-mineralization in clarified human saliva. Thirty minutes after the 1 st, 3 rd and 5 th demineralization episodes of each day, the specimens were treated with one of the test solutions for 2 min. Surface loss was measured via optical profilometry. Mixed-model ANOVA followed by Tukey&# 8217;s test were used for the statistical analysis.

RESULTS: After three weeks, the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced gingivitis compared with the Colgate Total group by 39. 7 %. Gingival bleeding was also reduced relative to the Colgate Total group. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05).

While most people claim to brush their teeth twice daily the effectiveness does in general not seem to be sufficient to prevent gingivitis and as a consequence periodontitis. Hence, in this thesis several modifications of oral hygiene devices and toothpastes have been evaluated such as the effectiveness of a toothbrush with a digital feedback monitoring and training system, the risk of gingival recession by brushing with a newly developed power toothbrush and the effectiveness of interdental cleaning devices. Furthermore the contribution of the detergent sodium lauryl sulphate in toothpastes was clinically analyzed and the active ingredients <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and triclosan systematically reviewed with regard to parameters of plaque and gingivitis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37. 6) were {{assigned to one of}} four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. All four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a day for one minute during a four-week test period. Before and after the trial period, Plaque Indices (PII, Silness and Löe, 1964) and Gingival Indices (GI, Löe and Silness, 1963) were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from all patients at Baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. These samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: As a result of the only one minute brushing with the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice, the mean PII at Baseline was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) from the mean PII at four weeks. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} premolar and molar mean values. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean GI at Baseline and at four weeks. The microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2 and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i. e. A. actinomyctemcomitans P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. Over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. In groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of Streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0. 05) including S. mitis, S. intermedius, and S. sanguis (p < 0. 01) suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated bacteria. CONCLUSION: One minute brushing with a 0. 454 % <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice did [...] after four weeks [...] not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis.

Treatment of powdered dentin with a 10 % solution of <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> produced a new crystal-line material {{identical to that}} previously de-scribed. The formation of fluorapatite on hydroxyapatite of powdered dentin could not be detected under the experimental con-ditions. Topical applications of fluoride solutions {{have been shown to}} reduce the incidence of enamel caries in numerous clinical investi...|$|R
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} properties of a 0. 50 % stan-nous fluoride mouthwash and a 0. 27 %o so-dium fluoride mouthwash of equivalent flu-oride ion concentration (0. 12 % 1) were exam-ined using standard bacteriologic plate count procedures. The <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution produced a significant bacterial effect, but the bactericidal {{activity of the}} sodium flu-oride solution was negligible. The action of fluoride ions on oral microor-ganisms has been suggested as a possible mechanism in the inhibition of dental caries. Bibby and Van Kesterenl have shown that sodium fluoride solutions of concentrations up to 100 ppm do not influence {{the growth rate of}} selected organisms, but have a notice-able effect on acid production. Wright and Jenkins 2 reported that fluoride concentra-tions as low as 0. 5 ppm produce a detectable inhibitory effect on acid production in sa-liva-glucose mixtures. Weiss et a 13 reported up to 50 % decrease in polysaccharide syn-thesis by cariogenic organisms in the pres-ence of 10 ppm fluoride ion. Although low concentrations of fluoride ion affect the met-abolic activity or oral microorganisms, they do not reduce significantly the number of microorganisms. A recent study has shown that the daily use of a <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> mouthrinse will result in a significant reduction in DMF sur-faces in children in addition to the reductio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the number of Streptococcus mutans CFU (colony forming units) in the saliva and plaque adjacent to orthodontic brackets bonded with a glass ionomer cement - GIC (Fuji Ortho) or a resin-based composite - RC (Concise). Twenty male and female patients, aged 12 to 20 years, participated in the study. Saliva was collected before and after placement of appliances. Plaque was collected from areas adjacent to brackets and saliva was again collected on the 15 th, 30 th, and 45 th day after placement. On the 30 th day, 0. 4 % <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> gel was applied for 4 minutes. No significant modification {{in the number of}} Streptococcus mutans CFU in saliva was observed after placement of the fixed orthodontic appliances. On the 15 th day, the percentage of Streptococcus mutans CFU in plaque was statistically lower in sites adjacent to GIC-bonded brackets (mean = 0. 365) than in those adjacent to RC-bonded brackets (mean = 0. 935). No evidence was found of a contribution of GIC to the reduction of CFU in plaque after the 15 th day. Topical application of <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> gel on the 30 th day reduced the number of CFU in saliva, but not in plaque. This study suggests that the antimicrobial activity of GIC occurs only in the initial phase and is not responsible for a long-term anticariogenic property...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of aqueous solutions of strontium nitrate and <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{results in the}} formation of a precipitate which is SrSn 2 F 6 ·H 2 O, or Sr 2 Sn 2 NO 3 F 7 · 2 H 2 O, or a mixture of both, depending on the conditions. The reaction has been studied as a function of various reaction parameters, such as molar ratio, order of addition of reagents, mixing speed, time and temperature. The preparation of these materials is described here. The nature of the products was investigated by various analytical techniques, such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry, fluoride ion electrode analysis, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analyses and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Recrystallization of SrSn 2 F 6 ·H 2 O and Sr 2 Sn 2 NO 3 F 7 · 2 H 2 O from nitric acid was performed in primarily an effort to obtain single crystals {{that could be used for}} crystal structure determination by X-ray single crystal diffraction. In addition, it was also used to investigate if any new materials are formed by this method, since it is known to happen if PbSnF 4 is recrystallized in nitric acid. Furthermore, highly oriented samples and higher purity of both materials are obtained by recrystallization. Reactions between strontium chloride and <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> in aqueous solutions were also investigated under similar conditions...|$|R
