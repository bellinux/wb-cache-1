5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. On {{the floor of the}} House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia Congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden to serve as a second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the <b>censure</b> of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House <b>censure).</b> The resolutions of expulsion and <b>censure</b> were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect <b>censure</b> and later regretted his actions.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: <b>censure</b> and excommunication. <b>Censure</b> was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: <b>censure</b> by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from <b>censure</b> included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{penitent}} be {{in danger}} of death, any priest can absolve him, both from reserved <b>censures</b> and reserved sins. In case of reserved <b>censures,</b> if he recover, he must later present himself to the one having special power for reserved <b>censures,</b> unless the case was simply reserved to the pope. As to reserved sins, he need not, as a general rule, present himself again after convalescence.|$|R
5000|$|Hunter was <b>censured</b> by the United States House of Representatives. This was {{the tenth}} time in American history that a Representative was <b>censured.</b> The report cites [...] "Insulted another member during debate (January 26, 1867)" [...] {{as the reason}} for this condemnation.|$|R

5|$|President James Monroe's {{first choice}} for Secretary of War was Henry Clay, who {{declined}} the office. When Johnson also declined to serve, the post ultimately went to John C. Calhoun. The {{result was that}} Johnson became chair of the Committee on Expenditures where he wielded considerable influence over defense policy in the Department of War during the Fifteenth Congress. In 1817, Congress investigated General Andrew Jackson's execution of two British subjects during the First Seminole War. Johnson chaired the inquiry committee. The majority of the committee favored a negative report and a <b>censure</b> for Jackson. Johnson, a Jackson supporter, drafted a counter report that was more favorable to Jackson and opposed the <b>censure.</b> The ensuing debate pitted Johnson against fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay. Johnson's report prevailed, and Jackson was spared <b>censure.</b> This disagreement between Johnson and Clay, however, {{marked the beginning of}} a political separation between the two that lasted for the duration of their careers.|$|E
5|$|After his <b>censure,</b> McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|The manner {{by which}} Hopkins {{distributed}} the spoils was criticized, and {{his failure to}} follow his orders to patrol the Virginia shore resulted in <b>censure</b> by the Continental Congress. After a series of further missteps and accusations, Hopkins was {{forced out of the}} navy in 1778.|$|E
5000|$|The Bull {{contained}} {{a collection of}} <b>censures</b> of excommunication against the perpetrators of various offences, absolution from which was reserved to the pope. The custom of periodical publication of <b>censures</b> is an old one. The tenth canon of the Council of York in 1195 ordered all priests to publish <b>censures</b> of excommunication against perjurers with bell and lighted candle thrice in the year. The Council of London in 1200 commanded the yearly publication of excommunication against sorcerers, perjurers, incendiaries, thieves and those guilty of rape.|$|R

50|$|The bishop Batai of Mashmahig, who {{had already}} been <b>censured</b> on a {{previous}} occasion for an unknown misdemeanour, was again <b>censured</b> and deposed at the synod of Isaac in 410, and the bishop Eliya of Mashmahig was among the signatories of the acts of the synod.|$|R
5|$|When General Andrew Jackson {{tried and}} {{executed}} two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish-held Florida, it precipitated the Great Seminole Debate of 1818–1819 in Congress, with some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his <b>censure.</b> Floyd, however, supported Jackson's actions, maintaining he had acted {{according to precedent}} and his orders. He also denied {{the sovereignty of the}} Seminole tribes.|$|E
5|$|A Parliamentary {{debate and}} motion to <b>censure</b> the Labour {{government}} on this {{was set for}} 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings {{into his office and}} suggested a way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept all the blame and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald {{and the rest of the}} cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election. Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took {{a position on the}} lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive <b>censure</b> in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E

60|$|But, {{to return}} to the more {{immediate}} subject of our lucubrations: It seems almost like a fatality, that Lord Byron has hardly ever praised any thing that he has not at some other period <b>censured,</b> or <b>censured</b> any thing that he has not, by and bye, praised or practised.|$|R

5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would <b>censure</b> the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under <b>censure</b> by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E
5|$|From 1833 to 1834, Jackson {{was engaged}} in {{removing}} federal funds from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War. Calhoun opposed this action, considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power. On March 28, 1834, he voted with the Whig senators on a successful motion to <b>censure</b> Jackson for his removal of the funds. However, by 1837 Calhoun generally had realigned himself {{with most of the}} Democrats' policies.|$|E

5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss of}} their comrades. He escaped official <b>censure,</b> and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of <b>censure</b> on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Marshall and Innes {{continued}} during Marshall's {{tenure in}} the legislature. When Innes, {{acting on a}} recommendation from an advisory jury, dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by Marshall in Innes' district court, Marshall retaliated by convincing Congressman John Rowan to file an impeachment petition against Innes in the House of Representatives. Innes countered by having his son-in-law, Thomas Bodley, pursue a <b>censure</b> of Marshall in the state House. Rowan's petition against Innes failed, but Bodley's against Marshall succeeded, and Marshall was expelled from the House in 1808, only to be re-elected the following year.|$|E

5|$|Tensions mounted and, on May 14, 1864, Cuza {{carried out}} a coup d'état, coinciding with the moment when Conservatives imposed a <b>censure</b> vote. Kogălniceanu read in Parliament the monarch's {{decision}} to dissolve it, after which Cuza introduced a new constitution, titled Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris ("Statute Expanding the Paris Convention"). Together with a law virtually establishing a system of universal male suffrage, it was submitted to the 1864 plebiscite, gaining support from 682,621 voters out of 754,148.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending <b>censure</b> from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first. He disliked teaching – although he admitted it paid the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made Vice-Chancellor of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the <b>censure</b> of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
