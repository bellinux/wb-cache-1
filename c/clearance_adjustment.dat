50|$|The wasserboxer, as {{with all}} Volkswagen boxer engines, {{directly}} drives the three-bearing camshaft via a small steel gear on the crankshaft, and a large aluminium one on the camshaft, {{so there is no}} timing belt or timing chain. The entire mechanism is internal to the engine, so there should be no concerns regarding wear or replacements, as long as the engine oil is changed regularly. The overhead poppet valves each feature two concentric valve springs, and are operated by pushrods, with adjustable rocker arms to facilitate valve <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) genotype {{has been}} associated with probability of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, no prior studies have examined whether this relationship may be further characterized by grouping HLA alleles according to their supertypes, defined by their binding capacities. There is debate regarding the most appropriate method to define supertypes. Therefore, previously reported HLA supertypes (46 class I and 25 class II) were assessed for their relation with HCV clearance in a population of 758 HCV-seropositive women. Two HLA class II supertypes were significant in multivariable models that included: (i) supertypes with significant or borderline associations with HCV <b>clearance</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for multiple tests, and (ii) individual HLA alleles not part of these supertypes, but associated with HCV clearance in our prior study in this population.

30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model of the mandible with eight implants in the premolar and molar regions was constructed. Linearly elastic material properties were defined for all elements except the periodontal ligament, which was defined as nonlinearly elastic. The TMJs and antagonists were simplified and replaced with nonlinear springs. Antagonists were assumed to be natural teeth or implants and had two- or three-stage displaceability. We constructed finite element (FE) models in which occlusal adjustment with three kinds of occlusal force (40  N as a light bite, 200  N as a hard bite, and 400  N as a maximum biting force) was performed. The <b>clearance</b> by occlusal <b>adjustment</b> was decided beforehand with a trial-and-error method so that the occlusal forces were distributed similarly to {{the distribution of the}} natural dentition. Each model was evaluated under loads of 40, 100, 200, 400, and 800  N to determine the distribution of occlusal forces on the teeth and implants.|$|R
40|$|AbstractZonisamide is a {{synthetic}} 1, 2 -benzisoxazole- 3 -methanesulfonamide with anticonvulsant properties. The sulfamoyl group on zonisamide {{was expected to}} suppress seizures {{in a manner similar}} to another sulfonamide analogue, acetazolamide, through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. However, this does not appear to be the primary mechanism of action since zonisamide requires much higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent titration in vivo. Studies with cultured neurons indicate that zonisamide blocks repetitive firing of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive T-type calcium currents without affecting L-type calcium currents. Its dual mechanism of action may explain its efficacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Zonisamide has a pharmacokinetic profile favorable for clinical use. It is rapidly and completely absorbed and has a long half-life (63 – 69 h in healthy volunteers) which allows twice-daily, or even once-daily, dosing. Zonisamide is not highly bound to plasma proteins. Consequently, it does not affect protein binding of other highly protein-bound AEDs. Furthermore, zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism and does not induce liver enzymes. However, since zonisamide is metabolized by cytochrome P 450, liver enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase zonisamide <b>clearance,</b> and dosage <b>adjustments</b> may be necessary when it is used in combination with certain AEDs...|$|R
50|$|The 603.96 engine has a {{capacity}} of 2996cc and was an engineering marvel in pre-chamber design and a technological leap forward from the earlier 5 cylinder OM617.

40|$|Background: DUE (Drug Utilization Evaluation) {{studies can}} help {{identify}} and correct {{problems associated with}} irrational use of drugs. Considering lack of data regarding how rational vancomycin is being used, we evaluated this DUE study in a referral infectious center to evaluate compliance with guidelines in terms of rational use of this valuable antibiotic. Methods: This retrospective study was done for 6 months from March to September 2012 at Razi hospital, an educational hospital affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Data including patients’ demographics, vancomycin dose, kidney function assessment, dose adjustments, sampling and culture were collected. Based on the HICPAC (Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) and Up-to-date 2012 advices, the concordance of practice with standard guidelines was assessed. Results: One hundred and forty six medical records were reviewed in this study. Fever and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms {{at the time of}} initiation of vancomycin. Skin infections, lower respiratory tract infection and septicemia were the most common initial diagnosis of patients. Sampling was done in almost one-third of patients. Most of patient with a specific order were received vancomycin in half an hour. Considering the indication, Vancomycin was administered appropriately in 58 percent of patients. Conclusion: Vancomycin was used irrationally in a great proportion of patients. The main observed drawbacks were empiric use of vancomycin without subsequent adjustment of antimicrobial agent according to culture and sensitivity data and lack of paying enough attention to calculation of creatinine <b>clearance</b> and dosage <b>adjustment.</b> </p...|$|R

It is {{an ideal}} antibiotic for treatment of serious nosocomial infections and severe sepsis for its exceptionally high efficiency and broad antibacterial spectrum of action. Doripenem is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. In cases of acute kidney injury, dosing of doripenem depends on creatinine <b>clearance</b> and requires <b>adjustments.</b> Doripenem is eliminated during hemodialysis because its molecular weight is 300 – 400 Da. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the impact of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) on doripenem serum concentrations in a population of intensive-therapy patients with life-threatening infections and severe sepsis. Ten patients were enrolled in this observational study. Twelve blood samples were collected during the first administration of doripenem in a 1 -hour continuous infusion while CRRT SLED was provided. Fluid chromatography was used for measurement of the concentration of doripenem in serum. In all collected samples, concentration of doripenem was above the minimum inhibition concentration of this antibiotic. Based on these results, we can draw the conclusion that doripenem concentration is above the minimum inhibition ­concentration throughout all of CRRT. The dosing pattern proposed by the manufacturer can be used in patients receiving CRRT SLED without necessary modifications.

40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of occlusal forces(the contractile force of masticatory muscles) exerted during occlusal adjustment on the distribution of the forces among teeth, implants, and TMJs in intercuspal clenching in cases with bilateral missing molars and premolars by using finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of the mandible with eight implants in the premolar and molar regions was constructed. Linearly elastic material properties were defined for all elements except the periodontal ligament, which was defined as nonlinearly elastic. The TMJs and antagonists were simplified and replaced with nonlinear springs. Antagonists were assumed to be natural teeth or implants and had two- or three-stage displaceability.

40|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the well}} known gender difference in bladder cancer {{risk is that}} males and females metabolize carcinogens differently. The caffeine breath test (CBT) was performed {{on a group of}} healthy men and women to determine whether there was a gender difference in P 4501 A 2 activity. Results consistent with previous data suggesting an elevation of CBT in men were observed, although this increase was not statistically significant.

Parous women had CBT values similar to men, whereas the results of women who had never given birth were lower. Confirming earlier studies, women taking oral contraceptives had low CBT values. Our data suggest an effect of recent caffeine consumption, with heavy coffee drinkers having higher rates of caffeine <b>clearance.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> for other weak effects, such as age, exposure to environmental cigarette smoke, history of smoking, recent meat and cruciferous vegetable consumption, and use of alcohol or other medications, did not alter these findings.

40|$|Robots {{based on}} {{parallel}} kinematic structures feature low moved masses, allowing for better dy-namic performance compared to serial mechanisms, eventually resulting in shorter cycle-times in handling and assembly. A {{side effect of}} this high dynamics is {{a higher level of}} vibration which has to be addressed in order to reach the full potential for short cycle-times. Some active measures for vibration-suppression were already presented previously. Another problem of parallel robots is a small ratio between working-space to installation-space. In order to overcome the problem (e. g. by changing configurations) specific components (e. g. joints) are needed. In this paper the use of an adaptronic joint with quasi-statical <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment</b> integrated in the five-bar parallel structure is presented, addressing both vibration-suppression and configuration changes. Dimensioning of the adaptronic joint covers two aspects. Firstly increasing of friction up to blocking the joint in order to change configuration of the five-bar-structure. Secondly friction variation is used to optimize vibration damping and thus indirectly shorten cycle-times. First experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|E

Aim: to assess efficacy of carbocysteine lysine salt monohydrate as a mucokinetic agent in children with respiratory tract diseases. Patients and methods : 65 children (31 girls and 34 boys) aged from 5 to 16 years old with acute respiratory tract diseases received treatment in Belgorod pediatric out-patient clinic №  4 were included into the study. The results of the clinical follow-up of these children are shown in the article. Results : carbocysteine lysine salt monohydrate {{was found to be}} effective and safe in treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory {{diseases of the}} respiratory tract in children. The authors observed quicker convalescence of the patients and possibility of combination of this drug with other medicines used in pediatric practice. Conclusions : the above-mentioned drug when used in combination with antibacterial agents intensifies penetration of the latter into the bronchial secretion and bronchial mucous membrane thereby increasing their efficacy. The drug does not have toxicity, is well-tolerated even when prolonged using and can be recommended for treatment of cough in children both under out- and in-patients conditions.

40|$|Program {{objectives}} were to determine three advanced configurations of helium buffer seals {{capable of providing}} improved performance in a space shuttle main engine (SSME), high-pressure liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump environment, and to provide NASA with the analytical tools to determine performance {{of a variety of}} seal configurations. The three seal designs included solid-ring fluid-film seals often referred to as floating ring seals, back-to-back fluid-film face seals, and a circumferential sectored seal that incorporated inherent <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment</b> capabilities. Of the three seals designed, the sectored seal is favored because the self-adjusting clearance features accommodate the variations in clearance that will occur because of thermal and centrifugal distortions without compromising performance. Moreover, leakage can be contained well below the maximum target values; minimizing leakage is important on the SSME since helium is provided by an external tank. A reduction in tank size translates to an increase in payload that can be carried on board the shuttle. The computer codes supplied under this program included a code for analyzing a variety of gas-lubricated, floating ring, and sector seals; a code for analyzing gas-lubricated face seals; a code for optimizing and analyzing gas-lubricated spiral-groove face seals; and a code for determining fluid-film face seal response to runner excitations in as many as five degrees of freedom. These codes proved invaluable for optimizing designs and estimating final performance of the seals described...|$|E

40|$|Carpet weaving is a {{high risk}} {{occupation}} for developing MSDs, as awkward working postures, repetitive movements, contact stress and long working time are common. The objectives of the present study, which was carried out at the Iranian hand-woven carpet industry, were determination of MSDs symptoms prevalence, workstation and working posture assessment, identification of major factors associated with MSDs symptoms in different body regions and developing guidelines for workstation design. In this study, 1439 randomly selected weavers from 9 Iranian provinces have participated. Data on personal details, workshop characteristics and MSDs symptoms was collected by questionnaire. Posture and workstation assessment were performed by observational technique. The results revealed that musculoskeletal symptoms prevalence rates in shoulders (47. 8 %), lower back (45. 2 %), wrists (38. 2 %), upper back (37. 7 %), neck (35. 2 %) and knees (34. 6 %) were high as compared to general Iranian population (for neck, back and large joints p< 0. 0001). Working postures {{were found to be}} deviated form neutral. Lack of proper seat, leg <b>clearance,</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanisms, together with incorrect weaving height made weavers worked in constrained, harmful postures. The results were subjected to multivariate analyses in order to find the major factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms.

40|$|Pumps {{are among}} the most spread {{machines}} in industrial facilities. In this work a comparative CFD analysis using different software is presented. The three-dimensional flow in the semi-open impeller and volute of a centrifugal pump is numerically simulated. The main advantage of semi-open impeller centrifugal pump is its efficiency which can be considered constant thanks to the <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment.</b> In addition this kind of impeller is less likely to clog with solid bodies (important in case of slurry-processing). The open impeller has all the parts visible, so it is easier to inspect for wear and damages. Eventually it is lighter than a shrouded impeller: it can spin faster. The stress due to centrifugal force is indeed a limit for the speed of this machines. On the other hand its main disadvantage if compared to a shrouded pump is its lower efficiency due to the heavier tip leakage. In addition it cannot be employed in case of explosive products: the risk of contact between impeller and volute causing sparks is not negligible. The simulations have been carried out using both open-source and proprietary software: OpenFOAM®, PumpLinx ® and ANSYS-CFX ®. The performance of the machine handling both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are also investigated. The numerical models and the results of the different computational strategies were compared with the experimental data and the accuracy of different software is evaluated in the case of Newtonian model. It is well known that the performance of a centrifugal pump drops processing a viscous fluid. Even so the behavior during the pumping of non-Newtonian fluids has not been investigated so far. The non-Newtonian fluid processed is a shear-thinning fluid (the apparent viscosity decreases with an increase stress). The slurries which are usually processed in the food industries, chemical plants and oil&gas processes show a usual behavior which correspond to this kind of model...|$|E
