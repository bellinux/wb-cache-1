40|$|This paper reports {{facts and}} figures on the disproportionate {{representation}} of Latinos in the juvenile criminal justice system. However, it is beneficial to begin by building {{an understanding of how}} this biasness is reached in the first place. So in-group versus out-groups and social hierarchy will be examined to determine how these concepts favors some over others. Various theories on group dynamics explain the me-chanics of prejudice and institutional racism. For example, Shawn O. Utsey, Joseph G. Ponterotto, and Jerlym S. Porter (2008) address the origins, mechanisms, and expressions of prejudice. They argue that racism continues to be a pervasive problem throughout world (Ponterot-to, Porter, & Utsey 2008). In other words, racism can be broadly manifested into such actions as institutional racism, housing discrimination, the committing of hate crimes, and so forth just {{as much as they can}} appear in anecdotes and jokes. Latinos in literature list their likelihood of being treated harshly in the criminal justice. Mistreatment of this sort consists of being denied bail, harassed by the police, and impris-oned at disproportional rates compared to whites. As of 2003 12 % of all Black males in their 20 s were in prison or jail; almost 4 % of Latinos and only 1. 5 % of whites in their 20 s were incarcerated (Harrison, 2003; Rios, 2006).

60|$|Nothing can {{possibly}} be more intensely possessive of the facts than this whole passage: the sense of utter deadness and emptiness, and frustrate fall in the leaves; of dormant life in the human body,--the fire, and heroism, and strength of it, lulled under the dead brown heap, as embers under ashes, and the knitting of interchanged and <b>close</b> <b>strength</b> of living boughs above. But {{there is not the}} smallest apparent sense of there being beauty elsewhere than in the human being.

40|$|Developing {{effective}} coarse grained (CG) {{approach is}} a promising way for studying dynamics on large size networks. In the present work, we have proposed a strength-based CG () method to study critical phenomena of the Potts model on weighted complex networks. By merging nodes with <b>close</b> <b>strength</b> together, the original network is reduced to a CG-network with much smaller size, on which the CG-Hamiltonian can be well-defined. In particular, we make error analysis and show that our strength-based CG approach satisfies the condition of statistical consistency, which demands that the equilibrium probability distribution of the CG-model matches that of the microscopic counterpart. Extensive numerical simulations are performed on scale-free networks, without or with strength-correlation, showing that this approach works very well in reproducing the phase diagrams, fluctuations, and finite size effects of the microscopic model, while the approach proposed in our recent work [Phys. Rev. E 82, 011107 (2010) ] does not. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of metal crystals is reduced below the theoretical value {{by the presence}} of dislocations or by flaws that allow easy nucleation of dislocations. A straightforward method to minimize the number of defects and flaws and to presumably increase its strength is to increase the crystal quality or to reduce the crystal size. Here, we describe the successful fabrication of high aspect ratio nanowhiskers from a variety of face-centered cubic metals using a high temperature molecular beam epitaxy method. The presence of atomically smooth, faceted surfaces and absence of dislocations is confirmed using transmission electron microscopy investigations. Tensile tests performed in situ in a focused-ion beam scanning electron microscope on Cu nanowhiskers reveal <b>strengths</b> <b>close</b> to the theoretical upper limit and confirm that the properties of nanomaterials can be engineered by controlling defect and flaw densities.
