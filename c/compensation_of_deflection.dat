40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{production}} {{systems have been}} subject to continuous change. Whereas scale effects of mass production were brought into focus {{during the middle of the}} 20 th century, costs are not the only requirement on today’s manufacturing systems. Products are manufactured in big varieties, each product has to satisfy the specific needs of each costumer as good as possible. As a result, production systems need to provide high flexibility and versatility. The deployment of industrial robots is an appropriate way to run different processes in one production cell. However, the usage of industrial robots is limited by different obstacles: Safety, programming and accuracy hamper for example the application of robots in many applications. This work focuses on improving the accuracy of industrial robots in machining in order to qualify robots for a bigger set of applications. There is already a diverse set of methods available in literature which improve accuracy of industrial robots. On one side, robot behavior is described by means of models and used for compensation. Specifically, the determination of real kinematics and the identification of compliance parameters for the <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> due to load on the end-effector are addressed. For each of the model, the quality of the models is decisive for the description of robot behavior. On the other side, additional sensing is used in order to improve accuracy of end-effector positioning and path tracking. Both sensors on joint level and large scale measurement systems in order to determine the pose of the end-effector in space, are used. Good accuracies can be achieved in static case, yet the dynamic behavior of industrial robots can hardly be influenced as it is mostly determined by mass, compliance and friction. Oscillations beyond the bandwidth of industrial robots can therefore not be compensated by the robot mechanics. Based on systematic analysis of influences on robots in machining, different methods are developed in this work in order to improve accuracy. First, compensation of end-effector deflection due to process forces is addressed, as being one of the major influences. A new approach is presented describing the real robot behavior more precisely by usage of nonlinear functions in several degrees of freedom. An innovative identification procedure enables parameter identification on a broad database. Derived from the developed model and based on online force/torque measurement, the deflection can be determined and compensated online. The application of an external actuator system aims to reduce the deviations in robotic machining. The bandwidth of the actuator system exceeds the bandwidth of industrialrobots and can therefore compensate for Eigen modes of the robot. This work presents a control approach which guarantees good positioning of the spindle based on piezo actuation and realizes an overall control of robot and actuator system based on direct pose measurement of the end-effector. The error of relative positioning of workpiece and tool is provided both to robot controller and actuator system. Special attention is drawn on the limited work space of the actuator system. Evaluation of the presented methods together with an uncompensated robot in an industrial use case allows qualification and relative grading. The effectiveness of the methods is revealed in milling a circular geometry in steel and in measuring on a coordinate measurement machine. Deviations can be reduced to ± 100 m. The mean average error can be reduced by 87, 4 %. Based on the practical testing of the compensation methods, the applicability for different machining processes is investigated. The combination of methods is considered and monetary aspects are discussed. This work finishes with an outlook on further potentials. The modeling is addressed as well as the identification of model parameters. Finally, design aspects of the actuator systems are discussed and further advances on the control of the overall robotic system are outlined...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of increasing the vehicle driving stability at a higher speed. One of the ways how to achieve higher stability is using the 4 WS system. Mathematical description of vehicle general movement is a very complex task. For simulation, models which are aptly simplified are used. For the first approach, so-called single-truck vehicle model (often linear) is usually used. For the simulation, we have chosen to extend the model into a two-truck one, which includes the possibility to input more vehicle parameters. Considering the 4 WS system, it is possible to use a number of potential regulations. In our simulation model, the regulation system with compound coupling was used. This type of regulation turns the rear wheels depending on the input parameters of the system (steering angle of the front wheels) and depending on the output moving quantities of the vehicle, most frequently the yaw rate. Criterion for <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> lateral <b>deflection</b> centre <b>of</b> gravity angle is its zero value, or more precisely the zero value of its first-order derivative. Parameters and set-up of the simulation model were done in conjunction with the dSAPACE software. Reference performances of the vehicle simulation model were made through the defined manoeuvres.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft <b>deflections,</b> (2) <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> predicted shaft <b>deflections</b> during generation <b>of</b> spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle <b>of</b> meshing. <b>Compensation</b> <b>of</b> misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect <b>of</b> several misalignment <b>compensations</b> in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.

40|$|Abstract. At JAEA as the JApan Domestic Agency (JADA) for ITER, a MAMuG (multi-aperture multi-grid) {{accelerator}} {{has been}} developed for the ITER neutral beam injector (NBI). Beam parameters achieved by the MAMuG accelerator were increased to 0. 32 A H- at the ion current density of 140 A/m 2, from the 0. 2 A reported at Chengdu, and 796 keV at the beam energy, which was almost the power supply limit (0. 5 A) of the test facility. This was achieved {{as the result of}} countermeasures to handle unexpected heat load by backstream positive ions. A test of SINGAP (single-aperture single-gap) accelerator was performed at JAEA under an ITER R&D task agreement. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the two different accelerator concepts (SINGAP and MAMuG) at the same test facility. As the result, it was concluded that the MAMuG accelerator is more suitable for the ITER NBI because of its better voltage holding and less electron acceleration.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods for}} improving the accuracy and efficiency of tasks performed using different kinds of industrial manipulators, {{with a focus on}} the application of machining. Industrial robots offer a flexible and cost-efficient alternative to machine tools for machining, but cannot achieve as high accuracy out of the box. This is mainly caused by non-ideal properties in the robot joints such as backlash and compliance, in combination with the strong process forces that affect the robot during machining operations. In this thesis, three different approaches to improving the robotic machining accuracy are presented. First, a macro/micro-manipulator approach is considered, where an external compensation mechanism is used in combination with the robot, for <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> high-frequency Cartesian errors. Two different milling scenarios are evaluated, where a significant increase in accuracy was obtained. The accuracy specification of 50 μm was reached for both scenarios. Because of the limited workspace and the higher bandwidth <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> mechanism compared to the robot, two different mid-ranging approaches for control of the relative position between the robot and the compensator are developed and evaluated. Second, modeling and identification of robot joints is considered. The proposed method relies on clamping the manipulator end effector and actuating the joints, while measuring joint motor torque and motor position. The joint stiffness and backlash can subsequently be extracted from the measurements, to be used for <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deflections</b> that occur during machining. Third, a model-based iterative learning control (ILC) approach is proposed, where feedback is provided from three different sensors of varying investment costs. Using position measurements from an optical tracking system, an error decrease of up to 84 % was obtained. Measurements of end-effector forces yielded an error decrease of 55 %, and a force-estimation method based on joint motor torques decreased the error by 38 %. Further investigation of ILC methods is considered for a different kind of manipulator, a marine vibrator, for the application of marine seismic acquisition. A frequency-domain ILC strategy is proposed, in order to attenuate undesired overtones and improve the tracking accuracy. The harmonics were suppressed after approximately 20 iterations of the ILC algorithm, and the absolute tracking error was r educed by a factor of approximately 50. The final problem considered in this thesis concerns increasing the efficiency of machining tasks, by minimizing cycle times. A force-control approach is proposed to maximize the feed rate, and a learning algorithm for path planning of the machining path is employed for the case of machining in non-isotropic materials, such as wood. The cycle time was decreased by 14 % with the use of force control, and on average an additional 28 % decrease was achieved by use of a learning algorithm. Furthermore, by means of reinforcement learning, the path-planning algorithm is refined to provide optimal solutions and to incorporate an increased number of machining directions...|$|R
