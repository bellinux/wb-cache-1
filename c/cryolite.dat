5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing <b>cryolite</b> and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to <b>cryolite</b> and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} on 7 November 1960 as Grønlandsfly A/S by the Scandinavian Airlines System (now SAS) and Kryolitselskabet Øresund, a Danish mining company {{involved with the}} <b>cryolite</b> operations at Ivittuut to provide transport and logistics for four American radar bases in Greenland. In 1962, interests in the firm were acquired by the Provincial Council (now the Greenland Home Rule Government) and the Royal Greenland Trade Department (now KNI).|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into <b>cryolite</b> which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten <b>cryolite</b> Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, <b>cryolite,</b> nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
25|$|The halide {{minerals}} are compounds where a halogen (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine) is {{the main}} anion. These minerals tend to be soft, weak, brittle, and water-soluble. Common examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), sylvite (KCl), fluorite (CaF2). Halite and sylvite commonly form as evaporites, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks. <b>Cryolite,</b> Na3AlF6, is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from bauxites; however, as the only significant occurrence at Ivittuut, Greenland, in a granitic pegmatite, was depleted, synthetic <b>cryolite</b> {{can be made from}} fluorite.|$|E
25|$|The {{race for}} the commercially viable {{production}} of aluminium was won in 1886 by Paul Héroult and Charles M. Hall. The problem many researchers had with extracting aluminium was that electrolysis of an aluminium salt dissolved in water yields aluminium hydroxide. Both Hall and Héroult avoided this problem by dissolving aluminium oxide in a new solvent— fused <b>cryolite</b> (Na3AlF6).|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Charles Martin Hall, a {{graduate}} of Oberlin College, discovered the process of smelting aluminum, almost simultaneously with Paul Héroult in France. He realized that by passing an electric current through a bath of <b>cryolite</b> and aluminum oxide, the then semi-rare metal aluminum remained as a byproduct. This discovery, now called the Hall-Héroult process, is still the only process used to make aluminum (however, see also Bayer process).|$|E
25|$|Some {{ships of}} the Greenland Patrol were {{conventional}} cutters briefly {{assigned to the}} patrol. Others were unique and sometimes historic vessels specifically designed for polar exploration and well suited to conditions encountered by the patrol. Larger cutters escorted SG convoys of freighters and troopships between Sydney and the larger Greenland ports serving Narsarsuaq Air Base and the Ivittuut <b>cryolite</b> mine, while trawlers and tugs (sometimes towing barges) distributed supplies from those ports to smaller Army Bluie bases on remote fjords without port facilities.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{atmospheric}} circulation pattern requires westerly meteorological observations for prediction of weather conditions to the east. Weather observation stations in Greenland improved {{the accuracy of}} weather forecasting for the Atlantic Ocean and northern Europe for tactical advantage {{in the battle of}} the Atlantic and European theatre of World War II. Greenland had been part of the Danish colonial empire since 1814. Greenland appeared relatively unprotected following German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940. The Allies of World War II became concerned about the possibility of Axis military bases on Greenland. The <b>cryolite</b> mine at Ivittuut was a strategically important source of flux for electrolysis of aluminum ores by the Hall–Héroult process for aircraft production.|$|E
25|$|In the {{preparation}} of alum from clays or from bauxite, the material is gently calcined, then mixed with sulfuric acid and heated gradually to boiling; it is allowed to stand for some time, the clear solution drawn off and mixed with acid potassium sulfate and allowed to crystallize. When <b>cryolite</b> is used for {{the preparation}} of alum, it is mixed with calcium carbonate and heated. By this means, sodium aluminate is formed; it is then extracted with water and precipitated either by sodium bicarbonate or by passing a current of carbon dioxide through the solution. The precipitate is then dissolved in sulfuric acid, the requisite amount of potassium sulfate added and the solution allowed to crystallize.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium, like boron, {{was first}} known in {{minerals}} {{before it was}} finally extracted from alum, a common mineral {{in some areas of}} the world. Antoine Lavoisier and Humphry Davy had each separately tried to extract it. Although neither succeeded, Davy had given the metal its current name. It was only in 1825 that the Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted successfully prepared a rather impure form of the element. Many improvements followed, a significant advance being made just two years later by Friedrich Wöhler, whose slightly modified procedure still yielded an impure product. The first pure sample of aluminium is credited to Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, who substituted sodium for potassium in the procedure. At that time aluminium was considered precious, and it was displayed next to such metals as gold and silver. The method used today, electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in <b>cryolite,</b> was developed by Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult in the late 1880s.|$|E
500|$|Fluorine is {{the thirteenth}} most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700ppm (parts per million) by mass. Elemental {{fluorine}} in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor, precluding its natural occurrence; {{it is found}} only in combined mineral forms, of which fluorite, fluorapatite and <b>cryolite</b> are the most industrially significant. Fluorite or fluorspar (...) , colorful and abundant worldwide, is fluorine's main source; China and Mexico are the major suppliers. The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995. Although fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) contains most of the world's fluorine, its low mass fraction of 3.5% means that {{most of it is}} used as a phosphate. In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via fluorosilicic acid, a phosphate industry byproduct. <b>Cryolite</b> (...) , once used directly in aluminium production, is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals. The main commercial mine on Greenland's west coast closed in 1987, and most <b>cryolite</b> is now synthesized.|$|E
500|$|The Earth's crust {{contains}} 2.27% sodium, {{making it}} the seventh most abundant element on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium. Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08 milligrams per liter. Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. [...] The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as <b>cryolite</b> and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which {{in the case of}} feldspar is a polysilicate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} dissolves {{slowly in}} mineral acids through grain boundary attack, and in strong alkalies through {{attack on the}} aluminium nitride grains. The material hydrolyzes slowly in water. Aluminium nitride is resistant to attack from most molten salts, including chlorides and <b>cryolite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most {{high-volume}} {{inorganic fluoride}} compounds are prepared from hydrofluoric acid. [...] Foremost are Na3AlF6, <b>cryolite,</b> and AlF3, aluminium trifluoride.

[...] Given concerns about fluorides in the environment, alternative technologies are being sought. Other inorganic fluorides prepared from hydrofluoric acid include sodium fluoride and uranium hexafluoride.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{hypotheses}} for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, radium exposure, childhood diseases, or a {{calcium deficiency}} {{in the local}} drinking water. In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded {{that the cause of}} the Colorado stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1mg/L or less). Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral <b>cryolite,</b> one of whose constituents is fluorine. [...] As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, when Nazi Germany {{extended}} its war operations to Greenland, Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish Minister to the United States— {{who had already}} refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark— signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting the US Armed Forces permission to establish stations in Greenland. Kauffmann did this without {{the knowledge of the}} Danish government, and consequently, [...] "the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately – none of which had any result". Because of the difficulties for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful export, especially of <b>cryolite,</b> Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status. Its supplies were guaranteed by the United States and Canada.|$|E
2500|$|An ocular prosthesis, {{artificial}} eye or glass eye {{is a type}} of craniofacial prosthesis that replaces an absent natural eye following an enucleation, evisceration, or orbital exenteration.

A few ocular prostheses today are made of <b>cryolite</b> glass. A variant of the ocular prosthesis is a very thin hard shell known as a scleral shell which can be worn over a damaged or eviscerated eye. Makers of ocular prosthetics are known as ocularists. An ocular prosthesis does not provide vision; this would be a visual prosthesis. Someone with an ocular prosthesis is totally blind on the affected side and has monocular (one sided) vision.|$|E

In the writings of the alchemists we find the words misy, sory, chalcanthum applied to alum as well as to iron sulfate; and the name atramentum sutorium, which one might expect to belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both. Various minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum, the most important being alunite, alum schist, bauxite and <b>cryolite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{is usually}} {{considered}} a rare mineral, {{but this is}} likely due to difficulty in preserving samples. It was first discovered in nature by the Danish mineralogist Pauly in the Ikka (then spelt Ika) fjord in southwest Greenland, close to Ivigtut, the locality of the famous <b>cryolite</b> deposit. Here ikaite occurs in truly spectacular towers or columns (up to [...] tall) growing out of the fjord floor towards the surface water, where they are naturally truncated by waves, or unnaturally by the occasional boat. At the Ikka Fjord, {{it is believed that}} the ikaite towers are created {{as the result of a}} groundwater seep, rich in carbonate and bicarbonate ions, entering the fjord bottom in the form of springs, where it hits the marine fjord waters rich in calcium. Ikaite has also been reported as occurring in high-latitude marine sediments at Bransfield Strait, Antarctica; Sea of Okhotsk, Eastern Siberia, off Sakhalin; and Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. In addition it has been reported in a deep sea fan off the Congo, and therefore probably has worldwide occurrence. The most recent occurrence has been reported by Dieckmann et al. (2008). They found the mineral ikaite directly precipitated in grain sizes of hundreds of micrometers in sea ice in the Weddell Sea and throughout fast ice off Adélie Land, Antarctica. In addition, ikaite can also form large crystals within sediment that grow to macroscopic size, occasionally with good crystal form. There is strong evidence that some of these marine deposits are associated with cold seeps.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four days}} sailing a gale forced Marion to seek shelter at Godhavn where {{the crew was}} granted liberty.

With the unexpected acquisition of fuel, when Marion departed Godhavn, she was able to do so on both engines. After completing a line of sample stations to the north, she returned to top off fuel and water tanks before heading across to Baffin Bay, all the while taking soundings and samples. Samples were taken along the coast of Baffin Island and a [...] line across Davis Strait during the month of August ending at Ivigtut, the site of a <b>cryolite</b> mine that was Greenland's main source of income during that period. After re-provisioning and fueling, she headed back to sea only to be forced to shelter under Mount Kungmat for three days before departing Cape Farewell on a [...] station line to Belle Isle. A storm prevented entering the Strait of Belle Isle so Smith decided to put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, for a liberty and supplies. While en route, Smith managed to run two unscheduled station lines along the Newfoundland coastal shelf. Marion arrived at St. John's on 11 September and departed for New London the next day, her scientific mission accomplished. She arrived at New London on 19 September 1928 after having traveled [...] and taken observations at 191 oceanographic stations with some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity. Numerous bottom samples had been taken and soundings were added to the charts of the area. The Marion expedition observations demonstrated that pack ice had a direct influence on the drift of icebergs. Heavy pack ice along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf waters prevented icebergs from being carried to shore and forced them to enter shipping lanes to the south. Little ice on the shelves allowed the icebergs to ground on the Newfoundland coast, where they were harmless. The expedition {{was the beginning of a}} long involvement by the Coast Guard in Greenland and its surrounding waters.|$|E
