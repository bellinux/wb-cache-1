40|$|The stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} the {{fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant. During the operation of a power plant, stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> are initiated and grown especially in dissimilar weldment of primary loop components. In particular, stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> usually occurs when the following three factors exist at the same time: susceptible material, corrosive environment, and tensile stress (residual stress included).

40|$|Pipelines {{are one of}} {{the safest}} forms of {{transportation}} for oil and gas. However, pipelines may experience some defects, such as <b>cracks,</b> <b>corrosion</b> and <b>cracks</b> in <b>corrosion,</b> during service period. In this thesis, the current defect assessment methods for <b>crack,</b> <b>corrosion</b> and <b>crack</b> in <b>corrosion</b> defects are reviewed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the <b>crack</b> in <b>corrosion</b> defects on the failure pressure of natural gas transmission pipelines. Consequently, a series of burst tests with varying defect depths were undertaken on end-capped, seam-welded API 5 L Grade X 60 (433 MPa yield stress) pipeline steel of external diameter 508 mm (20 inch), 5. 7 mm wall thickness. Defects were created by pre-fatiguing the pipe to create a crack. The number of cycles required to create a fatigue crack were varied between 75000 to 150000 cycles based on the desired final defect depth. For the (CIC) defects, the pipe was pre-fatigued to create a sharp crack, and the artificial corrosion defect was simulated by machining a rectangular groove over the fatigue crack. The rupture tests were conducted by pressurizing the pipe until failure occurred. Results were analyzed using various assessment methods. For the artificial corrosion defects, the predicted failure pressures based on RSTRENG were more reliable than those based on Modified B 31 G. This study revealed that CorLAS provided the least conservative prediction for crack defects, whereas the other methods provided more conservative estimates of failure pressure. Moreover, the predicted failure pressure of the level 3 FAD for API 579 cylinder equations had better agreement with experimental results in comparison with the other methods, i. e. BS 7910 and NG- 18. The failure pressure for CIC defects for pipes tested fell between corrosion defects (lower bound) and crack defects (upper bound). The transition to crack defect behavior only occurs when the crack defect depth is significant or vice versa. It should be noted that the <b>crack</b> to <b>corrosion</b> ratio is not the only parameter to evaluate a CIC defect. There are other parameters such as total defect depth and defect profile, which affect the failure behavior of a CIC defect...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The current {{industry}} {{practice for}} in-service inspection of steam generator (SG) tubing {{is the use}} of eddy current (and in some cases ultrasonic) testing. This is performed when the system is shut down for either maintenance or refueling outages. Thus, the information about the mechanical integrity of SG tubing and structure is not directly available at other times. The development of a sensor suite, using piezoelectric sensor arrays that can be permanently embedded in the tubing and other structures and can be monitored continuously, is presented. Piezo-transducers are used both as actuators and as sensors. They can be either surface-bonded or embedded in the structure. The signal characteristics depend on structural stiffness, damping, and inertia. These in turn are strongly affected by such defects as <b>cracking,</b> <b>corrosion,</b> sediment build-up, or delamination.
