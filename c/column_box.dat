40|$|Summary]: This paper {{studies the}} {{ultimate}} {{strength and ductility}} of short concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> with local buckling effects using a nonlinear fiber element analysis technique. New effective width formulas for determining the ultimate strengths of steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses in concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program {{to account for the}} effects of local buckling. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel box. Performance indices are employed to quantitatively evaluate the section and ductility performance of composite columns. The effects of local buckling, steel ratios and steel yield strengths on the strength and ductility of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> are investigated. It is demonstrated that local buckling significantly reduces the ultimate strength of thin-walled high-strength steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> filled with concrete. The 4 % limit on the steel ratio or the 0. 2 limit on the steel contribution ratio imposed on composite column sections in current design codes leads to the use of very slender steel plates in concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> It is suggested that the section performance index of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> should be as high as 0. 5 for a better structural performance. The use of high strength steels in concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> significantly increases the ultimate strengths of the columns but reduces their ductility...|$|R
50|$|The Mauser Model 1895 is a {{modification}} of the Mauser Model 1893. The flush-mounted staggered <b>column</b> <b>box</b> magazine has a capacity of 5 smokeless powder 7×57mm Mauser cartridges. The magazine can be loaded from a stripper clip, or with individual rounds. The stock has a straight wrist and a handguard which stretches from the receiver ring to the lower barrel band. The upper band has a lug for the Model 1895 bayonet.|$|E
50|$|Mauser went {{two steps}} further in 1892 when he again {{improved}} the bolt design by adding an extractor that prevented double feeding from {{the magazine and}} changed the single <b>column</b> <b>box</b> magazine to a staggered five cartridge box design. The magazine now fit in the rifle without {{any part of it}} protruding in front of the trigger making it less apt to be damaged while still easily and quickly loaded from the five round stripper clips. These improvements were embodied in the Model 1893 (adopted by Spain) and then slight improvements resulted in the 1895/96 model (adopted by Sweden, Mexico, Persia, and the Orange Free State).|$|E

5000|$|The Arsenal M23 submachine gun (Arsenali püstolkuulipilduja) (also {{known as}} Arsenal Tallinn) was an Estonian submachine gun from 1926 through 1935. These submachine guns were {{designed}} and {{produced in the}} Estonian military equipment factory [...] "Arsenal" [...] in Karjamaa, Tallinn, but production was not more than 600 units. The weapon was chambered for the 9x20 mm semi-rimmed Browning cartridge to be compatible with ammunition for the Browning FN M1903 pistol which had been adopted by the Estonian Army. It operated on the blowback system and was essentially similar to the MP18.1; having a wooden stock, slotted barrel jacket, and horizontal left side magazine feed. A uniquely slender 40 round single <b>column</b> <b>box</b> magazine led to frequent cartridge feeding problems; and cooling fins which were machined lengthwise along the barrel to promote cooling air flow when firing (similar to the Lewis machine gun), unnecessarily complicated production. It {{was used by the}} combat support units of the Border Guard, the Estonian Defence League and the Estonian Defence Forces. The Arsenal submachine gun was replaced in Estonian service by the Finnish Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun in 1938. The Estonian Army sold a few samples to Latvia and all of the remainder found their way to Republican forces during the Civil War in Spain.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the post-local buckling behaviour and ultimate strength of steel plates in concrete-filled fabricated <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> is presented. The finite element method is used to predict the post-local buckling response of plates restrained by concrete. Geometric imperfections and residual stresses are considered in the analysis. The model developed is initially compared with a classical solution for clamped plates with initial imperfections. An extensive parametric study is then carried out to investigate the minimum local buckling coefficient {{and the effects of}} geometric imperfections and residual stresses on the post-local buckling strength of clamped steel plates. An effective width model is proposed for the design of clamped steel plates, and this can be used in the determination of the ultimate strength of short concrete-filled <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> Independent test results of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> are compared with the theoretical predictions by using the proposed design model.

40|$|Abstract]: Local {{buckling}} {{of steel}} plates reduces the ultimate loads of concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> under axial compression. The effects of local buckling {{have not been}} considered in advanced analysis methods {{that lead to the}} overestimates of the ultimate loads of composite columns and frames. This paper presents a nonlinear fiber element analysis method for predicting the ultimate strengths and behavior of short concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> with local buckling effects. The fiber element method considers nonlinear constitutive models for confined concrete and structural steel. Effective width formulas for steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program to account for local buckling effects. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel plates. Two performance indices are proposed for evaluating the section and ductility performance of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> The computational technique developed is used to investigate the effects of the width-to-thickness ratios and concrete compressive strengths on the ultimate strength and ductility of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> It is demonstrated that the nonlinear fiber element method developed predicts well the ultimate loads and behavior of concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> and can be implemented into advanced analysis programs for the nonlinear analysis of composite frames...|$|R
