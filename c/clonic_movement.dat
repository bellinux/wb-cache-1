40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} the lateralising value of leg behaviors in complex partial seizures (CPS) of temporal lobe onset. Methods: Videotapes of 123 seizures from 38 {{patients who were}} seizure-free after temporal lobectomy were reviewed. Ictal behaviors including head turning, limb automatisms, tonic/dystonic postures and the latent time for ictal behavior were analysed for their lateralising value. Results: Contralateral versive head turning, ipsilateral arm automatisms, contralateral arm tonic/dystonic posturing, and contralateral arm clonic posturing {{were found to have}} high predictive value of lateralisation. As for the lower limbs, meaningful leg behaviors were recorded in 38 (31 %) of 123 seizures, far less than behaviors of the upper limbs (79 %). The predictive value from leg behaviors were similar to that from upper limbs. Among the leg behaviors, dystonic behaviors were always contralateral to the ictal side. Tonic behaviors were 94 % contralateral to the ictal side. Dystonia and <b>clonic</b> <b>movement</b> were always contralateral to the ictal side. Automatisms were 86 % ipsilateral to the ictal side. Conclusions: Although incidences were low, leg behaviors could provide useful lateralising value of the seizure foci. Clinicians as well as investigators should recognize the value of lower limbs behavior in studies of ictal semiology...|$|E
40|$|Unit {{activity}} was recorded with intraspinal microelectrodes for investigating {{the modes of}} intraspinal conduction of metrazol convulsion in cats, in which succinyl choline chloride was injected to avoid the artefact caused by convulsion. 1) In the early stage, i. e. the tonic convulsion, small spikes about 200 p. s. were seen on the flat base line. 2) In the clonic convulsion, there were seen about 4 to 6 p. s. slow waves, on which about 200 p. s. small spikes and 20 p. s. fast waves were also observed. 3) The 4 to 6 p. s. slow waves corresponded with the rhythm {{and the time of}} appearance of the gross <b>clonic</b> <b>movement.</b> 4) The 20 p. s. fast waves corresponded with the rhythm and the time of appearance of the minute clonic spasm of the muscle, which was only seen in the stage of flexion of the clonic convulsion. 5) The 200 p. s. small spikes could only be recorded from the lateral fascicle, while the 4 to 6 p. s. slow waves could also be obtained even from the anterior fascicle. 6) The 4 to 6 p. s. slow waves synchronized with the electroencephalogram were simultaneously recorded, 7) These patterns of convulsive activity were obtained not only from the lateral fascicle of the thoracic cord, but also from the pyramidal decussation of the medulla and the lateral fascicle of the lumbar cord, and were considered to have their origin in the center above the medulla...|$|E

40|$|Epilepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by sudden, often unexpected transitions from normal to pathological behavioral states called epileptic seizures. Some of these seizures {{are accompanied by}} uncontrolled, often rhythmic movements of body parts when seizure activity propagates to brain areas responsible for the initiation and control of movement. The dynamics of these transitions is, in general, unknown. As a consequence, individuals have to be monitored for long periods {{in order to obtain}} sufficient data for adequate diagnosis and to plan therapeutic strategy. Some people may require long-term care in special units to allow for timely intervention in case seizures get out of control. Our goal is to present a method by which a subset of motor seizures can be detected using only remote sensing devices (i. e., not in contact with the subject) such as video cameras. These major motor seizures (MMS) consist of <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> and are often precursors of generalized tonic-clonic (convulsive) seizures, sometimes leading to a condition known as status epilepticus, which is an acute life-threatening event. We propose an algorithm based on optical flow, extraction of global group transformation velocities, and band-pass temporal filtering to identify occurrence of <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> in video sequences. We show that for a validation set of 72 prerecorded epileptic seizures in 50 people, our method is highly sensitive and specific in detecting video segments containing MMS with <b>clonic</b> <b>movements.</b> This work {{was supported in part by}} the ZonMw agency, The Netherlands, under Grant 300040003...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to attempt {{restoration}} of abduction of a recently denervated left dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle in the horse by anastomosing the first cervical nerve to the abductor branch of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Ten horses {{were used in the}} study. In six horses the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was transected and ligated while the ventral branch of the left first cervical nerve was anastomosed to the abductor branch of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The remaining four horses also had the left recurrent laryngeal nerve transected and ligated but had no nerve anastomosis performed. Each horse was evaluated preoperatively, and at one week, three and six months after surgery, by endoscopy and determination of upper airway resistance. The endoscopy was performed with the horses breathing room air and while breathing 10 % carbon dioxide. All ten horses showed endoscopic signs of complete laryngeal hemiplegia immediately postoperatively. Starting at three months postoperatively <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the left arytenoid cartilage were observed in four of the six reinnervated horses but not in the sham operated horses. At the sixth postoperative month five reinnervated horses had <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the left arytenoid cartilage. The comparison of upper airway resistance measurements before surgery and at one week, three and six months after surgery showed no significant differences in either control or experimental horses.

40|$|AbstractNonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a {{heterogeneous}} disorder with different seizure types and diverse etiologies, and is mainly characterized by altered consciousness. The recognition of NCSE is more challenging than generalized convulsive SE, and {{diagnosis and treatment}} are often delayed. Therefore, some cases can evolve into refractory SE and become pharmacoresistant even with GABAergic anesthetics. Herein we report the successful clinical experience of pharmacoresistant complex partial SE treated with ketamine. An elderly woman was profoundly stuporous and had relentless <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the right hand and forearm. Electroencephalography revealed repetitive periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). There was a poor clinical response to standard anticonvulsants and GABAergic anesthetics.

40|$|AbstractA {{pilot study}} was {{undertaken}} of {{the feasibility of}} continuous EEG monitoring of patients admitted to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for management of status epilepticus or its immediate sequelae. Eight children were studied and seizure activity was recorded in four patients. Additional information influencing management was obtained: the bedside nurse considered decerebrate posturing in one patient to be a seizure: there were no epileptiform EEG changes. Another patient was considered to have seizures (<b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of both upper limbs) following cardiac arrest; the EEG showed electrocerebral silence, and thiopentone treatment was discontinued. In another patient, continuing epileptiform activity on EEG gave intensivists the confidence to use higher than usual doses of thiopentone. The problems encountered were delays in monitoring, once for a CT scan and once because of two admissions within hours of each other. We conclude that EEG monitoring on a PICU is feasible and provides clinically useful information...|$|R
40|$|Reflex anoxic {{seizures}} (RAS) {{are important}} in the differential diagnosis of non-epileptic paroxysmal events in infants and preschool-aged children. They are classically provoked by a sudden distressing stimulus, which causes loss of consciousness followed by stiffening and brief <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> affecting some or all limbs, often misinterpreted as an epileptic seizure. The underlying pathophysiology is a vagal-induced brief cardiac asystole with resultant transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Parents and carers who witness the event are understandably anxious, and the mainstay of management are ensuring the appropriate timely diagnosis of RAS and excluding cardiac arrhythmia. A detailed history from a witness {{is all that is}} needed to diagnose this condition and investigations like EEG or neuroimaging should be avoided.

40|$|AbstractPurposeIctal motor {{phenomena}} play {{a crucial}} role in the localization of seizure focus in the management of refractory focal epilepsy. While the importance of unilateral automatisms is well established, little attention is paid to the contralateral relatively immobile limb. In cases where automatisms mimic <b>clonic</b> or dystonic <b>movements</b> and in the absence of previously well-established signs, unilateral relative ictal immobility (RII) is potentially useful as a lateralizing sign. This study was carried out to examine the lateralizing value of this sign and to define its characteristics among patients of refractory focal epilepsy. MethodsVEEGs of 69 consecutive patients of refractory focal epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery at our center over last four years were reviewed and analyzed for the presence of RII. Unilateral RII was defined as a paucity of movement in one limb lasting for at least 10 s while the contralateral limb showed purposive or semi-purposive movements (in the absence of tonic or dystonic posturing or <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> in the involved limb). The findings were seen in the light of VEEG, radiological and nuclear imaging data, and with post-surgical outcome. ResultsUnilateral RII as a lateralizing sign was found in 24 of 69 patients (34. 78 %), consisting of both temporal and extra temporal epilepsy, with 100 % concordance with VEEG and MRI data. All patients demonstrating this sign had a good post-surgical outcome.

40|$|SummaryCough syncope is a {{well-known}} entity which results in loss of consciousness during episodes of cough. It commonly occurs in patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and asthma. We report a 50 -year-old African American male who presented with a syncopal episode during vigorous bout of coughing. He was noted to have <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> with brief loss of consciousness during this episode. Initially, he was evaluated for seizures but careful history revealed that he had similar episodes in the past with coughing. Physical examination was remarkable for diffuse bilateral wheezing and tachycardia. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflation of the lungs. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension. EEG and CT scan of the head were unremarkable. His bronchodilator regimen was optimized. He was treated with antitussives for the cough and was advised to exhale before coughing. His syncopal episodes resolved on his follow up visits after the discharge. This case demonstrates that cough syncope is a known presentation of severe COPD. It can often be confused with a seizure episode but a careful history is helpful to differentiate it from seizures. Treatment of underlying COPD and cough is associated with resolution of syncopal episodes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT − Frontal lobe {{epilepsy}} {{accounts for}} only 10 - 20 % of the patients in surgical series, but the incidence in non-surgical patient cohorts seems to be much higher. The typical clinical presentation of the seizures includes contralat-eral <b>clonic</b> <b>movements,</b> uni- or bilateral tonic motor activity as well as complex automatism. The yield of surface EEG may be limited due to the difficulty in detection of mesial or basal foci, and the patient may be misdiagnosed as having non-epileptic events. In addition, in patients with mesial frontal foci the epileptiform discharges may be mislateralized (“paradoxical lateralization”). Therefore, epilepsy surgery has been commonly considered as less promising in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy. However, the advent of sophisticated neu-roimaging techniques, particularly MRI with epilepsy-specific sequences, {{has made it possible}} to delineate the epileptogenic lesion and detect a specific etiology, in an increasing number of patients. Thus, the success rate of epilepsy surgery in frontal lobe epilepsy is currently comparable to temporal lobe epilepsy, if the candidates are carefully selected. Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy who do not respond to anticonvulsive medication, and who are not eligible for epilepsy surgery may benefit from alternative approaches such as electrical brain stimulation.

40|$|Increased {{worldwide}} use for paediatric anaesthesia of {{the volatile}} anaesthetic agent sevoflurane has mainly resulted from its low blood-gas partition coefficient and low airway irritability, providing smooth conditions for rapid induction of anaesthesia. Nevertheless, {{there are several}} clinical and experimental reports suggesting a correlation between exposure to sevoflurane and generalized clonic or tonic seizure activity. We report two clinical episodes of convulsions associated with the induction of sevoflurane anaesthesia in young children. Case 1 : during induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane by facemask in a 3 -year-old healthy boy, there were symmetrical <b>clonic</b> seizure-like <b>movements</b> of the upper extremities for 60 s. Case 2 : on re-induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane because of profuse bleeding following nasal adenoidectomy in a 4 -year-old healthy girl with {{a family history of}} epilepsy, there were symmetrical tonic and <b>clonic</b> seizure-like <b>movements</b> for 30 - 40 s in the upper and lower extremities. Both episodes ceased spontaneously. Although no EEG was recorded, it cannot be excluded that both episodes resulted from seizure activity within the CNS. Based on our observations and reports by others we suggest that, until further notice, sevoflurane should be avoided or at least used cautiously in patients where clinical epileptic activity has been verified or is strongly suspected...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In this naturalistic {{study the}} aim was to examine the impact on seizure {{duration}} of stimulus intensity, previous treatments (during the first course of ECT), age, gender, and electrode placement. Method: The database of the ECT Service of the Royal Hobart Hospital was examined for the 15 years ending in 2010. First courses of ECT were identified in which the stimulus intensity was not altered and at least 5 treatments were provided. Seizure duration was determined by cessation of <b>clonic</b> <b>movements.</b> Result: 383 patients (164 males) met selection criteria. A multiple regression analysis revealed that previous treatments, age, gender, and electrode placement had non-significant regression coefficient on the seizure length. The stimulus intensity, however, showed significant regression coefficient (-. 267, p <. 001), indicating that higher stimulus intensity induced shorter seizure duration. Conclusion: It was suggested that electrode placement and the number of treatments had negligible influence on seizure duration, while high stimulus intensity reduced seizure duration. If fixed high dose ECT is being provided, and there is concern due to the brevity of seizures, rather than taking steps to increase the output of the machine, a modest reduction of dose (perhaps to < 428. 4 mC, or < 85...|$|R
40|$|Current {{investigation}} {{describes the}} behavioral and electrographic characteristics of spontaneous absence-like seizures identified in Wistar rats (referred to here as FMUSP-rats, after the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil), and characterized by spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the neocortex and the hippocampus. After consanguineous crossing directed {{to an increased}} incidence of seizures, the latter were observed in almost all F 9 offspring. FMUSP-rat seizures are expressed as immobility and concomitant SWDs, oscillating between 7. 5 and 12 Hz in the frontoparietal cortex and the hippocampus. Behaviorally, they are mainly associated with <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the eyes, rostrum and vibrissae, the latter ranging between 1 and 70 seconds and occur {{at a rate of}} up to 229 per hour. Systemic injections of ethosuximide (0, 25, 50, 100, 250 mg kg- 1) and of diazepam (15 mg kg- 1) increased the latency for the first seizure and reduced both the hourly incidence of SWD bursts and their mean duration. Carbamazepine (30 mg kg- 1) injections increased both the incidence and duration of the SWDs, leaving the latency for the first seizure unchanged. Comparisons between FMUSP-rats and well-established genetic models of absence seizures data indicated that the animals described herein might contribute towards studies on the neurological condition under analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to document convulsant and neurotoxic properties of extracts of a tropical tree, Magnistipula butayei subsp. Montana, and to investigate the involvement of the glutamatergic system in these effects. Continuous behavioral observations and electroencephalographic (EEG) records were obtained after per os administration of an aqueous extract of Magnistipula (MBMAE) in rats. MBMAE (800 mg/kg) induced behavioral changes resembling motor limbic seizures: staring and head tremor, automatisms, forelimb <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> and violent tonic-clonic seizures leading to death in all animals. Concomitantly, important seizure activity that gradually evolved to epileptiform activity was recorded on the EEG. Moreover, c-Fos immunohistochemistry has revealed an increased c-Fos expression in the dentate gyrus and in piriform, peri- and entorhinal cortices 2 and 4 h after treatment. This expression pattern suggested that the mechanism of action for the MBMAE is similar to that observed in glutamate-induced models of epilepsy. The MBMAE increased cell death also in hippocampal cell cultures. Furthermore, the build-up of convulsive activity and epileptic discharges induced by MBMAE in rat were abolished by MK- 801, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Our study suggests that MBMAE contains a potent toxin, with a powerful neurotoxic activity in rat, and corresponding to a new natural component(s) that act as an NMDA-mediated convulsant molecule.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) is {{a common}} {{paroxysmal}} disorder that is often misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder. Head up tilt test (HUTT) {{has been used to}} confirm this diagnosis. There is no data available of its use in children / adolescents from India. AIM: To study the usefulness of the HUTT in children and adolescents with suspected NCS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a part retrospective and later prospective study set in a tertiary child neurology outpatient department (OPD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a strong clinical suspicion of syncope were recruited for the study. Clinical and treatment details were either retrieved from the chart or prospectively recorded in later patients. The HUTT was then carried out at baseline and after provocation and the results correlated with the clinical diagnosis. Results: Eighteen children {{with a mean age of}} 10. 8 years were studied. Eight had precipitating factors. Thirteen had premonitory symptoms. Pallor, temperature change, diaphoresis, headache, tonic / <b>clonic</b> <b>movements,</b> post-ictal confusion and peri-ictal headache were symptoms noticed. Sixteen had a positive HUTT. Seven were on long-term anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Two had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalogram (EEG). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of syncope is often confused with epilepsy.

The first alterations occurred during microinjection of granulitoxin (8 µg) into the dorsal hippocampus and consisted of seizure activity {{that began in the}} hippocampus and spread rapidly to the occipital cortex. This activity lasted 20 - 30 s, and during this period the rats presented immobility. During the first 40 - 50 min after its administration, three to four other similar short EEG seizure periods occurred and the rats presented the following behavioral alterations: akinesia, facial automatisms, head tremor, salivation, rearing, jumping, barrel-rolling, wet dog shakes and forelimb <b>clonic</b> <b>movements.</b> Within 40 - 50 min, the status epilepticus was established and lasted 8 - 12 h. These results are similar to those observed in the acute phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy and suggest that granulitoxin may be a useful tool not only to study the sodium channels, but also to develop a new experimental model of status epilepticus.

40|$|AbstractSubacute {{encephalopathy}} with seizures {{in chronic}} alcoholism (SESA) was first described in 1981 by Niedermeyer who reported alcoholic patients presenting with confusion, seizures and focal neurological deficits and is quite distinct from patients presenting with typical alcohol withdrawal seizures. EEG often reveals periodic discharges and spikes, but SESA presenting with non-convulsive status epilepticus {{has rarely been}} described. We report a case of SESA with non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient who was initially suspected of having a typical alcohol withdrawal seizure. A 61 year old woman {{with a history of}} chronic alcoholism was admitted at an outside hospital for confusion thought to be secondary to an alcohol withdrawal seizure. She had right hemiparesis and later developed right facial twitching that did not respond to intravenous fosphenytoin and levetiracetam. She was transferred for further management. Upon arrival, lorazepam and fosphenytoin were given and right face <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> resolved. However, continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Following treatment with IV valproate and lacosamide, there was resolution of NCSE. SESA is likely an under recognized clinical syndrome that is quite distinct from typical alcohol withdrawal seizures and requires a different diagnostic and management approach. NCSE is likely to account for the encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits seen in patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SESA. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is warranted and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for alcoholic patients with encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits...|$|R
40|$|Strategies {{to induce}} {{recovery}} from lesions of {{the spinal cord}} have not fully resulted in clinical applications. This {{is a consequence of}} a number of impediments that axons encounter when trying to regrow beyond the lesion site, and that intraspinal rearrangements are subjected to. In the present study we evaluated (1) the possibility to improve locomotor recovery after complete transection of the spinal cord by means of an adeno-associated (AAV) viral vector expressing the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in lumbar spinal neurons caudal to the lesion site and (2) how the spinal cord transection and BDNF treatment affected neurotransmission in the segments caudal to the lesion site. BDNF overexpression resulted in clear increases in expression levels of molecules involved in glutamatergic (VGluT 2) and GABAergic (GABA, GAD 65, GAD 67) neurotransmission in parallel with a reduction of the potassium-chloride co-transporter (KCC 2) which contributes to an inhibitory neurotransmission. BDNF treated animals showed significant improvements in assisted locomotor performance, and performed locomotor movements with body weight support and plantar foot placement on a moving treadmill. These positive effects of BDNF local overexpression were detectable as early as two weeks after spinal cord transection and viral vector application and lasted for at least 7 weeks.

Intensity of movements accompany-ing stimulation decreased after NBQX, and <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> accompanying ADs were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose of NBQX disabled the animals; there-fore, the action of this drug on motor skills was studied in another group of animals. Even the dose of 30 mg/kg NBQX interfered with motor performance in 12 - and 18 -day-old rat pups, 25 -day-old rat pups were more resistant to this action. NBQX exhibited only moderate antiepileptic action (suppres-sion of progressive lengthening of ADs) at doses where un-wanted side effects were absent. Most types of epileptic seizures are caused by a distur-bance of equilibrium between excitation and inhibition in {{the central nervous system}} (Heinemann and Jones, 1991). Drugs, which restore this equilibrium, may be effective anti-convulsants. There are two possible ways to restore this equilibrium: potentiation of inhibition or suppression of ex...|$|R
40|$|Guanidinoethanesulfonic acid (GES) {{is known}} to induce convulsive {{seizures}} when administered intracisternally into rabbits and cats. I {{examined the effects of}} GES on behavior, electroencephalogram and brain monoamine levels after intraventricular injection into mice. When GES was intraventricularly injected into mice, focal <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the face, vibrissae and ears, as well as twitchings of limbs were observed 0. 5 - 1 min after injection. Hypersensitivity was observed until 7 min after the injection, after which the mice behaved in a normal way. It is also observed that GES induced sporadic spike discharges in the electroencephalogram. The latency and duration of the appearence of spike discharges showed considerable individual variation. The latency was from 0 to 5 min, and the duration was from 5 to 90 min. No spike discharge was observed in the saline injected animals. The 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) level decreased in the hippocampus, diencephalon, pons-medulla oblongata and cerebellum 5 min after injection, and recovered to the control level 10 min after the injection. No change in the norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) levels was found after GES injection. 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid increased in the striatum and cerebellum 5 min after injection. It is thought that the GES injection enhances the release of 5 -HT in the striatum and cerebellum, although the mechanism of the decrease of 5 -HT in the hippocampus, diencephalon and pons-medulla oblongata is unclear. These results indicate that the GES induced convulsive seizure is related to 5 -HT neurons, not NE or DA neurons...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF- 1) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} autosomal dominant genetic disorder among humans. Moyamoya disease is a cerebral vasculopathy that is only rarely observed in association with NF- 1, particularly in the pediatric age range. The present study reports an occurrence of this association in an infant. CASE REPORT: An eight-month-old female presented convulsive seizures with <b>clonic</b> <b>movements.</b> The patient suffered an ischemic stroke with hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed radiological findings compatible with moyamoya disease. The diagnosis of NF- 1 was made {{at the age of}} 20 months. CONCLUSION: Despite the rarity of this association in childhood, children with focal neurological symptoms and a diagnosis of NF- 1 deserve to be investigated for moyamoya syndrome. CONTEXTO: Neurofibromatose tipo 1 (NF- 1) é a doença genética autossômica dominante mais prevalente no ser humano. A doença de moyamoya é uma vasculopatia cerebral que raramente se encontra associada à NF- 1, particularmente na faixa etária pediátrica. Este estudo descreve a ocorrência desta associação em um lactente. RELATO DE CASO: Paciente feminina, aos oito meses de idade, apresentou quadro de crise convulsiva com movimentos clônicos. Evoluiu com acidente vascular encefálico isquêmico e com hemiparesia à direita. Ressonância nuclear magnética mostrou achados compatíveis com a doença de moyamoya. O diagnóstico de NF- 1 foi realizado aos 20 meses de vida. CONCLUSÃO: Apesar da raridade desta associação na faixa etária infantil, crianças com sintomas neurológicos focais e diagnóstico de NF- 1 merecem ser investigadas para síndrome de moyamoya.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{propagation}} of seizures arising from the cingulate gyrus, as cingulate coverage with interhemispheric subdural electrodes is usually challenging and incomplete due to inherent anatomical and vascular limitations. We present a case of lesional mid-cingulate epilepsy confirmed by stereotactically implanted intracranial depth electrodes and subsequent surgical resection. Hypermotor symptomatology was seen during the first seven seconds of seizure onset while the seizure was still confined to the mid-cingulate gyrus contacts. The patient had brief contralateral <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> as seizure propagated to the primary motor cortex. There was a high concordance between the primary propagation contacts, as delineated by intracranial EEG, and the contacts, with higher coherence values in the connectivity matrix. Interestingly, cingulate-extra-cingulate connectivity and spread to the primary motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex was seen preceding spread to other cingulate contacts, of which one was less than 15 mm from the onset contact. This report is one of a few published, documenting propagation of seizures arising from the mid-cingulate cortex. As illustrated by these data, hypermotor semiology correlated with direct activation of the cingulate cortex. Subsequent seizure propagation activated an extensive extra-cingulate rather than an intra-cingulate epileptogenic network. Interestingly, had the region of onset not sampled, the seizure onset would have appeared as non-localizing widespread rhythms over the fronto-parietal convexities. Further studies to explore the propagation of seizures arising from the cingulate gyrus and the physiological and pathological connectivity patterns within the cingulate gyrus in humans are needed, preferably using stereotactic implantation. Specific targets to be investigated are also discussed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|SvEDa., JUAN M. AND JuLius AXELROD: A {{specific}} and sensitive enzymatic assay for tryptamine in tissues. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 182 : 363 - 369, 1972. A sensitive and specific enzymatic-isotopic method for {{the determination of}} tryptamine content in animal tissues is described. Organ extracts are incubated with S-adenosyl-methiomne-”C {{in the presence of}} an N-methyltransferase, purified from rabbit lung. Under the conditions of the assay N-’ 4 C-methyl- and N, N- 14 C-dimethyltryptamine are the only products extracted in amounts directly proportional to the tissue tryptamine present in the incubation mixture; there is negligible conversion of other amines to radio-active products. With this assay, the levels of endogenous tryptamine were quantified in rat brain and peripheral tissues. Although the role of tryptamine in the body economy is presently unknown, this amine may be of physiological significance. When injected i. p. to rodents pretreated with monoamine oxi-dase inhibitors, as little as 5 to 10 mg of trypt-amine produced mydriasis, decreased curiosity and decreased locomotor activity together with hypotonia, bradypnea and dyspnea and hunch-ing of the back. With higher doses, body tremors, bilateral <b>clonic</b> <b>movements</b> of forepaws and fi-nally backward locomotion and clonic convul-sions occurred (Tedeschi et aL, 1959; Saavedra et at., 1970). When infused i. v. to humans, trypt-amine has been shown to facilitate patellar re-flexes, dilate pupils and increase blood pressure. It also produces changes in perception and sensa-tion resembling those effects obtained after the administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (Martin and Sloan, 1970).
