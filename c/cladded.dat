Seven combinations were tested and six deemed dangerous. It reported back in August 2017 that there are 228 buildings in the United Kingdom <b>cladded</b> using these methods.

An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse, writer-director Joseph fleshes out his characters. However, Drishyam often seems like a radio play, long dialogues mar its cinematic qualities, and like many other helmers, Joseph too does not know where to end his film. Cinema need not be so explanatory; certainly this is not how contemporary movies are made.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} application of continuous coaxial laser <b>cladding</b> by powder injection as a surface treatment or coating process. The investigation aimed to establish {{the relationship between a}} change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> process variables and the geometry and characteristics of an Al- 20 wt-Si single pass <b>clad</b> layer formed on an Al 1370 -F substrate using a Nd:YAG laser. The main process variables considered were: laser power, laser scanning velocity and the powder feed rate. The relationship between a change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> process variables and the geometry and characteristics of the <b>clad</b> layer was established by statistically analysing the variation in the process response with a change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> process variables. The process variables were varied based on a full-factorial, experimentally optimized test matrix. The <b>clad</b> geometry which is mainly defined by: the <b>clad</b> height, width, <b>clad</b> aspect ratio, depth of alloy penetration, and the <b>clad</b> root angle/wetting angle was investigated. In addition to the <b>clad</b> geometry several <b>clad</b> characteristics were investigated such as the dilution of the <b>clad</b> layer in the substrate material, the Vickers microhardness and microstructure of the <b>clad</b> crosssection, the powder efficiency of the process and the amount of visible defects. The study successfully established the relationship between the main laser <b>cladding</b> process variables and the <b>clad</b> geometry and characteristics. The secondary objective of establishing a suitable processing window by considering the relationship mentioned above was only partially met since it is believed that further refinement of the experimental <b>cladding</b> test setup and therefore also the experimental variable test levels is required...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{importance}} of <b>cladding</b> panels on mid-rise buildings in an earthquake-prone region is investigated. A <b>cladding</b> panel acts as a protective or an insulating layer to control weather infiltration. The Northridge Earthquake, which took place on January 17, 1994, caused numerous heavy <b>cladding</b> panels to fall off the walls of residential and commercial buildings. The failure of these panels {{was a result of}} an insufficient understanding of the <b>cladding</b> behaviors as a subsystem in the three-dimensional framing system. <b>Cladding</b> is designed to be isolated from the structural frame movement during an earthquake. However, numerous studies have concluded that <b>cladding</b> interacts with the structural frame in providing lateral resistance. The advantages and disadvantages of different <b>cladding</b> materials, <b>cladding</b> systems, and <b>cladding</b> connections are presented in this thesis. The effects of <b>cladding</b> on mid-rise buildings in the Northridge Earthquake in the Los Angeles area are simulated in this study. Motion resistance contributed from <b>cladding</b> in a particular mid-rise building, a 19 -story office building in downtown Los Angeles, is investigated. Analyses of <b>clad</b> models and unclad models are carried out, and <b>clad</b> models are discovered to displace less than unclad models. Therefore, <b>cladding</b> is able to contribute lateral motion resistance to a building during an earthquake, and structural engineers should include <b>cladding</b> in their analysis models when designing a building. by Chuan-Hua Kuo.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic methods walls control water intrusion: {{moisture}} storage, drained <b>cladding,</b> or face-sealed <b>cladding.</b> Moisture storage {{is typical of}} stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by {{the walls of the}} structure itself. Drained <b>cladding</b> also known as screened walls acknowledges moisture will penetrate the <b>cladding</b> so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the <b>cladding</b> provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. Face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier <b>cladding</b> relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the <b>cladding.</b> Examples of face sealed <b>cladding</b> are the early exterior insulation finishing systems, structural glazing, metal <b>clad</b> panels, and corrugated metal.|$|R

40|$|Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (<b>CLAD)</b> is {{the main}} {{limitation}} to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Although <b>CLAD</b> is usually not responsive to treatment, earlier identification may improve treatment prospects. In a nested case control study, 1 -year post transplant surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were obtained from incipient <b>CLAD</b> (n = 9) and <b>CLAD</b> free (n = 8) lung transplant recipients. Incipient <b>CLAD</b> cases were diagnosed with <b>CLAD</b> within 2 years, while controls were free from <b>CLAD</b> for at least 4 years following bronchoscopy. Transcription profiles in the BAL cell pellets were assayed with the HG-U 133 Plus 2. 0 microarray (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression analysis, based on an absolute fold change (incipient <b>CLAD</b> vs no <b>CLAD)</b> > 2. 0 and an unadjusted p-value ≤ 0. 05, generated a candidate list containing 55 differentially expressed probe sets (51 up-regulated, 4 down-regulated). The cell pellets in incipient <b>CLAD</b> cases were skewed toward immune response pathways, dominated by genes related to recruitment, retention, activation and proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD 8 + T-cells and natural killer cells). Both hierarchical clustering and a supervised machine learning tool were able to correctly categorize most samples (82. 3 % and 94. 1 % respectively) into incipient <b>CLAD</b> and CLAD-free categories. These findings suggest that a pathobiology, similar to AR, precedes a clinical diagnosis of <b>CLAD.</b> A larger prospective investigation of the BAL cell pellet transcriptome as a biomarker for <b>CLAD</b> risk stratification is warranted...|$|R

40|$|The design {{temperature}} of high plutonium concentration ZPPR fuel plates is 600 ˚C. <b>Cladding</b> inte-grity of the 304 L stainless steel <b>cladding</b> {{is a significant}} concern with this fuel since even small holes can lead to substantial fuel degradation. Since the fuel has a higher {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} than the <b>cladding,</b> an investigation of the stress induced in the <b>cladding</b> due to the dif-ferential thermal expansion of fuel and <b>cladding</b> up to the {{design temperature}} was conducted. Small holes in the <b>cladding</b> envelope would be expected to lead to the fuel hydriding and oxidizing into a powder {{over a long period of}} time.
