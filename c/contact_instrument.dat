40|$|Abstract. Membrane Contactor (MC) is a {{well-known}} membrane technology to provide significant advantages required by industries. For MC, a hydrophobic membrane required as a barrier so that liquid absorbent and flue gaseous do not disperse with one another. However, the major concern in hydrophobic membrane is getting swelling by liquid after a short operating period. To minimize the swelling, this study focused on the exploration on membrane fabrication by Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS). As the immersion in solvents {{is one of the}} important step to extract the diluent from membranes pores, the effect of the immersion in methanol was studied. The productions of hydrophobic microporous flat sheets were accomplished by using isotactic Polypropylene (iPP) and two type diluents: Dipenyl Ether (DPE) and Methyl Salicylate (MS). The measurement of hydophobicity of membranes produced was conducted by Test System of JY- 82 Video <b>Contact</b> <b>Instrument.</b> Membranes produced were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The highest hydrophobicity obtained were 124 °(three hours immersed in methanol) and 107 ° (two hours immersed in methanol) by DPE and MS respectively.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of a human-computer interface (HCI) for an expressive contactless musical instrument (using a ToF depth camera) that considers sensory feedback and sensorimotor adaptation {{in comparison with}} a conventional <b>contact</b> <b>instrument.</b> The design uses an intuitive ‘drum membrane’ paradigm for striking musical notes using simple pressing hand gestures on a notional keyboard in free air. In Experiment 1, 5 {{subjects were asked to}} complete a range of musical tasks using two forms of sensory feedback: Auditory-Only, where subjects could only hear the consequences of their pressing gestures, and Visual+Auditory, where subjects could both hear the sounds and receive visual feedback on a computer display. Results showed that Auditory+Visual feedback produced more precise performance (SD = 0. 894) in comparison to Auditory-Only feedback (SD = 3. 507), supporting the importance of a visual feedback element as an aid to natural gesture-based control in HCI. In Experiment 2, a comparison was made between sensorimotor adaptation in the contactless instrument (Visual-Only) and a conventional contact (Visual+Haptic) keyboard instrument. For each instrument, 7 subjects were asked to maintain tones at a perceived constant level (baseline) whilst a parameter (gain) was altered and then later restored. Once restored, the number of presses required to return to baseline was quantified as the after-effect of the adaptation. Results indicated that while design requirements for a contactless instrument may be very different from one that includes physical contact, similar neural mechanisms mediate a user's dynamic adaptation to both types of instrument...|$|E
40|$|PRESENTATION The {{informal}} group GABeC (Georisorse, Ambiente, Beni Culturali - Earth resources, environment, cultural heritage) {{was established in}} 2003 as a <b>contact</b> <b>instrument</b> of Italian mineralogists, petrologists, and economic geologists {{working in the fields}} of Earth resources, environmental applications, and issues related to cultural heritage. Currently the group, which operates under the umbrella of SIMP (Società Italiana di Mineralogia e Petrologia), comprises about 100 researchers, mainly from Universities. The group main activities consist of promoting research and teaching in the pertinent fields through the organization of, and support to, events such as workshops, schools and meetings, and diffusion of relevant news to members. A typical activity is the organization, every other year, of a one-day workshop (Giornata dei giovani ricercatori del GABeC) devoted to presentations by young researchers on a specific topic. In 2010, the theme of the workshop, organized by Giovanna Saviano and held in Rome on 14 June, was the applications of mineralogy and petrology to cultural heritage. The Periodico di Mineralogia, an ISI journal from 2009, kindly offered space in this special issue to publish a selection of papers arising from contributions to the workshop. Annamaria De Francesco and Giovanna Saviano served as Guest Editors for the issue, with the editorial assistance of Antonio Gianfagna, Scientific Editor of the journal. I trust that these papers will attract the interest of a wide audience of national and international scientists working in this field. This special issue will hopefully mark a first step of a fruitful interaction between the GABeC group and the host Journal. Pierfranco Lattanzi, President, GABeC Foreword During the “Giornata dei giovani ricercatori del GABeC” of June 14, 2010, the young researchers presented poster and oral communications concerning the results obtained by the application of both the traditional and innovative analytical methods. In particular, topics related to archaeometric studies on the provenance of the building stones used in very famous archaeological sites (Italy - Spain), and on the technology and sourcing of raw materials used for the production of ancient ceramics of the Lucania region, Italy, were presented. Other contributions focused on the origin of the natural pigments and their degradation in the paintings. The introduction in the workshop of a more complex and complete statistical methodology (multivariate analysis, GIS) of studying and collecting information, also was of relevant importance. In the last years, a considerable volume of new and different data have been collected in a lot of Italian archaeological sites, concerning various topics (materials: terracottas, ceramics, stones, glass, pigments, metals; methods: composition, technology of craftsmanship, provenance of raw materials, restoration, conservation, etc.). Such an increasing of collection data shows a great interest and step forward in the consideration of archaeometric topics. A framework in which new results can be compared and stored will be very useful in order to reconstruct, for instance, ancient commercial routes. Since Italy is a country with a such a rich artistic and archaeological history, it is even more essential to encourage, support, and document these studies.

40|$|Making {{no claim}} to be a {{definitive}} review, a several techniques in nanometrology are examined in order to identify critical challenges for the coming years. First, barriers to the wider application of X-ray interferometry are considered, showing that its use is likely to remain highly specialized. Sub-micrometre surface topography is then used to highlight how basic concepts, sensor technology and analytical software interact to both define and restrict instrument design and International Standards. Measurements should relate to the function of the surfaces, but suffer from poor fundamental understanding of their behaviour. Attempts to reconcile information from stylus <b>contact</b> <b>instruments,</b> from optical instruments and from atomic force microscopes are similarly impeded. Possible approaches to calibration are compared. Consideration of the wider issue of surface integrity shows additional challenges in defining and controlling surface cleanliness and in calibrating nano-friction and nano-harness instruments.

40|$|Abstract] Single Cycle Instrument Placement (SCIP), {{the ability}} to {{autonomously}} approach rocks and place <b>contact</b> <b>instruments</b> within 1 cm of selected features, {{has been identified as}} a high priority for increasing the efficiency and science return for planetary rover surface operations. Because of imprecise localization, it is necessary for a rover to visually keep track of targets, using images from onboard stereo cameras, as the rover navigates to them. “Handoff ” is the problem of matching a tracked point in one camera to the corresponding point in another camera pair. Handoff facilitates visual tracking of a point using multiple camera pairs, allowing at any time the choice of camera pair with the best view of the portion of the scene that is of interest. A significant fraction of the tracking error budget is due to handoff. In this paper, we review several methods for solving what we refer to as the handoff problem and evaluate their performance in the context of integrated planetary rover test beds analogous to the MER Spirit and Opportunity vehicles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{document}} the development of an accurate, affordable, reliable machine to perform the relatively long distance measurements routinely made by land surveyors. Prior to the development of the technology, surveyors used a variety of <b>contact</b> <b>instruments</b> for measurement: ropes, rods, poles, chains and steel tapes. The difficulty of obtaining results on long measurements by contact devices led innovators of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries to develop alternate non-contact methods of measuring: subtense bar, stadia wires and triangulation, all of which came with their own inadequacies. In 1951, Erik Bergstrand, a physicist with the Swedish Geographical Survey Office culminated thirteen years of research by bringing an electronic distance meter which measured distances based on the speed of light to the market. Research efforts undertaken during and after World War II in applied electronics and wave propagation led to the maser, which allowed South Africans Harry Baumann and T. L.
