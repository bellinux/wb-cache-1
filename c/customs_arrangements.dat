40|$|Abstract Did {{incentives}} in Togo’s export {{processing zone}} help firms to increase their technical efficiency? Drawing on incentive and production frontier theories, this article uses unbalanced panel data to estimate a translog stochastic frontier production function, with a diachronic technical inefficiency term. The results show that, in the food and chemical industries, technical efficiency differs according to the incentive scheme. Efficiency is lower for firms operating outside the {{export processing zone}}, when compared to firms operating within it. Factors affecting efficiency include: membership to the export processing zone, the foreign trade ratio, foreign capital investment, wage incentives and hierarchical control. However, by classifying types of employment {{on the basis of}} <b>customs</b> <b>arrangements,</b> we note that firms in the export processing zone tend to promote highly flexible labour practices and offer little job security...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s the European apparel sector has {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of `postcommunist' Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence {{of these changes}} is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East - Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990 s these processes were driven by outward processing trade arrangements between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey. Further liberalization of trade regimes during the 1990 s removed these outward processing <b>customs</b> <b>arrangements,</b> but outward-processing forms of assembly production continue. The authors chart these transformations, and signal {{one part of the}} emerging architecture of trade relations between the EU and ECE after 1989. They explore the trade regulation changes that have provided a context for outsourcing and examine the different strategies of EU retailers and manufacturers in the governance of pan-European apparel production and trade. ...|$|E

The show featured world-renowned pianist Lang Lang who performed a <b>custom</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the musical sensation “Let It Go” (from Disney’s “Frozen“) and China’s television and movie superstar Sun Li who took center stage. The historic event included the debut of an original song, “Ignite the Dreamer Within,” written especially for the grand opening of Shanghai Disneyland.

40|$|Despite the {{preponderance}} of small church choirs, there is a paucity of resources for choral directors of such groups. The unique makeup of small church choirs [...] unbalanced vocal parts and untrained singers [...] presents several challenges for conductors concerned with providing both ensemble members and congregants with a quality experience.

This report provides guidance for developing <b>custom</b> <b>arrangements</b> from hymnals and published octavos to meet the specific needs of the small church choir.

50|$|Carreón's orchestras {{performed}} stock arrangements from Count Basie {{and other}} popular swing bands and performed <b>custom</b> <b>arrangements</b> that distinguished his orchestra in both swing and Latin jazz. The Latin jazz was essentially American big band swing-jazz fused with Afro-Hispanic music — mambo and bolero, in particular. His band's Latin style became a popular trend {{with a few}} other notable Latin oriented Los Angeles big bands that influenced what became salsa. Carreón's band performed in ballrooms around Los Angeles (including the Avadon Ballroom), {{the rest of the}} West Coast, the Southwest — and as far as Texas (including Antonio Valencia's famous Patio Andatuz in San Antonio) and Louisiana — in the 1950s. Several major jazz musicians, early in their careers, performed with his band, including a group of saxophonists that included Teddy Edwards, Herb Geller, Warne Marsh, and Herbie Steward. The legendary composer, Lennie Niehaus, who went on to write for Basie and the film industry, got his first professional job out of high school as a composer and saxophonist with Carreón.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the private}} clubs, the {{orchestra}} also played many high school proms. The formality of a prom was a concern, and many school administrators of the era, {{were reluctant to}} allow Rock groups to perform at these events. Staulcup had a large library of music, mostly <b>custom</b> <b>arrangements</b> written specifically for the orchestra. The majority of the library consisted of jazz standards, with some contemporary Broadway show tunes added as their popularity demanded. As the 1960s progressed, this choice of music began to produce friction between Staulcup and the teenage prom crowds. At the urging of his teenage son, Staulcup began acquiring arrangements of popular, rock oriented songs. Mainly, the ballads of The Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb. The extreme examples of this foray, were the additions of Three Dog Night's, Joy to The World, and Jim Croce's, Bad, Bad, LeRoy Brown.

40|$|Microfluidic laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems {{based on}} a modular {{architecture}} are presented. The architecture is conceptualized on two levels: a single-chip level and a multiple-chip module (MCM) system level. At the individual chip level, a multilayer approach segregates components belonging to two fundamental categories: passive fluidic components (channels and reaction chambers) and active electromechanical control structures (sensors and actuators). This distinction is explicitly made to simplify the development process and minimize cost. Components belonging to these two categories are built separately on different physical layers and can communicate fluidically via cross-layer interconnects. The chip that hosts the electromechanical control structures is called the microfluidic breadboard (FBB). A single LOC module is constructed by attaching a chip comprised of a <b>custom</b> <b>arrangement</b> of fluid routing channels and reactors (passive chip) to the FBB. Many different LOC functions {{can be achieved by}} using different passive chips on an FBB with a standard resource configuration. Multiple modules can be interconnected to form a larger LOC system (MCM level). We demonstrated the utility of this architecture by developing systems for two separate biochemical applications: one for detection of protein markers of cancer and another for detection of metal ions. In the first case, free prostate-specific antigen was detected at 500 aM concentration by using a nanoparticle-based bio-bar-code protocol on a parallel MCM system. In the second case, we used a DNAzyme-based biosensor to identify the presence of Pb 2 + (lead) at a sensitivity of 500 nM in < 1 nl of solution...|$|R
