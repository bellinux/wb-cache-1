Our experimental treatments vary market competitiveness and <b>consumers</b> <b>information</b> on social responsibility in production. We show that irrespective of <b>consumers</b> <b>information</b> SR production reduces monopolistic supplier s profit and is therefore unlikely to emerge. With supplier competition, SR production positively influences consumers buying decisions and suppliers offering SR products achieve significantly higher profits, as long their price is not too high. Our results yield valuable insights into the possibilities and limitations of promoting SR production through consumer behavior, and provide evidence for positive effects of competition on moral behavior...|$|R

The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that [...] "one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300mg, didn't perform {{the same as the}} brand-name pill in the lab." [...] The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that [...] "Budeprion XL 300mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300mg." [...] The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.|$|E

[...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective.
