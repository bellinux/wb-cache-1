2500|$|Thousands {{of breast}} cancer-themed {{products}} are developed and sold each year. Some {{of these items}} are everyday products that have been repackaged or repositioned {{to take advantage of}} <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing,</b> such as teddy bears, clothing, jewelry, candles, and coffee mugs. These blended value objects offer consumers an opportunity to simultaneously buy an object and make a donation to a breast cancer organization. Some of these products are produced and/or sold by breast cancer survivors or charities for fundraising purposes, while others are for profits in addition to fundraising. Manufacturers also produce products with pink labels or pink ribbon logos to donate a sum of money to support the cause. The donation is typically capped so that it is reached after a fixed level of sales, although in some cases the company is providing only free advertising for a selected charity. Although advertising costs are rarely disclosed, some companies have been found to spend far more money advertising [...] "pink products" [...] and tie-ins than they donate to charitable organizations supporting research or patients. For example, in 2005, 3M spent US $500,000 advertising post-it notes printed with a pink ribbon logo. Sales were nearly double what the company expected, but the campaign resulted in a $300,000 donation.|$|E

50|$|Successful democratized {{transactional}} giving is the outgrowth or {{result of}} a fully realized <b>cause-related</b> loyalty <b>marketing</b> campaign which not only links nonprofits and for-profits together, but does so {{in the context of}} an existing company’s loyalty program. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cause-related</b> loyalty <b>marketing</b> is {{a recent}} trend in cause marketing. As the name implies, CLM is the {{marriage}} of cause marketing and loyalty programs. Cause marketing occurs when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause. Recent examples include Nike, Inc. partnering with Livestrong, athlete Lance Armstrong’s cancer-fighting foundation, and Eastman Kodak teaming with stationery designer Bonnie Marcus in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. CLM, however, takes these donations and corporate social responsibility efforts one step further, wedding them to thousands of customer loyalty programs. Rather than requiring the outlay of funds from donors, CLM essentially “recycles” loyalty program members’ unused points or miles. It then converts them into usable currency for a cause of the loyalty members’ choosing.|$|R

A high-profile form of <b>Cause-Related</b> <b>Marketing</b> occurs at checkout counters when customers are asked to support a cause with a charitable donation. Cause marketing differs from corporate giving (philanthropy), as the latter generally involves a specific donation that is tax-deductible, while cause marketing is a promotional campaign not necessarily based on a donation.|$|E

A qualitative content analysis was utilized to analyze the outreach programs of the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB as described on each website. A directed content analysis was used to categorize outreach programs as CRM, social marketing or other community outreach based on five variables that differentiate each strategy. Forty three programs were evaluated. Twenty two (51. 2 %) were categorized as social marketing, eight (18. 6 %) as CRM and thirteen (30. 2 %) as other community outreach.

40|$|Purpose - <b>Cause-related</b> and {{affinity}} <b>marketing</b> {{are based}} on the assumption that linking a commercial organisation's product with a non-profit organisation enhances the product's appeal and provides differentiation from rival offers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficacy of this premise. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth qualitative research was conducted to explore the construction of consumer value in affinity credit cards, followed by large-scale quantitative research to assess the prevalence of the perceptions and behaviour patterns identified. Findings - Linked products offer a range of individual and group benefits, both functional and symbolic. However, the value placed on these benefit categories varied according to the type of affinity group. Research limitations/implications - Whilst encompassing a wide range of affinity categories, all of the affinity credit cards were issued by one financial services organisation. Variation is therefore possible between the benefits offered by other financial services organisations operating affinity schemes. Practical implications - The findings demonstrate the need to identify the value perceived by different groups of consumers of affinity products and to tailor affinity products to the type of affinity organisation with which they are linked. Originality/value - A key strength is the research's access to card holders from a wide spectrum of affinity categories. This has proved elusive in prior research. The paper challenges the assumption that linking a product to a non-profit organisation enhances its appeal and provides a basis for differentiation. The efficacy of this premise depends on the type of cause or affinity group, with the value placed on benefit categories varying accordingly. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

Because the pink ribbon is not licensed by any corporation, it is more open to being abused by businesses that donate little or none of their revenue to breast cancer research. While companies such as Estée Lauder have distributed over 70 million pink ribbons, and donated over $25 million to breast cancer research, other companies have been discovered using the pink ribbon inappropriately—either by not donating their profits, or by using the pink ribbon on products that include ingredients which cause cancer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> is a {{powerful}} marketing tool that business and nonprofit organizations are increasingly leveraging.

5000|$|The recent {{interest}} in <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> {{is generally argued}} to stem from American Express, who apparently coined the phrase in 1983. Following various pilot schemes in 1981, American Express developed a campaign which donated funds {{to a number of}} different non-profit organizations as part of the San Francisco Arts Festival. Essentially every time someone used an American Express Card in the area, a 2-cent donation was triggered and each time new members applied for a card a larger contribution was made. The marketing goals that American Express had for this programme were apparently exceeded. Card usage was reported as having increased significantly and relationships between American Express and their merchants also improved {{as a result of the}} promotion. From the charity's point of view, despite being a short-term campaign, $108,000 was raised, making a significant contribution to their work. The terms [...] "cause-related marketing" [...] and [...] "cause marketing" [...] continued to grow in usage since that time.

50|$|McCormick rejoined Lifetime Television in 1986, where, {{through a}} series of promotions, {{ultimately}} became Lifetime’s president and CEO in 1993. McCormick dropped Lifetime Medical Television and turned Lifetime into a seven-day brand name network. In 1994, he overhauled network programming, appointing Judy Girard as senior vice president of programming to fill the vacancy left by Patricia Fili-Krushel. That same year he made significant brand changes by creating the network positioning, “Television for Women”, putting Lifetime “on the map” as the first and dominant women’s programming channel. Among milestones achieved during his years as Lifetime CEO, he launched the Intimate Portrait (TV series) and brought the WNBA to Lifetime. During his tenure as CEO, Lifetime gained national prominence for sponsoring and creating programming for the all-women’s team in the America’s Cup, expanded the Lifetime Original Movies to a monthly franchise and launched a slate of original series dealing with important topics such as racism and single parenthood - all gaining Emmy award attention for Lifetime. He is also credited with conceiving and launching Lifetime Movie Network in 1998. McCormick earned a reputation as a leader in women’s community and <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> by fostering programming and social awareness dedicated to breast cancer, gaining support from the Ms. Foundation for Women, Senator Bill Bradley and former first lady at the time, Hillary Clinton. At the end of his tenure, Lifetime was rated the number one cable network among women aged 18 to 49 in both prime time and total-day viewing.

40|$|International audiencePurpose – <b>Cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> – linking product sales with {{donations}} to a cause – are popular with consumers because they produce warm-glow feelings (the positive route). But when they involve large donations, they may trigger consumer scepticism, reducing the warm glow (the negative route). Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether large donations in <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> can produce consumer scepticism and reduce the warm-glow effect and positive attitude towards the retailer. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment varying the donation size (large, medium, small) in a <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> offer run by an office equipment retailer is set up. Hypotheses are tested using bootstrapping regression analyses. Findings – The negative route has the greater effect: scepticism towards the offer mediates the relationship between donation size and the warm glow. Furthermore, scepticism towards a large donation is higher (lower) for respondents scoring low (high) on altruism and high (low) on familiarity with <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing.</b> Practical implications – When using <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing,</b> retailers should choose their features and target audience carefully in order to reduce scepticism, e. g., small donations should be offered in promotions targeting consumers who are familiar with <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> and show low altruism. Originality/value – This study contributes to the recent research examining the negative effects of <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> by explicitly conceptualising and measuring scepticism towards <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing.</b> The findings are also valuable because they indicate the importance of a shift in focus, away from the conventional question of <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> effectiveness to the more specific and under-investigated problem of the appropriate core target consumers...|$|E

Companies belong to communities where they develop their activities. When the social goals of the communities are related to the main objectives of the company, sustaining a social cause could produce economic benefits, in this case corporate philanthropy and shareholders interest take the same direction. <b>Cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> is a marketing concept that gained more interest in the last three decades and exemplifies how social and economic objectives are achieved in a strategic manner in promoting campaigns. Researches in business and non-profit organizations reveal that <b>cause-related</b> <b>marketing</b> campaigns sustain the growth of market share and sales, and help at improving brands image.
