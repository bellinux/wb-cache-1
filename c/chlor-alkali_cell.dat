40|$|Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA®’s) {{are widely}} {{employed}} in the chlor-alkali technology and may be of interest also galvanic industry, as alternatives to lead anodes, owing to their good electrocatalytic properties and excellent wear-resistance under drastic electrolysis conditions ([1 - 3] and literature therein). The catalytically active components of the electrode films are VIII B group metals oxides (RuO 2 and IrO 2 in particular), which also afford good electric conductance to the electrode material. Other ceramic components, like TiO 2, ZrO 2, Ta 2 O 5 and SnO 2, (valve metal oxides) are added {{in order to increase}} the film wear resistance and achieve a better dispersion of the catalyst. RuO 2 -based electrodes are employed for chlorine evolution, while IrO 2 -based ones, because of their higher electrochemical stability under anodic oxygen evolution conditions, could find application as anodes in galvanic processes and electrowinning [5, 6]. The papers appeared in the last 25 years showed that the physical and chemical properties of DSA® materials are strongly influenced by a number of parameters, like the nature of the precursor salts and their solution, the oxidation temperature, the pyrolysis time, the kind of metal support {{and the nature of the}} stabiliser [7 - 9]. The last one in particular plays a very important role in the DSAs designing, since contributes both to the device stability and on its catalytic properties [1]. The employment of glass-former oxides like Ta 2 O 5, in particular, seems to improve the stability of the noble-metal oxide, possibly hindering its dissolution during the electrolysis [5]. The most widely used stabiliser in DSA®’s synthesis is TiO 2 [1 - 3], which, however, seems to be more interesting in the preparation of electrodes for <b>chlor-alkali</b> <b>cells.</b> The performance of TiO 2 -stabilized mixed-oxide electrodes under oxygen evolution conditions, is in fact unsatisfactory. For this reason research has been extended to other stabilisers, like ZrO 2 [7, 8] and Ta 2 O 5 [5, 6]. Ta 2 O 5 is of particular interest, due to its property of glass-former oxide [9]. The goal of this work is to investigate in detail the compositional and structural properties IrO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 /Ti anodes, with different nominal composition, by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate electrochemical surface area of the films and get some indication on their electrocatalytic activity, as a function of IrO 2 content. Ref. 1. S.

H. The cell house has been demolished, ground-water flow impeded by installation of an up-gradient-slurry wall, and capped with an impermeable geomembrane. Mercury has been removed from fractures at the surface on the riverbank five times; however, more continues to be found. Potential pathways for movement of mercury and ground water were indicated with the results of a geohydrologic study. The study demonstrates the integration of geophysical surveys, geologic mapping, and water-level monitoring in three areas: (1) the riverbank, (2) the site perimeter, and (3) the capped area. Results from ground-penetrating radar and two-dimensional-resistivity surveys along the riverbank indicate electrically conductive zones that are interpreted as bedrock fractures, which are potential ground-water-flow paths. Geologic mapping along the riverbank shows that bedrock fracturing is more prevalent in gneiss than pegmatite and is associated with schist in shear zones that correspond to geophysical anomalies. Nearly horizontal anomalies in ground-penetrating-radar survey results beneath areas mapped as pegmatite may represent locations where vertical fractures in gneiss terminate on a horizontal fractured contact between gneiss and pegmatite. Significant hydraulic connections were identified by analysis of stage changes in the Androscoggin River and bedrock water levels. Assessment of hydraulic heads in bedrock and overburden show vertical ground-water gradients in both directions. Resistivitysurvey results along the site perimeter indicate fractures and overburden-filled bedrock troughs where ground water may bypass a slurry wall. Overburden water levels and discharge from a drainage pipe suggest that ground water is passing through or beneath the slurry wall.

It is addressed by several existing international agreements addressing atmospheric emissions (CLRTAP), the marine environment (OSPAR, HELCOM, Barcelona, Bucharest), waste (Basel), and export of chemicals (Rotterdam). It can be brought into the biosphere by humans by two different mechanisms: 1) intentional extraction and use, and 2) as a natural constituent in other materials. Mercury is extremely toxic to both man and biota and can be transformed within the aquatic environment into more toxic organic compounds (e. g. methyl mercury). A main pathway of mercury to the sea is atmospheric and it can be carried long distances from its source.

Nevertheless, the average energy demand with {{the current state of}} the art of this technology is 2292 kWh/tCl 2 at 6 kA/m 2. Consequently, any reduction of the electrical energy demand in chlor-alkali electrolysis would be highly desirable for both economic and environmental reasons. Replacing hydrogen evolving reaction by oxygen reduction reaction can reduce the energy demand by approximately 30 %. In this work mathematical models for steady and dynamic operation of an industrial scale <b>chlor-alkali</b> electrolysis <b>cell</b> with ODC are developed. The steady state model predicts the distributions of temperature, concentration, current density, and overpotential as a function of height. At an industrially relevant current density of 4 kA/m 2 neither current density nor overpotentials exhibit strong variations along the cell height. Main reason for this behaviour is the uniformity of temperature distributions in the solid compartments of the cell (anode, membrane, ODC) which can be explained by efficient heat transfer between the electrodes and the electrolyte streams. This is especially true for the caustic solution, through which most of the irreversible heat released in the cell is removed. However, the temperature of the oxygen stream increases slowly along the height. Due to the initially low temperatures and the low water content of the inlet oxygen stream, the gas phase takes up considerable net amounts of water vapor. Nevertheless, the oxygen partial pressure at the electrochemically active regions of the ODC remains high allowing for efficient operation of the cathode. Operating cell at higher current requires better heat management as the heat production is performance of the electrode significantly. The dynamic model also predicts the performance of the electrode under the ripple voltage. However, Current Interruption (CI) measurements have been used to validate this model.

40|$|Electrochemical {{techniques}} provide {{convenient and}} environmentally compatible ways of bringing about chemical transformations. However they generally lose their economic viability when used with low conducting electrolyte systems. This has limited their usefulness {{in the treatment}} of water and wastewater. Increasing the electrolyte concentration of these systems is not an option as it is with industrial processes such as the <b>chlor-alkali</b> process. <b>Cell</b> resistance is the major limiting factor. Cell resistance can be reduced by reducing the inter-electrode gap. A novel micro gap perforated electrode flow through (PEFT) cell has been developed for efficient and cost effective treatment of aqueous systems of low ionic strength. The PEFT cell is an undivided flow through design which encompasses both parallel plate and porous electrode features. It consists of plate electrodes and flow is both through the electrodes and parallel to the surfaces of the two electrodes. The perforations in the electrodes and the short flow distance between the electrodes allow the inter-electrode gap to be reduced to 50 microns and less without causing excessive resistance to hydraulic flow. With reduced electrical resistance, effective electrochemical treatment of natural water and other low electrolyte systems is possible. The PEFT cell was first applied to overcome a local water supply problem, the Waikato region’s iron and manganese contaminated bore waters. These waters form stable colloidal suspensions during slow air oxidation. The problem can be overcome by rapid electrochemical oxidation using the PEFT cell. Electrochemical oxidation was found to be more effective and efficient than chemical oxidation allowing removal of iron and manganese to meet drinking water standards with minimal formation of disinfection by-products (DBP). Electrochemical oxidation of water and wastewater systems is brought about principally by chlorine mediated indirect oxidation processes. A 240 µm gap PEFT cell, with a graphite anode was used for chlorine generation. It produced chlorine at current efficiencies above 60 % with an energy consumption of 4. 83 kWh/kg of chlorine from a 0. 5 mol/L NaCl solution. This result compares well with industrial hypochlorite production using an undivided cell. Chlorine mediated electro-oxidation of effluents was successfully demonstrated by the degradation of textile dyes in water. Complete single pass electrochemical decolourisation of indigo carmine (IC) dye effluent containing 0. 35 mol/L NaCl was achieved using a graphite anode PEFT cell. Energy consumption was 0. 8 kWh/m 3 or 8. 3 kWh/kg of dye. This is an order of magnitude less than the energy consumption reported for colour removal using graphite anodes. It is comparable or lower than most colour removal work carried out using metal oxide coated dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) and boron doped diamond (BDD) anodes. Reduction of pH from 7 to 3 reduced the energy consumption for decolourisation of IC dye by 50 % and also increased the TOC removal by 20 %. When NaSO 4 was used as the electrolyte rather than sodium chloride, colour removal was much less effective. A single pass through a 50 µm gap PEFT cell with a stainless steel cathode and a graphite anode operated at 5. 5 V achieved a 6 log inactivation of Escherichia coli bacteria in a water sample containing only 1. 7 mmol/L of chloride ions. The power consumption was 0. 5 kWh/m 3 of water. The narrow inter-electrode gap allows high electric fields to be produced from low applied voltages. When the cell was operated at above 5. 0 volts, a synergistic electric field effect was observed. Specific lethality of the chlorine was increased to at least 50 L/(mgmin), approximately two orders of magnitude higher than {{in the absence of the}} field. Increased specific lethality means that disinfection can be achieved at much lower free available chlorine levels than previously possible. This reduces the risk of DBP formation. Improved current efficiencies and reduced energy consumption for electrolysis at low electrolyte concentrations were achieved by partial insulation of the active anode surface of a 50 µm gap PEFT cell. This electro-catalytic effect was consistent with enhanced transport of the electroactive species to the active part of the electrode, reducing concentration and resistance overpotentials. In the electrochemical production of chlorine from 0. 85 mmol/L NaCl at a current density of 2 mA/cm 2, current efficiency was tripled and power consumption was reduced by a factor of two, relative to the cell without the anode modification. The reduction in the inter-electrode gap to 50 µm and less has allowed the production of electric field strengths greater than 10 kV/cm from applied voltages of less than a 100 V. Field strengths between 1 and 10 kV/cm are known to cause reversible electroporation whereas irreversible electroporation occurs above 10 kV/cm. Evidence for irreversible electroporation was provided by the 6 log inactivation of Escherichia coli (in the absence of chlorine) at an applied electric field of 22. 5 kV/cm generated in a 40 µm gap PEFT cell by a 90 V DC supply. The energy consumption was 430 J/mL and without cooling, the temperature remained below 42 oC. Inactivation was achieved by 20 hydrodynamically generated DC pulses. The low applied voltage, the elimination of the need for pulsed electric fields, avoidance of external cooling and the simplicity of the experiment bring commercial non thermal electro-pasteurisation one step closer...|$|R
