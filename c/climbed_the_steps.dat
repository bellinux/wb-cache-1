25|$|As soon as {{the hijackers}} left the ship Marilyn Klinghoffer rushed to the {{infirmary}} looking for Leon. Not finding him the staff informed her to ask the captain who {{was still on the}} bridge. Klinghoffer <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> on the infirmary's level – {{near the bottom of the}} ship, all the way to the bridge – near the top of the vessel. Captain De Rosa informed her of her husbands murder. Klinghoffer collapsed uncontrollably sobbing, friends helped her to her cabin.|$|E
25|$|At the Ministry, a tank {{made its}} way to the main entrance, <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> into the building, and started firing on offices. Sergeant Rafael Veillena, of the Army's Second Division, was killed when he looked out a ninth-floor window. The firing of machine guns and tanks panicked workers in the area, who at that hour were making their way to their jobs downtown. A woman working at the State Bank near the Ministry was killed, as well as a couple who were caught in cross-fire. At least 16 people were wounded, four seriously. A group of foreign journalists {{covering}} the reforms carried out by Allende's government was {{caught in the middle of}} the insurrection. While filming the events outside La Moneda, Argentine cameraman Leonardo Henrichsen and his colleague Jan Sandquist were fired at by corporal Héctor Hernán Bustamante Gómez and several soldiers. Henrichsen was fatally shot by a soldier, who was never identified. Before collapsing in the arms of Sandquist, Henrichsen recorded the military foot patrol firing at him. The footage was recovered by Sandquist and showed on the Argentine television on 24 July.|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You {{should be ashamed of}} yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{condition}} {{required for the}} drive wheel to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> was analyzed. As previously described, for the drive wheel to <b>climb</b> over <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> <b>the</b> wheelchair has to first perform a wheelie motion, for which the design condition has already been obtained. Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, the drive wheel can also <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>step.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>step</b> {{was first}} <b>climbed</b> unaided in 1985, by the Catalan Òscar Cadiach. He {{assessed}} the final rock face as 5.7 to 5.8 (V+ in UIAA classification).Theo Fritsche, an Austrian, <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> in 2001 free solo on-sight {{and came to}} a similar conclusion. Conrad Anker <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Step</b> in 1999 and assessed the level of difficulty as 5.10. On this ascent Anker supported himself using the Chinese ladder. In 2007, Anker repeated <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> with Leo Houlding; this time, however, he first removed the ladder in order to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> unaided.|$|R

60|$|The Judge steadied {{himself on}} his hickory stick and walked off without a word. For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him. Then he slowly <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Helena, Louisa, and Olive <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> {{to go to}} the South-Western platform. They were {{laden with}} dress-baskets, umbrellas, and little packages. Olive and Louisa, at least, were in high spirits. Olive stopped before the indicator.|$|E

60|$|I <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> The wide {{vestibule}} {{was empty}} except for two men who stopped a low-toned conversation to look at me. I wondered whether they recognized me; that I might be recognized was an alarming possibility which had not occurred to me.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned the}} final {{corner in the}} drive, <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> and entered the hall. The {{servants}} were standing about as usual. There {{was no sign of}} anything having happened. They looked at him curiously, but that might well be, owing to his dishevelled condition.|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{emerged from}} the drive and <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> The manservant came down two steps and took the little bag. Then he ushered Aaron and the big bag into a large, {{pillared}} hall, with thick Turkish carpet on the floor, and handsome appointments. It was spacious, comfortable and warm; but somewhat pretentious; rather like the imposing hall into which the heroine suddenly enters on the film.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{continued to}} function until 1984, {{when it was}} taken out of service. The lighthouse is now open to visitors who can <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to <b>the</b> lantern room, if they wish, or see the Visitors' Centre.|$|R
5000|$|In older days pilgrims used to <b>climb</b> all <b>the</b> seven hills {{only through}} <b>the</b> <b>stepped</b> way on foot, {{as there was}} no other option. Hence the pilgrims came from long {{distances}} used to take rest for some time there, cooked their food, eat there. After taking rest they started to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|R

60|$|The scene {{had shifted}} suddenly, as do all scenes in moving pictures. Now was shown the {{platform}} of the Oak Run railroad station. The train was coming in, {{and there were}} Sam and Tom as natural as life, dresssuit cases in hand, ready to get aboard. The train stopped and some passengers alighted, and Tom and Sam <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the last car.|$|E
60|$|They <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> tottering {{now with}} age and disuse, and Virginia playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been wont to polish until it shone. Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock. The door swung open, and Virginia stood {{in the hall of}} her ancestors.|$|E
6000|$|She {{went upstairs}} then, tearing off her {{turquoise}} engagement ring as she <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> All sorts of wild ideas flashed through her head. She {{would go down}} and confront Vivienne LeMar--she would rush off and find Spencer and throw his ring at him, no matter where he was--she would go away where {{no one would ever}} see her again. Why couldn't she die? Was it possible people could suffer like this and yet go on living? ...|$|E

60|$|The banker <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of {{the moving}} train and {{disappeared}} in a coach. Uncle Bushrod stood motionless, still embracing the precious satchel. His eyes were closed and his lips were moving in thanks to the Master above for the salvation of the Weymouth honour. He knew Mr. Robert would return {{when he said he}} would. The Weymouths never lied. Nor now, thank the Lord! could it be said that they embezzled the money in banks.|$|E
60|$|Jacob {{did as he}} was told, {{drank some}} {{champagne}} cup, lit a cigarette, and began to realise that he was having a very pleasant time. Lady Mary chattered on gaily, telling Jacob who many of the people were and exchanging greetings with a number of friends. Presently, at her suggestion, they walked in the paddock, where she pointed out to him the most wonderful of the toilettes, and {{it was not until the}} bell rang for the last race that they <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> once more to the box.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} rattletrap pulled {{up at the}} sidewalk, {{the wheels of the}} near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread the umbrella. They were in front of a rather {{imposing}} house of brick, flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools. They <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> and rang the bell. In due time the door was opened by a smiling yellow butler in black.|$|E

50|$|In campus lore, if {{a student}} ascended <b>the</b> front <b>steps</b> of <b>the</b> Main Building before graduation, that student was doomed never to graduate. This legend stems from traditionalist smoking rituals. Students were not deemed worthy to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> and smoke with their professors until they {{received}} their degrees and were educational equals.|$|R
50|$|The {{woman who}} is about to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of <b>the</b> {{building}} is modeled after a figure from the right-hand panel of Hieronymus Bosch's 1500 triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights. This panel is individually titled Hell; a portion of it was recreated by Escher as a lithograph in 1935.|$|R
60|$|Major Dunlop, {{who was a}} very {{powerful}} and active man, lifted Ned on his shoulders, and began to ascend the narrow steps to the dome. It was hard work at first, but as {{he got on the}} ascent became less steep, and the last part was comparatively easy. Colonel Warrener mounted next, also heavily laden. Dick remained on guard at the door until he saw his father pass the shoulder of the dome, out of sight from those on the terrace; he then slung two muskets and cartridge pouches on his shoulders, briskly <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> and was soon by his father.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was shining}} brilliantly {{and the sky was}} {{cloudless}} as Richard turned his automobile into the grounds of the Villa Mimosa, soon after nine o'clock on the following morning. The yellow-blossomed trees, slightly stirred by the west wind, formed a golden arch across the winding avenue. The air was sweet, almost faint with perfume. On the terrace, holding a pair of field-glasses in her hand and gazing intently out to sea, was Fedora. At the sound of the motor-horn she turned quickly. She looked at the visitor in surprise. A shade of pink was in her face. Lane brought the car to a standstill, jumped out and <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the terrace.|$|E
60|$|There fell another silence, as {{absolute}} as the first, when Mr. Hill {{walked down}} the aisle and <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> Indeed, people were stupefied, for the feed dealer was a man who had never opened his mouth in town-meeting; who had never taken an initiative of any kind; who had allowed other men to take advantage of him, and had never resented it. And now he was going to speak. Would he defend the prudential committee, or would he declare for the teacher? Either course, in Mr. Hill's case, required courage, and he had never been credited with any. If Mr. Hill was going to speak at all, he was going to straddle.|$|E
