Iteron plasmids <b>control</b> <b>copy</b> number through two combined methods, suitable for low copy number stringent plasmids. One method is control of RepA synthesis. RepA {{is the only}} plasmid-encoded protein required for replication in pSC101. RepA protein represses its own synthesis by binding to its own promoter region and blocking transcription of itself (transcriptional autoregulation). Thus, the more RepA is made, the more its synthesis is repressed, and subsequently limiting plasmid replication. The coupling hypothesis proposes that the second method is coupling of plasmids through the Rep protein and iteron sequences. When the plasmid concentration is high, RepA plasmids bound to iterons form dimers in between two plasmids, [...] "handcuffing" [...] them at the origin of replication and inhibiting replication.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} gene {{disruptions}} and nuclease probes {{to assess the}} roles of yeast 2 micron plasmid genes in plasmid chromatin organization. The chromatin structure at the replication origin is not dependent {{on any of the}} four major open reading frames, A, B, C, or D. While stable plasmid maintenance is known to depend on a cis-acting locus STB and genes B and C, we find that only gene B influences STB chromatin. Other interactions between plasmid gene products and sequences may reflect gene regulation: the chromatin organization at the 5 ' end of gene A, which codes for a site-specific recombinase, depends on both gene B and gene C. Since disruption of gene C results in an increase in plasmid copy number that is dependent on gene A, we propose that gene C (and probably gene B) <b>control</b> <b>copy</b> number by regulating the level of the gene A recombinase...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the suitability of reference or housekeeping genes as internal controls in real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays for quantification of target mRNAs, we studied the levels of expression of four candidate reference genes in maritime pine by real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels obtained for glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate-dehydrogenase, 18 S ribosomal RNA, eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF 4 AII and ubiquitin in nine stages of embryo development revealed that none of the genes tested proved to be suitable as an internal <b>control.</b> <b>Copy</b> number quantification of the four transcripts showed an average relative variation of seven fold. We propose that the combination of a precise method for RNA quantification, internal controls for monitoring RT reaction and PCR efficiency and a robust external standard curve can guarantee a reliable absolute quantification of mRNA transcripts in real time RT-PCR. This approach may avoid the controversy in the use of housekeeping genes and may assume special significance in tissues undergoing developmental changes...|$|E
40|$|The 2 micron plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{maintained}} {{by the action of}} plasmid-encoded gene products that <b>control</b> <b>copy</b> number and promote equipartition of plasmid copies at cell division. We show that the REP 1 and REP 2 plasmid-encoded gene products are master regulators that act in concert to autoregulate the level of their own transcripts and to regulate transcript levels of the FLP gene that promotes plasmid copy amplification. REP 1 and REP 2 are also shown to repress transcription at REP 3, the cis-acting site essential for plasmid equipartitioning. We propose a model in which REP 3 acts by dislodging transcription apparatuses that otherwise cause plasmid molecules to adhere to the mother nucleus and segregate asymmetrically. On the basis of their ability to generate specific chromatin structures, we also propose that the REP 1 and REP 2 gene products interact with different specific sequences found iterated in the 2 micron plasmid...|$|E
40|$|Dominant human genetic {{diseases}} that impair reproductive fitness and have high locus heterogeneity constitute {{a problem for}} gene discovery because the usual criterion of finding more mutations in specific genes than expected by chance may require extremely large populations. Heterotaxy (Htx), a congenital heart disease resulting from abnormalities in left-right (LR) body patterning, has features suggesting that many cases fall into this category. In this setting, appropriate model systems may provide a means to support implication of specific genes. By high-resolution genotyping of 262 Htx subjects and 991 controls, we identify a twofold excess of subjects with rare genic copy number variations in Htx (14. 5 % vs. 7. 4 %, P = 1. 5 × 10 − 4). Although 7 of 45 Htx copy number variations were large chromosomal abnormalities, 38 smaller copy number variations altered a total of 61 genes, 22 of which had Xenopus orthologs. In situ hybridization identified 7 of these 22 genes with expression in the ciliated LR organizer (gastrocoel roof plate), a marked enrichment compared with 40 of 845 previously studied genes (sevenfold enrichment, P < 10 − 6). Morpholino knockdown in Xenopus of Htx candidates demonstrated that five (NEK 2, ROCK 2, TGFBR 2, GALNT 11, and NUP 188) strongly disrupted both morphological LR development and expression of pitx 2, a molecular marker of LR patterning. These effects were specific, because 0 of 13 control genes from rare Htx or <b>control</b> <b>copy</b> number variations produced significant LR abnormalities (P = 0. 001). These findings identify genes not previously implicated in LR patterning...|$|E
