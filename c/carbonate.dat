40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the thermal {{physical}} properties of ternary <b>carbonates,</b> potassium, lithium, and sodium <b>carbonates</b> were modified by adding additives CaO, CaCO 3, Ca(OH) 2 and KOH. Their melting point, initial crystallization point, and decomposition temperature were analyzed by using the Synchronous Thermal Analyzer. Although the additives have less influence on the initial crystallization temperatures and the decomposition temperatures of ternary <b>carbonates,</b> they have different effects on the melting point of ternary <b>carbonates.</b> For concentrating solar power, KOH {{could be a good}} candidate of practical additive to expand the work temperature range of ternary <b>carbonates</b> by reducing melting point in a great extent...|$|R

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium <b>carbonate</b> becomes more soluble with pressure, so <b>carbonate</b> shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium <b>carbonate</b> also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the <b>carbonate</b> compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium <b>carbonate</b> skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Effective CO 2 -storage in {{the shallow}} solid Earth mainly occurs by the {{formation}} of <b>carbonates.</b> Although the possibility of transport and storage of <b>carbonates</b> to great depth is demonstrated experimentally, ultra-deep mantle <b>carbonates</b> have not been found before. Applying several in situ analytical techniques on inclusions in diamonds from Juina (Brazil) originating from {{the lower part of}} the transition zone (> 580 km) or even the lower mantle (> 670 km), reveal the existence of deep Earth <b>carbonates.</b> These finding unquestionably show that at least locally <b>carbonates</b> exist within the deep Earth and may indicate that the Earth's global CO 2 -cycle has an ultra-deep extension...|$|R

5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium <b>carbonate.</b> Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations.

5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium <b>carbonate,</b> whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium <b>carbonate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Miocene <b>carbonates</b> {{have been}} studied on Palawan (Philippines), and {{compared}} to coeval deposits offshore.

The discovery of new outcrops of late Early Miocene to Middle Miocene platform <b>carbonates</b> and isolated reefal structures in SW-Palawan represent a similar development onshore, whereas the evolution is associated with a general increase of the relative sea level. The onshore <b>carbonates</b> in SW-Palawan are equivalent to the Miocene <b>carbonates</b> offshore and correlate with the stage of build-up development offshore.

40|$|Soils in arid and {{semi-arid}} {{regions are}} strongly {{affected by the}} accumulation of <b>carbonates,</b> gypsum and other, more soluble, salts. <b>Carbonates</b> and gypsum both have a considerable influence on soil properties, especially the chemical properties of the soil solution. The development of reliable, fast and inexpensive methods to quantify the amounts of <b>carbonates</b> and gypsum in soil is therefore important. Visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy is a non-destructive, rapid and cheap method for measuring several soil properties simultaneously. However, research on vis-NIR spectroscopy in quantifying <b>carbonates</b> and gypsum is limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficiency of vis-NIR spectroscopy in quantifying <b>carbonates</b> and gypsum in surface soils using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) compared with standard laboratory methods and compared PLSR with a feature-specific method using continuum removal (CR). <b>Carbonates</b> and gypsum {{in a total of}} 251 sieved and air-dried topsoil samples from Isfahan Province in central Iran were measured by standard laboratory methods and vis-NIR spectroscopy (350 – 2500 nm wavelength range). In parallel, PLSR and the feature-specific method based on CR spectra were used to predict <b>carbonates</b> and gypsum. The PLSR model efficiency (E) for <b>carbonates</b> and gypsum in the validation set was 0. 52 and 0. 80, respectively. The PLSR model resulted in better predictions than the feature-specific method for both soil properties. Because of the unique absorption features of gypsum, which did not overlap with other soil properties, predictions of gypsum resulted in higher E values and lower errors than predictions of <b>carbonates...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Carbonates</b> {{on large}} Solar System bodies like Earth and Mars (the latter {{represented}} by the meteorite ALH 84001) form through the weathering of silicates in a watery (CO 3) 2 - solution.

Despite efforts, the presence of <b>carbonates</b> outside the Solar System has hitherto not been established. Here we report the discovery of the <b>carbonates</b> calcite and dolomite in the dust shells of evolved stars, where the conditions are too primitive for the formation of large parent bodies with liquid water. These <b>carbonates,</b> therefore, are not formed by aqueous alteration, but perhaps through processes on the surfaces of dust or ice grains or gas phase condensation.
