40|$|A global {{stratigraphy}} of Mars {{was developed}} from a global geologic map series derived from Viking images; the stratigraphy {{is composed of}} three maps. A new <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> system which consists of lower, middle, and upper Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian systems is described. The crater-density boundaries of the chronostratigraphic units and the absolute ages of the Martian epochs aer estimated. The relative ages of major geologic units and featues are calculated and analyzed. The geologic history of Mars is summarized on the maps in terms of epochs...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Alethopteris virginiana Fontaine & White {{from the lower}} Dunkard in the Appalachians of North America shows that three different taxa {{are likely to be}} represented in the initial illustration. The specific epithet ‘virginiana’ ought to be restricted to a form comparable to Callipteridium costei (Zeiller) Wagner, whereas the two other taxa are referred to pecopterid ferns. A neotype is proposed for Callipteridium virginianum (Fontaine & White) comb. nov. on the basis of topotypes. Zeiller’s illustration of ‘Alethopteris’ costei is reproduced for comparison. On the other hand, a full description and illustration are provided for Alethopteris leonensis Wagner, a species which had been identified previously with Alethopteris virginiana, apparently in error. An associated Holcospermum ‘seed’ is also illustrated. Comparisons include the rather similar Alethopteris bohemica Franke, 1912, which is also illustrated with an associated ‘seed’. The age of the lower Dunkard flora is determined as (early?) Autunian. The relative position of the Upper Pennsylvanian (upper Conemaugh, Monongahela, Dunkard) of eastern North America is depicted in a chart showing the full succession of substages in the West European <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Pennsylvanian Subsystem, as well as the corresponding megafloral zones...|$|E
40|$|A pioneer {{study of}} the {{previously}} unknown delta C- 13 chemostratigraphy in the Ordovician/Silurian boundary interval in eastern Iowa and northeastern Illinois resulted in {{the discovery of the}} Hirnantian Isotope Carbon Excursion (HICE). The presence of this major isotope excursion in the Mosalem Formation in Iowa and the Wilhelmi Formation in Illinois, which indicates that the excursion interval in these units is of Hirnantian (latest Ordovician) rather than Early Silurian age, necessitates a revised <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of these units. Although the precise level of the Ordovician/Silurian boundary remains somewhat uncertain {{in the absence of the}} diagnostic graptolites, it is herein placed in the upper part, but well below the top, of the Mosalem Formation and at the top of the Wilhelmi Formation. During a major regression following the deposition of the Maquoketa Shale, the upper part of the latter elastic unit was in some places deeply eroded, resulting in a topographically dissected landscape with upland areas separated by wide incised valleys. During a subsequent late Hirnantian transgression, these palaeovalleys were gradually filled with marine sediments, but the upland areas were not transgressed until earliest Silurian times. The new chemostratigraphical evidence is in good agreement with the available biostratigraphical data, especially from corals, conodonts, and brachiopods. A preliminary chemostratigraphical {{study of the}} presumably coeval Edgewood Group successions in Pike County, northeastern Missouri failed to document any heavy delta C- 13 values characteristic of the HICE and some, or all, of the Hirnantian values obtained there may be diagenetically overprinted...|$|E

40|$|Stable isotope {{measurements}} on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) {{have been carried}} out on a number of selected deep-seas sediment cores from the South Lau and Norlh Fiji Basins. The d 18 O-curves show good correlation with the inter-ocean oraphic correlation composite d 18 O-record of the standard reference section (Prell et al. 1986), which, in combination with the <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classifications</b> of Herterich & Sarnthein (1984, modified) and Imbrie et al. 1984), allows a detailed dating of the sedimentary sequences. The deepest layers in core no. 119 (southern Lau Basin) could be assigned to Isotope Stage 24. Measurements made on bulk carbonate in two cores show a much higher glacial-interglacial amplitude, allowing the general identification of the conventional oxygen isotope stages. The d 13 C-values of the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi show progressively lighter values northwards reflecting an increasing contribution of the isotopically lighter CO 2 from the remineralisation of organic matter during the general northward movement of the deep water masses. Cyclicities in the sedimentation rates were observed in core nos. 117 and 119 (both southern Lau Basin) where the interglacials exhibit higher levels than the glacials. Calculated new or export paleoproductivity show that the glacials had higher productivity in the euphotic zone. From the oxygen isotope stratigraphy, the five ash layers in core nos. 117 and 119 could be dated as about 530 ka B. P. in Stage 14, 695 ka B. P. in Stage 18, 775 ka B. P. in Stage 21, 790 ka B. P. and 825 ka B. P. in Stage 22. Carbonate dissolution occurred during stages 5, 8 and 10 to 12...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: 19 th and 20 th century {{stratigraphy}} often concerned itself {{primarily with}} classification and nomenclature, during {{what can be}} termed the heroic and codex ages of stratigraphy. In contrast, 21 st century stratigraphy will fall within the post-modern age. In possession of agreed classification schemes, future stratigraphers will concentrate on (i) the reconstruction of earth environments and processes (including evolution) through time, (ii) the eficient location and recovery of useful earth resources, and (iii) the study of those geological hazards that can be understood within a stratigraphic context. The first objective- reconstructing environments through time- {{requires the use of}} a conceptual framework similar to the one that we term the geological time scale (GTS). The 21 st century GTS will be based on GSSP designations at the base of all geological Periods and, ultimately, Ages, i. e. it will comprise an internationally agreed chronologic hierarchy. Recognition of local chronologic schemes (as distinct from biostratigraphies based on Oppelzones) will thereafter serve no useful purpose and local “Ages ” will become redun-dant. Globally, recognition of a separate but completely parallel <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> will also serve no useful purpose, and this hierarchy too will be abandoned. Correlation of events into the GTS will be undertaken using a wide variety of methods, including numeric dating, fossil occurrence, physical and chemical properties, tephrochronology and astrochronologic retrodictions. Biostrati-graphy, though remaining a vital tool, especially for Phanerozoic strata, will carry no necessary correlation primacy. Meeting the second and third objectives- locating and recovering earth resources, and studying hazards- requires first and fore-most the creation of detailed geological maps and stratigraphic columns. The lithostratigraphic hierarchy of Bed-Member-Forma...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with three coastal caves and two open coastal sites in south Gower. The Pleistocene succession at each locality is described and classified using a multidisciplinary approach, which involves sedimentological. faunal and pollen analyses. An informal lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic and <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> is proposed. Two interglacial high sea level events are recognised. The earlier {{is represented by the}} Inner Sand Beach of Minchin Hole and is correlated with oxygen isotope sub-stage 7 a (210 ka BP) using amino acid dating. The younger is represented by the Outer Gravel Beach of Minchin Hole and is correlated by amino acid dating with oxygen isotope stage 5 e (125 ka BP). Evidence is presented of three cold events in Gower. The earliest antedates the Minchin Hole Inner Sand Beach, the second is related to oxygen isotope stage 6 on the basis of lithostratigraphy and amino acid dating, and the youngest represents the last (Devensian) Glaciation. Detailed evidence of climatic and environmental change from the Last Interglacial (oxygen isotope stage 5 e) to the Last Glaciation is described. The Last Interglacial in Gower is marked by a high sea level event, interglacial weathering of sediments, a temperate fauna with some southern species and an inferred regional vegetation of mixed temperate forest. This is followed by a continuous fall in sea level to the low stand of the Last Glaciation, which accompanied by a gradual change from a temperate to a boreal fauna, an inferred deterioration of climate and reduction in the vegetation cover., and the commencement of colluviation and sheetwashing of weathered sediments on the plateau surfaces of Gower. The Last Glaciation in Gower is represented by a boreal fauna and periglacial sedimentation, with head deposits and loess. NER...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Laurentian Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician {{is based}} on strata in Utah, Nevada, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Alberta. Biozonations are based on strata there {{as well as in}} Texas and Oklahoma. Regional {{trilobite}} zonations vary somewhat because of facies influence and periods of regional endemism; the zonation is quite different in slope deposits. Conodont zonation begins in the middle Upper Cambrian; many taxa occur in a variety of facies and are cosmopolitan, so zones can be correlated across Laurentia and globally. Calcitic brachiopod zones established in Oklahoma have been identified in other areas where faunas have been studied. Phosphatic brachiopod zones were established first in the lower Upper Cambrian, and the zonation is being extended into the Lower Ordovician. Carbon-isotope profiles of Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician strata from several parts of Laurentia are used for precise correlation, especially in conjunction with trilobite and conodont data. Distinctive profile peaks have been correlated among several areas in Laurentia and to Australia, China, and Kazakhstan. Stratigraphic sequences identified in Utah, Nevada, and Texas range in scale from four supersequences within the Sauk Megasequence to individual meter-scale cycles. In Utah a series of highstand strata (mostly deep-subtidal lime mudstones) alternate with well-preserved lowstand strata (shallow-subtidal lime grainstones). Lowstand strata have higher concentrations of fine quartz sand compared with highstand strata; insoluble residue data are from hundreds of conodont samples. Nearly all sequence boundaries are conformable in thick carbonate strata in Utah and Nevada but may correlate to hiatuses in cratonic areas. Several lowstand intervals can be identified on other continents if sufficient conodont or carbon-isotope data exist there. Outcrop gamma-ray logs allow correlation among exposures and into the subsurface. Lithostratigraphic boundaries in various areas of Laurentia often equate to sequence boundaries, as do some zonal boundaries. Cooperative research using all of these approaches is producing a comprehensive stratigraphic framework for Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician strata in Laurentia. More work is needed to fill in parts of the entire framework...|$|E
40|$|A small {{collection}} of ammonoids from the Upper Triassic Scillato Formation at Pizzo Mondello (Agrigento, Sicily) is studied. The specimens {{were collected in}} a framework of a project aimed at providing an integrated high-resolution bio-chronostratigraphic support to the Upper Carnian-Norian magnetostratigraphic scale defined at this site, that is located in an historical area from which G. G. Gemmellaro collected the Upper Triassic of ammonoids monographed {{at the beginning of}} the XX century. The specimens from Pizzo Mondello were bed-by-bed sampled and represent the first {{collection of}} Upper Triassic ammonoids described from Sicily since Gemmellaro time. Quite several levels of the Pizzo Mondello section yielded ammonoids, but very few levels have provided more than one specimen. Due to the scarcity of specimens the taxonomic analysis has been complex because Gemmellaro, who described 166 new species, did not explain the variability of many of his taxa. Sixsteen taxa belonging to eleven genera are described. They include Placites sp. ind., Discotropites plinii (Mojsisovics), Anatropites sp., Microtropites cf. paronai, Metathisbites cf. affinis, Hyattites aff. praefloridus, Projuvavites boehmi (Gemmellaro), Projuvavites inflatus (Gemmellaro), Gonionotites cf. italicus, Gonionotites aff. recuperoi, Dimorphites noricus n. sp., Dimorphites selectus Mojsisovics, Dimorphites sp., Pregriesbachites n. gen., P. bukowskii (Gemmellaro), Discophyllites insignis. Among the new taxa, Dimorphites noricus n. sp. formalizes the nomen nudum “ Dimorphites n. sp. 1 ” quoted in literature for several years, that is index of the lowest subzone of the Norian stage. The small collection document the Discotropites plinii and Gonionotites italicus subzones of the uppermost Carnian Spinosus Zone and the Dimorphites noricus and D. selectus subzones of the Jandianus Zone, the first zone of the Lower Norian. This <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> firmly tie the Pizzo Mondello succession to the Tethyan chronostratigraphic scale, and is crucial for the calibration of the Halobia and conodont bioevents identified in the section. The chronostratigraphic correlations based on ammonoids of the Pizzo Mondello section with Feuerkogel (Austria), Jomsom (Nepal), West Union Canyon (Nevada, USA) and Black Bear Ridge (British Columbia, Canada) is discussed. These are the most complete ammonoid-bearing sections in the world spanning the Carnian/Norian boundary, but all of them show a discrete distribution of ammonoid-bearing beds across the boundary. Ammonoid will not provide the primary marker event for the definition of the GSSP of the Norian, but they are crucial for the selection of the most significant events.  </p...|$|E
