5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants.

Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) <b>contact</b> <b>herbicides</b> include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl.

40|$|Air-assist nozzles mix {{air with}} the spray liquid and help {{transport}} the spray to the target. These nozzles {{make it possible to}} reduce application rate and still be able to provide adequate coverage while minimizing spray drift. Air-assist nozzles are relatively new for agricultural spraying and evaluations to date are limited. The performance of air-assist nozzles (Spraying Systems Airjet) were explored and the nozzles were evaluated in field tests using systemic and <b>contact</b> <b>herbicides.</b> Spray-drift assessments for the Airjet nozzles were also conducted. Application rate varied between 30 l/ha to 200 l/ha for the field tests and the spray-drift assessments. For most of the tests two different pressure settings were used. The overall conclusion for the Airjet nozzles is that the choice of air pressure and liquid pressure are very important in determining an acceptable spray pattern, droplet size spectrum and in minimizing spray-drift. The field studies with systemic and <b>contact</b> <b>herbicides</b> did not result in significant differences among the application rates. A spray volume of 30 l/ha gave poor control in the field studies and in the spray-drift assessments. Control improved dramatically with spray volumes above 50 l/ha. Different size inserts and different air and liquid pressures determine the spray volume. It was observed that different size inserts to the air-assist nozzles should be choosen rather than changing pressures if an entirely different spray volume is desired. Changing pressures affect the droplet size distribution and spray pattern uniformity a great deal. The characteristics of a ULV air-assist sprayer (AAN) were also explored. No field tests were conducted with this sprayer. The AAN-sprayer was not evaluated sufficiently to express extensive conclusions. A major observation was that the AAN-sprayer produces a non uniform droplet size distribution in the spray fan and has a high variation in the spray distribution. These studies indicated that air-assist nozzles have potential for applying pesticides at low spray volumes, provided that the air pressure and liquid pressure are maintained sufficiently low...|$|R

In 2002, Delta and Pine cultivar 458 BR was planted on 17 April. In 2004 and 2005 Delta and Pine cultivar 449 BR was planted on 13 May and 12 April respectively. In all years, plots were 13. 33 ft wide and 25 ft long and treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block with four replications. Irrigation was terminated at cutout (NAWF= 5) and defoliation treatments were initiated 22 days later. All plots received an initial defoliation treatment of thidiazuron plus diuron (Ginstar) at 8 oz/A. In 2002 and 2004, follow-up applications occurred seven days after initial defoliation, and included the following treatments: paraquat (Gramoxone Max) at 10. 7 oz/A plus nonionic surfactant at 0. 25 %v/v, flumiclorac (Resource) at 8 oz/A plus crop oil concentrate (COC) at 1 % v/v, pyraflufen (ET) at 1. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v or carfentrazone (Aim) at 1. 0 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v. In 2005, follow-up application occurred eight days after initial defoliation and included the same treatments as 2002 and 2004 with the addition of fluthiacetmethyl (Blizzard) at 0. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v and an adjustment of the Gramoxone Max rate to 20 oz/A.

50|$|Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum {{residual}} and <b>contact</b> <b>herbicide,</b> rapidly {{absorbed by}} the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore {{it is a very}} effective herbicide for the control for annual and perennial broadleaf weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the herbicide to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots. It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the photosynthesis of the plant within the chloroplasts. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the photosystem II complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state chlorophyll reacts with oxygen to form singlet oxygen. Both chlorophyll and singlet oxygen then remove hydrogen ions from the unsaturated lipids present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxydize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of chlorophyll, leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant. Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die. Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.|$|E
40|$|Glyphosate {{resistant}} weeds {{have evolved}} because of over-reliance on this herbicide without integration with other effective weed control methods. Since the first incidence of glyphosate resistance in 1996, 24 weed {{species have been}} confirmed with glyphosate resistance in 18 countries. Australia {{is one of the}} countries that is most affected by glyphosate resistance with resistance reported in 6 weed species. Glyphosate resistance in L. rigidum remains the greatest problem with 347 documented populations. These resistant populations have mostly been reported from cropped situations with heavy glyphosate use, such as chemical fallows, orchards, and vineyards. Recently populations of glyphosate resistant L. rigidum have started appearing on fence lines where glyphosate is applied once annually late in the cropping season. The aim of this project was to investigate the evolution and management of glyphosate resistance in L. rigidum on fence lines. Dose response of L. rigidum to glyphosate was investigated in two fence line populations from Clare, South Australia (Clare 2010 and Clare 2009), two known resistant populations (SLR 76 and SLR 77) and one susceptible population (SLR 4). In these experiments, the susceptible population (SLR 4) was completely controlled at the recommended glyphosate rate of 450 g a. e ha ⁻ ¹. However, the resistant populations required much higher rates of glyphosate to achieve control. The fence line populations required 9 to 15 -fold higher glyphosate dose to achieve 50 % weed kill (LD₅₀) than SLR 4. The standard resistant population SLR 77 had 5 to 7 - fold greater resistances than SLR 4, while SLR 76 was 20 to 30 -fold more resistant than the susceptible control. The pattern of glyphosate translocation in L. rigidum plants was investigated by examining the movement of ¹⁴C-labeled glyphosate. There {{were no significant differences between}} L. rigidum populations in the amount of herbicide absorbed 48 hours following application. Plants of populations SLR 76, Clare 2009 and Clare 2010 retained significantly more herbicide in their treated leaves than did the susceptible plants 48 h after the treatment. The amount of herbicide translocated to the stem and untreated leaves of the susceptible plants was significantly greater than that translocated into these tissues in the resistant plants. These differences in translocation pattern of glyphosate in these fence line populations of L. rigidum suggest that resistance is associated with an altered translocation mechanism. The pattern of glyphosate translocation in SLR 77 was similar to the susceptible population SLR 4 indicating presence of a different resistance mechanism. To determine if these fence line populations have target-site mutation, the populations were assayed through DNA sequencing to determine any alterations in the EPSPS gene. Results from this screening indicated, the fence line populations did not have a mutation at Pro 106 of the ESPS gene observed in glyphosate resistant weeds with target site resistance. A famer survey was conducted on selected fence lines sites in South Australia where glyphosate had been sprayed for five years or more. L. rigidum plants were sampled from these fence lines and tested for resistance to glyphosate (810 g a. e ha⁻ ¹) using the Syngenta Quick Test. Plants sampled from ten out of the fifteen surveyed sites were confirmed with resistance to glyphosate. Survival in these populations ranged between 23 to 98 %. Fence lines with plant survival less than 20 % were considered not to have resistance. The herbicide programs used on these sites showed that sites which had been treated with herbicide mixtures or non-glyphosate herbicides in the last three years did not have resistance. This confirmed that intensive and repeated use of glyphosate on fence lines is the major determinant of evolution of resistance. Control of glyphosate resistant L. rigidum on fence lines is important to prevent spread of resistance into adjacent crops. To identify alternative herbicide strategies to control glyphosate resistant L. rigidum along fence lines, a range of herbicides were examined at two different fence line sites. It was observed that the control of these resistant weeds requires mixtures of broad spectrum <b>contact</b> <b>herbicides</b> with residual herbicides or sequential application of <b>contact</b> <b>herbicides</b> 14 days apart. The results of this study also showed that glyphosate-resistance in L. rigidum had moved at least 50 m from the fence lines into adjacent crops. Thesis (M. Ag. Sc.)

30|$|The above {{results suggest}} a {{significant}} influence of GBHs on the uptake of some micronutrients, their root-to-shoot translocation and, {{in the case}} of the study by Cakmak et al.

Importantly, these findings demonstrate the potential for nutritional disruption of this kind to occur following exposure of GS plants to a small fraction of the recommended herbicidal dosage, such as may occur by accident due to spray drift or root <b>contact</b> with <b>herbicide</b> residues in soil. Mechanisms underlying the observed antagonism between GBHs and crop nutrition were not conclusively identified by these studies. It has been suggested, however, that the observed declines in uptake, as well as in-plant transport of micronutrients, might be related to the ability of glyphosate to form poorly soluble glyphosate–metal chelates within plant tissues and/or within the rhizosphere [82, 83]. Ozturk et al. [84] inferred that the formation of glyphosate–Fe complexes might have restricted the availability of Fe(III), crucial for the maintenance of Fe-reductase enzyme activity, in plant cells.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine if satisfactory weed control in vegetable crops (scallions) could be achieved and overall chemical use reduced by very repeated low dose applications of contact and <b>contact</b> residuals <b>herbicides.</b> The trials showed that scallion crops could tolerate certain post-emergence herbicides better than weed populations earlier in their life cycle provided the first true leaf of the crop had reached 1. 5 - 2 cm in length. Various combinations or cocktails of herbicides of cyanazine, oxyfourfen, ioxynil and gesagard were tested both at Kinsealy and in several commercial locations in Co. Dublin at very low rates varying from 17 to 70 g/ha and these were compared with current standard post-emergence recommendation of single rate ioxynil at 0. 4 - 0. 7 kg/ha. Each of the cocktail combinations apart from ioxynil and cyanazine produced highly satisfactory weed control when repeated at 7 - 12 day intervals commencing when the first true leaf averaged 2 cms long, over a wide range of conditions. The most effective and satisfactory weed control was achieved from either the oxyflourfen (17 - 35 g/ha) plus cyanazine (35 - 70 g/ha) or the ioxynil(17 - 35 g/ha) plus gesagard (17 - 35 g/ha) combinations.

The experiment was done with four varied concentrations of paraquat (0. 0, 0. 07, 0. 15, and 0. 3 mg/l equal 0. 0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of nominal value of 96 h LC 50) during 3 weeks. The exposed ﬁsh displayed erratic swimming and became lethargic. The changes in gills were characterized by hypertrophy, epithelial, epithelium increase of gill filament, edema and secondary gill lamella. The liver showed hypotrophy of liver cells, cloudy swelling and formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in the liver tissue of fish treated with 0. 15 and 0. 3 mg/l concentrations of paraquat. Disorder in the ellipsoid cell and hemosiderin accumulation in melano-macrophage centers was observed in the spleen tissue of fish exposed to 0. 15 and 0. 3 mg/l of paraquat...|$|R
