50|$|Omphalea triandra, {{also known}} as Jamaican <b>cobnut</b> and pop nut is a plant species endemic to Jamaica and Haiti.|$|E
50|$|The filbert nut is edible, and is {{very similar}} to the {{hazelnut}} (<b>cobnut).</b> Its main use in the United States is as large filler (along with peanuts as small filler) in most containers of mixed nuts. Filberts are sometimes grown in orchards for the nuts, but much less often than the common hazel.|$|E
50|$|The hazelnut, {{also known}} as the <b>cobnut,</b> is the nut of the hazel. It is roughly spherical to oval in shape, about 15-25 mm long and 10-15 mm in diameter, with an outer fibrous husk {{surrounding}} a smooth shell. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about seven to eight months after pollination.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{at the top}} of View Road there were woods {{stretching}} almost to the river, with wild <b>cobnuts,</b> and chestnuts too. There were wild damsons in the area, and apple trees were planted and mature by the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Hazelnuts do not {{generally}} {{need to be}} toasted; indeed, Kentish <b>cobnuts</b> are still sold fresh. Presumably toasting was done {{to make them more}} digestible for children. Toasting the nuts was thought to increase how long they would keep, and historically, they have been a useful food for mariners because they keep well.|$|R
50|$|Beers in {{the range}} {{included}} Tolly Original, <b>Cobnut,</b> Tolly Bitter, Tolly Mild, Old Strong, Old Strong Porter (bottle only). Tollyshooter (named in honour of the visit of Sir John Harvey-Jones to the brewery shortly after the 1990 management takeover) Cantab, Cardinal Ale, Cobbold's Conquest, Cobbold's IPA (a straw-coloured bitter), Beano Stout, Countdown, Election Ale (1997), Final Brew and Last Orders - a final brew in 2002.|$|E
50|$|At Royal Ascot in June West Australian beat Lord Eglington's horse Vanderdecken {{to win a}} Triennial Stakes. On the Thursday of {{the same}} meeting, West Australian ran in the Ascot Gold Cup {{in front of a}} crowd which {{included}} the Queen, Prince Albert and the Duke of Wellington. He won by a head from the five-year-old Kingston, with Rataplan third and was paraded past the Royal Stand after the race. At Goodwood on 25 July West Australian beat Mr Barber's horse <b>Cobnut</b> by twenty lengths to win a Â£300 Sweepstakes, but missed a race against the filly Virago in the Goodwood Cup.|$|E
5000|$|Common hazel is {{cultivated}} for its nuts {{in commercial}} orchards in Europe, Turkey, Iran and Caucasus. The name [...] "hazelnut" [...] {{applies to the}} nuts {{of any of the}} species of the genus Corylus. This hazelnut or <b>cobnut,</b> the kernel of the seed, is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a paste. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin which has a bitter flavour and is sometimes removed before cooking. The top producer of hazelnuts, by a large margin, is Turkey, specifically the Ordu Province. Turkish hazelnut production of 625,000 tonnes accounts for approximately 75% of worldwide production.|$|E
60|$|After these came twelve most worshipful baboons, in most venerable wigs. They were clothed with scarlet robes {{lined with}} ermine, and ornamented with gold chains, and {{mounted on the}} most obstinate and {{inflexible}} mules in Tartarus. These were the judges. Each was provided with a pannier of choice <b>cobnuts,</b> which he cracked with great gravity, throwing the shells to the multitude, an infernal ceremony, there held emblematic of their profession.|$|R
60|$|Besides {{its main}} {{use as an}} article of food, the banana serves {{incidentally}} to supply a valuable fibre, obtained from the stem, and employed for weaving into textile fabrics and making paper. Several kinds of the plantain tribe are cultivated for this purpose exclusively, the best known among them being the so-called manilla hemp, a plant largely grown in the Philippine Islands. Many of the finest Indian shawls are woven from banana stems, {{and much of the}} rope that we use in our houses comes from the same singular origin. I know nothing more strikingly illustrative of the extreme complexity of our modern civilisation than {{the way in which we}} thus every day employ articles of exotic manufacture in our ordinary life without ever for a moment suspecting or inquiring into their true nature. What lady knows when she puts on her delicate wrapper, from Liberty's or from Swan and Edgar's, that the material from which it is woven is a Malayan plantain stalk? Who ever thinks that the glycerine for our chapped hands comes from Travancore coco-nuts, and that the pure butter supplied us from the farm in the country is coloured yellow with Jamaican annatto? We break a tooth, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has pointed out, because the grape-curers of Zante are not careful enough about excluding small stones from their stock of currants; and we suffer from indigestion because the Cape wine-grower has doctored his light Burgundies with Brazilian logwood and white rum, to make them taste like Portuguese port. Take merely this very question of dessert, and how intensely complicated it really is. The West Indian bananas keep company with sweet St. Michaels from the Azores, and with Spanish <b>cobnuts</b> from Barcelona. Dried fruits from Metz, figs from Smyrna, and dates from Tunis lie side by side on our table with Brazil nuts and guava jelly and damson cheese and almonds and raisins. We forget where everything comes from nowadays, in our general consciousness that they all come from the Queen Victoria Street Stores, and any real knowledge of common objects is rendered every day more and more impossible by the bewildering complexity and variety, every day increasing, of the common objects themselves, their substitutes, adulterates, and spurious imitations. Why, you probably never heard of manilla hemp before, until this very minute, and yet you have been familiarly using it all your lifetime, while 400,000 hundredweights of that useful article are annually imported into this country alone. It is an interesting study to take any day a list of market quotations, and ask oneself about every material quoted, what it is and what they do with it.|$|R
50|$|Hazelnut is the nut of the hazel and therefore, {{includes}} any of {{the nuts}} deriving from species of the genus Corylus, especially the nuts of the species Corylus avellana. It also is known as <b>cobnut</b> or filbert nut according to species. A cob is roughly spherical to oval, about 15-25 mm long and 10-15 mm in diameter, with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell. A filbert is more elongated, being about {{twice as long as}} its diameter. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about 7 to 8 months after pollination. The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a paste. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which sometimes is removed before cooking.|$|E
