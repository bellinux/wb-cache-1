40|$|The {{association}} of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{with a growing}} number of human malignancies underlines the importance of efforts aimed at preventing the infection with this potential carcinogen and of establishing animal models for human virus-associated tumors. <b>Cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been used in EBV vaccine studies because virus infection regularly induces lymphomas similar to those seen in human immunocompromised individuals. In recent years, several vaccines based on the gp 340 / 220 envelope protein of EBV have been developed and shown to prevent the development of EBV-associated lymphomas in this model. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have characterized EBV infection in one nonimmunized and three immunized animals after challenge with a standard tumorigenic dose of EBV. In the nonimmunized animal, EBV-infected lymphoid cells were detected in numerous tissues showing no obvious lymphoma infiltration. Surprisingly, variable numbers of virus-carrying cells were also found in all three immunized animals that were protected against the development of virus-associated lymphoma. This observation demonstrates that vaccination does not induce sterilizing immunity against EBV infection in this model. Double labeling suggested a B cell phenotype of the majority of these cells. EBV infection of nonlymphoid cells was not observed. Analysis of viral gene expression in immunized animals suggested a restricted form of virus latency different from that seen in EBV-driven lymphomas in nonimmunized <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins.</b> These results raise the possibility that immunized <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> protected against the development of EBV-driven lymphoma or animals exposed to a sublymphomagenic dose of virus may {{serve as a model for}} EBV infection in humans...|$|R

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that cooperative breeding facilitates the emergence of prosocial behavior by presenting <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Saguinus oedipus) with the option to provide food rewards to pair-bonded mates. In Experiment 1, tamarins could provide rewards to mates {{at no additional cost}} while obtaining rewards for themselves. Contrary to the hypothesis, tamarins did not demonstrate a preference to donate rewards, behaving similar to chimpanzees in previous studies. In Experiment 2, the authors eliminated rewards for the donor for a stricter test of prosocial behavior, while reducing separation distress and food preoccupation. Again, the authors found no evidence for a donation preference. Furthermore, tamarins were significantly less likely to deliver rewards to mates when the mate displayed interest in the reward. The results of this study contrast with those recently reported for cooperatively breeding common marmosets, and indicate that prosocial preferences in a food donation task do not emerge in all cooperative breeders. In previous studies, <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> have cooperated and reciprocated to obtain food rewards; the current findings sharpen understanding of the boundaries of cottontop tamarins’ food-provisioning behavior...|$|R

50|$|In 2005 a study {{involving}} common marmosets and <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins,</b> {{animals of}} both species faced a self-control paradigm {{in which individuals}} chose between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time for a large reward. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history, social behaviour or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology: marmosets rely on gum, a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow from trees, whereas tamarins feed on insects, a food product requiring impulsive action. Foraging ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure {{for the evolution of}} self-control.|$|R
40|$|Our {{longitudinal}} study explored {{the role of}} socially biased learning in the acquisition of a novel foraging task that could be solved in two ways in captive juvenile <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins.</b> We trained parents to adopt a single solution (pole or ceiling strategy). We tested 13 different juvenile offspring-parent pairs on the task {{over the course of}} 11 weeks. Our objective was (1) to investigate the extent to which juveniles match their parent, and (2) to analyse the influence of behavioural feedback between parent and juvenile offspring on learning trajectories, behavioural acquisition and performance. Although not all juveniles matched the modelled solution, both groups of juveniles significantly spent more time at the targeted location being modelled for them. Parent and offspring correlated well in time spent at the demonstrated location. We investigated predictors of performance and success by analysing data prior to first success. Juveniles' exploration of the apparatus was important in dictating their success at the task, whereas observation of the parent had no influence. Both juvenile scrounging and adult food calling, which encouraged begging, drew the attention of the juveniles away from the task and impeded learning. High adult refusals per beg predicted task success in young. Adults monitored their offspring's performance and increased their refusals per begs upon the first success of their offspring. <b>Cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> also showed some behavioural scaffolding. Solving the task did not simply reflect a maturational change in juveniles, but was rather influenced by an intricate behavioural feedback between parent and offspring...|$|R

5000|$|Geoffroy's tamarin {{can give}} birth {{throughout}} the year, but the birthing peak is from April to June. A single infant or twins can be born, {{although it is}} not uncommon for one of the twins to perish within the first few months.

40|$|<b>Cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> {{have been}} immunized {{with a high}} {{molecular}} weight, Epstein-Barr (EB) virus membrane antigen (MA) glycoprotein (gp 340) separated by monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography (MCABgp 340).

The animals were challenged with a 100 % lymphomagenic dose of EB virus but despite possessing powerful neutralizing antibodies were not protected against tumour causation by the virus. This result contrasts with that of earlier experiments in which tamarins with neutralizing antibodies induced by gp 340 prepared by a molecular weight-based method (MWgp 340) were protected. The reasons for this difference in protection associated with vaccine molecules prepared in different ways are discussed together {{with the need for}} parameters other than neutralizing antibody for use in the assessment of subunit immunogens against EB virus...|$|R
40|$|Colitis occurs spontaneously in the cottontop tamarin; {{it shares}} similar clinical, {{endoscopic}} and histological features with, {{and has a}} similar response to treatment as, human ulcerative colitis. An association between human ulcerative colitis {{and the presence of}} DNA from multiple herpesviruses (human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the colon has been described. Intestinal herpesvirus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. In a pilot study, coded full thickness colonic specimens from 27 <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> were examined for the presence of HHV- 6, CMV and EBV DNA using the nested polymerase chain reaction. The sections represented a spectrum of disease activity ranging from histologically normal bowel to severe colitis. A low prevalence of DNA from these viruses was found, which bore no relation to the presence of inflammation. Although these herpesviruses may have a pathogenetic role in human ulcerative colitis, they are not associated with colitis in this animal model...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis of {{infected}} cells {{is an important}} host defense mechanism, and many viruses have exploited antiapoptotic proteins that interfere with crucial cellular pathways. Viral FLICE inhibitory proteins (vFLIPs) are encoded by rhadinoviruses like herpesvirus saimiri, the related Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV 8), and the poxvirus responsible for molluscum contagiosum. The vFLIPs can block {{the interaction of the}} death receptor-adapter complex with the cellular effector FLICE (caspase- 8), and this prevents the initiation of the downstream caspase cascade. KSHV/HHV 8 vFLIP overexpression can confer resistance to T-cell-mediated apoptosis and acts as a tumor progression factor in a murine B-cell lymphoma model. To analyze the function of herpesvirus vFLIPs in the genetic background of the virus and in a model for viral pathogenesis, we deleted the vFLIP gene (open reading frame 71) from the genome of herpesvirus saimiri strain C 488. The viral deletion mutant was viable and replicated like the wild-type virus. An antiapoptotic effect could be attributed to the vFLIP gene, but we also show that the vFLIP gene of herpesvirus saimiri is dispensable for viral transformation of T cells in vitro and for pathogenicity in <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins</b> in vivo...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aetiology}} and pathophysiology of {{ulcerative colitis}} remains unclear; however, {{there is increasing}} recognition of the critical role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease.

AIM: To study the effects of an engineered human monoclonal antibody to TNF alpha (CDP 571) in the treatment of idiopathic ulcerative colitis in the <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarin.</b> METHODS: Six cottontop tamarins with confirmed ulcerative colitis received repeated doses of CDP 571. Progression of disease was assessed by measuring both body weight and rectal biopsy pathology. RESULTS: All animals showed a rapid improvement in clinical condition and rectal biopsy pathology that was maintained following completion of the therapy. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate the efficacy of selective antibody therapy to TNF alpha for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in a primate and suggest that similar therapy in human could be of value...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{induction}} of malignant lymphomas can {{be achieved}} in the <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarin</b> by inoculation with Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. This system provides an animal model for assessing the efficacy of vaccine protection against the virus which is intended to {{reduce the incidence of}} human tumours associated with EB virus infection, namely endemic Burkitt's lymphoma nd undifferentiated nasopharyngeal c rcinoma. Cottontop tamarins have been vaccinated with the major envelope glycoprotein of EB virus, gp 340, incorporated into immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) and were thereby protected against a 100 ~ lymphomagenic dose of virus. The gp 340 iscoms are highly immunogenic, requiring only a few micrograms of immunogen to induce protective immunity and thus would be a strong candidate for further development as an EB virus vaccine for use in man. Epstein-Barr (EB) virus is strongly implicated as one of the causative agents in the chain of events that leads to the development of two important human malignancies, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Shanmugaratnam, 1971) and endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (Burkitt, 1963). The former epresents a major world health problem, being the most commo...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} cooperative {{problem solving}} in unrelated pairs of the cooperatively breeding <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarin,</b> Saguinus oedipus, {{to assess the}} cognitive basis of cooperative behaviour in this species and to compare abilities with other apes and monkeys. A transparent apparatus was used that required extension of two handles {{at opposite ends of}} the apparatus for access to rewards. Resistance was applied to both handles so that two tamarins had to act simultaneously in order to receive rewards. In contrast to several previous studies of cooperation, both tamarins received rewards as a result of simultaneous pulling. The results from two experiments indicated that the cottontop tamarins (1) had a much higher success rate and efficiency of pulling than many of the other species previously studied, (2) adjusted pulling behaviour to {{the presence or absence of}} a partner, and (3) spontaneously developed sustained pulling techniques to solve the task. These findings suggest that cottontop tamarins understand the role of the partner in this cooperative task, a cognitive ability widely ascribed only to great apes. The cooperative social system of tamarins, the intuitive design of the apparatus, and the provision of rewards to both participants may explain the performance of the tamarins...|$|E
40|$|Foraging {{decisions}} in nonhuman animals often require choosing between small, immediate food rewards and larger, more delayed rewards. Faced with such choices, animals typically discount or devalue the future quite strongly. Although discounting studies often focus on delays to reward access, other temporal intervals contribute to foraging rate, and thus may potentially influence discounting levels. Here, {{we examine the}} effect of handling time, the time required to process and consume food, on discounting in <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Saguinus oedipus, and common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, two species that differ in levels of temporal discounting. We presented subjects with a discounting task under two conditions. In the first condition, we made the entire reward available after the delay expired. In the second condition, we experimentally increased the minimum length of time required to consume the reward to simulate a longer handling time. We found that tamarins and marmosets showed sensitivity to increases in the time necessary to process food rewards. Both species adjusted their preferences to account for different handling times at long delays to accessing food. Consequently, models of discounting behaviour that include handling times may better describe animal choices than models that focus exclusively on delays prior to access...|$|R
40|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{posits that}} cooperatively breeding species {{are motivated to}} act prosocially, that is, to behave in ways that provide benefits to others, and that cooperative breeding has {{played a central role}} in the evolution of human prosociality. However, investigations of prosocial behaviour in cooperative breeders have produced varying results and the mechanisms contributing to this variation are unknown. We investigated whether reciprocity would facilitate prosocial behaviour among <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins,</b> a cooperatively breeding primate species likely to engage in reciprocal altruism, by comparing the number of food rewards transferred to partners who had either immediately previously provided or denied rewards to the subject. Subjects were also tested in a non-social control condition. Overall, results indicated that reciprocity increased food transfers. However, temporal analyses revealed that when the tamarins' behaviour was evaluated in relation to the non-social control, results were best explained by (i) an initial depression in the transfer of rewards to partners who recently denied rewards, and (ii) a prosocial effect that emerged late in sessions independent of reciprocity. These results support the cooperative breeding hypothesis, but suggest a minimal role for positive reciprocity, and emphasize the importance of investigating proximate temporal mechanisms underlying prosocial behaviour...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that as many as 15,000 non-human primates are kept by private individuals as pets in the United States. Nine states ban the keeping of non-human primates, but no federal law regulates ownership. In 1975, the Center for Disease Control prohibited their import into the US for use as pets. The breeding industry uses descendants of animals imported before 1975. Non-human primates of various species, including those listed as endangered, such as <b>cottontop</b> <b>tamarins,</b> baboons, chimpanzees, Diana monkeys, lemurs and gibbons are still available for purchase in the US, although due to captive breeding, this does not affect wild populations. For example, chimpanzees are popular in some areas despite their strength, aggression, and wild nature. Even in areas where keeping non-human primates as pets are illegal, the exotic pet trade continues to prosper and some people keep chimpanzees as pets mistakenly believing that they will bond with them for life. As they grow, so do their strength and aggression; some owners and others interacting with the animals have lost fingers and suffered severe facial damage among other injuries sustained in attacks.|$|R
