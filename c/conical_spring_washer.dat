50|$|A Belleville washer, {{also known}} as a coned-disc spring, <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> <b>washer,</b> disc spring, Belleville spring or cupped spring washer, is a conical shell which can be loaded along its axis either statically or dynamically. A Belleville washer is, then, a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the {{frusto-conical}} shape that gives the washer a spring characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect and how a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop. Detecting when a large <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> is likely to occur is of considerable interest. Suggestions on how this could be done are made. 1...|$|R

A joint includes a pin, a tang, and a shackle. The pin is tapered at the same angle as the bores extending through the projections of the shackle and the tang. A <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> biases the tang onto the tapered sidewall of the pin.

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} {{to assess the impact of}} {{proposed}} nonlinear <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> bracing (NCSB) system on seismic response subjected to earthquake. The developed system includes of two telescopic <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> springs that operate in axial compression. Due to shape of spring, the proposed system can performed as a nonlinear stiffness element that provide more lateral stability to structural frame. The action of NCSB does not control the low and moderate vibration due to earthquake but it acts for severe vibration whereas the frame displacement pass the allowable boundary. This inconstant performance avoids excessive effects of conventional bracing system if they attached as retrofitting components to moment resistant steel frame. by other words, due to the aforementioned characteristics of NCSB system, the inherent ductility of steel frame is not scarified and earthquake energy can be dissipate due to frame ductility, but, NCSB system provided more stability of structures and prevent large story drift. In this study, pushover and time history analyses has been conducted to evaluate the seismic performance of introduced device. The results from pushover disclose a considerable enhancement of structural capacity and ductility. Besides, the application on NCSB device changed the location of plastic hinge formation in structural elements. Furthermore, time history results proved the efficiency of NCSB device on reducing the maximum displacement...|$|R
