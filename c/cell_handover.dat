Streaming services should consider {{not only the}} support of different forms of mobility and connectivity, but also runtime service personalization based on client characteristics and location, while possibly maintaining streaming continuity independently of client roaming. The paper proposes an original middleware solution based on mobile proxies that work at the wired-wireless network edges, close to their limited wireless clients, to support their personalized access to continuous services, especially by pre-fetching multimedia contents to avoid streaming interruptions. In particular, the paper focuses on how to exploit handover prediction i) to migrate mobile proxies in advance to the wireless cells where mobile clients are going to reconnect, and ii) to proactively manage mobile proxy buffers, thus reducing memory and bandwidth usage. Experimental results show that our original lightweight solution for IEEE 802. 11 <b>cell</b> <b>handover</b> prediction can significantly improve the management of proactive multimedia buffers, by respecting the challenging time constraints of the addressed application domain. ...|$|E

This approach has not been considered in the past in any fault detection or self-healing mechanism. The proposal discussed in this article expands the author's previous work in the area and employs distributed probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to successfully learn and predict which network resources are better suited to recover from a fault. The PGMs take into consideration observable processes like <b>cell</b> <b>handovers</b> or data traffic along with external information coming from online vehicular traffic monitoring systems available through social networks.

30|$|To {{cater to}} the {{exponentially}} increasing traffic volume requirements in public mobile network, higher frequency bands with wider spectrum are exploited to further extend the capacity of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Unfortunately, compared with lower frequency bands, higher frequency bands suffer from severer propagation loss which seriously limits the coverage. Hence, cells working at higher frequency bands are called small cells. On the account of mobility performance, small cells are usually overlaid on the coverage of macro cells that use lower frequency bands, which forms heterogeneous network. However, as deployment gets increasingly dense, the huge redundant control signaling interaction caused by frequent handovers between small and macro cells reduces the efficiency of heterogeneous networks. In order to mitigate this situation, C/U-plane decoupled architecture is proposed for upcoming 5 G wireless communication network [1, 2]. In this architecture, the relatively important C-plane is extended and kept at lower frequency bands of macro cells. In addition, the main capacity demander U-plane is moved to the small cells using available higher frequency bands with wider spectrum. With considerable coverage of macro <b>cells,</b> much fewer <b>handovers</b> happen to the C-plane compared to conventional coupled architecture of heterogeneous networks. Therefore, under a macro <b>cell,</b> the <b>handover</b> process is just simplified to the U-plane handover, which saves lots of control signaling interaction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mobile {{communications}} system created {{to meet the}} communication needs {{that can be done}} anywhere either when user is motionless or moving. To maintain the quality of services in a wide service area, coverage area is divided into smallest geographic units called cells. If the user moves from one area of the cell to another, then it needs an algorithm that guarantees the continuity of communications services. These algorithm is called a handover to a dedicated mode and the cell reselection for idle mode. In observing handoff algorithm, the operator did a drive test using computer and handset, which each had been equipped with special software, and GPS. This final project analyze the matters related to the handoff algorithm, both when in idle mode or dedicatd mode, including the causes, processes and things that influence it. Data acquisition is carried out through a drive test using software TEMS Investigaions GSM 4. 1. 1 with routes in the downtown area of Semarang. Drive test held on every Thursday and Sunday for three consecutive weeks starting on August 23, 2009 and each of day divided into three time allocation, ie morning, noon and night. The observed event include: <b>cell</b> reselection, <b>handover,</b> handover (intracell), handover failure and intracell handover failure. In addition Information Element that effected on the event are also observed, path loss criteria and cell reselection criteria for cell reselection, and received power, bit error rate and timing advance for the four other events. From the analysis is known that the assignment channel is triggered by the Information Element value that reaches a certain threshold value. For cell reselection, the both Information Element having equal influence. Information Element of the most influential for the handover and the handover failure is received power, whereas for two other events the most influential is the received bit error. After the detected value of the Information Element reaches a certain threshold, MSC will instruct the candidate cell to monitor and serving mobile station. Different process going on for handover (intracell), which after the information element value is known at a certain threshold, MS will move to another traffic channel in the same <b>cell.</b> If <b>handover</b> (intracell) was requested but could not be performed then handover based quality is tried the next time (if criterion is still given). When this handover also fails then BS toggles back and tries again a handover (intracell). In this drive test result there are 15 handover failures that may because no available traffic channel in candidate cell.
