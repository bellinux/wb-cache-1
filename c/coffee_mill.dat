5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a <b>coffee</b> <b>mill,</b> one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the {{government}} of Puerto Rico expropriated most of the lands of Buena Vista, {{as a result of}} a new law to provide land to local farmers. Only 87 acres of land remained with the Vives, including the manor house and the water channel system. These were acquired by the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico in 1984. In 1986, the Trust restored the hacienda to much of its past glory and turned it into a museum. It opened in 1987. The museum has operated continuously for 23 years. It is the only such museum in Puerto Rico. In 1988, the Trust entirely reconstructed the <b>coffee</b> <b>mill</b> to its 1892 look.

She found school boring compared to her grandmother's lessons, and frequently got into trouble. As punishment, {{she was forced to}} read novels aloud to a blind nun. The experience taught her a love of literature which influenced her choice of major in college. Her parents wanted her to go to college, and her teachers expected everyone in the school to attend a university.|$|E

2500|$|The Vereins Kirche, or Peoples Church, was {{designed}} by Friedrich Schubbert (aka Friedrich Armand Strubberg) {{and became the first}} public building in Fredericksburg in 1847. It served as a non-denominational church, school, town hall and fort. Locals refer to it as the Kaffeemühle (The <b>Coffee</b> <b>Mill)</b> Church for its shape. [...] Pupils learned their lessons in their own German language, and their parents paid $1 per quarter in tuition for each child. The first teacher in the Vereins-Kirche in 1847 was Professor Johann (John) Leyendecker, who emigrated from Rhineland-Palatinate with his wife and five children. They sailed on the Ship Riga, which left Antwerp on November 7, 1845, and arrived in Galveston on February 1, 1846. [...] Leyendecker also provided his home for Catholic services. [...] Leyendecker was succeeded as the Vereins-Kirche teacher in 1848 by Jacob Brodbeck. The building models a style known as Carolingian architecture, similar to the Aachen Cathedral.

[...] A rooster weather vane that sat on top was destroyed by lightning and replaced by a cross. In 1896 (or 1897) the original building was torn down.

60|$|I {{immediately}} procured a {{horse and}} started for the country, taking no baggage with me, of course. There is an insignificant creek--the Gravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going, and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth. There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a <b>coffee</b> <b>mill,</b> and at low water there is none running whatever. On this occasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I found the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid. I looked at it a moment to consider what to do. One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished. I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in by the other side. So I struck into the stream, and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the current. I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it, wet through and without other clothes {{on that side of the}} stream. I went on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my --future--brother-in-law. We were not of the same size, but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own.|$|E

Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R
