The aim {{of the work is}} to describe temperatures and gas concentrations in the bed and to obtain data with high accuracy and with a resolution in space and time that is high enough to be useful for validation of mathematical models. To close mass balances of the main species, (C, H, O, N), O 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, H 2, H 2 O and hydrocarbons were measured, and samples of char and tar were analysed. For gas extraction an oil-cooled probe was used. The experimental rig was developed to achieve well-defined, one-dimensional, conditions. The measurements show the different episodes in the conversion front: initial heating by radiation, drying, release of volatiles, ignition and heat release, production of combustion products, depletion of oxygen followed by gasification reactions.

40|$|Nitrogen oxides have {{received}} much attention as air pollutants. Many schemes {{have been developed}} to remove the low concentrations (> 1, 500 ppm) of NOx normally encountered in flue gases, but little emphasis has been placed on recovery of this NOx as a source of fixed nitrogen. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power production could potentially generate an effluent gas containing 15, 000 ppm N 0 X. This research is concerned with determining the effectiveness of using liquid absorbent systems to remove the nitric oxides from MHD exhaust for recovery as a fixed nitrogen fertilizer. Systems composed of organic electron donor solvents (i. e. di-methylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide) with aqueous alkali added were tested as absorbents for gas containing 7, 500 - 15, 000 ppm N 0 X. Simple aqueous alkali systems were tested similarly. Alkali compounds studied included the hydroxides, carbonates, and sulfites of sodium and potassium. <b>Continuous</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was obtained with a Thermo Electron Corporation Model 10 A Chemiluminescent NO-NOx Gas Analyzer. The organic systems with aqueous hydroxide were effective NOx absorbents, removing up to 98 % of the NOx in the gas stream. Carbonates and sulfites in the organic systems were less successful due to inability to absorb NO (as N 2 O 3). Solvent loss was a major disadvantage. The simple aqueous systems were equally effective NOx absorbents (with hydroxides, carbonates, or sulfites) removing up to 97 % of the N 0 X. They are preferred over the organic systems. The aqueous carbonate showed the greatest absorptive capacity. The ammonium based aqueous systems could not be evaluated due to analyzer interference. Carbon dioxide in the gas stream was not detrimental to absorption efficiency. Nitrites and nitrates were the resultant absorption product with both systems. Use of potassium compounds was preferred. All are potentially convertible to marketable fixed nitrogen fertilizers...|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review aims to get {{insight into the}} feasibility of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients with cancer prior to a physical exercise programme. We will focus on quality (defined as the adherence to international guidelines for methods of CPET) and safety of CPET. Furthermore, we compare the peak oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 peak) values of patients with cancer with reference values for healthy persons to put these values into a clinical perspective. A computer aided search with ‘cardiopulmonary exercise testing’ and ‘cancer’ using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pedro, CINAHL® and SPORTDiscus™ was carried out. We included studies in which CPET with <b>continuous</b> <b>gas</b> exchange <b>analysis</b> has been performed prior to a physical exercise programme in adults with cancer. Twenty studies describing 1158 patients were eligible. Reported adherence to international recommendations for CPET varied per item. In most studies, the methods of CPET were not reported in detail. Adverse events occurred in 1 % of patients. The percentage V̇O 2 peak of reference values for healthy persons varied between 65 % and 89 % for tests before treatment, between 74 % and 96 % for tests during treatment and between 52 % and 117 % for tests after treatment. Our results suggest that CPET is feasible {{and seems to be}} safe for patients with cancer prior to a physical exercise programme. We recommend that standard reporting and quality guidelines should be followed for CPET methods.

Intermittent blood gas assessments were carried out using a routine gas analyzer at any experimental phase and compared with values obtained {{at the same time}} settings during continuous monitoring with CDI™ 500 system. The Bland-Altman analysis was employed. Results Bias and precision for pO 2 were - 0. 06 kPa and 0. 22 kPa, respectively (r 2 = 0. 96); pCO 2 - 0. 02 kPa and 0. 15 kPa, respectively; pH - 0. 001 and 0. 01 units, respectively (r 2 = 0. 96). The analysis showed very good agreement for SO 2 (bias 0. 04,precision 0. 33, r 2 = 0. 95), Base excess (bias 0. 04,precision 0. 28, r 2 = 0. 98), HCO 3 (bias 0. 05,precision 0. 62, r 2 = 0. 92),hemoglobin (bias 0. 02,precision 0. 23, r 2 = 0. 96) and K + (bias 0. 02, precision 0. 27, r 2 = 0. 93).

40|$|LLNL {{has built}} and {{operated}} a pilot plant for processing oil shale using recirculating hot solids. This pilot plant, was adapted in 1993 {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of decomposing base hydrolysate, a mixture of sodium nitrite, sodium formate and other constituents. This material is the waste stream from the base hydrolysis process for destruction of energetic materials. In the Livermore process, the waste feed is thermally treated in a moving packed bed of ceramic spheres, where constituents in the waste decompose, {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide, to form solid sodium carbonate and a suite of gases including: methane, carbon monoxide, oxygen, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and possibly molecular nitrogen. The ceramic spheres are circulated and heated, providing the energy required for thermal decomposition. The spheres provide a large surface area for evaporation and decomposition to occur, avoiding sticking and agglomeration of the waste. We performed a 2. 5 hour test of the solids recirculation system, with continuous injection of approximately 0. 04 gal/min of waste. Gasses from the packed bed reactor were directed through the lift pipe and water was not condensed. Potassium carbonate (0. 356 M) was added to the hydrolysate prior to its introduction to the retort. <b>Continuous</b> on-line <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was invaluable in tracking the progress of the experiment and quantifying the decomposition products.

REE was calculated via indirect calorimetry using <b>continuous,</b> expired <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> following an overnight fast. Fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass were measured by bioelectrical impedance. B-mode ultrasound measured Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Gastrocnemius Medialis (GM) anatomical cross sectional area (ACSA). The Bone Specific Physical Activity Questionnaire measured physical activity. No difference in REE was found between CTRL and BeMD groups (1913 ± 203 & 1786 ± 324 Kcal respectively). Other physiological comparisons showed increased fat mass (+ 54 %), decreased TA ACSA (- 42 %), increased GM ACSA (+ 25 %) as well as reduced respiratory function (FVC - 28 %; FEV 1 - 27 %) in BeMD adults compared to controls. REE estimated from prediction equations (Schofield's) in Muscular Dystrophy were different from measured REE (P< 0. 05, bias = - 728 kcal), while the Mifflin equation was no different from measured REE (r 2 = 0. 58, Bias = - 8 kcal). Within the present BeMD, REE predicted from FFM (REE = FFM x 34. 57 - 270; r 2 = 0. 85) and body mass (REE = BM x 15. 65 + 421. 5; r 2 = 0. 66), were not different from measured REE (bias equals 0 and 0. 2 kcals, respectively). Despite no differences in REE between CTRL and BeMD adults, increased fat masses highlights the requirement for explicit nutritional guidelines, as well as maintenance of physical activity levels, where possible. Prediction equations are frequently used in clinical settings, however these {{have been shown to be}} less accurate in BeMD; therefore, the equations proposed here should be used where possible...|$|R

Induction was with fentanyl/propofol and maintenance was with sevoflurane 2. 5 % in oxygen/air. The airway device was removed when the patients were awake and the patients were transferred to the postanaesthesia care unit 10 min later. Air was sampled from a point 1. 5 m above the floor at a location remote from the ventilation outlet and analysed using a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer capable of <b>continuous</b> trace <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> at the parts per billion volume (ppbv) level. The concentration of sevoflurane was recorded every minute during three consecutive phases: for 5 min before the introduction of sevoflurane (background); after introduction of sevoflurane until removal of the airway device (intra-operative); and every minute after removal until the concentration returned to background levels. Median (interquartile range [range]) intra-operative sevoflurane concentrations were 200 - 400 times higher than background values for the laryngeal mask airway 1 (1 - 2 [0 - 3]) ppbv vs. 404 (278 - 523 [83 - 983]) ppbv, respectively, and the tracheal tube 2 (1 - 3 [0 - 5]) ppbv vs. 396 (204 - 589 [107 - 1735]) ppbv (both p < 0. 0001), and returned to background values within 5 min of removal. There were no differences in sevoflurane concentration between devices intra-operatively or after removal. The performance of the proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer was identical at the start {{and end of the}} 30 -day study. We conclude that peri-operative sevoflurane concentration in a modern operating theatre is similar for the laryngeal mask airway and the uncuffed tracheal tube in paediatric patients receiving intermittent positive pressure ventilation.
