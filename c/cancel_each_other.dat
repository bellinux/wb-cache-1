5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{belongs to}} the point group D3h in its monomeric form and D2h in its dimeric form. Both forms of aluminium chloride, however, do not possess a dipole moment because the bond dipole moments <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out.|$|E
5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

50|$|For {{the mixing}} of colored light, Isaac Newton's color wheel {{is often used to}} {{describe}} complementary colors, which are colors which <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture. Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle <b>cancel</b> out <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E

5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him {{if he does not}} return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

25|$|The Milankovitch cycles are {{a set of}} cyclic {{variations}} in characteristics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each cycle has a different length, so at some times their effects reinforce each other {{and at other times}} they (partially) <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the mass that is located at radii r > r0 exerts no net {{gravitational}} force at the distance r0 from the center.

25|$|The coil-rotation {{transformer}} used a fixed-position electromagnet coil {{in conjunction}} with a variable-position coil to vary the voltage in the line by varying the alignment of the two coils. Rotated 90 degrees apart, the secondary coil is affected by two equal but opposite fields from the primary, which effectively <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out and produce no voltage in the secondary.|$|E
25|$|The {{solar and}} lunar {{corrections}} work in opposite directions, {{and in some}} century years (for example, 1800 and 2100) they <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The {{result is that the}} Gregorian lunar calendar uses an epact table that is valid for a period of from 100 to 300 years. The epact table listed above is valid for the period 1900 to 2199.|$|E
25|$|Fermi {{estimates}} generally {{work because}} the estimations {{of the individual}} terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out.

50|$|When one {{contestant}} won {{the right}} to answer questions he/she selected one of the categories. If a contestant failed to correctly answer as many questions as he/she bid, control passed to the next highest bidder, then the lowest bidder if the second player was unsuccessful. If the two contestants matched bids and <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out, and the remaining contestant failed to fulfill his/her bid, the canceled players were given a chance to re-bid, with the higher bidder having a chance to answer questions from the two remaining categories. If they <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> out again, the game moved on to a new set of categories. When a contestant fulfilled the bid, the contestant won the pot.|$|R
