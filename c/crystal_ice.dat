5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear <b>crystal</b> <b>ice,</b> typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E

40|$|The Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) is an {{existing}} altitude simulation jet engine test facility located at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH. It was modified in 2012 with {{the integration of}} an <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud generation system. This paper documents the inaugural <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud test in PSL [...] the first ever full scale, high altitude <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud turbofan engine test to be conducted in a ground based facility. The test article was a Lycoming ALF 502 -R 5 high bypass turbofan engine, serial number LF 01. The objectives of the test were to validate the PSL <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud calibration and engine testing methodologies by demonstrating the capability to calibrate and duplicate known flight test events that occurred on the same LF 01 engine and to generate engine data to support fundamental and computational research to investigate and better understand the physics of <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> in a turbofan engine environment while duplicating known revenue service events and conducting test points while varying facility and engine parameters. During PSL calibration testing it was discovered than heated probes installed through tunnel sidewalls experienced ice buildup aft of their location due to <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> impinging upon them, melting and running back. Filtered city water {{was used in the}} cloud generation nozzle system to provide <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> nucleation sites. This resulted in mineralization forming on flow path hardware that led to a chronic degradation of performance during the month long test. Lacking internal flow path cameras, the response of thermocouples along the flow path was interpreted as ice building up. Using this interpretation, a strong correlation between total water content (TWC) and a weaker correlation between median volumetric diameter (MVD) of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud and the rate of ice buildup along the instrumented flow path was identified. For this test article the engine anti-ice system was required to be turned on before <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> would occur. The <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> event, an uncommanded reduction in thrust, was able to be turned on and off by manipulating cloud TWC. A flight test point where no <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> event occurred was also duplicated in PSL. Physics based computational tools were successfully used to predict tunnel settings to induce ice buildup along the low pressure compression system flow path for several test points at incrementally lower altitudes, demonstrating that development of <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> scaling laws is potentially feasible. Analysis of PSL test data showed that uncommanded reduction in thrust occurs during <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> cloud on operation prior to fan speed reduction. This supports previous findings that the reduction of thrust for this test article is due to ice buildup leading to a restricted airflow from either physical or aerodynamic blockage in the engine core flow path...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>crystals</b> {{are solid}} <b>ice</b> exhibiting atomic {{ordering}} on various length scales and include hexagonal columns, hexagonal plates, dendritic crystals, and diamond dust. The hugely symmetric shapes {{are due to}} depositional growth, namely, direct deposition of water vapour onto the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal.</b> Depending on environmental temperature and humidity, <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> can develop from the initial hexagonal prism into numerous symmetric shapes.

If the crystal migrates into regions with different environmental conditions, the growth pattern may change, and the final crystal may show mixed patterns.

The work has been carried out in the framework of project High Altitude <b>Ice</b> <b>Crystals</b> (HAIC), co-funded by the European Union. The developed ice accretion method is split in the numerical simulation of three distinct parts of the process: particle trajectories towards an object, particle impact on the object's surface and evolution of the ice layer on the surface. An Eulerian method has been applied to calculate the trajectories of the (melting) <b>ice</b> <b>crystals.</b> The trajectory method includes models which account for the effects of the shape of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> on its trajectory and on the heat transfer to and from the particle as well as phase change along its trajectory. On impact with a surface the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> can either bounce from the surface, break-up into a number of smaller fragments or stick to the surface. An impact model has been applied which relates the impingement characteristics to the amount of water that is present in the form of (supercooled) droplets or melted <b>ice</b> <b>crystals.</b> In {{the last part of the}} method the mass flux of impinging <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> is used to determine the ice layer by solving the mass and energy balance in control volumes along the surface along with accounting for erosion caused by the impinging <b>ice</b> <b>crystals.</b> The method for <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>icing</b> has been validated employing available experimental data.
