While generally not noticeable when using a tabletop controller, it becomes a noticeable problem when using 2-way switches or when utilizing some sort of <b>computerized</b> <b>controller.</b> The apparent delay can be lessened somewhat by using slower device dim rates. With more advanced modules another option is to use group control (lighting scene) extended commands. These allow adjusting several modules at once by a single command.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{regenerative}} Environmental Control/Life Support Systems requires instrumentation characteristics which evolve with successive development phases. As {{the development}} phase moves toward flight hardware, the system availability becomes an important design aspect which requires high reliability and maintainability. This program was directed toward instrumentation designs which incorporate features compatible with anticipated flight requirements. The first task {{consisted of the}} design, fabrication and test of a Performance Diagnostic Unit. In interfacing with a subsystem's instrumentation, the Performance Diagnostic Unit is capable of determining faulty operation and components within a subsystem, perform on-line diagnostics of what maintenance is needed and accept historical status on subsystem performance as such information is retained {{in the memory of}} a subsystem's <b>computerized</b> <b>controller.</b> The second focus was development and demonstration of analog signal conditioning concepts which reduce the weight, power, volume, cost and maintenance and improve the reliability of this key assembly of advanced life support instrumentation. The approach was to develop a generic set of signal conditioning elements or cards which can be configured to fit various subsystems.

40|$|Swine {{finishing}} facility ventilation has become relatively complex {{and is often}} mismanaged as a system. One of the few ways to truly understand these systems is to spend time systematically going through the many components {{of the building and}} how they work as a system. To learn to help producers better, a team of university Extension specialists that included agricultural engineers and animal scientists spent an extended period carefully documenting conditions in a deep-pit swine finishing building with two 1, 000 -head rooms. Exhaust fans connected to the manure pit and wall fans were operated at various stages as a negative-pressure ventilation system. A <b>computerized</b> <b>controller</b> activated exhaust fans, a ventilation curtain actuator, heaters, stir fans, and a spray cooling system. Gravity-controlled baffled ceiling inlets were evenly spaced in the building to provide good air distribution during cold and mild weather conditions. Following the review of current conditions and operating parameters, performance deficiencies were identified and recommendations were given regarding controller settings, inlet settings, and the transition to natural ventilation. Specific recommendations included changing minimum ventilation speed settings of fans based on animal size, removing inlet stops during warmer weather to avoid premature transition to natural ventilation, a change in how fans were staged, a change in setpoint, and the specific temperature at which the cooling system was engaged...|$|E

If a lens is equipped with presets, potentiometers attached to lens components that measure the position of that function, then the controller can work in a closed loop and move to a specific position. If the lens is not equipped with presets, then the controller can only move a lens function to an approximate position.|$|R

40|$|Some manufacturers, {{who have}} {{invested}} in sophisticated computer- controlled production equipment, are finding that the technologies do not perform as well as initially expected. While these new automated systems hold {{the potential for a}} company to regain a competitive edge by increasing product quality, decreasing production costs, and increasing flexibility, users of such systems are finding that the new production processes are difficult to keep operating. Downtime is a major problem and is expensive in terms of repair costs and lost revenue. The first issue addressed in this study {{is the extent to which}} downtime, in general, and maintainability, in particular, is a problem in computer-controlled production systems. We addressed this issue by analyzing failure data in a computer-controlled production process in the automobile industry. This analysis indicates that downtime is a problem and that problems with maintainability are a major contributing factor to the large amounts of downtime. The second issue addressed is the relative contributions of different kinds of failures to downtime and maintainability problems. Addressing this issue can help guide the focus of efforts to reduce downtime. Anecdotal evidence suggests that difficulty in troubleshooting failures via the <b>computerized</b> process <b>controllers</b> is driving the maintainability problems. Analysis of the same failure data mentioned above supports this evidence. The last issue raised is the question of what can be done to design a system of computer-controlled machines so that the system is more maintainable. We propose an experimental design to address this issue. The experiment focuses on two factors which we hypothesize contribute to troubleshooting difficulty and which are also design variables under the control of system designers. These two factors are complexity of the process control logic in the <b>computerized</b> process <b>controllers</b> in the system design and hierarchical arrangement of display pages in the design of the user interfaces...|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} trend of {{increasing}} automation, leading to self-organizing machine tools and production machines (“Industry 4. 0 ”), data acquisition and processing {{becomes more and more}} important. Based on these data, new monitoring functions and identification methods can be implemented in the machine control. Depending on the algorithms, also drive internal data, such as the actual torque, or the power consumption of the machine axes are required, partially at high sample rates. State of the art <b>computerized</b> numerical <b>controllers</b> (e. g. SIEMENS 840 D sl) however, are characterized by a separation of drive system and controller.

Subsequently, the most convenient method, which utilizes a drive-internal data recorder is chosen for implementation.

50|$|In traffic control, {{simple and}} old forms of signal {{controllers}} are {{what are known}} as electro-mechanical signal <b>controllers.</b> Unlike <b>computerized</b> signal <b>controllers,</b> electro-mechanical signal controllers are mainly composed of movable parts (cams, dials, and shafts) that control signals that are wired to them correctly. Aside from movable parts, electrical relays are also used. In general, electro-mechanical signal controllers use dial timers that have fixed, signalized intersection time plans. Cycle lengths of signalized intersections are determined by small gears that are located within dial timers. Cycle gears, as they are commonly known, range from 35 seconds to 120 seconds. If a cycle gear in a dial timer results in a failure, it can be replaced with another cycle gear that would be appropriate to use. Since a dial timer has only one signalized intersection time plan, it can control phases at a signalized intersection in only one way. Many old signalized intersections still use electro-mechanical signal controllers, and signals that are controlled by them are effective in one way grids where it is often possible to coordinate the signals to the posted speed limit. They are however disadvantageous when the signal timing of an intersection would benefit from being adapted to the dominant flows changing over the time of the day.|$|R

In the system, the higher harmonic blade pitch is input through a standard helicopter swashplate; for a four-blade helicopter rotor the 4 /rev vibration in the rotorcraft is minimized by inducing cyclic pitch motions at 3, 4, and 5 /rev in the rotating system. The controller employs the deterministic, cautious, and dual control approaches and two linear system models (local and global), {{as well as}} several methods of limiting control. Based on model testing, performed at moderate to high values of forward velocity and rotor thrust, reductions in the rotor test apparatus vibration from 75 to 95 percent are predicted, with HHC pitch amplitudes of less than one degree.
