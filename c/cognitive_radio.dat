We consider the sensing {{of the frequency}} spectrum for <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios,</b> based on energy detection. It {{has been shown that}} the sensing reliability can be improved by using several cooperating <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> that exchange their individual sensing information to a coordinator node.

In this paper, we propose a decentralized Q-learning algorithm to share the sensing time among the <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> in a way that maximize the throughputs of the radios.

25|$|In a <b>cognitive</b> <b>radio</b> system, {{unlicensed}} secondary {{users can}} use the resources which is licensed for primary users. When primary users want to use their licensed resources, secondary users has to vacate these resources. Hence secondary users have to constantly sense the channel for detecting the presence of primary user. It is very challenging to sense the activity of spatially distributed primary users in wireless channel. Spatially distributed nodes can improve the channel sensing reliability by sharing the information and reduce the probability of false alarming.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s a {{stochastic}} geometry model [...] {{was developed to}} study wireless networks. This model {{is considered to be}} pioneering and the origin of continuum percolation. Network models based on geometric probability were later proposed and used in the late 1970s [...] and continued throughout the 1980s [...] for examining packet radio networks. Later their use increased significantly for studying a number of wireless network technologies including mobile ad hoc networks, sensor networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, <b>cognitive</b> <b>radio</b> networks and several types of cellular networks, such as heterogeneous cellular networks. Key performance and quality of service quantities are often based on concepts from information theory such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, which forms the mathematical basis for defining network connectivity and coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{simplifying}} nature, {{the independence}} {{property of the}} Poisson process {{has been criticized for}} not realistically representing the configuration of deployed networks. For example, it does not capture node [...] "repulsion" [...] where two (or more) nodes in a wireless network may not be normally placed (arbitrarily) close to each other (for examples, base stations in a cellular network). In addition to this, MAC protocols often induce correlations or non-Poisson configurations into the geometry of the simultaneously active transmitter pattern. Strong correlations also arise in the case of <b>cognitive</b> <b>radio</b> networks where secondary transmitters are only allowed to transmit if they far from primary receivers. To answer these and other criticisms, a number of point processes have been suggested to represent the positioning of nodes including the binomial process, cluster processes, Matérn hard-core processes, and Strauss and Ginibre processes. For example, Matérn hard-core processes are constructed by dependently thinning a [...] Poisson point process. The dependent thinning is done in way such that for any point in the resulting hard-core process, there are no other points within a certain set radius of it, thus creating a [...] "hard-core" [...] around each point in the process. [...] On the other hand, soft-core processes have point repulsion that ranges somewhere between the hard-core processes and Poisson processes (which have no repulsion). More specifically, the probability of a point existing near another point in a soft-core point process decreases in some way as it approaches the other point, thus creating a [...] "soft-core" [...] around each point where other points can exist, but are less likely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As {{a result}} of an {{increasing}} growth in wireless technologies, it is inevitable to focus on managing spectral resources. Hence there is an increase in demand for available spectrum. The main way of handling this spectrum congestion is done using smart /intelligent <b>radio</b> systems called <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios.</b> <b>Cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> deals with the sharing of available spectrum between primary users and secondary users in an opportunistic way. Amongst all the functions of <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios,</b> spectrum sensing is of primary importance. Spectrum sensing is the searching of white spaces or empty spaces in the spectrum to make it available for secondary users when primary users are not in use. Out of various techniques employed for <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> spectrum sensing, energy detection mode of sensing is optimal and an algorithm for the same has been proposed here.

Recent research on <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> has started to introduce machine learning and reasoning techniques to wireless networks.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{concept of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> offers {{a way to}} use the limited radio-spectrum more efficiently by allowing networks and nodes to adaptively vary their parameters. An important element in the successful implementation of <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> is the ability to estimate the varying state of spectrum usage in a wide-band channel quickly and at minimum cost. In this work, we utilize a powerful non-convex optimization approach to provide sparse and unbiased estimates of the spectrum from limited non-uniformly sampled data. Simulation results for a wide-band communication scenario show that the noise floor is significantly reduced compared to other commonly used approaches.

30|$|One {{application}} of <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> {{is to provide}} broadband wireless access (BWA) in the licensed TV bands on a secondary access basis. This concept is examined to see under what conditions BWA could be viable. Rural areas require long range communication which requires spectrum to be available over large areas {{in order to be}} used by <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios.</b> Urban areas have less available spectrum at any range. Furthermore, {{it is not clear what}} regulatory model would best support BWA. This paper considers demographic (urban, rural) and licensing (unlicensed, nonexclusive licensed, exclusive licensed) dimensions. A general BWA efficiency and economic analysis tool is developed and then example parameters corresponding to each of these regimes are derived. The results indicate that an unlicensed model is viable; however, in urban areas spectrum needs can be met with existing unlicensed spectrum and <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> have no role. In the densest urban areas, the licensed models are not viable. This is not simple because there is less unused spectrum in urban areas. Urban area <b>cognitive</b> <b>radios</b> are constrained to short ranges and many broadband alternatives already exist. As a result the cost per subscriber is prohibitively high. These results provide input to spectrum policy issues.|$|R
