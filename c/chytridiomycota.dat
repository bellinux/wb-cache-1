5|$|The major phyla (sometimes called divisions) of fungi {{have been}} {{classified}} {{mainly on the}} basis of characteristics of their sexual reproductive structures. Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota.|$|E
5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chytridiomycota</b> are {{commonly}} known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
5|$|It {{is presumed}} that the fungi colonized the land during the Cambrian (542–488.3Ma), long before land plants. Fossilized hyphae and spores {{recovered}} from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (460Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed {{at a time when}} the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants. Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416–359.2Ma), when they occur abundantly in the Rhynie chert, mostly as Zygomycota and <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> At about this same time, approximately 400Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged, and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1–299Ma).|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Glomeromycota and Zygomycota), micro-organisms (including Mycetozoa), and plants.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} species of fungi {{including}} lichen-forming species, and the mycobiota is less poorly known than in {{many other parts of}} the world. The most recent checklist of Basidiomycota (bracket fungi, jelly fungi, mushrooms and toadstools, puffballs, rusts and smuts), published in 2005, accepts over 3600 species. The most recent checklist of Ascomycota (cup fungi and their allies, including most lichen-forming fungi), published in 1985, accepts another 5100 species. These two lists did not include conidial fungi (fungi mostly with affinities in the Ascomycota but known only in their asexual state) {{or any of the other}} main fungal groups (<b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Glomeromycota and Zygomycota). The number of fungal species known very probably exceeds 10,000. There is widespread agreement among mycologists that many others are yet to be discovered.|$|E

5000|$|Blastocladiomycota {{is one of}} the {{currently}} recognized phyla within the kingdom Fungi. [...] Blastocladiomycota was originally the order Blastocladiales within the phylum <b>Chytridiomycota</b> until molecular and zoospore ultrastructural characters were used to demonstrate it was not monophyletic with <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> The order was first erected by Petersen for a single genus, Blastocladia, which was originally considered a member of the oomycetes. Accordingly, members of Blastocladiomycota are often referred to colloquially as [...] "chytrids." [...] However, some feel [...] "chytrid" [...] should refer only to members of <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> Thus, members of Blastocladiomyota are commonly called [...] "blastoclads" [...] by mycologists. Alternatively, members of Blastocladiomycota, <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> and Neocallimastigomycota lumped together as the zoosporic true fungi. Blastocaldiomycota contains 5 families and approximately 12 genera. This early diverging branch of kingdom Fungi is the first to exhibit alternation of generations. As well, two (once) popular model organisms—Allomyces macrogynus and Blastocladiella emersonii—belong to this phylum.|$|E

5000|$|The order Blastocladiales, {{originally}} {{within the}} <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> are now {{classified as a}} separate phylum, the Blastocladiomycota.|$|E
5000|$|Species of <b>Chytridiomycota</b> have {{traditionally}} been delineated and classified based on development, morphology, substrate, and method of zoospore discharge. [...] However, single spore isolates (or isogenic lines) display {{a great amount of}} variation in many of these features; thus, these features cannot be used to reliably classify or identify a species. Currently, taxonomy in <b>Chytridiomycota</b> is based on molecular data, zoospore ultrastructure and some aspects of thallus morphology and development.|$|E
50|$|Some {{plants and}} fungi act as vectors for various pathogens. For example, the big-vein disease of lettuce was long {{thought to be}} caused {{by a member of the}} fungal {{division}} <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> namely Olpidium brassicae. Eventually however, the disease was shown to be viral. Later it transpired that the virus was transmitted by the zoospores of the fungus and also survived in the resting spores. Since then, many other fungi in the <b>Chytridiomycota</b> have been shown to vector plant viruses.|$|E
50|$|Piromyces sp. E2 is an {{eukaryotic}} species {{belonging to}} the phylum <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> which comprises organisms that possess flagellated zoospores, making them unique among the fungi.|$|E
50|$|The {{biodiversity}} of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Glomeromycota and Zygomycota), micro-organisms (including Mycetozoa), and plants.|$|E
50|$|Chytridiomycetes is {{the major}} class of the phylum <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> which {{contains}} a number of parasitic species. At least two species in this class are known to infect a number of amphibian species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chytridiomycota</b> are unusual {{among the}} Fungi {{in that they}} {{reproduce}} with zoospores. For most members of Chytridiomycetes, sexual reproduction is not known. Asexual reproduction occurs through the release of zoospores (presumably) derived through mitosis.|$|E

Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota.|$|E
50|$|Similar to <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> {{members of}} Blastocladiomycota produce asexual zoospores to colonize new substrates. In some species, a curious {{phenomenon}} {{has been observed}} in the asexual zoospores. From time to time, asexual zoospores will pair up and exchange cytoplasm but not nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Petersen's main {{research}} was {{in what was}} then known as lower fungi - <b>Chytridiomycota</b> and Oomycetes, but he also studied the systematics of Red algae. Parallel to these lines of research, he investigated the intraspecific morphological variation in plant species - which would today be called quantitative genetics.|$|E
50|$|This genus {{has been}} {{difficult}} to classify, being placed in several different taxa in the past (e.g., <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> Dinoflagellata) but it is now known to be an alveolate. Its closest relations appear to be the genus Thalassomyces. These genera have been grouped together to form the family Ellobiopsidae.|$|E

Posterior {{whiplash}} flagella, {{a characteristic}} of <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> and a proposed a uniting trait of the Opisthokonts, a large clade of eukaryotes containing animals and fungi.

5000|$|In {{an older}} and more {{restricted}} sense (not used here), the term [...] "chytrids" [...] referred just to those fungi in the class Chytridiomycetes. Here, the term “chytrid” refers to all members of <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> The chytrids have also been included among the Protoctista, but are now regularly classed as fungi.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{filamentous}} fungi (Such as Glomeromycota, <b>Chytridiomycota</b> and Neocalligomastigomycota) {{may contain}} multiple nuclei in a coenocytic mycelium. A coenocyte {{functions as a}} single coordinated unit composed of multiple cells linked structurally and functionally, i.e. through gap junctions. Fungal mycelia in which hyphae lack septa are known as [...] "aseptate" [...] or [...] "coenocytic".|$|E
50|$|Synchytriaceae is a chytrid fungus {{family in}} the {{division}} <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> The family was described by German mycologist Joseph Schröter in 1892. The type genus, Synchytrium, contains about 200 species of fungi that are parasitic on flowering plants, ferns, mosses, and algae. Synchytrium endobioticum causes potato wart disease, an economically important disease of cultivated potato.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the least}} {{expected}} terrestrial environments the chytrid thrive in are periglacial soils. The population of the <b>Chytridiomycota</b> species are able to be supported {{even though there is}} a lack of plant life in these frozen regions due to the large amounts of water in periglacial soil and pollen blowing up from below the timberline.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} the rust fungus Puccinia jaceae var. solstitialis, first {{released}} in July 2003 on a ranch in the Napa Valley, has shown promise as an agent against yellow star-thistle. The rust causes widespread pathology in {{the leaves of the}} plant and slow its dispersal. The fungus Synchytrium solstitiale (Synchytrium of phylum <b>Chytridiomycota)</b> is also being considered as an agent of biological control.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chytridiomycota</b> is a {{division}} of zoosporic organisms in the kingdom Fungi, informally known as chytrids. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek χυτρίδιον chytridion, meaning [...] "little pot", describing the structure containing unreleased zoospores. Chytrids are one of the early diverging fungal lineages, and their membership in kingdom Fungi is demonstrated with chitin cell walls, a posterior whiplash flagellum, absorptive nutrition, use of glycogen as an energy storage compound, and synthesis of lysine by the α-amino adipic acid (AAA) pathway.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chytridiomycota</b> are {{commonly}} known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{this group}} are {{distinguished}} from one another based on morphology of the various life cycle stages, differences in cytology, both the cytological reaction and gross reaction of the host plant to infection, and the host plant. However, similar to other members of <b>Chytridiomycota,</b> all of these features exhibit considerable variation and often overlap between species. It is possible that many species names refer to the same organism. In some cases, {{there is not enough}} variation, and it is possible that one name refers to a species complex. An example is Synchytrium aureum; as mentioned above, it is able to infect a broad range of hosts. However, cross inoculation experiments reveal that strains demonstrate considerable host range restrictions, which implies the presence of cryptic species. A recent study using molecular characters placed Synchytrium endobioticum and two other species outside of Chytridiales. They were sister to the Lobulomycetales, which suggests the genus likely represents a distinct order within <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> However, the study did not contain S. taraxci, the type, and so could not make taxonomic changes. A more recent study has included the type along with those other species. So far, the genus is monophyletic as are several of the subgenera. Two subgenera were non-monophyletic: Pycnosynchytrium and Microsynchytrium. The study also found deep divergences and fast evolution rates in the genus, which is to be expected under Red Queen dynamics.|$|E

50|$|Synchytrium {{is a large}} genus {{of plant}} {{pathogens}} within the phylum <b>Chytridiomycota.</b> Species {{are commonly known as}} false rust or wart disease. Approximately 200 species are described, and all are obligate parasites of angiosperms, ferns, or mosses. Early species were mistakenly classified among the higher fungi (Ascomycota or Basidiomycota) because of their superficial similarity to the rust fungi. Anton de bary and Mikhail S. Woronin recognized the true nature of these fungi and established the genus to accommodate Synchytrium taraxci, which grows on dandelions, and S.succisae, which grows on Succisa pratensis. Synchytrium taraxci is the type of the genus. The genus has been divided into 6 subgenera based on differences in life cycles.|$|E
50|$|Members of Synchytrium are endobiotic, holocarpic, and inoperculate. This means Synchytrium species grow {{inside of}} the host cell (endobiotic), produce {{structures}} other than a zoosporangium (holocarpic), and do not release zoospores through a lid-like structure (inoperculate). Zoospores of other members of <b>Chytridiomycota</b> typically give rise to one zoosorangium or a polycentric thallus capable of producing many zoosporangia. In Synchytrium, the zoospore nucleus divides many times with each daughter nucleus giving rise to a zoosporangium. This produces a cluster of clonal zoosporangia, often enveloped with a membrane. This cluster is called a sorus. The zoospore can give rise to the sorus directly or it {{can act as a}} prosorus. The difference is demonstrated in the life cycle, which is discussed below.|$|E
