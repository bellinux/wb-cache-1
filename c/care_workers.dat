5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|While {{much care}} work is {{performed}} in the home, {{it may also be}} done for pay. As such, feminist economics examine its implications, including the increasing involvement of women in paid care work, the potential for exploitation, and effects on the lives of <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> The government had been called on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} we {{examine how the}} Danish <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> defines herself as a professional, and how {{the ideals of the}} social worker {{influence}} her practices. We combine a social constructivist perspective with a practice theoretic perspective and from a bottom-up view we carry out 9 interviews with social workers and ask them to tell their different stories about how to be a good <b>care</b> <b>worker.</b> We also use the main book from the <b>Care</b> <b>Worker</b> Program to discuss the different ideals of the <b>care</b> <b>worker.</b> We look into research on care, already present on the subject, to form the questions in the interviews, and to carry out an analysis on the interviews. Research on the changes of the field counts amongst others Karen Christensen (2005) and Betina Dybbroe (2006). To define and understand the relation between <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> and client we also look into research from Joan Tronto (1993), Kari Wærness (1989) and Anne Liveng (2007). To examine the practice of the social worker we are inspired by Pierre Bourdieu and his concept of Habitus (1990). A concept of habitus in consistent to the female <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> is presented by Tine Rask Eriksen (1995), the Care Habitus. We conclude that the <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> constructs a very altruistic ideal about how to be professional. The main book from the program shows the same thing and stresses the importance of knowledge that comes to form from social and personal experience. The professional and personal knowledge is combined in the book and in the narratives of the agents. This has an influence on how the <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> gains knowledge which she explains mainly comes from experience. The young and newly educated <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> therefore is less valued than the more experienced <b>care</b> <b>worker.</b> The more experienced <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> positions herself in addition to the young with less experience. The young and less experienced <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> constructs a different ideal of being a professional <b>care</b> <b>worker.</b> Her story is about being professional, not from personal skills, but from professional skills. As she understands herself as a professional, it means that she also gains better opportunities to come up with solutions to the problems that appear in practice. She has professional tools to use, and her success in the job relies on her professional skills...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{cooperative}} study conducted by a child <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> and a researcher. The researcher observed her care activities and after each session of child care, they discussed her care. This study analyzed their narratives to examine how the child <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> made decisions about her child care. The result shows {{that there are two}} stages in the narratives. In the first stage; both the child <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> and the researcher were in a psychologically equal position, or a sort of "parallel relationship," as the child <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> narrated what she thought in her daily care. This stage is based on their wish to understand each other. This relationship led to what might be termed "the conversational relationship. " In the conversational relationship, they formed cooperative contexts for child care. These features suggest that such a relationship between a child <b>care</b> <b>worker</b> and a researcher is as important in a clinical narrative setting as in a conference for child care...|$|R

5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. Routine vaccination of health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination). By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Beshear {{announced}} six mandatory, unpaid furlough {{days for}} most state employees {{in order to}} achieve the savings called for by the budget. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the furlough for public safety and mental health <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> The American Federation of County State and Municipal Employees (AFCSME) Council 62, which represents about 9,000 of Kentucky's state workers, filed suit to block implementation of the furloughs. A Franklin County Circuit Court Judge refused to issue an injunction in September 2010, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. A month later, AFCSME agreed to drop the suit and address the furlough issue through Beshear's Employee Advisory Council. Ultimately, all six furlough days were observed as outlined in Beshear's plan.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

25|$|The {{move into}} health care was {{particularly}} risky. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 originally included health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> from {{the protection of}} federal labor law, but the Taft-Hartley Act amendments exempted workers employed by non-profit health care organizations from the law in 1947. Since nearly all health care organizations {{at the time were}} non-profit, this effectively excluded the vast majority of health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> from federal labor law. In 1962, Congress passed legislation allowing workers in health care institutions owned by the federal government to engage in collective bargaining. Publicly owned hospitals were covered by the NLRA in 1967, and non-profit nursing homes in 1970. Congress amended the Taft-Hartley Act in 1974 to bring non-profit hospitals back under the NLRA's coverage. BSEIU had organized its first hospital workers in San Francisco in the 1930s. Hardy's push into health care proceeded very slowly. Nationwide, only 2.3 percent of all health care institutions had a union in 1970. Despite a sharp upturn in the number of dismissals of health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> for union activity in the 1950s and 1960s, Hardy had organized one of the largest pockets of unionized health <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> outside New York City by the late 1960s.|$|E
