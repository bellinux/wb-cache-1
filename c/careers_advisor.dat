After he graduated from Oxford University, Davies joined the BBC's children's department in 1985 on a part-time basis and worked in varying positions, including writing and producing two series, Dark Season and Century Falls. He left the BBC in the early 1990s to work for Granada Television and later became a freelance writer.|$|E

During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama about community belonging and identity in early-1980s West Glamorgan.

At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E
25|$|Nouns used attributively {{to qualify}} other nouns are {{generally}} in the singular, even though for example, a dog catcher catches {{more than one}} dog, and a department store {{has more than one}} department. This is true even for some binary nouns where the singular form is not found in isolation, such as a trouser mangle or the scissor kick. This is also true where the attribute noun is itself qualified with a number, such as a twenty-dollar bill, a ten-foot pole or a two-man tent. The plural is used for pluralia tantum nouns: a glasses case is for eyeglasses, while a glass case is made of glass (but compare eyeglass case); also an arms race versus arm wrestling. The plural may be used to emphasise the plurality of the attribute, especially in British English but very rarely in American English: a <b>careers</b> <b>advisor,</b> a languages expert. The plural is also more common with irregular plurals for various attributions: women killers are women who kill, whereas woman killers are those who kill women.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines current careers {{education and}} guidance being delivered {{in secondary schools}} and determines whether it is relevant and helpful for students during their decision making process by asking the students directly. The role of <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors</b> is also investigated, the prescribed careers education curriculum examined and their professional qualifications considered. A qualitative study method was chosen and involved {{the use of a}} questionnaire for <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors,</b> a focus group for Year 13 students, and semi-structured interviews for Year 13 students and those two years post-school. The findings highlight the very complex nature of careers education and guidance and show there are marked differences {{in terms of what the}} students and post- students think they need in order to make informed career decisions and what the <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors</b> are willing and able to deliver within the secondary sector. Also that students and parents should be consulted as part of any careers education programme and their individual circumstances considered. The study highlights variances within the qualifications of <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors</b> and <b>careers</b> education curriculum delivery across schools. This raises a number of implications for Principals, Deans, <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors</b> and policymakers including the value of consulting students and offering holistic careers education where the student is placed at the centre, the importance of work experience and allowing broad exposure to as many career fields as possible, placing more emphasis on careers education in Year 9 and 10, and educating parents as part of the careers process. The professional qualifications of <b>Careers</b> <b>Advisors</b> and consistent delivery of the curriculum should also be of concern...|$|R
