25|$|The {{microprocessor}} is a <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> that processes {{instructions and}} communicates with outside devices, controlling {{most of the}} operations of a computer through the central processing unit on a single integrated circuit.

25|$|Nanotechnology {{will replace}} our entire {{manufacturing}} base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible {{way of making}} products. The aim is not simply to replace today's <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} at least four major false alarms, the most recent in 1995, that {{resulted}} in the activation of nuclear attack early warning protocols.

One day Ryota Sakamoto awakens to find himself stranded on a tropical island with a pouch full of bombs and a <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> embedded in his hand. He soon learns that he has been entered into a competition where he must play Btooom! for real—where losing means death.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, graphs {{are used}} to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach {{can be taken to}} problems in social media, travel, biology, <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> design, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.|$|E

25|$|The goal of luring a <b>computer</b> <b>chip</b> {{fabrication}} plant (chip fab) {{was one of}} the earliest goals of, and reasons underlying, the Tech Valley name. The plan to get a chip fab to the Capital District predates the Tech Valley slogan. In 1997, New York set out submissions for possible chip fab sites that it could whittle to 10 sites around the state that would be pre-approved and pre-permitted for a chip plant. Years before that the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's RPI Tech Park had been visited by semiconductor companies, but they had chosen not to build. The renewed interest by the region in luring them was spurred by the research centers and training of specialists for the industry by area colleges such as the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Hudson Valley Community College. Responding to the state's request for potential sites, Rensselaer County proposed the same RPI Tech Park site; Schenectady County proposed two sites, one of which was in Hillside Industrial Park in Niskayuna; Saratoga County proposed two sites; and Albany County proposed three sites, two in Bethlehem and one in Guilderland. The state ultimately decided on 13 sites it would aggressively promote, most of which were in Tech Valley. As one of the thirteen sites chosen, the RPI Tech Park site originally met little opposition from the town of North Greenbush in which it sat. As time progressed opposition grew in response to concerns about potential impacts on traffic and the environment. The RPI Tech Park site, which by October 1999 had become one of only nine sites still being marketed by the state, ended when the North Greenbush town council voted to terminate the review process. A site in Wallkill, Orange County was the first site in Tech Valley and in the entire state to receive pre-approval for a chip fab.|$|E
