5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ellis Charles Wackett, CB, CBE (13August 1901– 3August 1984) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Its chief engineer from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's <b>controlling</b> <b>body,</b> the Air Board, for a record seventeen years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of airworthiness. Commencing his service career as a Royal Australian Navy cadet during World WarI, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|In December 1966, Rowland became {{commanding}} officer of No.3 Aircraft Depot (No.3 AD) at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with the acting rank of group captain; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967. After completing his tenure at No.3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook, New South Wales. In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the Royal College of Defence Studies, London. Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to air vice marshal to serve as Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied {{a seat on the}} Australian Air Board, the service's <b>controlling</b> <b>body</b> that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).|$|E
5|$|Lukis {{went on to}} lead No.1 Squadron in {{the early}} 1930s, and was {{promoted}} to group captain in 1938. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire the same year, {{he was in charge}} of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, during the early years of World WarII. He later held forward commands in the South West Pacific theatre, including Northern Area (later North-Eastern Area), for which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and No.9 Operational Group (later Northern Command). Lukis also served on the Air Board, the RAAF's <b>controlling</b> <b>body,</b> as Air Member for Personnel. After retirement from the Air Force in 1946, he became a manager with Australian National Airways, and was active in veterans' associations. He died in 1966 at the age of sixty-nine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A micro finance {{institution}} provides public financial services for micro to small business activities {{as well as}} low-income earners that {{are not able to}} access formal financial institutions. Village Credit Institution (called LPD) is a micro {{finance institution}}. It is supervised by a <b>control</b> <b>body</b> named Badan Pengawas, which acts as an internal auditor. The performance indicator of the <b>control</b> <b>body</b> would be the increase of audit quality and audit report, thus increase the function and credibility of the <b>control</b> <b>body.</b>   The aim of this research was to examine the effect of auditors’ professionalism, independence, and work experience on audit quality of <b>control</b> <b>bodies</b> of LPD in Denpasar city. A survey towards 33 LPD in Denpasar with 3 respondents each was conducted, providing 99 respondents in total. Samples are taken using purposive sampling method, including head of LPD, members of <b>control</b> <b>body,</b> and internal auditors. Data was collected using questionnaire and observation conducted in 2012. Data was then analyzed using multiple linear regressions. Hypotheses were tested using F-test and t-test. The results showed that simultaneously, auditor professionalism, independence, and experience affected audit quality of <b>control</b> <b>body</b> of LPD.

5|$|Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.38 Group RAF, Bladin {{was closely}} {{involved}} in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France. He flew a mission on D-Day, 6June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to Normandy, and was mentioned in despatches two days later. Completing his RAF {{service on the}} staff of the Second Tactical Air Force in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944. On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with directives from the Air Board, the RAAF's <b>controlling</b> <b>body,</b> but in the end the Australian government made no change to command arrangements.|$|E
5|$|When Wackett {{left the}} Air Force on 31December 1959, he was its longest-serving officer. The {{next year he}} joined the Australian National Airlines Commission (ANAC), the <b>controlling</b> <b>body</b> of the federal government's {{domestic}} carrier, Trans Australia Airlines (TAA). He rose to the Vice Chairmanship of ANAC before retiring in 1968. During his term on the commission, Wackett witnessed {{the arrival of the}} Jet Age on domestic air routes; TAA took delivery of its first Boeing 727 in 1964, and its first Douglas DC-9 in 1967. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Like his brother Lawrence, who wrote two books on the subject, Ellis Wackett's chief hobby was angling. He died in Warracknabeal, Victoria, on 3August 1984; his wife predeceased him in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Headlam was {{promoted}} to substantive air commodore on 1January 1955. In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College. Returning to Australia, he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air, Canberra, from 19March to 21October 1957, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Walters, and again from 24August 1959 to 28March 1960, between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely. In this role Headlam occupied {{a seat on the}} Air Board, the service's <b>controlling</b> <b>body</b> that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William John Allison, examining conditions of defence service; the committee's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay, among other improvements. Headlam's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959. The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF's Directorate of Intelligence. Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, gazetted on 3June. In May 1960 he became acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.|$|E

25|$|While the throw-pass was in effect, {{particularly}} during the early 1940s, there were talks between the VFA and VFL towards re-amalgamating the two bodies. Although the throw-pass had been a great success for the VFA, {{it was felt that}} a single <b>controlling</b> <b>body</b> for football in Victoria playing under a uniform set of rules was {{in the best interests of}} football as a whole. Negotiations for an amalgamation took place over several years, but broke down several times over a variety of issues, including representation at board level, Australian National Football Council representation, and a promotion and relegation structure between the VFA and VFL.|$|E

The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and wanted to know whether other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{the council}} {{met for the}} first time in five years. At that meeting, the council voted to reduce {{representation}} for each state from two delegates to one, deciding that it would be preferable for each state to have only one <b>controlling</b> <b>body.</b> This meant that the Goldfields Football League lost its representation on the Council, and in the bitter aftermath it temporarily broke off its relationship with the WAFL, choosing to affiliate with the VFA rather than the WAFL and resulting in the annual Western Australian State Premiership not being contested for the next two years. With the reduction in delegates and the withdrawal of New Zealand, the council was reduced to six delegates and its name was amended to the Australian Football Council.|$|E

25|$|Leagues not {{represented}} by delegates {{on the council}} would still come under the council's influence by affiliating {{under the umbrella of}} their state <b>controlling</b> <b>body.</b> Notably, the VFA remained unaffiliated, refusing to affiliate with the league which had seceded from it ten years earlier. Victoria's Con Hickey was made the inaugural president of the council. It was initially decided that clubs affiliated with the state controlling bodies would be charged a levy equal to 5% of their income to finance the council's activities, which included the expense of holding meetings, and for propaganda campaigns and developing school football in Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand, all of which were rugby football territories; the size of levies and funds varied throughout the council's history. Changes to the council's laws or rules required a three-quarters majority to pass.|$|E
25|$|Like all sauropods, Brachiosaurus was homeothermic (maintaining {{a stable}} {{internal}} temperature) and endothermic (<b>controlling</b> <b>body</b> temperature through internal means), {{meaning that it}} was able to actively control its body temperature ("warm-blooded"), producing the necessary heat through a high basic metabolic rate of its cells. In the past, Brachiosaurus has been used an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great caloric needs to fuel endothermy. However, these calculations were based on incorrect assumptions about the available cooling surfaces (the large air sacs were not known), and a grossly inflated body mass. These inaccuracies resulted in the overestimation of heat production and the underestimation of heat loss. The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for evaporative cooling of the blood.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Canberra {{was granted}} a non-voting {{position}} on the council. The city of Canberra was only about fifteen years old, Australian rules football had only been played in Canberra for a few years, and the council had originally intended to let Canberra fall under the New South Wales league's control; but after discussion, the council decided that the game {{had a chance to}} prosper in the new city, and that it could be better developed there if it had its own <b>controlling</b> <b>body,</b> rather than a New South Wales body preoccupied with competing with rugby league in Sydney – thus a non-voting delegate was granted. In a rebranding exercise, the council was renamed the Australian National Football Council, and (with the exception of the VFL) the controlling bodies took names ending with 'Australian National Football League' – resulting in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), Western Australian National Football League (WANFL), Tasmanian Australian National Football League (TANFL), etc.|$|E
