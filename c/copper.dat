5|$|Although {{the output}} of <b>copper</b> {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty <b>copper</b> mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more <b>copper</b> mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined <b>copper</b> deposits by 1165. Even though <b>copper</b> cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of <b>copper</b> money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued <b>copper</b> currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song <b>copper</b> coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid <b>copper</b> as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing <b>copper.</b> The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from <b>copper</b> toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, <b>copper,</b> iron, and zinc.

5|$|Chronic <b>copper</b> {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion.

By 1781, 82 ships of the line had been <b>coppered,</b> along with fourteen 50-gun ships, 115 frigates, and 182 unrated vessels.

5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black <b>copper</b> oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (<b>copper</b> carbonate) can often be seen on old <b>copper</b> structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. <b>Copper</b> tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various <b>copper</b> sulfides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, <b>copper</b> membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries <b>copper</b> inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of <b>copper,</b> an enzyme called ATP7A releases <b>copper</b> into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links <b>copper</b> to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess <b>copper</b> by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. <b>Copper</b> accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks <b>copper</b> (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all <b>copper</b> ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of <b>copper</b> on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of <b>copper</b> reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of <b>copper</b> in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of <b>copper</b> production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak <b>copper,</b> analogous to peak oil.|$|E

5|$|<b>Copper</b> is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains <b>copper</b> {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. <b>Copper</b> is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, <b>copper</b> is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of <b>copper</b> in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the <b>copper</b> that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a <b>copper</b> source. <b>Copper</b> in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess <b>copper,</b> if needed, via bile, which carries some <b>copper</b> out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is a}} key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, <b>copper</b> is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, <b>copper</b> is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of <b>copper</b> per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure <b>copper</b> is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of <b>copper</b> results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E

5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. <b>Copper</b> was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; <b>copper</b> continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. <b>Copper</b> plating and <b>copper</b> sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to <b>copper</b> would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary <b>copper</b> production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} <b>copper</b> toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary <b>copper</b> metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with <b>copper</b> absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on <b>copper</b> ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Copper</b> {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a <b>copper</b> head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in <b>copper</b> smelting. Experience with <b>copper</b> has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, <b>copper</b> smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old <b>Copper</b> Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of <b>copper</b> made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

5|$|<b>Copper</b> toxicosis, {{also known}} as <b>copper</b> storage disease and <b>copper</b> {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of <b>copper</b> in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to <b>copper</b> toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to <b>copper</b> storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with <b>copper.</b> This causes the cell to store <b>copper</b> in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when <b>copper</b> accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate <b>copper.</b>|$|E
