50|$|Optical fiber {{connectors}} {{are used}} to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. The basic connector unit is a connector assembly. A connector assembly consists of an adapter and two <b>connector</b> <b>plugs.</b> Due to the sophisticated polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are generally assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier’s manufacturing facility. However, the assembly andpolishing operations involved can be performed in the field, for example to make cross-connect jumpers to size.|$|R

The VHDCI connector is a very small connector that allows placement of four wide SCSI connectors {{on the back of a}} single PCI card slot. Physically, it looks like a miniature Centronics type connector. It uses the regular 68-contact pin assignment. The male <b>connector</b> (<b>plug)</b> is used on the cable and the female connector ("receptacle") on the device.|$|E
50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of <b>connector</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E

A primary goal of the Atari computer design was user-friendliness which was assisted by the SIO bus. Since only one kind of <b>connector</b> <b>plug</b> is used for all devices the Atari computer was easy for novice users to expand. Atari SIO devices used an early form of plug-n-play. Peripherals on the bus have their own IDs, and can deliver downloadable drivers to the Atari computer during the boot process.

5000|$|The term [...] "socket" [...] is {{analogous}} to physical female connectors, communication between two nodes through a channel being visualized as a cable with two male <b>connectors</b> <b>plugging</b> into sockets at each node. Similarly, the term [...] "port" [...] (another term for a female connector) is used for external endpoints at a node, and the term [...] "socket" [...] is also used for an internal endpoint of local inter-process communication (IPC) (not over a network). However, the analogy is strained, as network communication need not be one-to-one or have a channel.|$|R

50|$|<b>Plug</b> and socket <b>connectors</b> {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female {{receptacle}} (typically socket contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN <b>connector.</b> <b>Plugs</b> generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R

40|$|A 4 -wide {{internal}} cable and connector solution is being designed for connecting controllers (e. g. PCI cards) to backplanes. It {{is intended to}} be used in place of 4 SATA host connectors (on the controller) to 4 separate SATA cables to 4 SATA host connectors (on the backplane). This cable/connector is being proposed for both SATA II and SAS. Figure 1 shows the <b>connector</b> <b>plug</b> used on the backplanes. It follows the design of the SATA host connector. Figure 1 — Internal wide <b>connector</b> <b>plug</b> picture (from Amphenol) Editor’s Note 1 : The connector ended up with 6 sidebands in the middle rather than 4 as shown. Editor’s Note 2 : SFF- 8484 also defines a two lane interface. This proposal is not adding support for that into SAS- 1. 1. That could be proposed separately later on if needed. The connector interface includes 4 high-speed serial channels and 6 sideband signals (in the middle). It is split into two tongues for stability. SAS- 1. 1 should recognize this as a standard connector and define signal assignments for it.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) {{are rapidly}} gaining popularity on our roads. Besides a comparatively high purchasing price, the main two problems limiting their use are the short driving range and inconvenient charging process. In this {{paper we address}} the following by presenting an automatic robot-based charging station with 3 D vision guidance for plugging and unplugging the charger. First of all, the whole system concept consisting of a 3 D vision system, an UR 10 robot and a charging station is presented. Then we show the shape-based matching methods used to successfully identify and get the exact pose of the charging port.
