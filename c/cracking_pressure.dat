25|$|Scuba demand valves {{which are}} set to breathe lightly (low <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure,</b> and low work of breathing) may tend to free-flow {{relatively}} easily, particularly if the gas flow in the housing {{has been designed to}} assist in holding the valve open by reducing the internal pressure. The <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> of a sensitive demand valve is often less than the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inside of an air-filled housing and the water below the diaphragm when the mouthpiece is pointed upwards. To avoid excessive loss of gas due to inadvertent activation of the valve when the DV is out of the diver's mouth, some second stages have a desensitising mechanism which causes some back-pressure in the housing, by impeding the flow or directing it against the inside of the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|Some demand valves use a small, {{sensitive}} {{pilot valve}} {{to control the}} opening of the main valve. The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure.</b> They are generally more complicated and expensive to service.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand valve}} detects when the diver starts inhaling and {{supplies}} the diver with {{a breath of}} gas at ambient pressure. This is done by a mechanical system linking a pressure differential sensor (diaphragm) to a valve which is opened to an extent proportional to the displacement of the diaphragm difference. The pressure difference between {{the inside of the}} mouthpiece and the ambient pressure outside the diaphragm required to open the valve is known as the <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure.</b> This <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> difference is usually negative but may be slightly positive on a positive pressure regulator (a regulator that maintains a pressure inside the mouthpiece, mask or helmet, which is slightly greater than the ambient pressure). Once the valve has opened, gas flow should continue at the smallest stable pressure difference reasonably practicable while the diver inhales, and should stop as soon as gas flow stops. Several mechanisms have been devised to provide this function, some of them extremely simple and robust, and others somewhat more complex, but more sensitive to small pressure changes.|$|E

50|$|Resistive work of {{breathing}} {{is the sum}} of all the restrictions to flow due to bends, corrugations, changes of flow direction, valve <b>cracking</b> <b>pressures,</b> flow through scrubber media, etc., and the resistance to flow of the gas, due to inertia and viscosity, which are influenced by density, which is a function of molecular weight and pressure. Rebreather design can limit the mechanical aspects of flow resistance, particularly by the design of the scrubber, counterlungs and breathing hoses. Diving rebreathers are influenced by the variations of work {{of breathing}} due to gas mixture choice and depth.

40|$|Abstract In this study, scaled model {{tests were}} {{performed}} to investigate the stability of twin tunnels constructed in anisotropic rocks with 30 Â° inclined bedding planes under the condition of lateral pressure ratio, 2.

The models with shallower pillar width showed shear failure of pillar according to the existing bedding planes and they were <b>cracked</b> under lower <b>pressure</b> than the models with thicker pillar width. In order to find the effect of tunnel sectional shape on stability, the models with four centered arch section, circular section and semi-circular arch section were experimented.

25|$|Some early twin hose {{regulators}} were of single-stage design. The {{first stage}} functions {{in a way}} similar to {{the second stage of}} two-stage demand valves, but would be connected directly to the cylinder valve and reduced high pressure air from the cylinder directly to ambient pressure on demand. This could be done by using a longer lever and larger diameter diaphragm to control the valve movement, but there was a tendency for <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure,</b> and thus work of breathing, to vary as the cylinder pressure dropped.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that all the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver some of it less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the interstage pressure decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, in at least one regulator design, once the interstage pressure has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the residual gas to escape until the cylinder pressure has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E

2500|$|The {{demand valve}} adds a little {{respiratory}} dead space to the airway, and there is added [...] due to hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the depth of the}} demand valve and the lungs, and due to <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow resistance in the demand valve. These factors make breathing from a demand valve more effort than normal breathing out of the water, and the additional work of breathing at depth due to increased density and viscosity of the compressed gas, make a slow deep breathing cycle more energy efficient and more effective at carbon dioxide elimination. The diver learns to breathe more slowly and deeply with practice, and this usually improves endurance on a given quantity of gas. Part of the skill is learning to relax under water, and part is to minimize effort by learning good buoyancy, trim, maneuvering and propulsion skills. The breathing rate should not be slowed down too much, or there is a risk of hypercapnia (carbon dioxide buildup).|$|E

2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the <b>cracking</b> <b>pressure.</b> This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E
