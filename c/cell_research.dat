5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem <b>cell</b> <b>research</b> during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem <b>cell</b> <b>research.</b> Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E
30|$|Nanotechnology brings new {{chance to}} stem <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development. Nanotechnology {{is the term}} used to cover the design, construction, and {{utilization}} of functional structures {{with at least one}} characteristic dimension measured in nanometers [19, 20]. Such materials and systems can be designed to exhibit novel and significantly improved physical, chemical, and biological properties, phenomena and processes {{as a result of the}} limited size of their constituent particles or molecules. The reason for such interesting and very useful behavior is that when characteristic structural features are intermediate in extent between isolated atoms and bulk macroscopic materials, i.e., in the range of about 0.1 – 100 nm, the objects may display physical attributes substantially different from those displayed by either atoms or bulk materials. It is well-known that the nanomaterials own four basic unique effects such as small size effects, surface effects, quantum size effects, and tunnel effects, and ultimately these effects can lead to new technological opportunities as well as new challenges [21 – 23]. The application of nanomaterials and nanotechnology in stem <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development exhibits attracting technological prospects, which provide a new chance to solve current problems that stem <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development meet.|$|R

He was the first Democrat to declare his candidacy, doing so on July 30, 2002, during a rally with Hispanic leaders. His Senate committee preferences included education, transportation, and foreign relations. He also criticized the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, but supported gay marriage, abortion rights, stem <b>cell</b> <b>research,</b> the death penalty, and universal healthcare. Chico was the only candidate who supported gay marriage out of all seven Democrats and eight Republicans. Then-State Senator Barack Obama ultimately won the nomination over six other candidates including Chico.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto).

Bush, serving as the Science Advisor to the President. His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to stem <b>cell</b> <b>research</b> and global warming. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E
