40|$|The use of {{alternative}} raw materials like <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> in animal feed to reduce final costs {{could be of}} interest as the sector seeks to increase its competitiveness. The aims of the present work were to evaluate the effect of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> on back-fat thickness and the proximate composition of pork and to examine the effect on pork quality of using growing-finishing feeds with different percentages of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> added. For this purpose 60 crossbreed (Large White × Landrace) barrows were subdivided into three groups according to the <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> concentration administered in feed: C, control diet, no crude glycerine; and G 2. 5 and G 5 with 2. 5 % and 5 % added <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine,</b> respectively. This study evaluated proximate composition, pH, cooking losses, texture, colour coordinates, fatty acid profile, and sensorial analysis. No {{differences were found in}} any of the three groups studied (C, G 2. 5, G 5) for measurements performed both before (with ultrasound equipment) and after slaughter (millimetre ruler). The proximate composition and the physical-chemical parameters of longissimus dorsi were similar between groups. There were no differences detected (p> 0. 05) between the three groups as regards the CIELab coordinates, textural profile and sensory attributes. Therefore, 5 % <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> to replace corn could be used as an ingredient in pig feed without appreciably affecting the back-fat and meat quality characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to determine the nutritional value and to evaluate performance of piglets fed two types of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CG), which were made from vegetable oil (CGS) and a mix of animal fat + % soybean oil (CGA). In experiment I, a digestibility assay was conducted using 32 crossbred piglets (19. 20 ± 1. 52 kg). The experimental unit consisted of one pig, {{with a total of}} four experimental units per diet. The glycerine levels used in the digestibility assay were 4, 8, and 12 % of the basal diet (corn + soybean based). The digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) values of glycerine were estimated by regression of DE and ME intake (kcal/kg) vs. glycerine intake (kg). The values (as-fed basis) of DE and ME (kcal/kg) obtained were: CGS = 5, 070 and 4, 556; CGA = 5, 143 and 4, 488, respectively. The results indicate that these two types of glycerine are a highly-available energy source for the feeding of piglets (15 - 30 kg). In experiment II, 90 piglets (BW = 15. 18 ± 0. 67 to 30. 28 ± 1. 68 kg), were allotted in a completely randomized design in 2 × 4 factorial arrangement, with of two types of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CGS and CGA) and four inclusion levels (3, 6, 9, and 12 %). Five experimental units (pens with two pigs) were used for each level of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine,</b> resulting in five replicates per treatment in the diet. Additionally, a control diet containing no glycerine (0 %) was formulated. There was no interaction between levels of CG and types of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine,</b> and the regression analysis indicates no effects of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> inclusion on performance and plasma variables. The results suggest that it is feasible to use up to 12 % of both tyes of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (obtained from soybean oil and mixed) in the diet for piglets without impairing performance, in addition to promoting a reduction of about 11 % in the cost with feeding...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the dry matter digestibility, gross energy (GE), the nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), and the nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy (TMEn) of two <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> from two different sources. The first <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CG 1) was from a large scale biodiesel producer with high content of glycerol (89. 49 %) and low content of crude fat (1. 73 %), meanwhile the second <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CG 2) was from a medium scale biodiesel producer with lower content of glycerol than CG 1 (38. 36 %) and high content of crude fat (23. 63 %). Fed rooster assay based on Sibbald (1976) was used in the experiment. The experimental feed consisted of ground corn and three levels of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (0, 10, and 20 %). Twenty four Hisex brown roosters were housed in metabolic cages. Roosters were force fed with 30 g experimental feed, after 24 hours of fasting. Excreta collection was performed for two days while the roosters were fasting again. The content values of GE, AMEn, and TMEn of CG 1 were 4065. 18, 2926. 59, and 3068. 73 kcal kg- 1 and for CG 2 were 5928. 09, 4010. 11, and 4054. 52 kcal kg, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the {{antiviral}} activity of a <b>crude</b> hot <b>glycerine</b> extract of Aloe vera gel which was grown in Bushehr (Southwest of Iran) against HSV- 2 replication in Vero cell line. The extract showed antiviral activity against HSV- 2 not only before attachment and entry of virus to the Vero cells but also on post attachment stages of virus replication. The IC 50 before attachment and entry of virus to the cells is 428 μg/ml and the CC 50 value which is the cytotoxicity of the extract for Vero cells is 3238 μg/ml, while the calculated selectivity index (SI) is 7. 56. Also, IC 50 of extract on post attachment stages of replication is 536 μg/ml and the SI value for inhibition of the post attachment stages of HSV- 2 replication is 6. 04. Therefore, compounds of Aloe vera from Bushehr {{could be a good}} candidate as a natural source for antiviral drug development against HSV- 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} was to evaluate the performance, quality and fatty acid profile of eggs from laying hens fed with diets containing <b>Crude</b> Vegetable <b>Glycerine</b> (CVG) originating from biodiesel production. Two hundred and forty 35 -week-old Hy-Line W 36 laying hens were used. The experiment lasted 112 days, split into 4 28 -day cycles. The birds were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design to six treatments with CVG inclusion of 0, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0 and 7. 5 %, with 5 replicates and 8 birds per experimental unit. With increased CVG inclusion, the egg-laying percentage linearly increased (P< 0. 05). The percentage of linoleic and behenic acid, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) and omega- 6 fatty acids in eggs from laying hens fed with CVG increased as the levels of inclusion (P< 0. 05). According {{to the results of}} the present study, CVG can be included in the diet of laying hens up to the level of 7. 5 % of inclusion, considering the improvement in performance and lipid profile of the eggs...|$|R
40|$|Sulphur {{concrete}} is {{a strong}} but brittle material. Concrete with a higher sulphur binder content is weaker but more flexible than concrete with a smaller content of binder. Sulphur concrete has unique properties, such as rapid strength development, high ultimate strength, low per-meability and superior esistance to strong acids and saline solutions. It has {{a wide range of}} potential engineering applications, particularly in situations where problems are encountered in the use of portland cement concrete. Sometimes, ulphur concrete shows poor durability, which may result from expansion and cracking on exposure to water, a behaviour that has been found to result from the use of certain types of aggregates. Admixtures have been found which lead to significant improvements in the strength and durability characteristics of sulphur concretes. Sulphur concrete was made with seven types of rock as aggregate: granite, syenite, diorite, basalt, greywacke, quartzite and marble. Mixes were made with 20 % and 23 % of sulphur binder and with and without admixtures. Admixtures used were <b>crude</b> oil, <b>glycerine</b> and two types of silane surface active agents. When crude oil was included in the mix, strength decreased significantly but ductility increased. When the aggregate was pre-treated with glycerine the strength of the concrete was affected only slightly but flexibility increased. With silane type A treatment to the aggregate the sulphur concrete had good strength and greater strain capacity than the control mixes made with no admixture. When the aggregate was treated with silane type Z the concrete was very strong but brittle. Treatment of the aggregates with glycerine and the two varieties of silane improved the moisture durability of the sulphur concrete. A comparison of the static and dynamic moduli showed that the three types of sulphur concrete which were more ductile behave similarly to portland cement concrete in that the dynamic modulus was larger than the static modulus. In the stiff and brittle sulphur concretes, that relationship was reversed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the metabolic response of broilers fed diets containing increasing <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> levels in two bioassays. Birds were house in metabolic cages, and were distributed {{according to a}} completely randomized experimental design with five treatments of 4 replicates each (1 st assay: 5 birds/ cage; 2 nd assay: 1 - 20 days = 8 birds/ cage, and 21 - 42 days = 4 birds/cage). Treatments consisted of a control diet based on corn and soybean meal, and four other diets containing 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 7. 5 % and 10. 0 % glycerine derived from biodiesel. In experiment I, there was no effect (p> 0. 05) of glycerol level on liver weight or blood parameters. Serum blood glycerol levels of the birds fed 10 % <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> increased during the first nine days of diet intake (p 0. 05) among treatments when birds were 42 days old. High dietary glycerine levels may induce metabolic change in broilers, such as increased blood glycerol level, water intake and fecal moisture...|$|E
40|$|Glycerine is a {{by-product}} of the biodiesel industry. Owing to the exponential growth of biodiesel production worldwide and particularly in Europe, the glycerine market has been driven {{during the last few}} years by the oversupply being generated by the biodiesel industry. Prices of both refined and <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> have fallen to all-time lows. Consequently, there are clear signs that demand for glycerine is growing strongly with new usages both for crude and refined glycerine now to the fore. This article attempts to analyse to what extent a « substitution/new-usage breakthrough » for glycerine is occurring and will propose a supply/demand scenario for the coming 3 years. It will also attempt to predict how glycerine prices will develop over the same period...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{lightweight}} design, their {{electrical insulation}} properties and their high formability polymers {{are widely used}} in the electronics industry. Since {{the end of the}} nineties also biopolymers made of renewable resources expanded into the range of electronic. The driving force for this development is to reduce resource depletion and to use materials that have less environmental impact during their production, e. g. using less energy or causing less pollution. Polylactide acid (PLA) is the most widely employed biopolymer in electronics by now. In addition to its mechanical properties particularly the good availability on the market was the crucial factor for this development. The mechanical properties of polyhydroxy-butyrate (PHB) are partly better but the production capacity so far was too low to make inroads into the market. The cooperative research projects BioFun and BioPro identify the feasible fields of applications for PHB in electronic products and try to enlarge its capabilities via suitable modifications. To achieve a biopolymer with well-balanced environmental properties, the use of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> - a by-product from the local biodiesel production - is explored as feedstock for the fermentation of PHB...|$|E
40|$|Twelve ruminally {{cannulated}} steers (401. 0 ± 41. 5 kg) and 24 mo {{were used}} in a replicated arrangement truncated Latin Square with six animals in six treatments and four periods to evaluate the effect of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CG; 80. 3 % of glycerol) with starch or fiber-based energy ingredients in the concentrate on DMI, DM (DMD) and NDF digestibility (NDFD) and ruminal parameters. Experimental periods were 19 days (14 days for adaptation and 5 days to sampling). Diets were: CO - without CG and corn as ingredient of concentrate; CGC - inclusion of CG (10 % of DM) with corn in the concentrate; and CGSH - inclusion of CG (10 % of DM) with soybean hulls (SH) in the concentrate. All three diets were offered at low (LC) or high (HC) concentrate level, CL (40 or 60 %). Animals fed LC or HC diets had similar DMI, DMD and NDFD. Animals fed diets with CG associated with corn or SH had higher propionate concentrations and lower A:P ratio. Diets with HC increase the propionate but do not affect the NDFD. CG (10 % of DM) {{can be used to}} replace corn or SH in diets with 40 or 60 % of concentrate, without affect NDFD. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 70 Nellore bulls (18 ± 3 months of age) {{were used to}} {{determine}} the effects of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> (CG) replacing starch- v. fibre-based energy ingredients in low (LC; 0 · 40 concentrate) or high concentrate (HC; 0 · 60 concentrate) ? on a dry matter (DM) basis ? on DM intake (DMI), methane emissions and growth. Ten bulls were slaughtered (reference group) to obtain the carcass gain (CrG). The 60 remaining bulls (374 ± 24 · 5 kg) were allocated to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (two concentrate levels, LC or HC; and three feeding regimes, FR). The FR were: CO ? without CG and maize as an ingredient of concentrate; CGM ? inclusion of CG (0 · 10 of DM) replacing maize in the concentrate; and CGSH ? inclusion of CG (0 · 10 of DM) replacing soybean hulls (SH) in the concentrate. Bulls fed LC or HC had similar DMI (kg/d) and growth. The DMI and average daily gain (ADG) were similar among FR. Concentrate level and FR tended to interact for methane emissions (g) per kg DMI. Bulls fed CGM had a greater G : F (g CrG/kg DMI) than those fed CO or CGSH diets. Increasing dietary concentrate (0 · 40 ? 0 · 60) did not affect intake, methane emissions, or growth. Inclusion of CG in diets to replace SH in LC diets tended to decrease methane emissions from animals. When CG replaces SH in the diets, CrG and G:F (g CrG/kg DMI) are decreased compared with bulls fed CGM. 201...|$|E
40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} in {{supercritical}} {{water is a}} complex process. In supercritical water ideally the biomass structure and the larger molecules are broken down into smaller, gaseous components {{under the influence of}} radicals. However, the biomass is normally fed to the system at low temperature and, hence, should traverse a large temperature range before the supercritical conditions are met. During this warming-up (mostly ionic-) reactions may occur leading to the formation of intermediate compounds which are difficult to gasify, but lead to e. g. carbon formation that can cause blockage of process equipment. In case of uncatalyzed gasification the required temperatures are often above 650 °C and thus far above the supercritical temperature for water (374 °C). Together with the required high operating pressures (above 221 bar), this leads to high demands for the materials of construction and, hence, high costs. Reducing the operating temperature to below 600 °C is, next to maximizing gasification efficiency and minimizing carbon formation, an important target for catalyst development. In this thesis, attractive and relevant biomass feed streams have been used; like (<b>crude)</b> <b>glycerine,</b> a by-product from the biodiesel production, algae slurries and aqueous phases produced during the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass as well as the aqueous phase produced during upgrading (by hydrogenation) of the primary pyrolysis oil. Results for these raw materials are presented for both the uncatalyzed gasificaion as well as for gasification in the presence of existing (commercial-) and newly developed (in this project) catalysts. For the model compounds chosen, glycerol and ethylene glycol, significant progress is made in the area of catalyst development and deduction of the prevailing reaction mechanisms. Additionally, a more fundamental study into the effect of the molecular structure of n-alcohols and n-carboxylic acids on the gasification performance is performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{outcome of}} this Report {{suggests}} there is strong viability {{for the establishment of}} a 60, 000 tonne p. a. (raw material input) biodiesel plant. A plant of this size would provide an annual output (at full production levels) of 59. 7 m litres of biodiesel, 6. 12 m kilograms of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine,</b> and 1, 320 tonnes of fertiliser (potassium sulphate). This would result in a gross annual sales turnover of 47. 443 m, with the majority of this income derived from biodiesel fuel (43. 027 m), and to a lesser extent, glycerine (4. 284 m). The total capital requirement for the plant is 21. 307 m, of which 20. 0 m is the estimated cost of the building, plant, machinery and equipment and associated ancillaries. The land is assumed to be available to the Project at zero cost. The balance of 1. 307 m is required for working capital. The above capital requirement would be offset by a Federal Government Subsidy of 9. 552 m which is based on a grant of 0. 16 per litre biodiesel output. This is in line with a recent announcement by the Federal Government. Whilst this subsidy is not "make-or-brea" for the Project, it does nevertheless considerably mitigate financial risk and improves overall return ensuring the Project is very likely to succeed. However, with a rebate production quantity limitation applicable to the subsidy, it will be the initial renewable fuel producers whom are able to quickly establish themselves that will be able to take full advantage of this offer. The net amount of capital to be sourced by the Project’s proponents is therefore 11. 755 m. Without the government subsidy, the IRR reduces to 37. 66...|$|E
40|$|Thomas Overton Michael Van Amburgh Ynte SchukkenABSTRACT Holstein cows (n= 48) {{entering}} {{second or}} greater lactation were utilized {{to determine the}} effects of method of delivery of glycerol on performance and metabolism of dairy cows during the transition period. Beginning 21 d before expected parturition, cows were fed either a control diet or a diet containing glycerol (5 % of DM). After parturition, cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 (dietary glycerol; 3. 3 % of DM) X 2 (glycerol drench; 500 ml/d for 5 d beginning at parturition) factorial arrangement. From d 22 through 63 of lactation, cows were fed the same diet. Feeding glycerol during the prepartum period increased prepartum DMI, but feeding glycerol during the postpartum period tended to decrease postpartum DMI and drenching glycerol for the first 5 d of lactation decreased postpartum DMI. Milk yield was not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods or drenching glycerol during the first 5 d of lactation. Percentages and yields of milk fat and true protein were not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods; however, drenching glycerol tended to decrease milk protein content and decreased milk lactose content. Glycerol fed during the prepartum period resulted in no significant effects on plasma glucose, NEFA or BHBA concentrations during the prepartum period with no carry over effects on postpartum metabolites. Prepartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects in liver triglycerides or glycogen content in liver samples collected d 1 after calving compared with control cows with no carry over effects on postpartum liver triglycerides or glycogen content. Postpartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects on postpartum liver composition. Short term (5 -d) oral drenching of glycerol beginning at calving resulted in no significant effects on liver composition (d 10 and 21 postpartum) or on plasma glucose and NEFA. However, there was a trend for an increase in BHBA concentrations for cows drenched with glycerol. Intensive blood sampling performed on d 5 post calving demonstrated that a 500 ml oral bolus of <b>crude</b> <b>glycerine</b> significantly decreased plasma NEFA concentration with no overall significant effects on plasma glucose, BHBA, or insulin. Overall, incorporation of glycerol in to the diets of transition cows or the short-term oral drench of glycerol at calving resulted in few positive performance responses and only modest effects on metabolic variables studied.
