5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team gathered the same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos Piraeus). In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was in a tight three-way race with Omonia and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with no training.|$|E

[...] Pinsof acclaimed the city's scale and AI.|$|E

He wrote that Ivy was unlike other New York City bands {{in the way that they}} catered to [...] "unabashed pop melodies" [...] and later joked that the [...] "concept [...] so far out it's in"; Stowe also described their version of [...] "I Guess I'm Just a Little Too Sensitive" [...] as a [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "special treat".|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain {{returned}} to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, {{where he was}} met by the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Clarendon, who gave him a letter from King George VI assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain {{an hour and a}} half to journey the nine miles (14km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and Queen. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, [...] "Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'." [...] Chamberlain turned around and responded, [...] "No, I don't do that sort of thing."

500|$|Sylvester detects the {{influence}} of late works by Titian in other aspects, especially in the deep and rich colouring, and Velázquez's portrayals of Philip IV, such as Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga, and agrees with identification of pastels of Degas as a source. He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds {{to create the illusion}} of what Degas described as [...] "shuttering", as seen in the earlier artist's After the Bath, Woman drying herself. Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto. He believes the folds serve to [...] "push the viewer back", creating a distance from the subject, an effect he sees as similar to the separation between an orchestra and setting; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison. Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter. In his series of books [...] "Interviews with Francis Bacon", he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant. The artist replied, [...] "Well, it means that the sensation doesn't <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps." ...|$|E
500|$|With Gambier vacillating in Basque Roads, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Mulgrave interceded. Prime Minister Lord Portland's {{administration}} was {{concerned by the}} risk posed by the French fleet to the profits of the British colonies in the West Indies, and had determined that an attack must be made. Thus on 7 March ten fireships were ordered to be prepared. In considering who would be best suited to lead such an attack Mulgrave then made a highly controversial decision. On 11 March the frigate HMS Imperieuse anchored at Plymouth and a message instructed Captain Lord Cochrane to <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> to the Admiralty. Cochrane, eldest son of the Earl of Dundonald, was an aggressive and outspoken officer who had gained notoriety in 1801 when he captured the 32-gun Spanish privateer frigate Gamo with the 14-gun brig HMS Speedy. In the frigates [...] and Imperieuse he had caused havoc on the French and Spanish coasts with relentless attacks on coastal shipping and defences including, most relevantly, operations in the Rochefort area. He was also a highly active politician, elected as a Member of Parliament for Westminster in 1807 as a Radical, he advocated parliamentary reform and was a fierce critic of Portland's administration.|$|E

[...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|E

2500|$|Evidence {{from the}} 1920s {{supports}} {{the theory that}} at least one of the companies made a feint attack southeast from Nye-Cartwright Ridge straight down the center of the [...] "V" [...] formed by the intersection at the crossing of Medicine Tail Coulee on the right and Calhoun Coulee on the left. The intent may have been to relieve pressure on Reno's detachment (according to the Crow scout Curley, possibly viewed by both Mitch Bouyer and Custer) by withdrawing the skirmish line into the timber on the edge of the Little Bighorn River. Had the U.S. troops <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> down Medicine Tail Coulee, their approach to the Minneconjou Crossing and the northern area of the village would have been masked by the high ridges running on the northwest side of the Little Bighorn River.|$|E

[...] Another Harrison biographer, Elliot Huntley, similarly approves of [...] "Beautiful Girl"'s [...] "enchanting melody" [...] and notes its transformation from the 1970 demo version into [...] "a masterpiece, complete with a thrilling conversational guitar solo", {{in which the two}} parts [...] "interweave and answer one another". Leng also recognises the song's Beatle qualities, writing: [...] "'Beautiful Girl' is full of guitar arpeggios and vocal harmonies that might have <b>come</b> <b>straight</b> from Rubber Soul, albeit updated with a 1970s production and the singer's own beguiling guitar statements...
