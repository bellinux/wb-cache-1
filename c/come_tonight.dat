The silver and {{valuables}} we took across before are all safe in Limerick. As for the other things, they can go. Now, mind, we shall not leave unless we have your promise that, if a band of these men <b>come</b> <b>tonight</b> to sack the place, you and your men will offer no resistance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Raymond: Good evening, {{friends of}} the Inner Sanctum. This is Raymond, your host. I'm glad you <b>came</b> <b>tonight,</b> {{because we have a}} very special guest of horror with us. I'd like you to meet the late Johnny Gravestone, the most celebrated member of the Inner Sanctum Ghost Society. He's the best haunter of them all. Johnny's the tall figure in the white sheet wearing the blue ribbon. He's haunted {{everything}} from a palace to a telephone booth. And uh, if you're very nice to him, he'll be glad to consider giving your house the once-over. Who knows? He might even haunt you! Ha-ha-ha-ha! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should think, Mr. Ferguson, that {{it would}} be a good plan to send a party of twenty men on shore after nightfall and to {{distribute}} them, two Men to a hut. Possibly two or three of the Malays may come down to the village before morning, either to fetch valuables they may have left behind, or to see whether we are still here. They may <b>come</b> <b>tonight,</b> or they may come some time tomorrow, crawling through the plantations behind the houses. At any rate, I will wait here a day or two on the chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would <b>come</b> <b>tonight,</b> Anne," [...] said Miss Lavendar, running forward. [...] "And I'm doubly glad, for Charlotta the Fourth is away. Her mother is sick {{and she had to}} go home for the night. I should have been very lonely if you hadn't come [...] . even the dreams and the echoes wouldn't have been enough company. Oh, Anne, how pretty you are," [...] she added suddenly, looking up at the tall, slim girl with the soft rose-flush of walking on her face. [...] "How pretty and how young! It's so {{delightful}} to be seventeen, isn't it? I do envy you," [...] concluded Miss Lavendar candidly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{precisely}} as I have told you," [...] she replied. [...] "They will <b>come</b> <b>tonight</b> and kill {{you while you}} sleep. Find me pistols and a rifle and ammunition and we will pretend that {{we go into the}} jungle to hunt. That you have done often. Perhaps it will arouse suspicion that I accompany you but that we must chance. And be sure my dear Herr Lieutenant to bluster and curse and abuse your servants unless they note a change in your manner and realizing your fear know that you suspect their intention. If all goes well then we can go out into the jungle to hunt and we need not return.|$|E
6000|$|The ape-man {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "One must die sometime," [...] he said. [...] "To you doubtless {{it may seem}} terrible--such a death; but Tarzan of the Apes has always {{expected}} {{to go out in}} some such way. Few of us die of old age in the jungle, nor should I care to die thus. Some day Numa will get me, or Sheeta, or a black warrior. These or some of the others. What difference does it make which it is, or whether it <b>comes</b> <b>tonight</b> or next year or in ten years? After it is over it will be all the same." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I wasn't fit to <b>come</b> out <b>tonight,</b> but I couldn't help myself, I {{wanted the}} money. I wrote to Emil {{and told him}} I was broke, but he never even {{answered}} the letter." ...|$|R
60|$|Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts {{is doing}} the {{commercial}} part. Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked Colum's Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you'll be able to <b>come</b> <b>tonight.</b> Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic {{has yet to be}} written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've a blue silk {{to make up}} yet, but it's {{a little}} heavy for summer wear. I think I'll leave it until the fall. I'm going to teach in White Sands, you know. How do you like my hat? That one you had on in church {{yesterday}} was real dinky. But I like something brighter for myself. Did you notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs? They've both come determined to sit each other out. I don't care a single bit about either of them, you know. Herb Spencer is the one I like. Sometimes I really do think he's MR. RIGHT. At Christmas I thought the Spencervale schoolmaster was that. But I found out something about him that turned me against him. He nearly went insane when I turned him down. I wish those two boys hadn't <b>come</b> <b>tonight.</b> I {{wanted to have a}} nice good talk with you, Anne, and tell you such heaps of things. You and I were always good chums, weren't we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have another}} reason for suspecting it. I have kept a sharp watch on that high hill behind the village; they tell me there is nothing at the top except some curious stones, that {{look as if they}} had once been trees, so there is nothing they can want to go up for. Several times today I have made out the figures of men {{climbing}} that hill. When they got to the top they stood for some time as if they were looking out over the sea, and then came down again without doing anything. Now, men do not climb such a hill as that merely for exercise. They went up because they expected to see something, and that something could only be a fleet of pirate boats from the other islands. I would give a year's pay if we could get out of this place this evening, but it cannot be done, and we must wait till tomorrow morning. I will try then, even though I risk being driven on the rocks. However, if they do <b>come</b> <b>tonight</b> they will not catch us asleep." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to row over to Chapel Point for salt. They think the boats will <b>come</b> in <b>tonight</b> loaded with mackerel--look at them away out there by the score--and salt will be needed." ...|$|R
60|$|Synge {{has promised}} me {{an article for}} Dana too. Are {{we going to be}} read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants {{something}} in Irish. I hope you will <b>come</b> round <b>tonight.</b> Bring Starkey.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{the storm}} is about to burst," [...] Cneius said thoughtfully when he had read it. [...] "I thought so. I was sure that if the Britons had a spark of manhood left in them they would avenge the cruel wrongs of their queen. I am rejoiced to read Beric's words, and {{to see that he}} has, as I felt sure he had, a {{grateful}} heart. He would save us from the fate that he clearly thinks is about to overwhelm this place. The omens have not lied then--not that I believe in them; they are {{for the most part the}} offspring of men's fancy, but at any rate they will come true this time. I care little for myself, but I must do as he bids me for the sake of the girl. I doubt, though whether Beric can save her. These people have terrible wrongs to avenge, and at their first outburst will spare none. Well, I must do my best, and late as it is I will go out and purchase these garments. It is not likely that the danger will <b>come</b> <b>tonight,</b> for he would have given us longer notice. Still he may have had no opportunity, and may not have known until the last moment when the attack was to take place. He says 'lose no time.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, 'tis a true {{saying about}} an ill-wind, for {{it will be}} all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye, that he will. Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer. Lord! how he'll chuckle over this news! I hope he will <b>come</b> <b>tonight.</b> It will be all to one a better match for your sister. Two {{thousand}} a year without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only {{a quarter of a mile}} from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. Oh! 'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!" ...|$|E

It would never permit me to inflict on others the terrible wrong that Professor Maxon has inflicted on me--yet he never doubts his own possession of a soul. It would not allow me to revel in the coarse brutalities of von Horn--and I am sure that von Horn thinks he has a soul.
