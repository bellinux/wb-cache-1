40|$|After {{years of}} intense protection, the South African {{automobile}} industry has undergone major policy reforms. This paper investigates {{the impact of}} policy reforms on the welfare of consumers, producers and society as a whole. The results of the simulation analysis indicate that, following the removal of domestic content requirements and reduction in tariffs, there has been significant reduction in consumer welfare loss and societal deadweight loss in the automobile industry, while tariff revenue to the South African government has significantly decreased. The results demonstrate that further reduction in tariffs on <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>units</b> and <b>completely</b> knocked-down units is {{likely to result in}} further reduction in efficiency loss, thus leading to an improvement in the performance of South Africa’s automobile industry...|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{vehicles}} were first imported into Malaysia in August 1956, {{with the first}} <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> (CBU) <b>unit</b> being a Land Cruiser. Toyota signed distributor agreements with various Malaysian partners prior to UMW Toyota Motor, namely Car Motor (September 1960-February 1974), Emastorin Motor (September 1979-April 1984) and Sarin Motor (January 1979-February 1983). Additionally, several companies had also been appointed as importers and assemblers of Toyota's completely knocked-down (CKD) kits, with the most prominent CKD assembler being Champion Motor (CM). Other CKD assemblers include Borneo Motors (September 1967- September 1982) and Sarawak Motor Industries (SMI).|$|R

50|$|In Indonesia, the Timor, {{derived from}} the South Korean Mazda 323-based Kia Sephia, proved very controversial. The fact that the Timor was not {{assembled}} in Indonesia, rather, it was imported <b>completely</b> <b>built-up,</b> stirred up annoyance among car companies, especially Toyota, which were producing many vehicles in the country.|$|R
50|$|Covering {{less than}} half a square {{kilometre}} the Altstadt is the smallest district of Frankfurt. The area is <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> with the only open spaces being accounted for by the Main and the river bank, the streets, squares and backyards. The construction descends predominantly from the reconstruction phase of the post war era, aside from which there are numerous historical buildings partly reconstructed after their destruction in the war.|$|R

The suburb retains areas of natural bushland and is not <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> with housing, although there are plans to increase housing with expansion on the Crystal Brook housing estate. Maida Vale {{is home to a}} rare flower named the Maida Vale Bell.|$|R
50|$|Until 1900 Rijswijk {{remained}} a relative small community {{but it became}} urbanized during the 20th century when it expanded rapidly. Today, Rijswijk's area has almost been <b>completely</b> <b>built-up.</b> The last major development is the new Ypenburg neighbourhood, built on the lands of the former Ypenburg Airfield but this part of Rijswijk was annexed by The Hague in 2002. Rijswijk {{is part of the}} Haaglanden conurbation. During the years its built-up area has grown {{to the point where it}} has effectively merged with The Hague, even though it is still a separate municipality.|$|R
50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a <b>built-up</b> custom <b>unit,</b> designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. <b>Built-up</b> <b>units</b> are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a <b>built-up</b> <b>unit</b> to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1971, the {{government}} (along with private organizations representing the automotive industry) began {{an effort to}} increase the localization effort {{as a result of}} an ever increasing trade deficit. Many new parts manufacturers and assemblers had sprouted, but a proliferation of models and versions hindered economies of scale. As a reaction, the Thai government increased tariffs on <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> (CBU) vehicles and began a graduated increase in the local parts content regulations (up to 25 percent in 1975). A moratorium on new assemblers was also implemented, as were limits on the number of models offered. As manufacturers quickly began circumventing the model limits, these rules were abandoned before they could have any real effect.|$|R
40|$|UAVs are {{becoming}} standard platforms for applications aiming at photogrammetric data capture. Since these {{systems can be}} <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> at very reasonable prices, their use can be very cost effective. This is especially true while aiming at large scale aerial mapping of areas at limited extent. Within the paper the capability of UAV-based data collection will be evaluated. These investigations {{will be based on}} flights performed at a photogrammetric test site which was already flown during extensive tests of digital photogrammetric camera systems. Thus, a comparison to conventional aerial survey with state-of-the-art digital airborne camera systems is feasible. Due to this reason the efficiency and quality of generating standard mapping products like DSM and ortho images from UAV flights in photogrammetric block configuration will be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Relative {{rejection}} of the Telstar forced Ford to import <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> (CBU) premium models built in Genk, Belgium from 1990: the Sierra 2.0 GLX Wagon, the Sierra Sapphire 2.0 Ghia and the XR4×4 were part of this range. The advertising copy read, [...] "Introducing the new car that needs no introduction." [...] However, a relatively high price did not help [...] - [...] the Wagon began at over NZ$31,000 [...] - [...] and production errors in the launch brochure showed cars with no steering wheels. Furthermore, any marketing boosts Ford could have gained through Group A touring car racing were over with the Escort Cosworth becoming the company's standard-bearer in competition (and the Escort, meanwhile, was absent from the New Zealand market).|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the western}} part {{of what used to be}} Jacques-Cartier is {{primarily}} low-income, highly populated, retail-oriented and <b>completely</b> <b>built-up.</b> The architecture in this area can be defined as a mishmash and non-uniform, as buildings were usually constructed when the property owners had enough money to build them. The eastern part, on the other hand, tends to be the opposite. It is by far less densely populated than its western counterpart and contains the industrial section of Longueuil. Recently built designer mansions and condominiums are plentiful (notably in the Collectivité-Nouvelle and Parcours du Cerf neighbourhoods), and the area is becoming increasing built up. The far northeast known as the Fatima neighbourhood (which borders the city of Boucherville) is similar to {{the western part}}, with many bungalows and apartment buildings dating from Jacques-Cartier.|$|R

40|$|UAVs are {{becoming}} standard platforms for applications aiming at photogrammetric data capture. Since these {{systems can be}} <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> at very reasonable prices, their use can be very cost effective. This is especially true while aiming at large scale aerial mapping of areas at limited extent. In principle, the photogrammetric evaluation of UAV-based imagery is feasible by of-the-shelf commercial software products. Thus, standard steps like aerial triangulation, the generation of Digital Surface Models and ortho image computation can be performed effectively. However, this processing pipeline can be hindered due to the limited quality of UAV data. This is especially true if low-cost sensor components are applied. To overcome potential problems in AAT, UAV imagery is frequently captured at considerable overlaps. As it {{will be discussed in}} the paper, such highly overlapping image blocks are not only beneficial during georeferencing, but are especially advantageous while aiming at a dense and accurate image based 3 D surface reconstruction...|$|R

5000|$|After the tube, jacket, and hoops {{have been}} {{machined}} to appropriate dimensions, the jacket is carefully heated to approximately 400 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a vertical air furnace so thermal expansion allows the cool tube {{to be lowered}} into place. When the jacket is in position, it is cooled to form a tensioned shrink fit over the tube. Then the next hoop (either B2 or C1) is similarly heated so the assembled A tube and B1 jacket can be lowered into position for a successive shrink fit. The assembled unit may be machined prior to fitting a new hoop. The process continues as remaining tubes are heated sequentially and cooled onto the <b>built-up</b> <b>unit</b> until all elements have been assembled. [...] When tensioned wire winding is used {{in place of a}} hoop course, the wire is typically covered by an outer tensioned cylinder also called a jacket.|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands Centre for Research and Contract Standardization in Civil and Traffic Engineering (CROW) {{publication}} 116, the 'Guidebook for categorising roads on a 'sustainably safe' basis', {{the first}} functional {{demand for a}} 'sustainably safe' road network is called: 'Achieving as large as possible connecting residential areas'.

Ultimately, the following criteria {{were used for the}} choice of area size: journey length, traffic volumes, choice of route, car speeds, and accessibility. Attention is also paid to the relationship between the size of a residential area and the ease of crossing over the distributors.

40|$|Italy {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with the highest number of historical and monumental buildings. At the same time is a country of moderate/high seismic risk. Many of the Italian historical and monumental buildings are large masonry structures dating back to centuries ago, that can be highly vulnerable to earthquakes. One interesting approach for improving their seismic performance consists in seismic base isolation. This modern technique explicates its beneficial effects by adding a controlled source of damping and moving away the structure from the most energetic band of frequency of the soil motion. Dealing with base isolation of monumental buildings implies consideration for several peculiar, multidisciplinary, aspects. These are related to the age of these buildings, {{to the fact that they}} might have become part of larger <b>built-up</b> <b>units,</b> or they might have been built over previous buildings the remains of which can be themselves of interest for the cultural heritage. The aim of this work is first related to an evaluation of the main issues related to base isolation of large historical buildings. Subsequently, a tentative base isolation application is presented with reference to a prototypal case study, to better assess the practicality of base isolation when large historic buildings are concerned...|$|R
5000|$|The Timor itself proved controversial, because {{unlike the}} Proton Saga, {{it was not}} {{assembled}} in Indonesia when first released. Instead, it was imported <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> from South Korea, to the annoyance of companies like Toyota, which had undergone considerable expenses to produce vehicles in Indonesia. The Timor, in return for promising future exports and 60 percent local content within three years of starting production in Indonesia, avoided the taxes and duties that added 60 percent {{to the price of}} other imported cars. This cozy deal led to accusations of nepotism and cronyism, as the project was the brainchild of Hutomo [...] "Tommy" [...] Mandala Putra, the youngest son of the then President Suharto. A welter of complaints followed, particularly from the Japanese automakers who controlled 90% of the Indonesian automobile market at the time. The threat of a WTO lawsuit followed. 45,000 cars a year were planned, but with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 came the collapse of Kia. Combined with the May 1998 demise of the Suharto regime, the Timor project was abandoned. By early 1998, 15,000 out of the nearly 40,000 Kias imported were still sitting unsold in Jakarta—only 2,493 units were sold in 1998 as people wanted to distance themselves from the hated Suharto regime. During the May 1998 riots in Java, Timor owners would remove the [...] "T" [...] logos in the hope {{that they would not be}} targeted by protesters.|$|R
40|$|The {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in the Philippines is regulated and protected by the provisions of development programs for cars, commercial vehicles, and motorcycles. Each program virtually prohibits the import of <b>completely</b> <b>built-up</b> vehicles, specifies minimum local content requirements for vehicles assembled in the country from imported completely knocked-down kits, and requires that firms assembling kits export to earn foreign exchange {{to cover the cost}} of the kits. Similar protective regimes have existed in a number of countries, especially in Latin America. The author develops a model to illustrate the economic impact and welfare cost of import prohibitions, local content requirements, and export requirements. She applies that model to Philippine data. Her results indicate that the protective regime in the Philippines imposes substantial costs on consumers and encourages the allocation of resources to relatively high-cost activities. Eliminating all of the restrictions overnight may lead to adjustment problems, but gradual liberalization could limit these problems. The proportion of domestic content required, the percentage of compensatory exports required for kits, and the tariff rates on kits could be lowered in stages, according to a preannounced schedule, to allow gradual adjustment. The prohibition on imports of assembled vehicles could be replaced by a tariff and phased out gradually. To avoid proportionately more protection of the assembly industry, the tariff on finished autos could be phased out more quickly than the other tariffs, to avoid sending false signals to the domestic industry about the direction of adjustment. To avoid increasing the effective rate of protection on assembly operations during liberalization, elimination of the domestic content and compensatory export requirements should be accompanied by decreases in the tariff rates on assembled vehicles.

40|$|The modular hybrid linear {{stepper motor}} in {{discussion}} has improved performances {{due to its}} novel construction. This linear motor {{can be one of}} the best choices for industrial applications where fast and accurate linear motions under heavy loads are required. In this paper a coupled simulation program of this motor will be presented. The basic part of the model is built up in SIMULINK. The forces of the motor are not computed at each time step. They are taken from two look-up tables containing the static characteristics of the forces, computed using MagNet 6. 0 FEM-based magnetic field analysis program. The power converter's model was made in SIMPLORER, a widely used simulation program in the field of power electronics. The converter units were coupled into SIMULINK by the Sim 2 Sim link. This way all the parts of the model were implemented in the most suitable platform for each of them. The obtained results are in good accordance with the theoretical expectations and with the results of analytical computations. This means that the overall performances of the simulation program are quite good. Therefore the idea of coupling <b>units</b> <b>built-up</b> in different simulation platforms into a single simulation program could be also applied for simulating other types of electrical machines...|$|R
40|$|For {{buildings}} to operate effectively and save energy {{they must be}} commissioned properly and operational problems must be detected and diagnosed. Collection of sensor and control data is essential to this process. Likewise, the analysis of this data with effective tools is critical to performing this work in a cost effective manner. In general, the buildings industry lacks consistent methodologies or protocols that make this process of {{data collection and analysis}} effective and efficient; the practitioner usually develops his own techniques on a more or less ad hoc basis. Also lacking is a consistent way to accumulate data over time from many projects that could be helpful to the analysis of a particular system. To help remedy this situation (and to serve as an example of this concept) the Center for Environmental Design Research (CEDR) at UC Berkeley developed diagnostic protocols and a software "toolkit" (UCB AHU Toolkit) to help practitioners identify and rectify problems with large <b>built-up</b> air handling <b>units</b> (AHU). [Carter 1998, Webster 1998, 1999]. These tools and protocols rely on short term monitoring and a set of supporting spreadsheet based tools to screen for problems in AHUs and to conduct more in-depth diagnostic studies for problems found. The work described herein is an extension of the previous work and comprises Task 2. 2. 1 of Project 2. 2 of the High performance Commercial Buildings Systems (HPCBS) project.
