25|$|Quarries {{that produce}} {{dimension}} stone or <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> (used as construction aggregate) are interconvertible. Since most quarries can produce either one, a <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> quarry {{can be converted}} to dimension stone production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed. Dimension stone is separated by more precise and delicate techniques, such as diamond wire saws, diamond belt saws, burners (jet-piercers), or light and selective blasting with Primacord, a weak explosive.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates some {{contentious}} {{issues in}} women’s liberation struggles in Nigeria as recreated in Ezeigbo’s play, Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone.</b> The particularities of gender are neglected in the anti-colonial struggle for Nigerian independence, and women’s issues are subsumed within the nationalist literatures of cultural regeneration. With {{the influence of}} feminism, many Nigerian women embark on the identification of women’s personhood by controverting the representations of Nigerian women in male-centered works. African theatre, in particular, is very skeptical about the feminist ideology aimed at changing {{the status of women}} in society. Similarly, many people are suspicious of women’s liberation struggle and its consequent effect on the society. Hence feminism in Nigeria is rent with many contentious issues. Taking Marxist and feminist perspectives in the analysis of Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone,</b> the researcher explores some of the major issues in the character’s revolutionary gender-cum-class struggle for a pay rise. The proposition is that Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone</b> embodies most of the concerns in women’s struggle for survival in contemporary Nigeria...|$|R

In contrast to the Iron Tower, however, the Wood Tower is much more slenderly proportioned, which is typical of the 'verticality' of the Gothic style.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of fly ash content on {{unconfined}} compressive strength, cleavage strength and resilient modulus of cement-fly ash stabilized <b>crushed</b> <b>stones.</b> The relationships between mechanical parameters were also studied. The results show that with fly ash content increasing, the unconfined compressive strength and cleavage strength were increasing firstly but decreased then, and the resilient modulus were decreasing. The brittleness index was increased by the increment of fly ash content. It can be concluded that the optimal fly ash content in cement-fly ash stabilized <b>crushed</b> <b>stones</b> is between 10 % and 15 %, and increment of fly ash content can improve its crack-resistance...|$|R

25|$|From Birmingham's {{early days}} onward, the steel {{industry}} has always {{played a crucial role}} in the local economy. Though {{the steel industry}} no longer has the same prominence it once held in Birmingham, steel production and processing continue to play a key role in the economy. Steel products manufacturers American Cast Iron Pipe Company (ACIPCO) and McWane are based in the city. Several of the nation's largest steelmakers, including CMC Steel, U.S. Steel, and Nucor, also have a major presence in Birmingham. In recent years, local steel companies have announced about $100million worth of investment in expansions and new plants in and around the city. Vulcan Materials Company, a major provider of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> sand, and gravel used in construction, is also based in Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Swatara State Park is {{a fairly}} new park for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It was opened in 1987 and is still largely undeveloped. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is working on plans to further develop the lands of Swatara State Park. The {{original}} plans called for {{the building of a}} dam and reservoir for recreational fishing and boating as well as to provide drinking water for the City of Lebanon. The PADCNR explored plans for developing the park without the recreational lake/reservoir, and in 2012 started developing the park with infrastructure improvements to increase access to the biking, hiking, canoeing, fishing and picnicking opportunities in the park. Improvements include installing 10 miles of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> along the rail-trail and work on abandoned Old State Road.|$|E

A series of direct shear tests were conducted to investigate the friction behaviors of interfaces between composite geomembrane and two different permeable cushion materials (<b>crushed</b> <b>stones</b> and polyurethane mixed <b>crushed</b> <b>stones).</b> The shear stress-displacement relationships of the two interfaces show different characteristics and were described by the nonlinear-elastic model and nonlinear-elastic perfectly plastic model, respectively.

In addition, a nearby hillside {{appears to have been a}} sacred grove: numerous settings of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and fire sites were found all over it, and evenly distributed on, under, and around them, large amounts of burned and crushed bone, burned and crushed clay fragments, and resin drops, and smaller numbers of beads and blades such as knives and arrowheads.

25|$|This {{resulted}} in an uproar among local politicians, who in unison stated that cars were not a suitable means of transport, particularly for freight. They further stated that the investments would have been wasted and that the state would have to compensate the area with additional infrastructure, such as a NOK400,000 upgrade to the road between Gartland and Høylandet and NOK300,000 to Nes Bridge. Parliament intervenes and passed legislation pm 19 May 1928 for construction to continue. However, this involved a reduction of the line's standard. The most drastic reduction was {{a reduction in the}} rail profile from 35 to 25 kilograms per meter (70 to 50lb/yd) and the choice of used track. In addition, the line was equipped with ballast of gravel rather than <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> Both contributed in giving a lower axle load, resulting in only lighter locomotives being able to use the line and reducing train sizes.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E
