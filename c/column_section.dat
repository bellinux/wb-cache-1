50|$|When {{a column}} {{is too long}} to be built or transported in one piece, {{it has to be}} {{extended}} or spliced at the construction site. A reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower <b>column</b> <b>section.</b> A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{details on}} the Tay Bridge were considerably simpler, lighter, and cheaper than on the earlier viaducts. On these the machined base of each <b>column</b> <b>section</b> docked securely into a machined enlarged section {{of the top of}} the section below.

This 'spigot and faucet' configuration was used (apparently without machining) on some Tay Bridge pier columns, but on some the bolts were relied upon to ensure correct alignment. (In the event, the joints were made using undersized bolts. [...] This gave greater tolerances when assembling the column, but the less positive alignment of the column joints as initially assembled and after any subsequent 'working' of the joint would have weakened the column).|$|E

Diagonal bracing was by flat bars running from one lug at a <b>column</b> <b>section</b> top to two sling plates bolted to a lug {{at the base of the}} equivalent section on an adjacent column. The bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them. The tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping, and then a gib was driven through all three slots and secured. Two [...] "cotters" [...] (metal wedges) were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study is to predict the moment resistance and initial stiffness of FEP and EEP connections on cruciform <b>column</b> <b>section.</b> A series of FEP and EEP connections are tested in laboratory. The connection tests consist of four FEP and four EEP specimens with different configuration. Component method outlined in the publication of Steel Construction Institute and British Constructional Steelwork Association are based on BS 5950 and Eurocode 3 (EC 3) are used to predict the moment resistance and initial stiffness of the tested specimens. The experimental results are then used to validate the analytical predictions. As compare to the experimental results, all moment resistance of the connections coincide well with analytical predictions. Analytical prediction for initial stiffness using EC 3 does not show good agreement with the experimental results. This study shows that the component method can be used to predict the moment resistance of FEP and EEP connections on cruciform <b>column</b> <b>section.</b> Further study need to be carried out for initial stiffness to obtain accurate analytical representation...|$|E

Variable number of trays and variable feed tray location make optimization possible. This collocation model builds on the concepts of past collocation models for design of complex real-world separation systems. Two variable transformations make this method unique. Polynomials cannot accurately fit trajectories which flatten out. In columns, flat sections occur {{in the middle of}} large column sections, or where concentrations go to zero or one. With an exponential transformation of the tray number which maps zero to an infinite number of trays onto the range zero to one, two collocation trays can accurately simulate a large <b>column</b> <b>section.</b> With a hyperbolic tangent transformation of the mole fractions, the model can simulate columns which reach high purities.

40|$|High {{strength}} concrete (HSC) provides several advantages over normal {{strength concrete}} (NSC) {{and is being}} used in multi-story buildings for reducing {{the dimensions of the}} <b>columns</b> <b>sections</b> and increasing the net marketable area. However, upgrading of concrete strength class in a building may affect the fire performance, due to higher rates of strength loss with temperature and higher susceptibility to spalling of HSC compared with NSC. Reduction of <b>columns</b> <b>sections</b> also leads to increased member slenderness and faster temperature increase in the section core. These detrimental effects are well known, but their impact on fire performance of structures has not been established in terms of comparative advantage between NSC and HSC. In other words, {{it is not clear whether}} the consideration of fire resistance limits the opportunities for use of HSC for reducing the dimensions of <b>columns</b> <b>sections</b> in multi-story buildings. This research aims to address this question by comparing the fire behaviour of reinforced concrete columns made of NSC and HSC using nonlinear finite element modelling. The evolution of load bearing capacity of the columns is established as a function of the fire exposure duration. A 15 -story car park structure is adopted as a case study with alternative designs for the columns based on strength classes ranging from C 30 to C 90. Results show that, although the replacement of NSC by HSC accelerates the reduction rate of columns capacity under fire, the columns generally have significant reserves in resistance leading to sufficient fire resistance. This study gives an insight into the impact of replacing stocky sections in NSC by more slender sections in HSC on fire resistance rating for multi-story structures. Peer reviewe...|$|R

M. spicatum supported higher invertebrate biomass per unit of plant weight than S. lacustris whereas T. natans was somewhat intermediate. Depth did not affect invertebrate biomass significatively. Surface sections of M. spicatum and T. natans supported invertebrate communities with similar taxonomic composition dominated by oligochaetes and ostracods. Large hirudineans and gastropods characterized the communities on the water <b>column</b> <b>sections</b> of M. spicatum.

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} {{methods for}} analyzing reinforced concrete column sections strengthened with concrete jacket. First, {{the prediction of}} the axial load versus moment interaction curve is presented based on a lamellar analysis and a simplified method of analysis. The predicted results are compared with experimental results of jacketed columns. Second, the prediction of the moment versus curvature behaviour of a retrofitted <b>column</b> <b>section</b> under an axial load, is presented based on both the methods of analysis. Finally, the lateral load versus displacement behaviour of a beamâˆ’columnâˆ’joint sub-assemblage with retrofitted columns, is predicted using an incremental non-linear analysis. The predicted behaviours are compared with experimental results. It is concluded that the lamellar analysis provides good prediction of the strength, {{as well as the}} moment versus curvature behaviour of a retrofitted <b>column</b> <b>section.</b> The simplified analysis gives a conservative value of the strength. It cannot predict the ductility in the behaviour reasonably well.
