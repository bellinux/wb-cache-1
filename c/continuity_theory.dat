Disengagement theory, activity theory and <b>continuity</b> <b>theory</b> are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E

50|$|After the {{rejection}} of the <b>continuity</b> <b>theories,</b> the recent linguistic arguments have placed the Proto-Uralic homeland around the Kama River, or more generally close to the Great Volga Bend and the Ural Mountains. The expansion of Proto-Uralic has been dated to about 2000 BC (4000 years ago), whereas its earlier stages go back at least one or two millennia further. Either way, this is considerably later than the earlier views of the <b>continuity</b> <b>theories,</b> which would place Proto-Uralic deep into Europe.|$|R
25|$|Two {{theories}} {{account for}} {{the origin of the}} Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman <b>continuity</b> <b>theory,</b> posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the Roman Province of Dacia, while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of Illyria, Moesia, Thrace, and Macedon, and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the Danube into the area which they inhabit today.|$|E
25|$|Gyula László, a Hungarian archaeologist, {{suggests}} that late Avars, arriving to the qaganate in A.D 670 in great numbers, {{lived through the}} time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791–795 {{and the arrival of}} the Magyars in 895. László points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) did not replace but complement those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pastoring. He also notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40–50 graves on average, the Avars contain 600–1000. According to these findings the Avars not just survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of Árpád. He also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian-basin, but Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, one only finds Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language, rather Finno-Ugric, and so they must have been assimilated by the Avars that outnumbered them and the genetics of today's modern Hungarians is no different than that of neighboring West Slavs as well as western Ukrainians. László's Avar-Hungarian <b>continuity</b> <b>theory</b> also states that Hungarians speak Avar, though this has been disproved as Hungarian belongs to the Finnic-Ugric branch of languages.|$|E
2500|$|Roman incursions under Emperor Trajan between 101–102 AD and 105–106 AD {{resulted}} in {{half of the}} Dacian kingdom becoming a province of the Roman Empire called [...] "Dacia Felix". The Roman rule lasted for 165 years. During this period the province was fully integrated into the Roman Empire, and a sizeable {{part of the population}} were newcomers from other provinces. The Roman colonists introduced the Latin language. According to followers of the <b>continuity</b> <b>theory,</b> the intense Romanization gave birth to the Proto-Romanian language. The province was rich in ore deposits (especially gold and silver in places like Alburnus Maior). Roman troops pulled out of Dacia around 271 AD. The territory was later invaded by various migrating peoples.|$|E

2500|$|Followers of the <b>continuity</b> <b>theory</b> {{argue that}} the Romanians descended from the {{inhabitants}} of [...] "Dacia Traiana", the one-time province encompassing some regions of present-day Romania for around 165 years. In these scholars' view, the close contacts between the autochthonous Dacians and the Roman colonists {{led to the formation}} of the Romanian people because many provincials stayed behind after the Roman Empire abandoned its territories north of the Danube. Thereafter the process of Romanization expanded to Maramureş, Moldavia and other neighboring regions due to the free movement of people across the former imperial borders. The spread of Christianity also contributed to the process, since Latin was the language of liturgy among the Daco-Romans. Although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the lands now forming Romania, a sedentary Romance-speaking population survived. These lands remained the main [...] "center of Romanization" [...] after the Slavs began to assimilate the Latin-speaking population of the Balkans in the 6th century.|$|E

While there is broad support both scientifically and philosophically for the contention that our being Persons is {{at least in part}} contingent on the proper development and functioning of our brains, the lack of consensus as to {{the manner in which the}} brain and mind relate to engender a Person has made the question of personal identity particularly intractable. One theory, called Emergence, posits the mind is engendered by, but not reducible to, the actions of the brain. In this thesis, the consequences for our conception of personal identity are explored given an Emergentist conception of the mind/body relationship.

This study {{explored}} service providers??? {{perceptions of}} resilience, {{social support and}} social isolation among older adults {{in the context of}} disengagement and <b>continuity</b> <b>theories.</b> Thirty voluntary service providers working with older adults and selected through non probability criterion sampling responded to survey that measured service providers??? perceptions of older adult???s level of depression, social support, social isolation and their ability to ???bounce back??? despite adversity. Quantitative data analysis found moderate association (Cramer???s V =. 317) between professional categories and their perceptions of older adult???s ability to demonstrate high levels of resilience. An important finding of the study is that 87 % of the service providers reported the older adults they work with as experiencing depression ranging from medium to high levels. Recommendations of the study include targeted programs to reduce isolation and loneliness among older adults, specifically those who are in vulnerable conditions. Researchers also recommend the importance of planning for the demographic shift that is likely to exponentially increase the demand for services for older adults. Specifically, preventative measures in the practice and policy fields of social work with older adults are required. Social Wor...|$|R
