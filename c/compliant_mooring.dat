40|$|The Energy Systems Research Unit {{within the}} Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde has {{developed}} a novel contra-rotating tidal turbine (CoRMaT). A series of tank and sea tests {{have led to the}} development and deployment of a small stand-alone next generation tidal turbine. Novel aspects of this turbine include its single point <b>compliant</b> <b>mooring</b> system, direct drive open to sea permanent magnet generator, and two contra-rotating sets of rotor blades. The sea testing of the turbine off the west coast of Scotland in the Sound of Islay is described; the resulting stability of a single-point tethered device and power quality from the direct drive generator is reported and evaluated. It is noted that reasonably good moored turbine stability within a real tidal stream can be achieved with careful design; however even quite small instabilities {{have an effect on the}} output electrical power quality. Finally, the power take-off and delivery options for a 250 kW production prototype are described and assessed...|$|E
40|$|Anchor drag during {{operation}} of offshore structures could significantly alter the initial load design {{characteristics of a}} mooring system. Hence an estimation of anchor positions {{during operation}} is essential to identify whether slow or abrupt anchor motion occurs and might require the redeployment of an anchor. During storm conditions, monitoring of mooring tensions and structure motions at the South West Mooring Test Facility (SWMTF) revealed the slow drift motion of one anchor. This facility is a surface buoy with a three-legged, <b>compliant</b> <b>mooring</b> system designed to investigate mooring system behaviour for Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) devices. This paper presents i) some methods to identify the deployment anchor positions: numerical model, acoustics diver survey, and towed sonar ii) the analyses procedure, and estimations of slow drift anchor motion. The findings indicate that one drag embedment anchor moved slowly during a moderate but prolonged and isolated storm, before embedding again. The work demonstrates that anchor position can be accurately monitored and that anchor motion is not necessarily due to excessive peak loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} wave energy mooring systems is challenging: overdesign incurs a {{significant}} cost penalty, underdesign {{may lead to}} a premature failure and incorrect design could reduce the power production. Consequently, <b>compliant</b> <b>mooring</b> systems are being developed for wave energy applications. This paper presents tank test results for a scale model of the buoy and mooring used at the SouthWest Mooring Test Facility (SWMTF), an offshore facility developed to conduct long-term sea trials for wave energy device moorings. A compliant three leg catenary mooring system using Nylon ropes in the water column is investigated. Preliminary static, quasi-static, decay, regular and irregular wave tests were conducted on the 1 : 5 scale model, using the Ifremer basin in Brest. A corresponding numerical model was developed with a time-domain mooring modelling tool, inputting hydrodynamic data from a radiation/diffraction potential modelling program. After the calibration of several hydrodynamic parameters, the numerical model demonstrated good agreement with the experiment. However, numerical results show large differences with the field test results, mainly because of unknowns in the anchor position. The methods and procedures presented will allow the effective validation of numerical models to enable the development of appropriate mooring systems in wave energy applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{influences}} of wave directionality on a generic point absorber. The work presented here, shows how the dynamic of axisymmetric wave energy converter can be affected when one consider a realistic wave spectrum. For this purpose a non linear numerical model was used. The fluid structure interactions are modelled {{by means of a}} bending method where the Froude-Krylov forces are non linear and the radiation-diffraction problem is solved by using a linear method. Mooring loads are modelled via a finite element method. A <b>compliant</b> catenary <b>mooring</b> system composed by 4 mooring lines is hence used. Different models of sea spectra are used to approximate a real sea spectrum. The differences between them are discussed and comparisons on the body motions are commented...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{interest}} {{in the development of}} floating vertical axis wind turbines (FVAWTs) has been increasing, since FVAWTs might prove {{to be one of the}} optimal configurations in deep waters. In this study, a FVAWT with a 5 MW Darrieus rotor was used as the reference wind turbine and was mounted on three different floating support structures: the OC 3 spar buoy, the OC 4 semi-submersible, and a tension leg platform (TLP). Fully coupled nonlinear time domain simulations using the code SIMO-RIFLEX-DMS were conducted. A series of load cases with turbulent wind and irregular waves was carried out to investigate the dynamic responses of these three FVAWT concepts by estimating the generator power production, the platform motions, the tower base bending moments, and the mooring line loads. For the spar, semi-submersible, and TLP FVAWT concepts, twice-per-revolution (2 P) effects resulting from the 2 P aerodynamic loads are prominent in the dynamic responses of these concepts. Because of the <b>compliant</b> catenary <b>mooring</b> systems, the spar and the semi-submersible can help to mitigate the 2 P effects on structural loads and mooring line tensions as compared to the TLP concept, at the cost of larger platform motions. The TLP is not a good substructure for a vertical axis wind turbine unless the cyclic variation of aerodynamic loads is significantly reduced. Author preprin...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{extraction}} of mineral resources from deep ocean waters {{has been made}} possible by the development of large <b>compliant</b> offshore structures. <b>Mooring</b> cables are crucial components in these offshore facilities and form the basis of this study. The aims of this thesis are: to provide a comprehensive review on all aspects of cables, to determine criteria for numerical modelling, and to ascertain the capabilities of the finite element method for cable analyses using the F. E. package ABAQUS. Difficulties associated with large sag cables arise {{as a result of their}} inherent flexibility which causes ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrices. Furthermore, the cable winding configuration causes a nonlinear stress-strain relationship, it's sagged geometry results in nonlinear strain-displacement relations, and the immersion in water leads to nonlinear fluid loadings arising from Morison's Equation as well as uncertainties in the fluid parameters. Various models, starting with the developed. Convergence difficulties basic catenary, have been at start-up, caused by a lack of stiffness in the transverse direction, are avoided by supporting the cable when applying loads. It is further established that numerical analyses of flexible structures are most stable in dynamic analyses and when under tension. In general both displacement based isoparametric and hybrid beam elements were found to be more reliable and applicable than truss elements. Cable whip, ocean floor contact and harmonic motions of cables were analysed. Finally a cable/tower interaction was modelled and subjected to a Stokes's wave. Conclusions and guidelines are presented based on the numerical experiments carried out in this study...|$|R

The marine renewable energy (MRE) sector is now at a stage in its development whereby floating devices are adding new challenges to the moorings industries. Floating MRE devices are smaller than, for instance offshore platforms, and are usually targeted for deployment in highly energetic environments. The extreme conditions and the highly dynamic response of an MRE device present challenges in terms of peak loading within the mooring system itself and load transfer to the floating body. <b>Compliant</b> <b>mooring</b> systems provide advantages by reducing the peak loads and fibre ropes are an important asset in achieving such compliance. However, {{the extent to which}} existing fibre ropes can safely extend axially to provide compliance is insufficient and is strongly associated to the minimum breaking load (MBL) of the rope. A novel fibre rope mooring tether is presented here that provides advantages over existing ropes. The tether employs a hollow fibre rope containing an elastomeric core, this mechanism de-coupling the extension properties from the strength of the line. The load path is carried through the polyester rope which is terminated conventionally by eye splices, thus minimising any new risks to reliability. Very low axial stiffness is achieved and is shown to be selectable within limits. For comparison, the prototype tether’s MBL of 222 kN is assigned to polyester and Nylon reference ropes. The axial stiifness of these ropes are 590 kN and 463 kN respectively when measured by a secant between the origin and 30...|$|E
40|$|Highly dynamic {{floating}} bodies such as {{wave energy}} convertors require mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring tensions within acceptable limits.

This work introduces the ‘Exeter Tether’, a novel fibre rope mooring tether providing advantages over conventional fibre ropes.

A benefit of reduced axial stiffness is the reduction of mooring system stiffness providing a reduction of peak and fatigue loads, without increasing mooring system complexity.

40|$|Mooring {{systems are}} among the most {{critical}} sub-systems for floating marine energy converters (MEC). In particular, the occurrence of peak mooring loads on MEC mooring systems must be carefully evaluated in order to ensure a robust and efficient mooring design. This understanding can be gained through long-term field test measurement campaigns, providing mooring and environmental data {{for a wide range of}} conditions. This paper draws on mooring tensions and environmental conditions that have been recorded (1) for several months during the demonstration of an MEC device and (2) over a period of 18 months at a mooring test facility. Both systems were installed in a shallow water depth (45 m and 30 m, respectively) using <b>compliant</b> multi-leg catenary <b>mooring</b> systems. A methodology has been developed to detect peak mooring loads and to relate them to the associated sea states for further investigation. Results indicate that peak mooring loads did not occur for the sea states on the external contour line of the measured sea states, but for the sea states inside the scatter diagram. This result is attributed to the short-term variability associated with the maximum mooring load for the given sea state parameters. During the identified sea states, MEC devices may not be in survival mode, and thus, the power take-off (PTO) and ancillary systems may be prone to damage. In addition, repeated high peak loads will significantly contribute to mooring line fatigue. Consequently, considering sea states inside the scatter diagram during the MEC mooring design potentially yields a more cost-effective mooring system. As such, the presented methodology contributes to the continuous development of specific MEC mooring systems...|$|R

40|$|Floating wind {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to produce low-carbon electricity on a large scale: it allows the expansion of o shore wind harvesting to deep water, indicatively from 50 - 60 to a few hundred metres depth, where most of the worldwide technical resource is found. New design specifi cations are being developed for floating wind in order to meet diverse criteria such as conversion effi ciency, maintainability, buoyancy stability, and structural reliability. The last is the focus of this work. The mechanics of floating wind turbines in wind and waves are investigated with an array of numerical means. They demand the simulation of multiple processes such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, rotor and structural dynamics; understanding their interaction is essential for engineering design, verifi cation, and concept evaluation. The project is organised in three main parts, presented below. Aero-hydro-mechanical simulation, characterising the rigid-body motions of a floating wind turbine. An investigation of multi-physical couplings is carried out, mainly through EDF R&D's time-domain simulator CALHYPSO. Wave forces are represented with the potential- ow panel method and the Morison equation. Aerodynamic forces are represented by a thrust model or with the blade element momentum theory. Main fi ndings: Exposure of fi nite-angle coupling for semi-submersible turbines with focus on heave plate excursion; characterisation of the aerodynamic damping of pitch motion provided by an operating vertical-axis turbine. Dynamic mooring simulation, focussed on highly <b>compliant</b> <b>mooring</b> systems, where the fluid-structure interaction and mechanical inertial forces can govern line tension. EDF R&D's general-purpose, finite-element solver Code Aster is confi gured for this use exploiting its nonlinear large-displacement and contact mechanics functionalities. Main findings: Demonstration of a Code Aster-based work ow for the analysis of catenary mooring systems; explanation of the dynamic mooring eff ects previously observed in the DeepCwind basin test campaign. Aeroelastic analysis of vertical-axis rotors, aimed at verifying novel large-scale floating wind turbine concepts in operation, when aeroelastic-rotordynamic instabilities may occur. The finite-element modal approach is used to qualify rotor vibrations and to estimate the associated damping, based on the spinning beam formulation and a linearised aerodynamic operator. Main fi ndings: Characterisation of the vibration modes of two novel vertical-axis rotor concepts using the Campbell diagram; estimation of the related aerodynamic damping, providing information on the aeroelastic stability of these designs...|$|E
