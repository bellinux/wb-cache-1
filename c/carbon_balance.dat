25|$|The UN {{report also}} {{concluded}} that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes {{of food in}} 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest— and in 2001 consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses. As of 2006 the livestock industry accounted for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia. Livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which {{is involved in the}} production of acid rain. A 2017 study published in the journal <b>Carbon</b> <b>Balance</b> and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.|$|E

Cellulase production experiments were conducted in 7 -L fermentors using Trichoderma reesei grown on pure cellulose (Solka-floc), glucose, or lactose. All input and output carbon-containing streams were measured and carbon dioxide in the exhaust gaswas quantified usingamass spectrometer. On Solka-floc, <b>carbon</b> mass <b>balances</b> ranged from 90 to 100 % closure for the first 48 h but increased to 101 to 135 % closure from 72 h {{to the end of the}} cultivation at 168 h. <b>Carbon</b> mass <b>balance</b> closures for soluble sugar substrates ranged from 92 to 127 % over the entire course of the cultivations.

Many of the <b>carbon</b> mass <b>balance</b> results did not bracket 100 % closure within the 95 % CIs.

During the 1980s it became increasingly clear that the terrestrial biosphere played an important part in terms of the global atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>balance.</b> It became apparent that the conversion of land, most notably deforestation in the tropics, caused large terrestrial carbon losses into the atmosphere forcing other carbon sinks to compensate.|$|E

50|$|The {{zero carbon}} {{emissions}} are {{planned to be}} achieved by the combination of integrated gasification combined cycle and carbon capture and storage, {{as well as the}} supplement of up to 10% biomass in the combustion process. The generated CO2 will be utilized by depositing it underground in the deep layers of porous rock of the Jurassic and Triassic period, located at the depth of over one kilometer, and by chemical sequestration of CO2 in methanol, urea and other chemical products. As a result, the total reduction of CO2 emissions will amount to nearly three million tons annually (92%).

50|$|Alaska has {{a climate}} {{that of the}} boreal zone, more {{commonly}} known as the Taiga. The boreal zone, across the globe, makes up more than 25% of global forests, and when wildfires occur it is a top leader in carbon emissions. Approximately 12% of the world's carbon is stored in top layer soil and this part is the first to burn in any wildfire. These emissions have some of the greatest impacts on natural <b>carbon</b> <b>balance,</b> and Alaska gives its fair contribution. Typically Alaskan forest fires make up 41% of the United States total carbon emissions, but more recently with warming conditions and more wildfire occurrences these figures have gone all the way to 89%. Landscape is also changing with regards to wildfires as less canopy is provided after an occurrence, hence soil temperatures may rise and be inhabitable by certain species. When soil temperatures rise permafrost is revealed and begins to melt away. This then leads to Landslides and Erosion.|$|E

A simple model for estimating the distribution of substrate consumed between the fermentative and the respiratory pathways in the oxido-reductive process was developed based on the respiratory quotient (RQ) values. The fraction of substrate consumed for respiratory metabolic activities (qsresp/qs) was virtually 1. 0 for the first three phases of the feeding strategy, which accounted for the first sixteen hours of the 24 h operation.
