40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{activity}} of lipase in fermented Africa locust bean, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed,</b> and Africa oil bean was determined. The peak lipase activity for fermented Africa locust bean, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed,</b> and African oil bean were 13. 3 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec, 7. 2 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec and 10. 6 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec at day 5, 4 and 4 respectively. The optimum temperature and pH were 300 C and 7. 0 respectively {{for all the}} fermented seeds above. Increasing NaCl concentration decreases the {{activity of}} Lipase indicating that NaCl is an inhibitor of lipase. The effect of substrate concentration on lipase activity in the fermenting oil seeds shows the normal Michaelis-Menten curve. The Km for African locust bean is 0. 065664 mM, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed</b> is 0. 067625 mM, and African oil bean is 0. 075848 mM.

40|$|Some seeds rely on fleshy lipid-rich {{appendages}} as attractants to ants. By carrying those {{seeds to}} their nest, ants {{play a major}} role as seed dispersers and can provide suitable conditions for seed germination. Ricinus communis (the commonly known <b>castor)</b> <b>seeds</b> are primarily dispersed by autochory but probably present secondary dispersal by ants, once they bear a lipid-rich elaiosome. The following questions were addressed: (1) are ants legitimate dispersers of castor seeds?; (2) which ant species interact with the seeds?; and (3) is germination success higher in a predicted scenario met by seeds discarded from ant nest? We compared the removal of seeds with and without elaiosome and we determined which ant species interact with <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> and whether there was seed predation by ants. We performed experiments under controlled conditions to evaluate seed germination responses to light, temperature and elaiosome. Seeds with elaiosome were removed preferentially and no predation was found, indicating that ants are legitimate seed dispersers.

Addition of glutamine led to a 7 % increase of labeling in lipids and an inverse decrease of labeling in carbohydrates.

30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17].
