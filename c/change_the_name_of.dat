5|$|The section {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by Canadian writers, who have analyzed both its intention and its meaning.

5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the National Airport Station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E

Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy {{and that the only}} reason that he is on the show is because of Jack.

5|$|Stephen Morris {{has said}} that even without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were. The members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C., {{following}} {{a meeting at the}} home of Bartley Wilson in Cardiff, as a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club together and in shape during the winter months. Their first season saw them playing friendlies against local sides at their Sophia Gardens ground, but in 1900 they joined the Cardiff & District League for their first competitive season. In 1905, Cardiff was granted city status by King Edward VII, and as a result the club put in a request to the South Wales and Monmouthshire Football Association to change their name to Cardiff City, but the request was turned down as they were deemed to be not playing at a high enough level. To combat this they arranged to join the South Wales Amateur League in 1907 and the following year they were granted permission to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the club to Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that is what the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E
