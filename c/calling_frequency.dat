30|$|Here, we {{conclude}} that both the Sundaic and Indochinese forms are recognized and supported by morphological and genetic data, but share similar <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> in provinces {{to the north of}} the Isthmus of Kra. The Sundaic form of R. a. superans occurs from Ratchaburi province to the south; while the Indochinese form of R. a. macrurus occurs from Tak, Chaiyaphum and Surin to the north. Variation observed in <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> within the Indochinese subregion was partially supported by morphological and genetic data. Though the high <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> (> 80 kHz) from central Vietnam was supported, lower <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> recorded from northern Vietnam and southern China were not. This was also the case with variations in <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> observed in peninsular Thailand.|$|R
30|$|The {{variation}} in echolocation <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> of R. affinis {{throughout the region}} resulted in the taxonomic status of this widespread species being re-examined (Kingsada et al. 2011). <b>Call</b> <b>frequency</b> {{has been found to}} be a useful tool for classification in bats, particularly among cryptic species (Thabah et al. 2006). Echolocation <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> of R. affinis in mainland Southeast Asia were comprehensively documented by Kingsada et al.

50|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study conducted}} by Puechmaille et. al. (2014) revealed that the peak <b>frequencies</b> of echolocation <b>calls</b> emitted by male and female Rhinolophus mehelyi accurately reflect their body size and condition. In the experiment, larger males proved to have higher <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> that attracted females twice as often as males with lower <b>call</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In contrast, males appeared to choose females at random. This distinction suggests that females choose males based on their <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> for the indirect benefits of having healthier and fitter offspring. The mating system is therefore comparable to a lek, making female mate choice a selection factor {{in the evolution of}} <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> in males that may counter other selection pressures imposed by their ecological niche.|$|R

30|$|The {{degree of}} {{morphological}} variation in R. affinis is {{highlighted by the}} morphology of the as yet undesignated form B from Nghe An province, northern Vietnam, and eastern Shan, Myanmar. No <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> or genetic data were available; however morphologically, this population had the smallest cranial and nose leaf morphology of all the material examined. Based on our findings relating to relationships between size and <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> this population possibly emits a <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> higher than 80 kHz. By comparison, this form agrees closely with individuals from Mussoorie, northern India, albeit smaller overall. This suggests that R. a. himalayanus (or its immediate descendants) may have spread southward to northern Vietnam. In Vietnam, specimens were captured in Nghe An province where R. a. macrurus (form C) was also found. In Myanmar, the specimen was from Shan where many R. a. macrurus were also captured. Based on sympatric speciation, two morphologically different populations with sympatric distributions are considered to represent distinct species. Based on current knowledge, we suspect the clade IIIc (Figure  7) represents form B. This is likely, because (1) this population has cranial and nose leaf characteristics which produce the highest <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> (2) in the north, the highest <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> populations are found in upper south China, and (3) clade IIIc comprises only sequences from the northern Vietnam and upper southern China where R. a. himalayanus was recorded. It would {{be of interest to}} assess <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and morphological data of specimens from Hoang Lien Son (extreme northern Vietnam) to compare with form B.|$|R

In Ranong, both high and low frequencies were recorded. However, the high frequencies recorded from north of the Isthmus of Kra (Ranong, Prachuap Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi) were not supported by morphology and genetic data as belonging to the Indochinese subregion but grouped with material from the Sundaic subregion. This highlights the general need for examination of morphological and genetic data in tandem with echolocation call data.|$|R

5000|$|The lesser {{white-lined bat}} feeds {{primarily}} on aerial insects {{in the order}} Hymenoptera. This includes flying ants and formicids. The bats forage in areas under tree canopies and use echolocation to hunt the flying insects. The bats don't change their <b>calling</b> <b>frequency</b> or their mouth size when using echolocation while hunting. When roosting, the bats usually form small groups anywhere from 2 to a 9. Additionally, the bats {{are thought to be}} monogamous which is rare for most mammals. [...] Females typically only produce one or two young per year. The young can't fly for about the first 12 days after birth. These young are taken care of by the female for up to 18 months.

40|$|This study investigates {{validity}} of self-reported mobile phone {{use in a}} subset of 75 993 adults from the COSMOS cohort study. Agreement between self-reported and operator-derived mobile <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration for a 3 -month period was assessed using Cohen's weighted Kappa (κ). Sensitivity and specificity of both self-reported high (≥ 10 calls/day or ≥ 4 h/week) and low (≤ 6 calls/week or < 30 min/week) mobile phone use were calculated, as compared to operator data. For users of one mobile phone, agreement was fair for <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> (κ= 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 35, 0. 36) and moderate for call duration (κ= 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 49, 0. 50). Self-reported low <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration demonstrated high sensitivity (87 % and 76 % respectively), but for high <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration sensitivity was lower (38 % and 56 % respectively), reflecting a tendency for greater underestimation than overestimation. Validity of self-reported mobile phone use was lower in women, younger age groups and those reporting symptoms during/shortly after using a mobile phone. This study highlights the ongoing value of using self-report data to measure mobile phone use. Furthermore, compared to continuous scale estimates used by previous studies, categorical response options used in COSMOS appear to improve validity considerably, most likely by preventing unrealistically high estimates from being reported...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the FCC {{intended}} for CB {{to be the}} [...] "poor man's business-band radio", and CB regulations were structured similarly to those regulating the business band radio service.

5000|$|Article XXI of the Service Regulations {{required}} that whenever an SOS distress call was heard, all transmissions {{unrelated to the}} emergency had to immediately cease until the emergency was declared over. There was a potential problem if a ship transmitted a distress call: The use of 500 kHz as a common frequency often led to heavy congestion, especially around major ports and shipping lanes, and it was possible the distress message would be {{drowned out by the}} bedlam of ongoing commercial traffic. To help address this problem, the Service Regulation's Article XXXII specified that: [...] "Coastal stations engaged in the transmission of long radiograms shall suspend the transmission {{at the end of each}} period of 15 minutes, and remain silent for a period of three minutes before resuming the transmission. Coastal and shipboard stations working under the conditions specified in Article XXXV, par. 2, shall suspend work at the end of each period of 15 minutes and listen in with a wave length of 600 meters during a period of three minutes before resuming the transmission." [...] During distress working all non-distress traffic was banned from 500 kHz and adjacent coast stations then monitored 512 kHz as an additional <b>calling</b> <b>frequency</b> for ordinary traffic.|$|E

Using anonymized data on mobility and calling behavior from 5. 1 million Grameenphone users in Barisal Division and Chittagong District, Bangladesh, we investigate the effect of Cyclone Mahasen, which struck Barisal and Chittagong in May 2013. We characterize spatiotemporal patterns and anomalies in <b>calling</b> <b>frequency,</b> mobile recharges, and population movements before, during and after the cyclone. While it was originally anticipated that the analysis might detect mass evacuations and displacement from coastal areas in the weeks following the storm, no evidence was found to suggest any permanent changes in population distributions. We detect anomalous patterns of mobility both around the time of early warning messages and the storm’s landfall, showing where and when mobility occurred as well as its characteristics. We find that anomalous patterns of mobility and <b>calling</b> <b>frequency</b> correlate with rainfall intensity (r =. 75, p < 0. 05) and use <b>calling</b> <b>frequency</b> to construct a spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone impact as the storm moves across the affected region.

40|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of {{echolocation}} <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> variation within rhinolophid bats is not well understood despite {{an increasing number of}} allopatric and sympatric examples being documented. A bimodal distribution of mean regional <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> within the Okinawa-jima Island population of Rhinolophus cornutus pumilus (Rhinolophidae) provided a unique opportunity to investigate geographic <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> variation early in its development. Individual resting echolocation frequencies, partial mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequences and genotypes from six microsatellite loci were obtained from 288 individuals in 11 colonies across {{the entire length of the}} island, and nearby Kume-jima Island. Acoustic differences (5 – 8 kHz) observed between the north and south regions have been maintained despite evidence of sufficient nuclear gene flow across the middle of the island. Significant subdivision of maternally inherited D-loop haplotypes suggested a limitation of movement of females between regions, but not within the regions, and was evidence of female philopatry. These results support a 'maternal transmission' hypothesis whereby the difference in the constant frequency (CF) component between the regions is maintained by mother–offspring transmission of CF, the restricted dispersal of females between regions and small effective population size. We suggest that the mean 5 – 8 kHz <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> difference between the regions might develop through random cultural drift. Yoshino Hajime, Armstrong Kyle N.
