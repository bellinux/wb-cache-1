50|$|Probably {{the largest}} {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} technologies aimed at actually implementing reversible computing is that they offer what is predicted to be the only potential way to improve the computational energy efficiency of computers beyond the fundamental von Neumann-Landauer limit of kT ln(2) energy dissipated per irreversible bit operation. Although the Landauer limit was millions of times below the energy consumption of computers in the 2000s and thousands of times less in the 2010s, proponents of reversible computing argue that this can be attributed largely to architectural overheads which effectively magnify the impact of Landauer's limit in practical circuit designs, so that it may prove difficult for practical technology to progress very far beyond current levels of energy efficiency if reversible <b>computing</b> <b>principles</b> are not used.|$|E

A precise analytical solution is challenging to obtain, thus making it hard to dissect with routine diagnostic systems. Since tried-and-true logical systems are extremely difficult to undertake, soft computing methodologies are deemed having potential for such applications.
