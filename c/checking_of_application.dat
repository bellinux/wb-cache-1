40|$|Many modern {{applications}} are built by combining independently developed packages {{and services that}} are distributed over many machines with complex inter-dependencies. The assembly, installation, and management of such applications is hard, and usually performed either manually or by writing customized scripts. We present Engage, a system for configuring, installing, and managing complex application stacks. Engage consists of three components: a domain-specific model to describe component metadata and intercomponent dependencies; a constraint-based algorithm that takes a partial installation specification and computes a full installation plan; and a runtime system that co-ordinates the deployment of the application across multiple machines and manages the deployed system. By explicitly modeling configuration metadata and intercomponent dependencies, Engage enables static <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> configurations and automated, constraint-driven, generation of installation plans across multiple machines. This reduces the tedious manual process of application configuration, installation, and management. We have implemented Engage and we have used it to successfully host a number of applications. We describe our experiences in using Engage to manage a generic platform that hosts Django applications in the cloud or on premises...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The secure {{usage of}} network nodes in smaller {{networks}} like company networks {{relies on the}} usage <b>of</b> uncompromised <b>applications.</b> There are many modern approaches to ensure the security- in particular the integrity- <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> but these solutions assume a secure operating system as base. As this assumption is very critical, there emerged other solutions to ensure a secure bootstrapping, but {{these do not include}} applications. Furthermore, most approaches used today just inform the user about a problem but are not able to repair a system automatically. We propose an approach which extends secure bootstrapping by integrity <b>checks</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> Our approach includes a recovery protocol in the case <b>of</b> compromised <b>applications.</b> The whole process will be secured by a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to ensure tamper resistance. ...|$|R

While such sharing can be tightly controlled with permissions, in general users cannot determine what applications will do with their data, and thereby cannot decide what permissions such applications should run with. In this paper we present SCANDROID, a tool for reasoning automatically about the security <b>of</b> Android <b>applications.</b> SCANDROID’s analysis is modular to allow incremental <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> as they are installed on an Android device. It extracts security specifications from manifests that accompany such applications, and checks whether data flows through those applications {{are consistent with those}} specifications.

The Bandera tool for Java programs is used to generate input for model checkers, although any similar tool could be employed. New verification aspects and superimpositions are defined to modularize the proofs, and separate the proof-related code from {{the program and the}} aspects.

40|$|Part 1 : Smart Cards System SecurityInternational audienceThe {{ability of}} Java Cards to {{withstand}} attacks {{is based on}} software and hardware countermeasures, and {{on the ability of}} the Java platform to check the correct behavior of Java code (by using byte code verification). Recently, the idea of combining logical attacks with a physical attack in order to bypass byte code verification has emerged. For instance, correct and legitimate Java Card applications can be dynamically modified on-card using a laser beam. Such applications become mutant applications, with a different control flow from the original expected behaviour. This internal change could lead to bypass controls and protections and thus offer illegal access to secret data and operations inside the chip.

In this context special emphasis should be given to urban areas. The prevailing systems of issuing preliminary land development clearance by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) which is based on a manual filing system consumes significant time and is unable to provide alternative solutions to prospective developers. Most of the countries use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for similar land management work. A study was carried out, selecting Thimbirigasyaya ward of Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to develop a GIS based land data management system in order to carry out the management of the land clearances in an efficient manner. Land parcel information obtained from CMC and UDA were scanned, spatial data were georeferenced and a mosaic was constructed. Input data were subjected to accuracy checks and were verified. Accuracies of data duplication, length, extent etc., were found satisfactory and adequate for UDA land clearance work. The database also incorporates the UDA conditions stipulated for location, zone and regulations enabling the <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> The developed land information system was designed to include all functional aspects in the previous systems and additional capability to provide alternative solutions.

40|$|Abstract. Besides key presses {{and text}} input, modern mobile devices support {{advanced}} interactions like taking pictures, gesturing, reading NFC-tags, {{as well as}} supporting physiological and environmental sensors. Implementing applica-tions that benefit of this variety of interactions is still difficult. Support for de-velopers and interaction designers remains basic and tools and frameworks are rare. This paper presents a prototyping environment that allows quickly and easily creating fully functional, high-fidelity prototypes deployable on the ac-tual devices. With this work, we target the gap between paper prototyping and integrated development environments. Additionally, new interaction techniques can be significantly faster or slower to use than conventional mobile user inter-faces. Hence {{it is essential to}} assess the impact of interface design decisions on interaction time. Additionally, the presented tool supports implicit and explicit user performance evaluations during all phases of prototyping. This approach builds on the original as well as extensions of the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) which allows estimating interaction times in early phases of the devel-opment with a simulated prototype. An underlying state graph structure enables automatic <b>checks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> logic.

40|$|Model checking, aka {{systematic}} {{exploration of}} the state space, is widely used {{as a method of}} verification of concurrent programs that may involve nondeterminism in their execution order. Especially, direct verification of implementations has been focused on in recent years. The crucial issues for such a model checker include how to explore state space systematically and how to control nondeterminism. Although existing model checkers can do this by running the target programs under a scheduler specialized for verification, this approach is subject to restrictions in its use of OS resources such as file systems. In this work, we propose and implement a framework for the model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> multi-process <b>applications</b> on an environment that is very close to the one for the actual execution.

SBUML provides not only a full-fledged execution environment but also the save-and-restore feature of the entire OS state including its file system. Nondeterminism of the target multi-process application is controlled via the breakpoint mechanism on GDB. Use of breakpoints also enables us to control the granularity of scheduling in a flexible way. We also give some verification examples using this framework. 1...|$|R
