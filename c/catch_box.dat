5000|$|TNT <b>catch</b> <b>box</b> ruins - The <b>catch</b> <b>box</b> ruins area {{consists}} of an earthen, brick-lined depression located immediately adjacent to the TNT-graining house in the former shell-loading area. This area was used to separate TNT particles from wastewater. Located near the dam at Penniman Lake.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{details of}} a microhydro plant are site-specific. Sometimes an {{existing}} mill-pond or other artificial reservoir is available and can be adapted for power production. In general, microhydro systems {{are made up of}} a number of components. The most important include the intake where water is diverted from the natural stream, river, or perhaps a waterfall. An intake structure such as a <b>catch</b> <b>box</b> is required to screen out floating debris and fish, using a screen or array of bars to keep out large objects. In temperate climates this structure must resist ice as well. The intake may have a gate to allow the system to be dewatered for inspection and maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{example of}} mixed martial arts was Bartitsu, which Edward William Barton-Wright founded in London in 1899. Combining <b>catch</b> wrestling, judo, <b>boxing,</b> savate, jujutsu and canne de combat (French stick fighting), Bartitsu {{was the first}} martial art known to have {{combined}} Asian and European fighting styles, and which saw MMA-style contests throughout England, pitting European Catch wrestlers and Japanese Judoka champions against representatives of various European wrestling styles.|$|R
2500|$|Box: A {{trapezoidal}} indentation in {{the ground}} with a metal or fiberglass covering {{at the end of the}} runway in which vaulters [...] "plant" [...] their pole. The back wall of the box is nearly vertical and is approximately [...] in depth. The bottom of the box gradually slopes upward approximately [...] until it is level with the runway. The covering in the box ensures the pole will slide to the back of the box without catching on anything. The covering's lip overlaps onto the runway and ensures a smooth transition from all-weather surface so a pole being planted does not <b>catch</b> on the <b>box.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The cartoon {{begins with}} Wile E. Coyote waiting at his mailbox. He {{looks up to}} see a U.S. Mail {{helicopter}} which drops a big box with a parachute attached to it. As Wile E. holds out his arms to <b>catch</b> the <b>box,</b> Road Runner runs by and taunts him long enough so that he forgets about the descending package which lands on top of his head. After some more taunting from Road Runner which causes his backside to be pricked by a cactus, Wile E. opens his package to reveal a chemistry set. Wile E. wastes no time as he pours red liquid back and forth between two beakers until it vanishes completely. He pours the invisible liquid into a bucket marked [...] "Invisible Paint" [...] paints himself invisible with it (he is outlined for the viewers to keep track of his presence). Wile E. gets into position to catch Road Runner near the side of a cliff, but the Road Runner runs into him and knocks him off. For good measure, the Road Runner paints a giant boulder and pushes it off the cliff; it lands on top of the unsuspecting Coyote.|$|R
2500|$|In Portal, GLaDOS {{tried to}} {{replicate}} the experiment with the scientists from Aperture Science, and she settled that the cat was dead. In the ending of its sequel, Portal 2, the Fact Sphere [...] might say [...] "The Schrödinger's cat paradox outlines {{a situation in which}} a cat in a box must be considered, for all intents and purposes, simultaneously alive and dead. Schrödinger created this paradox as a justification for killing cats." [...] In the publicity web-comic for the game, the fate of the protagonist Chell is a reference to Schrödinger's Cat. GLaDOS also mentions a [...] "bring your cat to work day" [...] and that she has the boxes and the neurotoxins (poison) and just needs the cats. There is also an achievement called Schrödinger's Catch, awarded when the player <b>catches</b> a blue <b>box</b> before it touches the ground, after it is broken out of a glass receptacle.|$|R
60|$|In the country, {{he cared}} for nothing but hunting and shooting--it was as {{difficult}} to make him go to a grand county dinner-party, as to make him go to church. In town, he haunted the theatres, behind the scenes as well as before; entertained actors and actresses at Richmond; ascended in balloons at Vauxhall; went about with detective policemen, seeing life among pickpockets and housebreakers; belonged to a whist club, a supper club, a <b>catch</b> club, a <b>boxing</b> club, a picnic club, an amateur theatrical club; and, in short, lived such a careless, convivial life, that my father, outraged {{in every one of}} his family prejudices and family refinements, almost ceased to speak to him, and saw him as rarely as possible. Occasionally, my sister's interference reconciled them again for a short time; her influence, gentle as it was, was always powerfully felt for good, but she could not change my brother's nature. Persuade and entreat as anxiously as she might, he was always sure to forfeit the paternal favour again, a few days after he had been restored to it.|$|R

40|$|Ayunan is {{the trap}} {{most widely used}} by public Sungai Batang Village, in {{addition}} to the unique shape of this tool also has an extensive capacity to accommodate good catches of shrimp and fish species. In addition to the village of Sungai Batang, at the Hulu Sungai region there is also the ayunan that looks different from contained in Sungai Batang Village. This study aims to (1) know the difference between shrimp of <b>catch</b> amor ayunan and <b>box</b> ayunan, and (2) to determine the catch other than shrimp. The results of research, treatment A (amor ayunan) shrimp catches as many as 1464, with a total weight of 9100 grams. Treatment B (<b>box</b> ayunan), shrimp <b>catches</b> as many as 1443, with a total weight of 7730 grams. Type of main haul shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii de Man) and Freshwater Shrimp (Palaemon sp), with by catches are  Lundu (Mystus gulio) with a total of 18 and total weight of 215 grams, sapu-sapu (Hypostomus plecostomus) 2, weighing a total of 560 grams, Puyau (Osteochilus hasselti) 3, weighing a total of 35 grams, telan (Macrognathus aculeatus) 2, weighing 810 grams. Bamboo and rattan as materials to make the ayunan has a weakness because odor (smell) is not good (bangai) and therefore contributes to the catch. To overcome this weakness it is advisable to replace the wire with the basic material...|$|R
40|$|Anchovies {{are a very}} labile {{fish and}} {{deteriorate}} fast under chilling conditions. In the South of Spain, fishing boats land their <b>catches</b> in wooden <b>boxes</b> with ice (12 to 14 kg). For some years now, fish processors have prepared this species for market distribution by placing about 7 kg fish in expanded polystyrene (EPS) boxes containing water and ice. Then, in the distribution market, boxes are dewatered and re-iced. Transportation of the fish in EPS boxes containing water and ice was recently forbidden {{on the grounds that}} boxes for transportation of fish in ice must have holes to let melted ice drain away. In this paper, the effect of preserving the anchovy in water and ice from landing to the distribution market was studied and compared with the more traditional methods of storing the fish in ice in either wooden or EPS boxes. Physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory analyses were carried out over three different storage trials to account for the effect of seasonality. Little differences were found among lots, but some of the parameters showed that fish transported in water and ice did present less spoilage than fish stored in ice, especially when compared to the wooden boxes. According to these results, chilling of this fish in water and ice can be used as an alternative preserving method during transport. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Squid {{attracting}} light systems {{consisting of}} low power {{light emitting diode}} panels (LEDs) and conventional metal halide lamps (MHs) were tested to describe the influence of combinations of LEDs and MHs on squid catch. Fishing trials using LEDs (9. kW) and different numbers of MHs were carried out in August and September 2009 targeting two squid species: (1) Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus in northern waters of the Sea of Japan (off Hokkaido) by 4 coastal squid jigging boats (19 gross tonnage) and (2) swordtip squid Photololigo edulis in western waters (off Iki) by 5 boats of the same class. Catches of both species tended to increase {{with the number of}} MHs. Generalized Linear Model analysis revealed that in addition to the number of MHs, the catch amount was influenced by fishing power (ability) of boat and by the monthly variation of squid abundance (only for P. edulis off Iki). The expected <b>catch</b> (number of <b>boxes)</b> was not proportional to the number of MHs. The largest catch was expected for P. edulis off Iki by using LEDs with 24 MHs. The optimal combination of LEDs and MHs for T. pacificus off Hokkaido was less clear because the combination with 36 MHs had the largest positive effect on the catch; this was the maximum number MHs used...|$|R
