40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} studied by applying methods of direct scaling to color appearances of stimuli perceived under different conditions of adaptation. This study differs from previous work {{in a number of}} ways. The color appearances of surface color stimuli were scaled by both magnitude estimation and magnitude production psychophysical methods. Changes in color appearances resulting from variations in correlated color temperature of adapting illumination, <b>luminance</b> <b>factors</b> of samples, illuininance, and surround induction conditions were scaled by a group of seven observers who had been trained to describe their perceptions in a uniform manner. This factorial approach to chromatic adaptation- influences on color appearance has yielded information about changes throughout a color solid rather than a single planar section of that solid. A distinction was made between absolute and relative attributes of color appearance. valuations of both internal and external consistency indicate that the data generated have relatively high precision and validity. The results indicate that chromatic adaptation induces smooth, continuous changes in color appearance. The nature of these changes depends upon correlated color temperature, <b>luminance</b> <b>factor,</b> and illuminance of surface color stimuli. Saturation, or colorfulness, is most susceptible to change and is highly dependent upon <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> and illuminance in addition to color temperature. These dependencies are systematic and explicit in the results presented here. Hue appearance of a given sample depends primarily upon color temperature of adapting illumination. Little or no change in hue was found for the range of variation in illuminance and <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> included in this study. In general, the hues of' all stimuli change with adaptation but there are important exceptions. The results do not support a linear model for the chromatic adaptation process...|$|R

Note that instead of the key bus, other video sources can be selected for the fill signal, but the key bus is usually the most convenient method for selecting a key fill. Usually, a key is turned on and off the same way a transition is. For this, the transition section can be switched from program mode to key mode.

40|$|The spatial {{filtering}} applied {{by the human}} visual system appears to be low-pass for chromatic stimuli and band-pass for luminance stimuli. Here we explore whether this observed difference in contrast sensitivity reflects a real difference in the components of <b>chrominance</b> and <b>luminance</b> in natural scenes. For this purpose a digital set of 29 hyper-spectral images of natural scenes has been acquired and its spatial frequency content analyzed in terms of <b>chrominance</b> and <b>luminance</b> defined according to existing models of the human cone responses and visual signal processing. The statistical 1 /f amplitude spatial frequency distribution is confirmed {{for a variety of}} chromatic conditions across the visible spectrum. Our analysis suggests that natural scenes are relatively rich in high spatial-frequency chrominance information which {{does not appear to be}} transmitted by the human visual system. This result is unlikely to have arisen from errors in the original measurements. Several reasons may combine to explain a failure to transmit high spatial-frequency chrominance: (a) its minor importance for primate visual tasks, (b) its removal by filtering applied to compensate for chromatic aberration of the eye's optics, or (c) a biological bottleneck blocking its transmission. In addition, we graphically compare the ratios of <b>luminance</b> to <b>chrominance</b> measured by our hyperspectral camera and those measured psychophysically over an equivalent spatial frequency range. ...|$|R
