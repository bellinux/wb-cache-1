50|$|The 384 BW {{accomplished}} a truly remarkable feat by being certified <b>combat</b> <b>ready</b> just {{nine months after}} receiving its first aircraft. Stringent SAC requirements called for a specified percentage of the crews to be certified {{in order for the}} wing to be considered <b>combat</b> <b>ready.</b> Since aircrew members were fresh out of student status, beginning to arrive about the same times the aircraft did, preparing the group to become fully <b>combat</b> <b>ready</b> was a tremendous task. The culture of the organization would accept nothing less than full effort, and when the newly formed wing was mission capable by September 1956, it became the first such SAC wing to do so in such a short time.|$|R
