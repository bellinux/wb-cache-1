50|$|Users may share access over {{a common}} network infrastructure. Since most users {{do not use}} their full <b>connection</b> <b>capacity</b> all of the time, this {{aggregation}} strategy (known as contended service) usually works well and users can burst to their full data rate at least for brief periods. However, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and high-quality streaming video can require high data-rates for extended periods, which violates these assumptions and can cause a service to become oversubscribed, resulting in congestion and poor performance. The TCP protocol includes flow-control mechanisms that automatically throttle back on the bandwidth being used during periods of network congestion. This is fair {{in the sense that}} all users that experience congestion receive less bandwidth, but it can be frustrating for customers and a major problem for ISPs. In some cases the amount of bandwidth actually available may fall below the threshold required to support a particular service such as video conferencing or streaming live video-effectively making the service unavailable.|$|E

This paper reported a series of research studies carried out in UTM for locally produced cold-formed steel sections and roof truss system.

40|$|The author {{explores the}} effects of privatization, competition, and {{regulation}} on telecommunications performance in 30 African and Latin American countries from 1984 to 1997. Competition is associated with tangible benefits in terms of mainline penetration, number of pay phones, <b>connection</b> <b>capacity,</b> and reduced prices. Fixed-effects regressions reveal that competition - measured by mobile operators not owned by the incumbent telecommunications provider - is correlated with increases in the per capita number of mainlines, pay phones, and <b>connection</b> <b>capacity,</b> and with decreases {{in the price of}} local calls. Privatizing an incumbent is negatively correlated with mainline penetration and <b>connection</b> <b>capacity.</b> Privatization combined with regulation by an independent regulator, however, is positively correlated with <b>connection</b> <b>capacity</b> and substantially mitigates privatization's negative correlation with mainline penetration. Reformers are right to emphasize a combination of privatization, competition, and regulation. But researchers must explore the permutations of regulation: What type of regulation do countries adopt (price caps versus cost-of-service, for example) ? How does the regulatory agency work? What is the annual budget? How many employees does it have? Where do regulators come from? What sort of training and experience do they have? What enforcement powers does the regulatory agency have? In addition, researchers must deal with endogeneity of privatization, competition, and regulation to deal with issues of casualty.

40|$|Replicating web {{services}} at geographically distributed servers can offer client applications {{with a number}} of benefits, including higher service availability and improved response time. However, selecting the “best ” server to invoke at the client side is not a trivial task, as this decision needs to account for (and is affected by) a number of factors, such as local <b>connection</b> <b>capacity,</b> external network conditions and servers workload.

The experiment involved two client stations, with different connection capacities, continuously applying the five policies to invoke a real-world web service replicated over four servers in three continents.

40|$|How {{might we}} conceptualise and {{research}} everyday urbanism? By examining {{the making of}} everyday life in a low- income neighbourhood in Uganda, we argue that a dialectics of everyday urbanism is a useful approach for understanding urban poverty. This dialectical approach examines how marginalised urban dwellers navigate {{the city in the}} relative absence of formal infrastructure systems, service provision and state welfare, and in turn exceed those limitations through forging <b>connections,</b> <b>capacities</b> and opportunities. We reveal the ‘social infrastructures’ that people put together to sustain life, as well as the limits of and placed on these infrastructures, from the legacies of structural adjustment to ongoing forms of demolition and disinvestment. We identify a set of practices that operate alongside social infrastructure – ‘coordination’, ‘consolidation’ and ‘speculation’ – important in the composition of everyday urban life. In doing so, we reflect on how we might research the dialectics of everyday urbanism, and here a ‘follow-along participant observation’ (FAPO) methodology has significant potential.

40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{modifications}} to the design procedure, currently implemented in the modern European seismic code for ductile cross concentric braced frames (X-CBFs), are proposed. The code procedure is aimed to obtain a ductile and dissipative ultimate behaviour by imposing that the yielding of diagonal members occurs before the damage and premature failure of beams, columns and <b>connections</b> (<b>capacity</b> design); this approach, involving overstrength requirements and diagonal slenderness limitations, strongly affects the design of CBFs and generally leads to oversized structural solutions, thus suggesting a high weight premium related to the capacity design.
