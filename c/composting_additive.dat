40|$|Agriculture {{and land}} use change has {{significantly}} increased atmospheric emissions of the non-CO 2 green-house gases (GHG) nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4). Since human nutritional and bioenergy needs continue to increase, at a shrinking global land area for production, novel land management strategies are required that reduce the GHG footprint per unit of yield. Here we review the potential of biochar to reduce N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from agricultural practices including potential mechanisms behind observed effects. Furthermore, we investigate alternative uses of biochar in agricultural land management that may significantly reduce the GHG-emissions-per-unit-of-product footprint, such as (i) pyrolysis of manures as hygienic alternative to direct soil application, (ii) using biochar as fertilizer carrier matrix for underfoot fertilization, biochar use (iii) as <b>composting</b> <b>additive</b> or (iv) as feed additive in animal husbandry or for manure treatment. We conclude that the largest future research needs lay in conducting life-cycle GHG assessments when using biochar as an on-farm management tool for nutrient-rich biomass waste streams...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effects of}} {{selected}} types of biomass ash on the composting process and final product quality were studied by conducting a 96 -day long experiment where the source separated organic fraction of municipal waste, mixed with wood prunings that served as bulking agent, was added with 0 %, 2 %, 4 % and 8 % wt/wt of biomass ash. The evolution over time of the main process parameters was observed, and the final composts were characterised. On {{the basis of the}} results, both the composting process {{and the quality of the}} final product were improved by ash addition. Enhanced volatile solids reduction and biological stability (up to 32 % and 52 %, respectively, as compared to the unamended product) were attained when ash was added, since ash favored the aerobic degradation by acting as a physical conditioner. In the final products, higher humification of organic matter (expressed in terms of the humification index, that was 2. 25 times higher in the most-enriched compost than in the unamended one) and total Ca, K, Mg and P content were observed when ash was used. The latter aspect may influence the composts marketability positively, particularly with regards to potassium and phosphorus. The heavy metals content, that is regarded as the main environmental disadvantage when using ash as a <b>composting</b> <b>additive,</b> did not negatively affect the final composts quality. However, some other controversial effects of ash, related to the moisture and temperature values attained during the process, pH (8. 8 – 9. 2 as compared to 8. 2 of the unamended compost) and electrical conductivity levels (up to 53 % higher as compared to the unamended compost) in the final composts, were also observed...|$|E

Risks of plant pathogen dissemination and phytotoxicity hazards are eliminated when an effective sanitation of tomato wastes is achieved through a thermophilic composting process before amendment to soils [6, 7]. Although some studies focused on tomato plant composting [8, 7], {{little attention has}} been so far paid to assess the agronomic effectiveness of the produced compost. By assuming that on-farm composting of tomato plant wastes is the best sustainable practice to improve soil quality, our aim was to investigate (i) the effects of field compost amendments on tomato yields and resulting soil biological characteristics, (ii) the quality of on-farm composts from tomato plant residues in comparison with a commercial organic waste compost, and (iii) the molecular biomarkers which could differentiate tomato-based composts according to different amounts of tomato and other <b>composted</b> <b>additives.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dry land soils {{from the}} Indo-Gangetic plains are {{inherently}} poor in {{organic matter content}} and phosphorus (P). Amendment of these soils with P-enriched compost, together with P solubilizing rhizobacterial (PSR) inoculation has been suggested to improve plant growth and P uptake. We performed 3 Â Ã 9 ̆ 7 Â  2 factorial experiment using compost i. e. control, raw saw dust P compost (RPC) and acidified saw dust P compost (APC), and PSR inoculation as factors. The pot study investigated the effects of compost and PSR on maize growth, yield, P nutrition and soil biochemical properties. PSR inoculation with APC enhanced shoot length, cob diameter, grain yield and plant P uptake compared to control. APC amendment, either alone or in combination with PSR, also improved root growth and caused extension of rhizosphere by increasing the root length density of the maize plants. Significant improvement in soil biochemical properties i. e. dehydrogenase (DHA), Î²-glucosidase (BGA), urease (UA) activity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) are due to the <b>additive</b> effect of <b>compost</b> amendments. A substantial increase in P availability and associated biochemical attributes reflect the significance of substrate quality, structural stability and optimized pH conditions of added compost that may have enhanced PSR performance, specifically with APC. Moreover, increased carboxylate secretions and PSR abundance in the root zone, lowering of pH and increase in rhizosphere fungal parameters, suggest PSR and APC to be synergetic driving of increased P availability for maize. We conclude that efficiency of P enriched compost could be increased with suitable <b>compost</b> <b>additive</b> {{in the presence of}} PSR in dry land soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{research}} and suggest good-quality compost accelerators that could be effectively used in the garden <b>composts.</b> The <b>additive</b> eliminates the shortage of the input pulverized grass matter which is being composted. This thesis also describes the features of the compost, the nature of the correct composting procedures, and the legal implications to the production of the composting process. This paper elaborates the efficiency of the compost accelerators that are available within the home market and abroad. An important component of my accelerator is magnesium from the Dolomites limestone distributed by the "HASIT" company which positively affects the process of humification. The experiment of compostation with this type of accelerator took place on the pulverized grass matter. In order to objectively assess the quality of the composts, the Sanhoff´s method of stating the cation exchange capacity was used. During this experiment, the cation exchange capacity increased by 22 % in the sample where the accelerator has been used, as compared to the sample where only the composted grass matter was present. Based on the results gathered, it is feasible to conclude that the suggested accelerator does have a significant impact on the composting of the grass matter. Due to this fact, it is strongly recommended to conduct a further research on the composition of the compost accelerators...|$|R

Additionally, {{the aim of the}} study was to determine the type of interaction occurring between autochthonous fungi isolated from composts after the end of the thermophilic phase and Trichoderma sp. strains applied in the experiment. Number of microorganisms was determined by the plate method, next the identification was confirmed. The rating scale developed by Mańka was used to determine the type of interactions occurring between microorganisms. The greatest count of moulds in onion waste composts was noted in the object which had simultaneously been inoculated with two strains T 1 - T. atroviride and T 3 - T. harzianum. The greatest count of moulds was noted in the tomato waste composts inoculated with T 2 - T. harzianum strain. Microscope identification revealed that Penicillum sp., Rhizopus sp., Alternaria sp. and Mucor sp. strains were predominant in onion waste composts. In tomato waste composts Penicillium was the predominant genus, followed by Rhizopus. The test of antagonism revealed the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma isolates on most autochthonous strains of moulds. Tomato waste composts proved to be better substrates for the growth and development of Trichoderma sp. isolates.

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} {{research}} work reported in this Thesis was to study a variety of aspects of dog faeces in relation to public health, their fertilizer potential and possibility that such faeces might be remediated using larvae, ultimately to provide a source of biodiesel. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Dog faeces were shown to be source of pathogenic bacteria, notably Escherichia. coli and Salmonella. These bacteria were shown to be transferred to the soil of a local playing field by direct, in situ, transfer from dog faeces undergoing weathering. E. coli and Salmonella enterica were isolated from all four sites while no such isolates were obtained from the fifth location which was uncontaminated with dog faeces 2) It was shown here that “common or garden” slugs can transfer potentially pathogenic bacteria from dog faeces to lettuce. 3) The feeding of Black Soldier Fly Larvae on faeces led to a statistically significant {{increase in the number of}} bacteria inside the BSFL gut and the same trend was seen in relation to dog faeces fed Fruit Beetle Larvae. This trend of increasing bacterial numbers in larvae fed on dog faeces is particularly worrying in relation to the potential feeding of these larvae to animals- post exposure to faeces. 4) Dog faeces were shown to have potential inherent fertilizer content; the nutrients present being released over a time period mimicking the natural weathering of dog faeces in the environment. 5) As a generalization, the addition of both types of larvae to dog faeces significantly reduced the concentration of indigenous plant nutrients over the entire four week incubation period; exceptions to this were nitrate and phosphate concentrations in BSFL treated faeces, where significant increases were seen at week 4 and 3 respectively and in faeces treated with FBL, where ammonium concentrations were significantly increased at weeks 2 - 4, and phosphate at week 4. While the addition of both larvae therefore initially decreased levels of indigenous plant nutrients there was a trend in some of the nutrients to increase the longer the incubation went on. This suggests that perhaps a longer term exposure of dog faeces to the two larvae might have lead to increase in ammonium, nitrate, sulphate and phosphate concentrations. The addition of ammonium, elemental sulphur an insoluble phosphate to dog faeces which had been modified by the two larvae led to significant increases in nitrate, sulphate and plant-available phosphate, results which shows that that dog faeces contains the indigenous microflora required for the transformation of these amendments (which simulate fertilizer addition). The results suggest the possibility that larval modified dog faeces could be used as <b>compost</b> <b>additive</b> fertilizer, or perhaps even be used as an agricultural soil fertilizer. 6) The potential for using fly larvae for the bioremediation of dog faeces was investigated. Black Soldier Fly (BSFL) and Fruit Beetle (FBL) Fly larvae were shown to dramatically improve the physical nature of canine faeces, even after only a short exposure period, giving a bioremediated product which is markedly improved in terms of texture, reduced odour and overall reduced offensiveness. The bioremediated dog faeces product was also found to be suitable as potting compost when “diluted” with proprietary potting compost. 7) The haemolymph and total body extracts of BSFL and FBL were shown to be antibacterial. 8) The potential for using dog faeces and dog faeces which had been treated with BSFL and FB as a source of biodiesel was determined. It was shown that potential biodiesel precursors) (mainly fatty acids) were present both in the raw dog faeces and in faeces which were treated with the two different larvae. 9) The number of bacteria present in dog faeces disposed of in plastic bags dramatically increased over exposure to the UK summer, when temperatures were recorded between 10 - 270 C. ...|$|R
30|$|Nitrogen mainly {{gives the}} plants dark green color and strong growth (Bojović and Marković 2009; Gastal and Lemaire 2002) while {{phosphorous}} (P) primarily results in healthy growth of roots and enhances crop quality (Ristvey et al. 2007). Enough potassium (K) content enhances plants’ resistance against drought and diseases (Malvi 2011). Hence, NPK content of compost, as a benchmark for compost quality, should be sufficient for plant growth (Rihani et al. 2010). All feedstock produced composts with acceptable levels of NPK. Good quality compost should have 0.4 – 3.5 % nitrogen, 0.3 – 3.5 % phosphorus and 0.5 – 1.8 % potassium (Jaafarzadeh Haghighi Fard et al. 2015; Sadeghi et al. 2015). Addition of EM resulted in production of compost with higher percentages of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} compared to SE. With addition of EM, feedstock with 10 % FW recorded the best NPK value.

In <b>composts</b> with SE <b>additive,</b> supplement of FW {{has no effect on}} phosphorus and potassium contents and almost similar percentages of P and K were recorded in all compost samples.
