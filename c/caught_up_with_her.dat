5|$|Sabina {{got to her}} feet, whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} to persuade her {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} option, he quotes Panyasis, who states that King Theias of Assyria had a {{daughter}} called Smyrna. Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her into a tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
50|$|Stephanie {{started to}} have {{an affair with a}} circus {{performer}} & businessman named, Bela Garody (Lee Godart). Despite the fact that Stephanie was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> mostly <b>with</b> <b>her</b> work at the news station with reaching deadlines & attending meetings. She stood by Wendy (Lisa Peluso) when she accused Bela for harassing her, when that stopped, Wendy and Bela became fast friends and eventually they wound up in bed together, which made Stephanie become mad and thus being so distant to Wendy because of what she did, betray her own mother (Stephanie) for sleeping with (Bela). Eventually Stephanie forgave Wendy for what they had both done to each other and they both reconciled with each other, right before Wendy left Henderson, right after the holidays, in January 1986.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Wentworth, who had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> knelt <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in his arms, {{looking on}} <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence. [...] "She is dead! she is dead!" [...] screamed Mary, {{catching}} {{hold of her}} husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.|$|R
500|$|The album's title also {{evolves into}} a {{reference}} to the political corruption and general social mistrust pervading contemporary Colombian society. The album cover features a photo of <b>her,</b> soot-covered palms <b>up,</b> <b>caught</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands dirty. Shakira explained the cover, saying, [...] "rom that point of view, we all have stolen at one time or another, myself included. The dirty hands [...] represent the shared guilt. No one is completely clean, in the end we are all accomplices". In keeping <b>with</b> <b>her</b> increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and messy and filled it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> little colorful braids, looking like a [...] "modern Medusa" [...] according to biographer Ximena Diego. Following the album's commercial success, girls from several countries were copying Shakira's style, colorfully braiding their hair and wearing friendship bracelets.|$|R

25|$|The {{family moved}} from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove, where Wilder's father {{served as the}} town butcher and justice of the peace. He {{accepted}} a railroad job {{in the spring of}} 1879, which took him to eastern Dakota Territory, where they joined him that fall. Wilder did not write about 1876–1877, when they lived near Burr Oak, but skipped directly to Dakota Territory, portrayed in By the Shores of Silver Lake (1939). Thus the fictional timeline <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> real life.|$|E
5000|$|At {{first the}} Dakota seemed friendly, but the {{situation}} abruptly soured. It is not known whether any of the five white men were armed. [...] Anders and the Lundborg boys were shot, though Samuel Lundborg would survive his wounds. Andreas Lundborg arrived just as his sons were being attacked. Armed but obviously outnumbered, he ran and several Dakota gave chase. At that point, however, the wagon appeared in which Daniel Broberg was driving {{the women and children}} home, and the attackers focused on them instead. [...] Daniel was shot and 7-year-old Christiana was clubbed down with a rifle. 16-year-old Anna Stina managed to flee into a cornfield, where she <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Andreas Lundborg. <b>Her</b> cousin Peter ran almost 400 yd to the Oman cabin, which was in sight. A Dakota tore Peter's baby brother from their mother's hands and threw him to the ground. The warriors tried to take the two Mrs. Brobergs prisoner, but they resisted and were shot.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". Thus, the album's title and track were born. The album's title also evolves into a sly reference to the political corruption and general social mistrust pervading contemporary Colombian society. It is a corruption in which Shakira regonizes her own complicity - the album cover features a photo of <b>her,</b> soot-covered palms <b>up,</b> <b>caught</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands dirty.|$|R
2500|$|On 30 January 1698, Captain Kidd, aboard {{his ship}} Adventure Galley, spotted Quedagh Merchant about 25 leagues from Cochin, and raced to catch <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> [...] After {{approximately}} four hours, Adventure Galley <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Quedagh and hoisted a French flag for its colours, and Kidd commanded the other captain to board his ship. [...] A Frenchman came over by boat, {{and when he}} stepped aboard Adventure Galley, Kidd gave the command to hoist an English flag. [...] The Frenchman, upon seeing the flag change, reportedly replied, [...] "Here is a good Prize." ...|$|R
25|$|On 14 July 1804 Demerara was {{cruising}} off Demerara when at daylight she sighted a ship at anchor. The ship {{got under}} weigh and approached Demerara, which attempted to escape what {{was clearly a}} well-armed privateer. Within an hour the privateer had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> quarry and started firing small arms and a broadside. Within 10 minutes Demerara had lost one man killed and nine wounded, and Dutton struck. The privateer was Grande Décidée. She was armed with 22 guns and had a crew of 155 men.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 1798, {{the hired}} armed cutterTelemachus sighted the French {{privateer}} Sophie {{three miles from}} the Berry Head. Telemachus gave chase and after six hours <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> some two or three leagues north of the Casquets Light. Sophie was armed with four guns and had a crew of 20 men. She was two days out of Saint Malo but had taken nothing; however, when the chase started, Sophie was close to three British merchant brigs. Seagull joined the chase and was in sight when Telemachus made the capture.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit, Canberra {{returned}} to civilian {{service as a}} cruise ship. Her role in the Falklands War made her very popular with the British public, and ticket sales after her return were elevated for many years as a result. Age and high running costs eventually <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> though, as she had much higher fuel consumption than most modern cruise ships. Although Premier Cruise Line had made a bid for the old ship, P had already decided {{that they did not}} want the Canberra to operate under a different flag. A replacement for the Canberra, the 1988-built Star Princess was transferred to P Cruises and was renamed Arcadia.|$|E

25|$|In August 1806 Commander George Morris took command, {{replacing}} Smith, who {{had taken}} command of Penguin in May or June. On 1 October Elk destroyed the five-gun privateer Alliance. Elephant had sent Elk to investigate a schooner. After chasing his quarry for nine hours, Morris eventually <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Elks masts had received damage in the chase and fearing that he might lose the prize if the winds changed, Morris rammed her. Her commander was M. Alexander St. Helme and she was armed with one long 12-pounder gun, two sixes and two 12-pounder carronades, and carried a crew of 75 men. In her five days out of Guadeloupe, she had taken three prizes, two American schooners and the British brig Neptune, which {{had been on a}} voyage from Jamaica to Exuma. In capturing Alliance, Elk had so damaged her that she sank shortly after Morris took her crew aboard Elk.|$|E
25|$|On {{that morning}} Allen sighted three vessels, {{the largest of}} which seemed the most suspicious. Echo gave chase and at 7p.m. the quarry raised French colours and fired a shot. Echo <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> at 9p.m., {{and after a few}} shots from Echo, and a few broadsides from the French vessel, she struck. She was the letter of marque barque Amazon(e), armed with ten 6-pounder guns and {{carrying}} a crew of 60. She was sailing from Jacquemel to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee. When Echo took her prisoners out of Amazon they proved to be quite unwell. Allen and his officers decided to put the prisoners on a Spanish sloop that Echo had taken a few days earlier and they then directed the sloop to the nearest Spanish port. Echos sails needed a complete overhaul, and with the squadron nowhere in sight, Allen escorted Amazon to Port Royal.|$|E

500|$|Concorde {{was then}} {{assigned}} to Rear-Admiral George Montagu's squadron in May 1794, and {{took part in}} the manoeuvres during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. Strachan left Concorde in July 1794 to take command of HMS Melampus, and in August Captain Anthony Hunt took over command of Concorde. Concorde was part of John Warren's squadron off Quiberon between June and July 1795, supporting the Quiberon Expedition, after which she joined Sir Edward Pellew's squadron. On 20 April 1796 Pellew's squadron, then consisting of Concorde, Pellew's 38-gun [...] and the 36-gun [...] under Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, spotted and chased a mysterious sail. After chasing her for 15 hours over 168 miles they <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> with Indefatigable leading the attack. Both ships exchanged fire, considerably damaging each other, upon which Concorde came up under her stern and forced her to surrender.

500|$|Beatty {{ordered his}} battlecruisers {{to make all}} {{practicable}} speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, Lion, Princess Royal and , were doing [...] in pursuit and Lion opened fire at very long range. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves about 20 minutes later and concentrated their fire on Lion. [...] and [...] combined their fire to cripple Lion over the next hour even though Princess Royal engaged Derfflinger during this period. Another signalling failure caused the British ships to focus on sinking Blücher when Beatty intended most of his ships to continue {{the pursuit of the}} battlecruisers. During this time Princess Royal hit Blücher at least twice, including the hit that crippled her and allowed the other British ships to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze. He then transferred to a destroyer and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before Blücher sank and boarded Princess Royal. Beatty ordered the pursuit resumed of the German battlecruisers, but rescinded the order {{when it became clear that}} too much time had been wasted sinking Blücher and that Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. Lion was headed home at [...] when the rest of the battlecruisers <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Later that afternoon, the battlecruiser [...] was ordered to take Lion under tow. It took almost two days to reach port. The ship was under repair for the next three months and did not rejoin the fleet until 7 April. Princess Royal was not damaged during the battle.|$|E
