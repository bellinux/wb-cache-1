Bullion coins sometimes carry a face value as legal tender.The face value is minted on the coin, and it is done so in order to bestow legal tender status on a coin, which generally makes it easier to import or export across national borders, as well as subject to laws against counterfeiting. However, their real value is measured as dictated by their troy weight, the current market price of the precious metal contained, and the prevailing premium that market wishes to pay for those particular bullion coins. The face value is always significantly less than the bullion value of the coin. Legal tender bullion coins are a separate entity to bullion gold. One enjoys legal tender status, the latter is merely a raw <b>commodity.</b> <b>Gold</b> has an international currency code of XAU under ISO 4217.

We examine {{the way in which the}} degree of regional (seven African markets combined), global (China, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US), <b>commodity</b> (<b>gold</b> and petroleum), and nominal effective exchange rate (Euro and US dollar) spillovers to individual African countries evolve during the two crises through the econometric method introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). We find that African markets are most severely affected by spillovers from global markets and modestly from commodity and currency markets. Conversely, the regional spillovers within Africa are smaller than the global ones and are insulated from the global crises. We also find that the aggregated spillover effects of European countries to the African markets exceeded that of the US even at the wake of the US financial crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{continental-scale}} kriging on the African continent using the gold-bearing commodities of the Gondwana Geoscience Indexing Database. The mineral layer contains over 20 000 commodities, each containing information on its ordinal interval size value. Boundaries between class intervals across the database are, however, not uniform. We perform spatial interpolation on a continental scale using the <b>commodity</b> <b>gold</b> as the binary variable. First, we select an appropriate distance metric {{in order to}} krige on an essentially spherical surface. We use this metric to implement a valid covariance function. Second, the ordinal size classes of the commodities are combined into a unique size classification. In addition, the commodity size classification {{is used as a}} proxy for data reliability and is incorporated by using a weighted variogram. The geology is used to stratify Africa into geologically homogeneous strata, leading to stratified kriging. The best model in each stratum is used to produce a map of gold commodities of Africa including the spatial uncertainties. By integrating advanced techniques with high-quality data, a state-of-the-art map of gold commodities was obtained for Africa, including the spatial uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|As a <b>commodity,</b> <b>gold</b> {{occupies}} {{a special place}} in Indian psyche. With formal capital markets still out of reach for a large section of the Indian population, gold, beyond its traditional use as jewellery, also acts as a store of value, especially under an environment of moderately high inflation. In this paper, we further explore the asset price channel of monetary transmission by endogenizing gold price inflation within the Indian macroeconomic system. Supported by empirical tests in favor of such an inclusion, a linear VAR model results indicate that gold seems to act as a shock absorber by way of shielding other macroeconomic variables, especially GDP growth, from the influence monetary policy shocks. In India, the demand for gold is primarily met by imports. Thus, the dynamics of gold, real exchange rate and inflation are likely to be interlinked in a nonlinear manner. Based on estimation of a TVAR model and simulation methods of inference, we find that there are significant differences in the macroeconomic dynamics of the Indian economy under high and low inflation regimes. Moreover, the TVAR model results suggest that gold seems to matter more in the Indian macroeconomic system during episodes of high inflation. Inflation regime; gold price; hedge; TVA...|$|E

40|$|In Marxism, {{money and}} labor {{are the two}} mea-sures of value. They run in parallel, with complex {{connection}}s, but three forms of connection are immediately conspicuous. A Capital, volume 1, version frames the connection in terms of money as a produced <b>commodity</b> (<b>gold)</b> with its own costs of production measured in socially necessary labor time; in volume 2 the connection is through money {{as a form of}} capital for the purchase of the commodity labor power; and a volume 3 connec-tion is expressed in the “transformation process”: the conversion of socially necessary labor time as a unit of account into money as a unit of account. Each connection contributes a dimension to the conception and measurement of surplus value. Volume 1 gives us a connection of money to the reproduction of labor power—that the cost of production of gold is defined with reference to “subsistence ” wages in the gold mining industry and hence the economy at large. Volume 2 gives us the conception of equivalence in the valuation of different forms of capital, such that the conver-sion of M to M ʹ in the circuit of industrial capital reveals the value creation of production. Finally, volume 3 gives us the connection between sur-plus value and its realization as the rate of profit measured in terms of money...|$|E
40|$|The central {{hypothesis}} to {{be tested}} is the relevance of gold in {{the determination of the}} value of the US dollar as an international reserve currency after 1971. In the first section the market value of the US dollar is analysed by looking at new forms of value (financial derivative products), the dollar as a safe haven, the choice of a standard of value and the role of SDRs in reforming the international monetary system. Based on dimensional analysis, the second section analyses the definition and meaning of a numéraire for international currency and the justification for a variable standard of value based on a <b>commodity</b> (<b>gold).</b> The second section is the theoretical foundation for the empirical and econometric analysis in the third and fourth sections. The third section is devoted to the specification of an econometric model and a graphical analysis of the data. It is clear that an inverse relation exists between the value of the US dollar and the price of gold. The fourth section shows the estimations of the different specifications of the model including linear regression and cointegration analysis. The most important econometric result is that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of a significant link between the price of gold and the value of the US dollar. There is also a positive relationship between gold price and inflation. An inverse statistically significant relation between gold price and monetary policy is shown by applying a dynamic model of cointegration with lags...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the crisis of the {{international}} financial system and the necessity of reforming it by new anchor or benchmark for the international currency, a money-commodity. The need for understanding the definition of a numéraire is a first necessity. Although most economists reject any connection between money and a particular <b>commodity</b> (<b>gold)</b> – because of the existence of legal tender money in every country – it will be shown that it is equivalent to reduce the real space to an abstract number (usually assumed 1) in order to postulate that money is neutral. This is sheer nonsense. It will also be shown that the concept of fiat money or state money does not preclude the existence of commodity money. This paper is divided in four sections. The first section analyses the definition and meaning of a numéraire for the international currency and the justification for a variable standard of value. In the second section, the market value of the US dollar is analysed by looking at new forms of value -the derivative products- the dollar as a safe haven, and the role of SDRs in reforming the international monetary system. In the third and fourth sections, empirical evidence concerning the most recent period of the financial crisis is presented and an econometric model is specified to fit those data. After estimating many different specifications of the model –linear stepwise regression, simultaneous regression with GMM estimator, error correction model- the main econometric result is that there is a one to one correspondence between the price of gold and the value of the US dollar. Indeed, the variance of the price of gold is mainly explained by the Euro exchange rate defined with respect to the US dollar, the inflation rate and negatively influenced by the Dow Jones index and the interest rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{the early}} times in India, {{majority}} of the consumers believed in satisfying their basic needs only and save the rest for bad times. But {{with the emergence of}} modern India, there is a shift in the consumption patterns. Nowadays, the consumers believe in satisfying their psychological needs that give them pleasure and status. India is emerging {{to be one of the}} largest consumers of luxury good like gold across the globe. This research enabled us to learn that a consumer’s behavior is by and large affected by social, cultural and environmental factors. Apart from these, the psychological needs of an individual also drive humans to purchase luxury gold. The research talks about the motivation cues and new experiences that influence the consumers. The study uses a questionnaire distributed randomly amongst different people. Some of the respondents especially females were attendant of a jewellery show organized in the city. The research focused on the social, environmental and perceived ethical factors that can shape and frame consumer’s mind for the consumption of luxury gold. It also studied some aspects related to offered services (both post sales and during the sales) and buying-selling or trading channels of gold (Crane and Matten, 2007). As expected, the consumers responded and agreed that their consumption depends largely on the personal benefit factors and the cultural & traditional factors. They also confirmed to be influenced by the marketing and promotional cues of discounts, easy buy back offers, etc. The economic status of an individual and the price fluctuation in gold are also in direct and indirect relation, respectively, with the consumption of luxury <b>commodity</b> <b>gold.</b> Apart from all this, the study revealed that most of the respondents believed that investment in gold is safe and will yield high returns in future. In other words, the study brings out the fact that investment in gold involves low risk with high returns...|$|E
