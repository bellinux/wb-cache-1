5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, <b>colored</b> <b>paper,</b> poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, water <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> {{was made}} by forming the {{dispersed}} cotton fibers on a mold (or fram), which allowed the water to drain away, leaving a sheet(> 300 g/㎡) of felted fibers. This wet sheet was then put on a high-roughness felt, {{to which it is}} adhered. And then pressing the wet sheet to form a rough, thick and absorbent water <b>color</b> <b>paper.</b> In case of water <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> was made from durable fibers with optimum water absorption and attractive coloring strength, it finds its admirable use in painting and sketching. A high-grade water color painting is mainly used for artistc appreciation and art'' s interest. Unfortunately, we are unable to make a high-grade water <b>color</b> <b>paper,</b> so expensive imported one''s, e. g. Arches (France), Whatman(Britain) are very popular for the watercolorists in Taiwan. In this study, we intended to make a high-grade water <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> by handsheet-making techniques. The best formulations for a high-grade water <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> are as follows: *Density: 0. 5 - 0. 6 g/cm 3 *Water absorbency:> 28 g/㎡(cobb test) *Roughmess:higher roughness make the <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> readly to *Brightness:high brightness makes the color moer brighter. *Colored pigments should properly level on the paper surface. *Permanence:alkaline sized and cotton-containing <b>color</b> water <b>paper</b> shows the greatest permanence. 傳統之水彩紙抄造法為以手工紙抄紙框撈起呈分散狀之纖維並經濾水交織 成基重 300 g/㎡以上之紙。然後將此濕紙轉移於表面甚粗毛布上，施壓脫 水，最後經乾燥除水，水彩紙於焉抄成。高品質水彩紙具色白，紙韌，顯 色性佳及適宜吸水性特性，可供水彩繪畫及素描之用。高級水彩紙為人們 帶來歡愉及藝術樂趣。不幸，臺灣目前尚不能抄造高品質水彩紙，因此畫 家均採用進口昂貴之水彩紙。本研究嘗試藉手抄紙法製造高品質水彩紙。 按本試驗最適配方所抄出之高品質水彩紙重要性質如下： *密度 ： 0. 5 - 0. 6 g/cm 3 *吸水性：> 28 g/㎡(cobb test) *粗糙度：適當粗糙度 有助水彩繪畫。 *白度：高白度水彩紙使色彩鮮明。 *水彩顏料應均勻分 佈在紙之表面，方可得好的顯色性。 *耐久性：含棉漿之鹼性上膠紙可延 長水彩紙之壽命...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{problem is}} to produce a {{sensitometer}} to expose photographic <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> {{to be used as}} control strips in a photographic <b>color</b> <b>paper</b> process. This problem involves designing, constructing, and verifying the sensitometer. Designing the sensitometer is done by looking at different methods of exposing each dye layer of a photographic <b>color</b> <b>paper.</b> These methods include: fiber optics or light guides, light integrating devices, and projection systems. The method which was chosen for this experiment is the projection system. After the method had been decided upon, a lamp model will be calculated using the spectral sensitivity curve of a photographic <b>color</b> <b>paper.</b> The rest of the components will then be designed as needed to complete the sensitometer...|$|R

25|$|Within a few hours, the IFE and {{the polling}} station {{officials}} explained that between 8 and 10 ballots {{for the election}} to the Lower House had been incorrectly placed in the presidential ballot box (this could be seen because the ballots for the presidential, senatorial, and lower house elections were printed on different <b>colored</b> <b>paper,</b> to match {{the colors of the}} boxes). Article 231 of the COFIPE states that ballots placed in the incorrect box should be moved to the correct box. The president of the polling station ordered the ballots moved to the correct box, and all representatives present agreed to this. The video had been recorded by the representative of the Coalition, who also signed the report that explained it in the official tally sheet.

Like in other parts of Mexico, the days around November 2 honor the dead with altars and offerings, although each community has its own variations. One area which is known for its traditions is Huejutla de Reyes, where altars dedicated to the dead are especially large and profusely decorated with flowers, <b>colored</b> <b>paper</b> and traditional foods, with the intention of counteracting mourning. In a number of areas, rituals based on Huasteca traditions are also performed. One of these is called the [...] "Danza de Xantolo," [...] in which masked figures in robes dance in candlelight. In other communities, youths in costume will dance from house to house, to be invited in to eat dishes prepared for the occasion. Another tradition is to have bands play at the cemeteries on November 2, where tombs are cleaned and decorated with flowers, garlands and more.|$|E

6000|$|Faustus, {{the second}} play, {{is one of}} the best of Marlowe's works.[141] The story is that of a scholar who longs for {{infinite}} knowledge, and who turns from Theology, Philosophy, Medicine, and Law, the four sciences of the time, to the study of magic, much as a child might turn from jewels to tinsel and <b>colored</b> <b>paper.</b> In order to learn magic he sells himself to the devil, on condition that he shall have twenty-four years of absolute power and knowledge. The play is the story of those twenty-four years. Like Tamburlaine, it is lacking in dramatic construction,[142] but has an unusual number of passages of rare poetic beauty. Milton's Satan suggests strongly that the author of Paradise Lost had access to Faustus and used it, as he may also have used Tamburlaine, for the magnificent panorama displayed by Satan in Paradise Regained. For instance, more than fifty years before Milton's hero says, [...] "Which way I turn is hell, myself am hell," [...] Marlowe had written: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a part of the {{activity}} to develop an interdisciplinary class on the climate environment around the Japan Islands and the “seasonal feeling”, succeeding to Kato et al. (2014). In the class at the Faculty of Education, Okayama University in 2014, the comparative expression of the seasonal feelings between early winter and early spring was made, with attention to the asymmetric seasonal march from autumn to the next spring pointed out by Kato et al. (2013). The students tried the expression firstly with combination of the <b>colored</b> <b>papers</b> based on the Johannes Itten’s (1888 - 1967) exercise, next with use of the small percussion instruments, and finally with the <b>colored</b> <b>papers</b> again. Analyses of the students’ works suggested the deepening of the expressions on different seasonal feelings between early winter and early spring by the interaction of the art and music activities with each other, such as the music expressions with imaging colors or superposition of the tones at the second activity, the art expressions influenced by the music works in selecting the configurations or combination of the <b>colored</b> <b>papers</b> at the third activity, and so on. It is also interesting that the students’ expressions of the seasonal feelings seem to be reflected by not only the mean seasonal state but also some specified factors in the seasonal march...|$|R
