5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Continuum</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> {{introduced}} by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert {{as the first}} of his twenty-three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium. The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor's set theory, and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, Hurwitz and Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.|$|E
40|$|The <b>continuum</b> <b>hypotheses</b> (CH) {{is one of}} {{the most}} central open {{problems}} in set theory, one that is important for both mathematical and philosophical reasons. The problem actually arose with the birth of set theory; indeed, in many respects it stimulated the birth of set theory. In 1874 Cantor had shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the algebraic numbers. More surprisingly, he showed that there is no oneto-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers. Taking the existence of a one-to-one correspondence as a criterion for when two sets have the same size (something he certainly did by 1878), this result shows that there is more than one level of infinity and thus gave birth to the higher infinite in mathematics. Cantor immediately tried to determine whether there were any infinite sets of real numbers that were ofintermediate size, that is, whether there was an infinite set of real numbers that could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers an...|$|R
40|$|This article explores Poisson's ratio, {{starting}} with the controversy concerning its magnitude and uniqueness {{in the context of}} the molecular and <b>continuum</b> <b>hypotheses</b> competing in the development of elasticity theory in the nineteenth century, moving on to its place in the development of materials science and engineering in the twentieth century, and concluding with its recent re-emergence as a universal metric for the mechanical performance of materials on any length scale. During these episodes France lost its scientific pre-eminence as paradigms switched from mathematical to observational, and accurate experiments became the prerequisite for scientific advance. The emergence of the engineering of metals followed, and subsequently the invention of composites?both somewhat separated from the discovery of quantum mechanics and crystallography, and illustrating the bifurcation of technology and science. Nowadays disciplines are reconnecting in the face of new scientific demands. During the past two centuries, though, the shape versus volume concept embedded in Poisson's ratio has remained invariant, but its application has exploded from its origins in describing the elastic response of solids and liquids, into areas such as materials with negative Poisson's ratio, brittleness, glass formation, and a re-evaluation of traditional materials. Moreover, the two contentious hypotheses have been reconciled in their complementarity within the hierarchical structure of materials and through computational modelling. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a distributed learning setup where {{a network of}} agents sequentially access realizations {{of a set of}} random variables with unknown distributions. The network objective is to find a parametrized distribution that best describes their joint observations {{in the sense of the}} Kullback-Leibler divergence. Apart from recent efforts in the literature, we analyze the case of countably many hypotheses and the case of a <b>continuum</b> of <b>hypotheses.</b> We provide non-asymptotic bounds for the concentration rate of the agents' beliefs around the correct hypothesis in terms of the number of agents, the network parameters, and the learning abilities of the agents.

25|$|The <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> first {{proposed}} as a conjecture by Cantor, was listed by David Hilbert {{as one of}} his 23 problems in 1900. Gödel showed that the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> cannot be disproven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice), by developing the constructible universe of set theory in which the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> must hold. In 1963, Paul Cohen showed that the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> cannot be proven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (Cohen 1966). This independence result did not completely settle Hilbert's question, however, as it is possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the hypothesis. Recent work along these lines has been conducted by W. Hugh Woodin, although its importance is not yet clear (Woodin 2001).|$|E
25|$|Several set theorists {{followed}} this approach and actively searched for axioms {{that may be}} considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the <b>continuum</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them.

40|$|A central {{challenge}} in developmental biology is understanding {{the creation of}} robust spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Generally, the mathematical treatments of biological systems have used <b>continuum,</b> mean-field <b>hypotheses</b> for their constituent parts, which ignores any sources of intrinsic stochastic effects. In this paper we consider a stochastic space-jump process as a description of diffusion, i. e., particles are able to undergo a random walk on a discretized domain. By developing analytical Fourier methods {{we are able to}} probe this probabilistic framework, which gives us insight into the patterning potential of diffusive systems. Further, an alternative description of domain growth is introduced, with which we are able to rigorously link the mean-field and stochastic descriptions. Finally, through combining these ideas, it is shown that such stochastic descriptions of diffusion on a deterministically growing domain are able to support the nucleation of states that are far removed from the deterministic mean-field steady state...|$|R

40|$|In {{the modern}} Bayesian view {{classical}} probability theory {{is simply an}} extension of conventional logic, i. e., a quantitative tool that allows for consistent reasoning {{in the presence of}} uncertainty. Classical theory presupposes, however, that [...] at least in principle [...] the amount of evidence that an experimenter can accumulate always matches the size of the hypothesis space. I investigate how the framework for consistent reasoning must be modified in non-classical situations where <b>hypotheses</b> form a <b>continuum,</b> yet the maximum evidence accessible through experiment is not allowed to exceed some finite upper bound.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} and vagal {{nerve stimulation}} are therapeutically effective in treating some neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Optogenetic-based neurostimulation approaches {{are capable of}} activating individual synapses and yield the highest spatial control over brain circuit activity. Both electrical and light-based neurostimulation methods require intrusive procedures such as surgical implantation of electrodes or photon-emitting devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has also shown therapeutic effectiveness and represents a recent paradigm shift towards implementing less invasive brain stimulation methods. Magnetic-based stimulation, however, has a limited focusing capacity and lacks brain penetration power. Because ultrasound can be noninvasively transmitted through the skull to targeted deep brain circuits, it may offer alternative approaches to currently employed neuromodulation techniques. Encouraging this idea, literature spanning {{more than half a}} century indicates that ultrasound can modulate neuronal activity. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms underlying the actions of ultrasound on neuronal excitability, here, I propose the <b>continuum</b> mechanics <b>hypothesis</b> of ultrasonic neuromodulation in which ultrasound produces effects on viscoelastic neurons and their surrounding fluid environments to alter membrane conductance.

25|$|One {{reason that}} the study of inner models is of {{interest}} is that {{it can be used to}} prove consistency results.

40|$|Using data on annual {{individual}} {{labor income}} from three representative panel datasets (German SOEP, British BHPS, Australian HILDA) we investigate a) the selectivity of item non-response (INR) and b) {{the impact of}} imputation as a prominent post-survey means {{to cope with this}} type of measurement error on prototypical analyses (earnings inequality, mobility and wage regressions) in a cross-national setting. Given the considerable variation of INR across surveys as well as the varying degree of selectivity build into the missing process, there is substantive and methodological interest in an improved harmonization of (income) data production as well as of imputation strategies across surveys. All three panels make use of longitudinal information in their respective imputation procedures, however, there are marked differences in the implementation. Firstly, although the probability of INR is quantitatively similar across countries, our empirical investigation identifies cross-country differences with respect to the factors driving INR: survey-related aspects as well as indicators accounting for variability and complexity of labor income composition appear to be relevant. Secondly, longitudinal analyses yield a positive correlation of INR on labor income data over time and provide evidence of INR being a predictor of subsequent unit-non-response, thus supporting the “cooperation <b>continuum</b> ” <b>hypothesis</b> in all three panels.

As a main result, we provide first evidence for a domain-specific behavioral bias of musicians and SIs toward the trained categories, namely music and speech. In addition, SIs showed a bias toward musical items, indicating that interpreting training has a generic influence on the cognitive representation of spectrotemporal signals with similar acoustic properties to speech sounds. Notably, EEG measurements revealed clear distinct N 400 and P 600 responses to both prototypical and ambiguous items between the three groups at anterior, central, and posterior scalp sites.
