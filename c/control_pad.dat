5|$|Whereas the {{original}} game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game {{introduced a new}} damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D <b>Control</b> <b>Pad,</b> whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or <b>control</b> <b>pad</b> directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the <b>control</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
50|$|Donkey Kong Hockey: It was {{developed}} by Nintendo R&D1 and released in 1985 {{as part of the}} Game & Watch Micro Vs. series. The game features one LCD screen and two attached <b>control</b> <b>pads.</b> The hockey features Donkey Kong as one of the players and Mario as the other.|$|R

50|$|Thirty plasma screens {{make up the}} gamezone, {{arranged}} in a rectangle five screens wide and six screens high. The players have to answer questions with two multiple-choice answers (or true-or-false questions) with <b>control</b> <b>pads</b> attached to their wrists. They can take their time, and only the correct-answering players are allowed to move down the gamezone.|$|R
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the <b>control</b> <b>pad</b> the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E
5|$|The <b>control</b> <b>pad</b> {{may be used}} to {{move the}} hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, {{the map of the}} Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. The touch screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via the touch screen. The game makes little to no use of the stylus, forcing players to rely on the <b>control</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, we used lentiviral-delivered shRNA to {{generate}} a clonal line of 3 T 3 -F 442 A preadipocytes with stable silencing of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression and examined the long-term consequence of this modification on fat pad development. HGF mRNA expression was reduced 94 %, and HGF secretion 79 % (P < 0. 01), compared with preadipocytes treated with nontargeting shRNA. Fat pads derived from HGF knockdown preadipocytes were significantly smaller (P < 0. 01) than <b>control</b> <b>pads</b> beginning at 3 days postinjection (0. 022 ± 0. 003 vs. 0. 037 ± 0. 004 g), and further decreased in size at day 7 (0. 015 ± 0. 004 vs. 0. 037 ± 0. 003 g) and day 14 (0. 008 ± 0. 002 vs. 0. 045 ± 0. 007 g). Expression of the endothelial cell genes TIE 1 and PECAM 1 increased over time in <b>control</b> fat <b>pads</b> (1. 6 ± 0. 4 vs. 11. 4 ± 1. 7 relative units at day 3 and 14, respectively; P < 0. 05) but not in HGF knockdown fat pads (1. 1 ± 0. 5 vs. 5. 9 ± 2. 2 relative units at day 3 and 14). Contiguous vascular structures were observed in <b>control</b> fat <b>pads</b> but were much less developed in HGF knockdown fat pads. Differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes was significantly attenuated in HGF knockdown fat pads. Fat pads derived from preadipocytes with knockdown of the HGF receptor c-MET were smaller than <b>control</b> <b>pads</b> at day 3 postinjection (0. 034 ± 0. 002 vs. 0. 049 ± 0. 004 g; P < 0. 05), and remained the same size through day 14. c-MET knockdown fat pads developed a robust vasculature, and preadipocytes differentiated to mature adipocytes. Overall {{these data suggest that}} preadipocyte-secreted HGF is an important regulator of neovascularization in developing fat pads...|$|R
5000|$|The Telegames Personal Arcade was the US {{version of}} the Dina by Bit Corporation. This slim console could play both ColecoVision and SG-1000 cartridges. It came {{equipped}} with NES-styled controllers, and even had a built in game called [...] "Meteoric Shower". Since the DINA <b>control</b> <b>pads</b> did not contain the numeric keypad of the actual ColecoVision controller, they were mounted on the unit itself.

5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as <b>control</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|R
25|$|After test screenings, it {{was decided}} to re-shoot Captain Kirk's death. Originally, Kirk was shot and killed by Doctor Soran, but it was felt by the test {{audience}} {{that this was not a}} fitting death for such an iconic character. The re-shoot changed the manner of his death, so that instead, he sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's <b>control</b> <b>pad</b> and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen.

Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional <b>control</b> <b>pads</b> {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Spacewar involves two monochrome spaceships called [...] "the needle" [...] and [...] "the wedge", each {{controlled by}} a player, attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. The ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a toggle switch on the computer or pressing a button on the <b>control</b> <b>pad,</b> and there is a cooldown period between launches. [...] The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.|$|E
500|$|The game further showcases {{a special}} 3D {{environment}} called [...] "Sonic World", whereby the player can move around freely as Sonic {{and interact with}} various objects. [...] "Sonic World" [...] acts as an interactive museum in which the player can access an array of information of Sonic the Hedgehog-related content, such as viewing concept artwork, manuals, character portfolios, music, and original Japanese advertisements. To access these features, the player must guide Sonic into specific buildings. As well as the interactive museum, [...] "Sonic World" [...] has a [...] "mission list" [...] which is only accessible if the player forces Sonic to jump on a red and white trampoline.

The proposed scheme enables entirely optical through-chip buses that could service hundreds of thinned stacked dies. Very high throughputs and communication density could be achieved even in tight power budgets. The core of the optical interconnect is a single-photon avalanche diode operating in pulse position modulation. We demonstrate how throughputs of several gigabits per second may be achieved. We also show a systematic analysis and trade-offs of such a system and preliminary results to support its suitability in emerging DSM technologies.

500|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} were {{created for the}} Mark III and Master System, which are cross-compatible with one another. [...] The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a <b>control</b> <b>pad</b> and two buttons. [...] Sega also introduced additional controllers, such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller, for the Mark III and a special sports controller for the Master System. [...] A pair of 3D glasses known as SegaScope 3-D were also created for games such as Space Harrier 3D, although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them. [...] The Mark III also had an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a UHF television signal.

500|$|The lights, and, by extension, the {{flashlight}} and flash beacon, {{are found in}} all main games, excluding the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a <b>control</b> <b>pad,</b> and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] The flashlight in the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off.
