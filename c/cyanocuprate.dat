5000|$|Propargyl methanesulfinates {{are useful}} {{substrates}} for {{the synthesis of}} allenes from stoichiometric organocopper complexes. In this case, the complexes were generated in situ through {{the combination of a}} Grignard reagent, copper(I) bromide, and lithium bromide. Organocopper complexes very often need Lewis acid activation in order to react efficiently; magnesium bromide generated in situ serves as an activating Lewis acid in this case.(7)Alkenylcopper complexes, easily generated through carbocupration, are useful for the introduction of a vinyl group in the β position of a carbonyl compound. In this case, as above, magnesium bromide is serving as an activating Lewis acid.(8)Epoxide opening with organocuprates is highly selective for the less hindered position. Substitution takes place with complete inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon.(9)Generally, organocuprates react with allylic electrophiles in an anti SN2 fashion. In the reaction below, nearly complete inversion of configuration was observed despite the presence of a second stereocenter in the ring.(10)Conjugate addition of organocuprates is widely used in organic synthesis. Vinyl ether cuprates serve as convenient acyl anion equivalents in conjugate addition reactions to enones. The resulting enol ethers can be hydrolyzed to 1,4-diketones, which are difficult to access using conventional carbonyl chemistry.(11)The use of additives in conjunction with a stoichiometric amount of organocopper complexes enhances the rate and yield of many reactions. Organocopper complexes in particular react sluggishly {{in the absence of a}} Lewis acid. Although magnesium bromide generated in situ from the reaction of Grignard reagents and copper(I) halides can serve this role (see above), external Lewis acids are also useful. In the presence of boron trifluoride etherate, organocopper complexes are able to add to sterically congested enones in moderate yield (effecting the same transformation with an organocuprate would be difficult).(12)Boron trifluoride etherate is also useful as an additive in reactions of higher-order cyanocuprates. The use of the 2-thienyl group as a [...] "dummy" [...] substituent in the <b>cyanocuprate</b> conserves the potentially valuable organolithium reagent used to generate the <b>cyanocuprate</b> (as only the dummy group is present in copper-containing byproducts). In the absence of boron trifluoride etherate, no reaction was observed in this case.(13)Conjugate addition reactions of higher-order cyanocuprates represent another useful application for boron trifluoride etherate. The vinyl group is transferred selectively in this reaction; this is in contrast to substitution reactions employing the same reagent, which result in selective transfer of the methyl group.(14) ...|$|E

40|$|The breath-taking {{development}} and the frequent use of organocuprates illustrate their synthetic importance for regio- and diastereoselective carbon-carbon bond formation reactions. Since their discovery by Gilman, organocuprates {{are the focus of}} proceeding studies. Empiric optimization of reaction conditions motivated the clarification of the reaction mechanism, forming the basis for further improvements. A lot of expertise was spent on the structure elucidation of organocuprates in the solid state as well as in solution and identified a dimeric assembly as the reactive species. Based on this structure, theoretical studies on the reaction mechanism predicted different pi- and sigma-intermediates, for which the experimental evidence was provided by NMR spectroscopic investigations. Especially for the square-planar copper(III) intermediate of cross coupling reactions, besides the structural characterization, stabilizing effects of commonly used additives were presented and completed by directed reactions with these intermediate structures. However, to date, structural rearrangements in the copper(III) intermediate as well as the subsequent formation of copper(I) complexes, caused by a changed stoichiometry during the reaction process, were not considered. Therefore, {{the first part of this}} thesis focuses on the NMR spectroscopic investigations of these two important points in cross coupling reactions of organocuprates and alkyl halides. Ligand exchange reactions in the square-planar copper(III) intermediate of a cross coupling reaction have been studied in detail with the help of two dimensional low temperature NMR techniques. In this study, the 12 C/ 13 C isotopic pattern of this intermediate and the corresponding product indicated ligand exchange reactions. Additional investigations on the mechanism of this scrambling identified a further copper(III) complex, which supports an SN 2 -like exchange mechanism instead of a pseudo rotational process. At elevated temperatures similar to synthetic conditions, the product pattern indicated that this ligand exchange is slow compared to reductive elimination, which actually leads to the formation of the desired cross coupling product. Furthermore, for two different copper salts, subsequently formed copper(I) complexes in cross coupling reactions with alkyl halides, caused by a change in the stoichiometry during the course of the reaction, were studied. In the case of copper iodide, the use of sub-stoichiometric ratios of alkyl lithium for the organocuprate formation lead to a variety of new organocopper(I) complexes. NMR investigations suggested cuprate analogue structures with less polarized alkyl moieties. These copper rich complexes were also observed in cross coupling reactions, where they can be formed from the emerging alkyl copper compound and the remaining organocuprate. There, the formation of these copper rich complexes reduces the amount of organocuprate available for the desired cross coupling reaction and hence, leads to diminished yields. It was shown that the formation of these unfavorable copper(I) complexes can be avoided by providing a sufficient amount of alkyl lithium compound, which is able to regenerate the reactive organocuprate, but also promotes side-rections. In contrast, in the case of cyanocuprates, besides the heteroleptic cuprate no further copper rich complexes are formed. Hence, the full amount of homoleptic <b>cyanocuprate</b> is available for the cross coupling reaction, which results in better yields than the respective iodocuprate. This discrepancy between iodo- and cyanocuprates might explain the long-standing myths about the special reactivity of cyanocuprates. Binary alloys, named Zintl phases, are intermetallic structures with heteropolar element-element-bound parts and possess a versatile and fascinating chemistry, ranging from oxidative couplings over the formation of endo- and exohedral and even to intermetalloide clusters. Some of these materials are discussed as attractive cluster-assembled nanomaterials for semiconducting applications. In this context, the electrochemical deposition of a suitable material from solution was demonstrated. However, the knowledge about the solvation of anionic clusters from Zintl phases as well as their stabilities in solution is rather limited, which hampers a targeted material research. Since hetreonuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution presented itself as a powerful method for the structural characterization of Zintl anions of group 15, the second part of this work is about the NMR investigations on the solvation of group 14 polyanions and their stabilities in liquid ammonia. The first NMR detection of the long-time elusive Si 44 − provided the direct evidence for silicides in solution. Furthermore, for the first time the likewise elusive Sn 44 − was detected in solution. Amazingly high signal intensities and stabilities for both highly charged tetrahedranides were observed by utilizing the stabilizing effect of [2. 2. 2]-cryptand. Furthermore, the observation of the generation of NH 2 − enabled the first experimental evidence for the long-standing assumption of solvent molecules as oxidizing agent for Zintl anions and in case of silicides, SiH 3 - was detected as degradation product. Furthermore, the influence of the synthetic route as well as the use of additives during the solvation of polystannides was investigated. With the low temperature synthetic route, in which the polyanions were generated in-situ in solution without additives, the highly charged tetrastannide was obtained. Further investigations addressed the high temperature route, in which the polyanions are precast in the solid state and subsequently dissolved at low temperatures in liquid ammonia. Additive-free solvations indicated a fast oxidation of the highly charged tertrastannide to a less reduced nonastannide. The addition of [2. 2. 2] cryptand to the solvation of Rb 4 Sn 4 enabled not only the mere detection of Sn 44 -, but also allowed for the observation of the first Sn 52 - signal and at least three separated signals of differently salt and solvent coordinated nine-atomic tin clusters. For one of these Sn 9 -clusters, low temperature NMR investigations suggest the freeze of the “diamond-square” process in the conformation of a threefold capped trigonal prism. In further investigations, these polystannides were converted with MesCu. In the absence of [2. 2. 2] cryptand a known interstitial complex, in which copper is encapsulated into the nonastannide was observed, whereas in the presence of [2. 2. 2] cryptand predominantly a new exo-complex of copper with the tetrastannide was detected. This indicates that, in principle, by the choice of suitable conditions, a distinct polystannide can be selected and addressed in targeted reactions. Since the generation of the molecular modification As 4 is a rather time consuming process, which has to be done prior to each conversion of As 4, due to its lack of stability, an alternative storage medium was investigated. The first NMR signal of a As 4 cluster provided the experimental evidence of reversible As 4 binding to a silver cation in this storage medium, which is light stable and can be used for the in-situ generation of molecular arsenic in chemical reactions. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} the long-standing and very {{controversial}} discussion about a special reactivity of cyano- versus iodocuprates concentrated {{on the existence of}} higher-order cuprate structures. Later on numerous structural investigations proved the structural equivalence of iodo and cyano Gilman cuprates and their subsequential intermediates. For dimethylcuprates similar reactivities were also shown. However, the reports about higher reactivities of <b>cyanocuprates</b> survived obstinately in many synthetic working groups. In this study we present an alternative structural difference between cyano- and iodocuprates, which is in agreement with the results of both sides. The key is the potential incorporation of alkyl copper in iodo but not in cyano Gilman cuprates during the reaction. In the example of cuprates with a highly soluble substituent (R = Me 3 SiCH 2) we show {{that in the case of}} iodocuprates during the reaction several copper-rich complexes are formed, which consume additional iodocuprate and provide lower reactivities. To confirm this, a variety of highly soluble copper-rich complexes were synthesized, and their molecular formulas, the position of the equilibriums, their monomers and their aggregation trends were investigated by NMR spectroscopic methods revealing extended iodo Gilman cuprates. In addition, the effect of these copper-rich complexes on the yields of cross-coupling reactions with an alkyl halide was tested, resulting in reduced yields for iodocuprates. Thus, this study gives an explanation for the thus far confusing results of both similar and different reactivities of cyano- and iodocuprates. In the case of small substituents the produced alkyl copper precipitates and similar reactivities are observed. However, iodocuprates with large substituents are able to incorporate alkyl copper units. The resulting copper-rich species have less polarized alkyl groups, i. e. gradually reduced reactivities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{mechanisms}} of organocopper reactions, in particular the reactions with activated alkynes (ynoates and ynones). These reactions are {{of interest in the}} formation of new highly functionalized double bonds with control of the stereochemistry. The solution structures of intermediate complexes and reaction products were determined with the aid of low temperature 13 C NMR spectroscopy and the use of 13 C-labelled substrates. It is shown that. pi. -complexes are formed reversibly between ynoates and t-BuCu(CN) Li before carbon-carbon bond formation. The subsequent reaction products have alkenylcopper or allenolate structures. The substrate, cuprate, solvent and additive all determine which one of these reaction products that predominates in solution. For example, ynoates preferably form alkenylcopper adducts in reactions with Me 2 CuLi·LiI, whereas ynones rather form products with an allenic structure under the same conditions. The adducts formed in reactions with ynoates and Me 2 CuLi·LiI (i. e. the lithium methyl (1 -carboxyalkenyl) cuprates) are mixed cuprates and also give. pi. -complexes upon treatment of an excess ynoate. The equilibration between the E- and Z-alkenylcopper adducts is proposed to proceed via the lithium allenolate. This equilibration could not be detected by 13 C NMR, but its presence is supported indirectly through the observed effect of solvent, LiI and TMSCl. In order to gain further understanding of the mechanism and the dependence on the structure of the reagent, the cuprates used in this thesis were studied by NMR. <b>Cyanocuprates,</b> made from 15 N-labelled copper cyanide in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, were investigated by 15 N NMR at low temperature.

40|$|The phosphatidylinositol {{phosphates}} (PIPns) and inositol phosphates (IPns) are intricately {{involved in}} cell signalling. They bind to {{a vast array}} of proteins, which results in a host of physiological responses. Therefore {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise downstream effects of an individual protein-phosphoinositide interaction. Perturbations of these networks occur in pathological conditions such as cancer and diabetes increasing the need to understand these systems. Receptor-Ligand Engineering (RLE) may provide the tools to map these interactions. Chemical modification of the small PIPn or IPn ligand and complementary mutation of binding site amino acids is used to create a unique protein-ligand binding pair. Once the modified protein is engineered into the cell line, the dose dependent effects of its stimulation with the complementary ligand can be studied in isolation from signal pathway cross-talk. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -diphosphate [PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 / PIP 2] and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate [PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 / PIP 3] analogues with C-alkyl groups replacing the axial inositol C-Hprotons would be suitable ligands for RLE. To date, no such analogues are known in the literature. The key challenges in preparation of such compounds are selective protection and deprotection of the myo-inositol hydroxyls, introduction of new inositol C-substituents with retention of myostereochemistry,and phosphorylation of an unnatural tertiary centre. 4 -C-Alkyl IP 3 and 4 -C-alkyl IP 4 analogues were chosen as targets to explore the chemical limitations of analogue synthesis. Orthoesters simultaneously tied up the 1 -, 3 - and 5 -O differentiating between the remaining three hydroxyls in a rigid structure. Oxidation of the isolated 4 -OH to the inos- 4 -ose and selective reintroduction of the myo-geometry by addition of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide generated the key exo-methylene oxide intermediate. Lithium alkyl <b>cyanocuprates</b> were employed to open the exo-methylene oxide introducing primary, -secondary, and -tertiary alkyl and aryl protrusions. 4 -C-Alkyl triols were prepared by regiocontrolled DIBAL-H reduction of the orthobenzoate to a benzyl ether, directed by the 4 -C-alkyl protrusion. The corresponding 4 -C-alkyltetrols were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the orthobenzoate and cleavage of the resultant benzoate ester. All polyols were then phosphorylated and globally deprotected to generate the final series of 4 -C-alkyl IP 3 and IP 4 analogues. Some initial investigations were also performed to extend this methodology to prepare 4 -and 5 -C-alkyl derivatives from a common precursor.
