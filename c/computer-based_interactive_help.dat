40|$|This {{research}} used {{quantitative and}} qualitative approaches to investigate the effectiveness of <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> imagery strategy and its components to support and enhance the learning of veterinary anatomy. The research also assessed the students 2 ̆ 7 acceptance of the utilization of interactive imagery and their reactions toward the interactive imagery strategy components. Participants were two classes of freshman veterinary students and one class of veterinary technology students. ^ The first study indicated that <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> realistic images, <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> black and white line drawings, and the combination of <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> realistic images and <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> black and white line drawings were effective in learning anatomical structures and to identify them in real specimens. Students showed no preference to learn from interactive black and white drawings alone. ^ Results from the second study reflected strong acceptance and positive attitude toward self-directed computer-based instruction that utilized interactive imagery {{in teaching and learning}} anatomy. Students 2 ̆ 7 perceived interactive imagery as an effective strategy that helped them learn anatomical concepts. They also identified the real images, use of color as part of the labeling format, dynamic labeling, and multiple key views of images as the important characteristics of effective <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> images. ^ In the third study {{there was no significant difference}} between computer-based dynamic labeling and computer-based static labeling in the immediate recall of anatomical information as measured by students 2 ̆ 7 achievement scores. Realistic images, use of color as part of labeling, presence of multiple key views, and dynamic labeling were identified as the important components of <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> imagery. ^ The fourth study indicated that there was no significant difference between <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> imagery and paper-based static imagery in the immediate recall of anatomical information as measured by the students 2 ̆ 7 achievement scores. However, students perceived <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> imagery as a better strategy than paper-based static imagery in the assimilation of anatomical information. Realistic images, use of color as part of labeling format, multiple key views with component emphasis, and dynamic labeling are the important factors that help students learn anatomical concepts. The combinations of realistic images and multiple key views, and realistic images and use of color as part of labeling were the effective important combinations. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{learning}} {{environment for the}} training of communicative competence has to consider the complexity of human experience, since it requires a number of cues that are managed hic et nunc {{in the flow of}} communicative exchange. Therefore, communicative competence has been traditionally considered as a typical face-to-face learning topic. So far, few opportunities exist to learn by experience in an e-{{learning environment}} that can combine user’s practising and experiencing with an adequate scaffolding structure, giving the learner both the opportunity to fail and the opportunity to give sense to the perspectives selected. Recent work on <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> simulations and autonomous agents is offering new opportunities for the training of communicative competence in different contexts. Simulation creates a unique environment for developing and executing communication skills. Moreover, the communicative interaction can be developed and enhanced in a realistic, but non-threatening situation.

40|$|Decision {{support systems}} (DSS) are <b>interactive,</b> <b>computer-based</b> systems <b>helping</b> {{decision-makers}} (individuals and/or groups) to solve various semi-structured and unstructured problems involving multiple attributes, objectives, and goals. The majority of DSS today are either computer implementations of mathematical models (e. g. optimization algorithms) or extensions of database systems and traditional management information systems. More recently, researchers [1, 2, 12] {{have argued that}} the role of DDSs should not be limited to “imposing relatively simple and rigid mathematical (or formal) artifacts on the rich, natural, selforganizing, and knowledge-producing processes of individual and social decision making ” [12]. They have proposed that research in DSS should focus on defining “flexible environments in which learning about a decision situation can take place [1],” i. e. support decision makers (DMs) in recursively redefining their problems and updating their aspirations, until a form of stability (cognitive equilibrium [12]) is obtained. Such an emphasis on learning has led to a different type of “learning-oriented ” DSS [1, 2, 12] to support DMs in incrementally exploring a decision situation and in reaching a cognitive equilibrium while avoiding typical decision-making biases observable in practice. Learning Oriented DSS In operational terms, learning-oriented DSS are symbiotic systems in which the human DM and the computer-based system are viewed as resources in the decision making process.

40|$|In <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> environments {{meant to}} support learning, {{students}} must bring {{a wide range}} of relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities to bear jointly as they solve meaningful problems in a learning domain. To function effectively as an assessment, a computer system must additionally be able to evoke and interpret observable evidence about targeted knowledge {{in a manner that is}} principled, defensible, and suited to the purpose at hand (e. g., licensure, achievement testing, coached practice). This paper concerns the grounding for the design of an <b>interactive</b> <b>computer-based</b> assessment of design and troubleshooting in the domain of computer networking.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the past decade the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) {{stations}} in Taiwan have become open air art galleries: with more prominent and frequent display of various artistic creations in stations, including interactive artworks. However, unlike the audiences in more meticulously choreographed exhibition contexts, those in stations are usually involuntary. New criteria for the creation and evaluation of artworks in these context are necessary to enhance the connection between the audience and the artwork, and to elicit meaningful experience via interactivity. This research aims to uncover the critical factors that can turn an indifferent passenger into an explorative participant, subsequently leading them to obtain meaningful experiences through interaction with <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> artwork. This research focuses on artworks that are permanently installed in the stations, with three case studies conducted in MRT stations forming the backbone of the research. Field observation was the first step in each case study, conducted in order to understand the fundamentals of the interactivity between the passengers and the artworks. This was followed by in-depth interviews with the passengers and three professional interview groups. A critical Analytical Framework was formed throughout {{the course of}} the research, identifying five engaging characteristics: Incentive, Transfer, Accessibility, Play, and Challenge. These five characteristics were eventually reapplied to re-examine the case studies and the content of the interviews with the professionals. The findings of this research articulate how the Analytical Framework can be adopted in future research intended to create the conditions for more meaningful art-interactions. This Analytical Framework will assist artists, designers and researchers in their pre-planning and follow up evaluations of the degree of engagement generated by <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> artworks displayed in transport hubs. The interest that the outcomes of this research has attracted in the field suggests that the framework could be extended to the examination of various <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> artworks in similar public contexts. In this context, the framework would play a valuable role in uncovering a more dynamic paradigm used to illustrate how meaningful experiences can evolve in similar public spaces.

40|$|Abstract Background Decision aids (DA) are tools {{designed}} to help patients make specific and deliberative choices among disease management options. DAs can {{improve the quality of}} decision-making and reduce decisional conflict. An area not covered by a DA is the decision of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to use inhaled steroids which requires balancing the benefits and downsides of therapy. Methods We developed a DA for COPD patients considering inhaled steroid therapy using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, the best available evidence for using inhaled steroid in COPD and the expected utility model. The development process involved patients, pulmonologists, DA developers and decision making experts. We pilot tested the DA with 8 COPD patients who completed an evaluation questionnaire, a knowledge scale, and a validated decisional conflict scale. Results The DA is a <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> tool incorporating four different decision making models. In the first part, the DA provides information about COPD as a disease, the different treatment options, and the benefits and downsides of using inhaled steroids. In the second part, it coaches the patient in the decision making process through clarifying values and preferences. Patients evaluated 10 out of 13 items of the DA positively and showed significant improvement on both the knowledge scale (p = 0. 008) and the decisional conflict scale (p = 0. 008). Conclusion We have developed a <b>computer-based</b> <b>interactive</b> DA for COPD patients considering inhaled steroids serving as a model for other DAs in COPD, in particular related to inhaled therapies.
