50|$|Design, carpentry, fellmongery, {{upholstery}} and colouring are {{the main}} crafts involved {{in the manufacture of}} a <b>club</b> <b>armchair.</b> Each chair is a product of all this combined expertise.|$|E
50|$|The <b>club</b> <b>armchair</b> first {{appeared}} {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with the application of a new padding technique, using double conical springs not only in the seat cushion but also in the backrest and armrests. Coir filling supplemented the suppleness of these springs.|$|E
5000|$|After the Second World War, {{dozens of}} {{different}} shapes appeared. Some have {{stood the test}} of time, such as the [...] "moustache" [...] and the [...] "gendarme’s hat", named after the shape of the backrest. The round shape has become the <b>club</b> <b>armchair’s</b> most emblematic incarnation.|$|R
50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} first run movie theatres in Paris at that time. The design featured a huge curved lobby with stained glass windows leading to the big auditorium which had <b>club</b> <b>armchairs.</b> However, due to two large columns in the auditorium space, the size of the screen was limited.|$|R
5000|$|The {{club was}} {{described}} by Charles Graves, writing of London <b>clubs</b> in Leather <b>Armchairs</b> (1963), as [...] "the only one in London, or possibly {{anywhere else in the}} world, which has a separate room - and a large one at that - devoted solely to backgammon".|$|R
5000|$|In 1890, The Old <b>Armchair</b> <b>Club</b> {{bought the}} paper and made J.D. Bivins editor and publisher; the paper's name was changed to The Stanly News. T. J. Jerome bought the paper in 1893. Editor R.A. Crowell changed the name to [...] The Stanly Enterprise. Bivins bought the paper in 1898.|$|R
60|$|Small, brown, and wrinkled, with {{puckered}} {{eyes and}} alert manner, Lord Roberts {{in spite of}} his sixty-seven years preserves the figure and energy of youth. The active open-air life of India keeps men fit for the saddle when in England they would only sit their <b>club</b> <b>armchairs,</b> and it is hard for any one who sees the wiry figure and brisk step of Lord Roberts to realise that he has spent forty-one years of soldiering {{in what used to be}} regarded as an unhealthy climate. He had carried into late life the habit of martial exercise, and a Russian traveller has left it on record that the sight which surprised him most in India was to see the veteran commander of the army ride forth with his spear and carry off the peg with the skill of a practised trooper. In his early youth he had shown in the Mutiny that he possessed the fighting energy of the soldier to a remarkable degree, but it was only in the Afghan War of 1880 that he had an opportunity of proving that he had rarer and more valuable gifts, the power of swift resolution and determined execution. At the crisis of the war he and his army disappeared entirely from the public ken only to emerge dramatically as victors at a point three hundred miles distant from where they had vanished.|$|R
