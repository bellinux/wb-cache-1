5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
50|$|As air is heated, it expands and {{possesses}} less density (weight {{per unit}} volume) than <b>cooler</b> <b>air.</b> Therefore, the heated air rises and displaces the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> (the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> descends).

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for cold gas reinjection in through-flow and reverse-flow wave rotors having {{a plurality of}} channels formed around a periphery thereof. A first port injects a supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> into the channels. A second port allows the supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to exit the channels and flow to a combustor. A third port injects a supply of hot gas from the combustor into the channels. A fourth port allows the supply of hot gas to exit the channels and flow to a turbine. A diverting port and a reinjection port {{are connected to the}} second and third ports, respectively. The diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting through the second port as reinjection air. The diverting port is fluidly connected to the reinjection port which reinjects the reinjection air back into the channels. The reinjection air evacuates the channels of the hot gas resident therein and cools the channel walls, a pair of end walls of the rotor, ducts communicating with the rotor and subsequent downstream components. In a second embodiment, the second port receives all of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting the channels and the diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> just prior to the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> flowing to the combustor...|$|R
25|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>air</b> is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> There are several different methods of injecting this <b>cooling</b> <b>air,</b> and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|E
25|$|Installation: It is more {{difficult}} to ensure adequate <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> in a buried engine installation or with pusher configurations.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E
5000|$|Thermals {{are caused}} by local {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, or impurity concentration in the vertical. Temperature differences can cause air currents because warmer air is less dense than <b>cooler</b> <b>air,</b> causing the warmer air to appear [...] "lighter." [...] Thus, if the warm air is under the <b>cool</b> <b>air,</b> air currents will form as they exchange places. Air currents are caused because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.|$|R
40|$|The central AC’s {{systems are}} {{installed}} away from building called central plant where water or air {{is to be}} <b>cooled.</b> This <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> not directly supplied to the building rooms. When the <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> cannot be supplied directly from the air conditioning equipment to the space to be cooled, then the ducts are provided. The duct systems carry the <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> from the air conditioning equipment for the proper distribution to rooms and also carry the return air from the room back to the air conditioning equipment for recirculation...|$|R
50|$|An {{evaporative}} cooler (also swamp cooler, desert <b>cooler</b> and wet <b>air</b> <b>cooler)</b> is {{a device that}} <b>cools</b> <b>air</b> through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by exploiting water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> using much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, evaporative <b>cooling</b> of <b>air</b> has {{the added benefit of}} conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of building occupants.|$|R

25|$|The {{gun barrel}} {{was placed in}} a long, large-diameter tube located between the spar and the leading edge. The tube channeled <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> around the barrel and breech, {{exhausting}} out of a slot {{at the rear of the}} wing. The installation was so cramped that parts of the MG 17's breech mechanism extended into an opening created in the flap structure.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to “Cool Power” air intake systems for {{turbocharged}} engines. These systems provide <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> to the turbocharger and engine, instead of the potentially too-warm air from the engine compartment. <b>Cooler</b> intake <b>air</b> is denser, which means that the engine can produce the same power with less fuel. <b>Cooler</b> <b>air</b> also gives the engine more power for applications such as towing heavy loads up driving up steep grades during the summer. <b>Cooler</b> <b>air</b> drawn into the engine compartment lowers the temperature under the hood, which allows plastic, rubber and electronic parts to last longer. Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine.|$|R

50|$|When rain falls {{below the}} cloud base or {{is mixed with}} dry air, it begins to {{evaporate}} and this evaporation process <b>cools</b> the <b>air.</b> The <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground. When the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> approaches the ground, it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst.

The metal pipe shown {{was used in the}} Concorde cockpit to provide <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to the pilots, but its loud tone got it canceled. This whistle is similar in many respects to the hole tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E
25|$|In some engines, {{bleed air}} is also tapped to provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. Bleed air is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed air is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of ADVENT {{is to develop}} an engine that is optimized for several design points, rather than the traditional single point. Instead of having an engine that is designed solely for high speed (like many current fighter engines are) or for high fuel efficiency (like many current commercial engines are), the final ADVENT engine would be designed to operate at both those conditions. Specific goals include reducing average fuel consumption by 25% and reducing the temperature of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> produced by the engine.|$|E

25|$|The XP-13 {{fuselage}} had a corrugated aluminum skin {{built over}} a metal frame; the flying surfaces were also metal-framed, but {{covered with the}} traditional fabric. While designed to use the 600hp Curtiss H-1640-1 Chieftain engine, (a novel 12-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial with the rear cylinders directly behind the front cylinders rather than staggered as normal in a two-row radial) for which the XP-13 incorporated a complex system of baffles to direct <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> over the engine, the engine simply would not stay cool enough, and in September 1930 it was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney SR1340C Wasp of 450hp.

25|$|Still-larger discs {{are used}} for {{railroad}} cars and some airplanes. Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> However, on some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, inboard disc brakes are used. This reduces wear from debris, and also provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery, and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. In contrast, some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling and the brake gets quite hot in a stop, but this is acceptable as there is then time for cooling, and where the maximum braking energy is very predictable.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was introduced with the BMW 801 14-cylinder twin-row radial. Kurt Tank designed a new cooling system for this engine that used a high-speed fan to blow compressed air into channels that carry {{air to the}} middle of the banks, where a series of baffles directed the air over all of the cylinders. This allowed the cowling to be tightly fitted around the engine, reducing drag, while still providing (after a number of experiments and modifications) enough <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to the rear. This basic concept was soon copied by many other manufacturers, and many late-WWII aircraft returned to the radial design as newer and much larger designs began to be introduced. Examples include the Bristol Centaurus in the Hawker Sea Fury, and the Shvetsov ASh-82 in the Lavochkin La-7.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E
25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|E
