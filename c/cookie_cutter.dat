5|$|Until the 21st century, Istiodactylus was {{the only}} known {{pterosaur}} of its kind, and was placed in its own family, Istiodactylidae, within the group Ornithocheiroidea. Istiodactylus differed from other istiodactylids by having a proportionally shorter skull. The distinctive teeth of Istiodactylus indicate {{that it was a}} scavenger that may have used its teeth to sever morsels from large carcasses {{in the manner of a}} <b>cookie</b> <b>cutter.</b> The wings of Istiodactylus may have been adapted for soaring, which would have helped it find carcasses before terrestrial carnivores. Istiodactylus is known from the Wessex Formation and the younger Vectis Formation, which represent river and coastal environments that were shared with various pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the <b>cookie</b> <b>cutter</b> shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Christmas cookies in the United States were {{brought by the}} Dutch in the early 17th century.

5000|$|The cookie is {{especially}} popular around, and usually associated with, Christmas in communities {{with a strong}} Moravian background such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which still maintain the two largest Moravian communities in the United States. Traditionally, prominent homes in the community hosted open houses which contained elaborate Nativity scenes. These scenes were often built around large tree stumps which {{were found in the}} woods near the town. People opened their homes for viewings of these scenes, and offering cookies to guests was {{an important part of the}} tradition. The spice cookies were central to the occasion, but many families also made a sugar cookie which was made with butter and flavored heavily with nutmeg. Families made their own <b>cookie</b> <b>cutters</b> and handed them down to family members. The shapes were primarily farm animals, as part of the Nativity tradition. Families often had a few <b>cookie</b> <b>cutters</b> which were large and intricate and took real skill to cut out and bake.
