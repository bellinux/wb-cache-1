The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were broken down, the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew each got {{a chunk of}} the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The {{temperature}} fields during semi-solid magnesium alloy produced by casting-rolling {{technology has been}} simulated by finite element method {{on the basis of}} ANSYS. The {{temperature fields}} for different conditions were obtained, which is consistent with the experimental results. Results show that there is a high temperature field in the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. The temperature fluctuates from the center to edge of the strip near the entry of the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. but The temperature decreases gradually from the center to edge of the strip near the exit of the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. There are some remarkable effects of the temperature of the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling, the velocity of the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling, the gap of two roll, the cooling of the roll and the diameter of the roll on the temperature field, which are in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Deformation often {{appears in}} {{castings}} during <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment processes, which determines the machining allowance setting and the machining size distribution of product. The paper presents a novel method for integrated simulation of the deformation behavior of castings during <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment processes with a unified finite element model. Firstly, analyze the deformation of castings during casting process with the model containing mold <b>and</b> <b>casting,</b> <b>and</b> update {{the geometry of}} casting after casting process, then analyze the deformation of castings during heat treatment process and the final geometry shape of casting before machining could be obtained. By the method, investigation on the deformation behavior of a hydro turbine blade <b>casting</b> during <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment processes was carried out, and the residual stress distribution and geometry shape of the casting were obtained...|$|R

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews {{with the majority of}} <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with Duncan Wood and Barry Took explained the origins of the show and how it came to be filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary was broadcast on 30 March 1997.|$|E
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} during the casting solidification process includes the heat radiation {{of the high}} temperature <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> the mold, the heat convection between the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> the mold, and the heat conduction inside the <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> from the <b>casting</b> to the mold. In this paper, a formula of time step in simulation of solidification is derived, considering the heat radiation, convection and conduction based on the conservation of energy. The different {{heat transfer}} conditions between the conventional sand <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> the permanent mold casting {{are taken into account}} in this formula. The characteristics of heat transfer in the interior and surface of the casting are also considered. The numerical experiments show that this formula can avoid computational dispersion, and improve the computational efficiency by about 20 % in the simulation of solidification process...|$|R

5|$|According to the producer, Tom Welling, {{he states}} that the reason of {{cancellation}} {{was due to the}} change of CW president of entertainment from Dawn Ostroff to Mark Pedowitz.

5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, the <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow {{more time with the}} same <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E

Acorn Antiques has been revived many times: firstly, Mrs Overall briefly returned in 1992's Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast. Secondly, Acorn Antiques was briefly brought back for an episode in 2001, featuring the original <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> Nick Frost as an armed robber. In 2005 it was revived by Wood as a West End theatre production , starring the original <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> directed by Trevor Nunn.
