He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.|$|E

Parallel to variations in the <b>corporate</b> <b>interest</b> rate, the cost of debt varies with respect to changes in the parameters. For example, when the level of EBIT flow falls, the bankruptcy threshold comes closer and default risk increases, so the fair <b>corporate</b> <b>interest</b> rate must rise. However, the relative proportion a of the risk premium with respect to the yield spread stays within a quite narrow range, 63 %– 73 % for the investment-grade firm and 37 – 52 % for the highly leveraged firm.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. Brundage believed the lobby of <b>corporate</b> <b>interests</b> would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.|$|E

Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by <b>corporate</b> <b>interests,</b> including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E

The original research consists of in-depth interviews with 12 machine learning researchers working in both academia and industry. Building on theory from science, technology and society studies, this dissertation problematizes the traditional narratives of the neoliberalization of academic research by allowing the researchers themselves to discuss how their career choices, working environments and interactions with others in the field have been affected by the reinvigorated <b>corporate</b> <b>interest</b> of recent years.

The vision on climate change, among other strategic issues, is expressed in annual CEO letters. This study applies a content analysis approach to review 1000 annual reports from European publicly‐traded companies published in years 2000 through 2008. The content analysis of the CEO letters indicate that: (a) <b>corporate</b> <b>interest</b> in the climate change was nearly nonexistent prior to 2004; (b) the greatest interest in the issues was shown in 2007, but since then interest has declined; and (c) meanwhile interest in external economic conditions doubled in 2008 compared to 2006. In summary, our findings raise questions as to whether <b>corporate</b> <b>interest</b> in climate change issues already has peaked, even as well adapted by industry as can be reasonably expected, or if environmental interest will rise again after the current global financial crisis is over.
