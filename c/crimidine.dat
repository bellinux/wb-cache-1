5000|$|<b>Crimidine</b> is a {{promiscuous}} compound. It {{effects and}} inhibits various receptors and even corrupts some naturally occurring biochemicals. One {{of the main}} problems with <b>crimidine</b> is that it inhibits vitamin B6, which {{is used in the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids. This is due to the pyrimidine ring that both compounds contain. Although, the exact mechanism of how <b>crimidine</b> antagonizes vitamin B6 is unknown. Another major problem with <b>crimidine</b> is its effect on acetylcholinesterase, it serves as an antagonist.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{cases with}} human {{poisoning}} via <b>crimidine</b> is small, several cases exist with curing rats, dogs, and other various mammals. In many cases pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) {{has been used}} to treat <b>crimidine</b> poisioning.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crimidine</b> is a {{fast acting}} convulsant, with an LD50 of 5mg/kg. Earliest {{symptoms}} can develop within 20-40 minutes. These symptoms can include burning, irritation, and itching {{at the site}} of exposure or intake. Following these initial symptoms, convulsions follow and can be fatal. Low dose, long-term exposure can lead to damage in the central nervous system, resulting in muscle stiffness, restlessness, and sensitivity to light and noise. [...] Although <b>crimidine</b> is fast acting, it is also quickly secreted and can pass through the system in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crimidine</b> is a convulsant poison {{used as a}} rodenticide. <b>Crimidine</b> was {{originally}} known by its product name, Castrix. It {{was originally}} produced in the 1940s by the conglomerate, IG Farben. [...] It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. It is also no longer used in the United States as a rodenticide, but is still used to this day in other countries.|$|E
50|$|The serine residue, {{which is}} part of the acetylcholinesterase, acts a {{nucleophile}} and eventually replaces the chlorine group that is present in <b>crimidine.</b> Unlike when acetylcholine does this, the resulting serine-crimidine bond does not easily hydrolyze, causing a more permanent complex. This in turn disrupts the acetylcholine from degrading as it normally would.|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} two series of control {{experiments}} against the voles, Microtus agrestis and Arvicola terrestris, are reported. In {{a series of}} field experiments in the 1970 s, three acute toxicants (zinc phosphide, <b>crimidine</b> and difluorpropanol) were tested against Microtus. Difluorpropanol (Gliftor) {{was found to be}} the most effective, but no ready-made bait containing it was available. The performance of the <b>crimidine</b> bait (Kastrix) was good enough to fulfill the registration requirements, while the zinc phosphide bait (Myrax) failed to give acceptable results. In the second series (early 1980 s) a brodi-facoum bait (Klerat) was found to be as efficacious as the <b>crimidine</b> bait (Kastrix) against Microtus, and sufficiently effective against Arvicola, on which the <b>crimidine</b> bait does not work. The experiments with bromadiolone (Arvicolon) and flupropadine (M 2 Ì† 6 B 36, 892) against Microtus were discouraging; against Arvicola they were promising, though not yet conclusive. In future research, special attention should be paid not only to the screening of potential toxicants and bait formulations, but also {{to the study of the}} basic differences in the reactions of even closely related species to the baits and their active ingredients, as well as to the compensatory demographic responses of the target pest populations in cases of suboptimal performance of the bait in the field...|$|E
40|$|Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) is a co-factor in many enzymatic {{pathways}} {{involved in}} amino acid metabolism: the main biologically active form is pyridoxal 5 -phosphate. Pyridoxine {{has been used}} as an antidote in acute intoxications, including isoniazid overdose, Gyromitra mushroom or false morrel (monomethylhydrazine) poisoning and hydrazine exposure. It is also recommended as a co-factor to improve the conversion of glyoxylic acid into glycine in ethylene glycol poisoning. Other indications are recommended by some sources (for example <b>crimidine</b> poisoning, zipeprol and theophylline-induced seizures, adjunct to d-penicillamine chelation), without significant supporting data. The value of pyridoxine or its congener metadoxine as an agent for hastening ethanol metabolism or improving vigilance in acute alcohol intoxication is controversial. This paper reviews the various indications of pyridoxine in clinical toxicology and the supporting literature. The potential adverse effects of excessive pyridoxine dosage will also be summarized.
