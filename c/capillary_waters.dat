Waste water treatment generates as much as 70 g of dry solids per capita per day. Although one of the disposal solutions for this waste is through incineration, still almost 30 % of sludge solids remain as ash. This paper presents results related to reuse {{of sewage sludge}} ash in concrete. The sludge was characterised for chemical composition (X-ray flourescence analysis), crystalline phases (X-ray diffraction analysis) and pozzolanic activity. The effects of incineration on crystal phases of the dry sludge were investigated. Two water/cement (W/C) ratios (0. 55 and 0. 45) and three sludge ash percentages (5 %, 10 % and 20 %) per cement mass were used as filler.

40|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>water</b> in peatlands {{has a very}} {{important}} role in supplying water to the root zone of plants. The current water content in the root zone depends mainly on groundwater levels in some areas with shallow water levels. The study aimed to measure the <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> dynamics in peat soils at various soil densities and groundwater levels which were observed from the changes in peat color, moisture distribution, water content and hydrophobicity of peat soil. The study was conducted in the greenhouse of Indonesian Swampland Agricultural Research Institute, Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the bulk density (BD) of peat, namely BD- 1 (on actual condition, 0. 1 g cm- 3) and BD- 2 (compressed into 0. 2 g cm- 3). The second factor was simulated groundwater levels (GWL) consisting of GWL- 1 (- 100 cm), GWL- 2 (- 70 cm) and GWL- 3 (- 40 cm) from soil surfaces. The results showed that the rise of <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> in peat soil reached a maximum height of 50 cm which was characterized by the increase in water content at the top layer in the range of 105 – 127 % for BD- 1 and 141 – 181 % for BD- 2.

These characteristics are examined by monitoring mass change using the conventional gravimetric method and by obtaining water content profiles using nondestructive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques during <b>capillary</b> imbibition of <b>water.</b> Here, three different gypsum samples are investigated: one non-aerated reference gypsum sample and two aerated gypsum samples produced with different volumetric air fractions. The <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption into the reference sample follows t 1 / 2 kinetics (Fickian diffusion), where t is the time of ingress. However, in the aerated gypsum samples there are deviations from t 1 / 2 kinetics. The MRI results show unambiguously that two wetting fronts advance through the aerated structure; an observation that cannot be made from the gravimetric data alone. The water content profiles of the aerated gypsum samples are therefore analysed by treating them as the sum of two separate absorption processes using Sharp Front (SF) analysis. The <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption properties of this material are well described as a parallel combination of fast absorption into fine matrix pores and slow absorption into a modified structure of matrix pores inter-connected to air voids introduced into the slurry by aeration.
