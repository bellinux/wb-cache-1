5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{report also}} <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no {{credible}} evidence that Bernard Nussbaum testified falsely {{about not having}} discussed Livingstone's hiring with the First Lady, and found as well {{that there was no}} personal relationship between the First Lady and Livingstone that had formed the basis for his hiring.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E

5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Allies possessed little {{intelligence}} on western New Britain's terrain and {{the exact location}} of Japanese forces, so they flew extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats. A team from Special Service Unit No. 1 reconnoitered Arawe on the night of 9/10December and <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were few Japanese troops in the area. The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.|$|E
5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common A.gallica.|$|E

5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published {{on the front page}} of the Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E
5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.|$|E
5|$|Lord Runciman {{continued}} his work, attempting {{to pressure the}} Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was no point in}} attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.|$|E

5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, {{it was announced that}} the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{declared}} a police intervention against terrorists, {{the local media}} quickly questioned the officers' testimonies {{as well as the}} only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.|$|E
5|$|The TV rights {{agreement}} between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, {{and a number of}} court cases have arisen as a result. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position. In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.|$|E

5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were more pressing needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want}} to prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
