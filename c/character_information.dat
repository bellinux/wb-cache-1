5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important <b>character</b> <b>information</b> and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E

500|$|The final trailer was [...] "unlocked" [...] by fans on March 4, 2015, via {{the use of}} hashtags on Twitter, {{ahead of}} its {{broadcast}} debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5. Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and <b>character</b> <b>information</b> between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled."

500|$|While outside combat, {{players can}} breed chocobos, {{recurring}} galliform {{birds in the}} Final Fantasy series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map {{and take them to}} a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, <b>character</b> <b>information,</b> in-game lore and special video clips. Moogles, another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by non-player characters (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to a wider range of shops. After completing the game once, players unlock a [...] "New Game+" [...] option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions. Type-0 features three difficulty levels; [...] "normal", [...] "hard", and [...] "impossible".|$|E

They were all interrogated, and in particular, Lieutenant Colonel Takenaga was transported to Manila for a detailed interrogation. As well as giving <b>character</b> <b>information</b> about the commanders of the 18th Army, Takenaga gave his opinion of how the Allies should deal with Emperor Hirohito: [...] "If the Emperor is killed then the Japanese people will resist until the bitter end, {{but if there is}} an order from the Emperor then they will probably surrender peacefully." [...] In preparation for interrogation, the soldiers in Takenaga's unit had invented false personal and unit names before their surrender, but from documents seized in Wewak District the Australian Army recognised these as falsehoods. Some of the prisoners also helped with translation of seized documents and with propaganda broadcasts urging the Japanese Army to surrender.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2016, Gunn, Pratt {{and other}} members of the cast {{attended}} San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film, showing footage and revealing additional <b>character</b> <b>information.</b> On October 19, a [...] "sneak peek" [...] teaser was released ahead of the first full teaser trailer. Ethan Anderton of /Film felt the teaser was strong, despite not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot, while The A.V. Clubs Esther Zuckerman called it [...] "an immediate crowd-pleaser". According to media-measurement firm comScore and its PreAct service, the teaser was the top trailer for the week it released, generating 108,000 new social media conversations. In early December, before Gunn revealed the first teaser trailer at Comic Con Experience 2016, he said that finding scenes and moments to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted in hard choices, since [...] "people really go through every single little shot and try to figure out what the movie's about. And there's a lot of mysteries in Guardians 2." [...] Describing the teaser trailer, Jacob Hall of /Film felt, [...] "It's telling that this trailer can get away without actually selling the plot of the movie. Audiences didn't fall in love with the first Guardians of the Galaxy because they were entranced by yet another Marvel Studios movie built around a villain who gets his hands on an Infinity Stone…the bulk of this trailer is dedicated to this group bouncing off one another, which is the real star attraction." [...] The teaser trailer had 81 million views in 24 hours, becoming the second-most viewed teaser behind Beauty and the Beast and largest Marvel Studios teaser ever. Additionally, Sweet's [...] "Fox on the Run" [...] reached number one on the iTunes Rock Chart after featuring in the teaser.|$|E
