40|$|In the coated fabrics, {{the textile}} {{component}} provides such the mechnical properties as tensile strength and elongation, and the resin component plays a roll for {{protection against the}} environment to which the fabric is subjected. The changes in the mechanical property of woven fabric caused by <b>coating</b> <b>finish</b> are discussed in this study. Plain weave fabrics are calendered and then coated with polyurethane or acrylic resin {{on one side of}} it. The tensile, shearing and bending properties of the fabrics are measured. Each property is compared with that of original fabric. The summary of results is shown as follows. (1) The anisotropy of tensile property in plain weave fabric is reduced significantly after coating with a thin layer of resin. (2) The <b>coating</b> <b>finish</b> increases remarkably shear and bending rigidities of the base fabric.

40|$|Abstract: A semi-implicit Taylor-Galerkin/pressure-correction {{algorithm}} of {{a transient}} finite element form {{is applied to}} analyse the flow instabilities that commonly arise during reverse-roller coating. A mathematical model is derived to describe the solvent coating applied to {{the underside of the}} sheet, assuming that the lacquer is a Newtonian fluid and considering the flow between application roller and foil. Here, we have investigated the effects of temporal instabilities, caused by adjustment of nip-gap width and foil-position, extending our previous steady-state analysis. Foil shifting is found to have a significant influence upon pressure and lift on the foil, drag on the roller, and free coating profiles. This would result in process instabilities, such as chatter and flow-lines. In contrast, nip-gap adjustment has no influence on the <b>coating</b> <b>finish...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enamelled wire is a {{conductive}} wire {{coated with}} a very thin layer of insulation, widely used in the field that requires tight coils of wire. The traditional enamelled wire is produced by liquid paint, which consists of resins, solvents, pigments, and additives. Organic solvent takes a relatively high content, normally of 75 % to 90 % by weight. Many efforts {{have been made to}} decrease the percentage of solvent in the insulation paint. On the other hand, increasing the solids content of given enamel results in the viscosity rises significantly, making it harder to flow. Therefore, powder coating technology as an alternative is developed in the production of enamelled wire, not only benefits the environment but also cuts cost of solvent. Mechanical and chemical methods to prepare the fine powder of PVF type enamelled wire coating are reported in this thesis. For gradual solvent evaporation method, kinetics and thermodynamics of the fabrication of microspheres are adopted from reference to predict the operating parameters, such as the solidification time. Factors affecting average particle size and particle size distribution are investigated as well. Phase ratio of emulsion system (DP/CP), emulsion agitation speed, types and dosage of emulsifier, co-solvent and stabilizer are all taken into account. When the DP/CP was 1 / 15, the resins percentage in DP was 12 wt%, the stirring speed was 6000 r/min, 1 wt% SDS was used as emulsifier, 1 wt% N-octanol and 0. 5 wt% PVA were employed as co-solvent and stabilizer, the powder of average particle size at around 12 micron can be obtained. Initial PVF enamelled wire coating formulation, as adopted from references of liquid insulation paint, which consists of PVF-E resin, novolac epoxy resin and melamine resin, produced a non-continuous <b>coating</b> <b>finish</b> with many tiny holes formed during curing. This may be attributed to the thermal properties of PVF-E resin or the inappropriate ratio among the different components in the formulation. After that BPA epoxy and its hardener were introduced to the initial formulation to improve the surface quality of <b>coating</b> <b>finish.</b> Then, the paint formulation, powder spraying and curing conditions are optimized. The recommended formulation is with mole ratio of PVF-K, OCFER and melamine resin at 100 : 375 : 119, and with proper dosage of degassing and flow agent. The best spraying condition is gun voltage of 30 kV and air stream of 3. 0 m/s. When the curing temperature ranged from 215 to 225 ℃, and the substrates were pre-treated, the number of defects on coating film was reduced...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from January 24, 2017 - December 1, 2017 Spalting fungi show strong potential as natural colorants {{on a variety of}} materials, specifically textiles and wood. Four species of spalting fungi are currently utilized in this manner: Scytalidium cuboideum, which produces a red pigment called draconin red, Scytalidium ganodermophthorum, that produces an unknown yellow pigment, and Chlorociboria aeruginosa and Chlorociboria aeruginascens, that both produce a blue-green pigment known as xylindein. This research expanded the known spalting fungi through surveys in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest, and found similarities with temperate fungi in terms of classification (orders such as the Helotiales and Xylariales and genera, such as Scytalidium and Xylaria). Extracts from known spalting fungi were also tested on a new substrate, bamboo, and performed well as a top <b>coating</b> <b>finish.</b> Finally, microscopic analysis of the known spalting fungal pigments with light microscopy (LM), confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) showed evidence that the extracted pigments bind to the materials where they are applied, although the type of structures formed when adhering to the substrate surface varies by species. Interestingly, the S. cuboideum pigment showed crystal-like structures. These were confirmed with a Kikuchi diffraction test and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to be an organic crystal. An X-ray diffraction test is required to obtain detailed information about this crystal, but this crystal is likely novel to science, {{and one of the few}} naphthoquinone organic crystals produced by a microorganism. The work herein represents a detailed analysis of the physical structure and binding ability of pigments extracted from spalting fungi—information which may be of use to manufacturers interested in replacing synthetic colorants with natural ones. The research also increases the number of known spalting fungi, and continued research in this field should lead to additional colors being available for extraction and study in the future...|$|E

40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> systems was also studied. These <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. <b>Finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear <b>coat,</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of <b>finish</b> <b>coats,</b> the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R
