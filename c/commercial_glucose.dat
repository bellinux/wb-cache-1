50|$|Glucose is {{produced}} commercially via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Many crops {{can be used}} as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, corn husk and sago are all used {{in various parts of the}} world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Most <b>commercial</b> <b>glucose</b> occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical. Glucose syrup, also known as corn syrup, is essentially a purified aqueous solution of saccharides obtained from edible starch that has a dextrose equivalency (DE) of 20 or more. Dried corn syrup is glucose syrup with the water removed. Glucose has a DE of 100; dried maltodextrin has a DE of less than 20. Corn syrup itself has a DE between 20 and 95.|$|E

30|$|During {{the process}} of sodium {{gluconate}} fermentation by A. niger, batch fermentation is generally adopted for <b>commercial</b> production. <b>Glucose,</b> {{as one of the}} key substrates in sodium gluconate fermentation, has a dual role of providing the required carbon source and increasing the environmental osmotic pressure.

On the other hand, for high sodium gluconate titer, high initial glucose concentration and continuous addition of neutralizer (NaOH) to maintain suitable environmental pH are considered to result in strong osmotic stress.

In addition, many lignocellulosic materials contain considerable amounts of five-carbon sugars which are not easily fermented to ethanol. The possibility of improving the cost-intensive steps was investigated. The steam pre-treatment of a fast-growing species of Salix (Q 082) was optimized with respect to treatment time and temperature, to give the best glucose yield after enzymatic hydrolysis. It was found that the semi-continuous production of cellulolytic enzymes with Trichoderem reesei Rutgers C 30 in an aqueous two-phase system (an extractive fermentation system) increased the amount of recoverable enzyme activity compared with a batch process.

40|$|Introduction A {{biosensor}} may {{be described}} as a sensor incorporating a biological element such as an enzyme, antibody, nucleic acid, microorganism or cell. A biosensor should exhibit both shelf-stability and operation stability. Compatible solutes from hyperthermophilic bacteria, called hypersolutes, are very efficient for the preservation of the performance {{of a wide variety of}} biomaterials; ranging from proteins to whole cells and artificial tissues. The overall objectives of this work have been to investigate the application of hypersolutes to enhance the performance of biosensors based on the stabilization properties offered by hypersolutes compounds, particularly with respect to storage and operational lifetime. Materials and Methods The stabilizing agents considered for this study were firoin, firoin A, ectoine®, hydroxyectoine, diglycerol phosphate (DGP) and potassium mannosyl-lactate (PML), provided either by Bitop AG (Witten, D) or StabVida (Oeiras, P). The following enzymes were selected due to their <b>commercial</b> importance: <b>Glucose</b> oxidase (GOx), alcohol oxidase (AOx), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). On immunosensors, a model system was first designed using ELISA tests. The influence of hypersolutes was then studied using BIAcore.

40|$|Here {{we present}} {{two types of}} all-printable, highly stretchable, and {{inexpensive}} devices based on platinum (Pt) -decorated graphite for glucose determination in physiological fluids. Said devices are: a non-enzymatic sensor and an enzymatic biosensor, the latter showing promising results. Glucose has been quantified by measuring hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) reduction by chronoamperometry at − 0. 35 V (vs pseudo-Ag/AgCl) using glucose oxidase immobilized on Pt-decorated graphite. The sensor performs well for the quantification of glucose in phosphate buffer solution (0. 25 M PBS, pH 7. 0), with a linear range between 0 mM and 0. 9 mM, high sensitivity and selectivity, and a low limit of detection (LOD). Thus, it provides an alternative non-invasive and on-body quantification of glucose levels in human perspiration. This biosensor has been successfully applied on real human perspiration samples and results also show a significant correlation between glucose concentration in perspiration and glucose concentration in blood measured by a <b>commercial</b> <b>glucose</b> meter.

40|$|A mediatorless glucose {{biosensor}} {{was developed}} by the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) to graphene-functionalized glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The surface of GCE was functionalized with graphene by incubating it with graphene dispersed in 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which acted both as a dispersion agent for graphene and as an amine surface modification agent for GCE and graphene. This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1 -ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking. The developed biosensor used a redox potential of 2 ̆ 2120. 45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for detecting glucose in the diabetic pathophysiological range 0. 52 ̆ 01332 mM. There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood <b>glucose</b> in <b>commercial</b> artificial blood <b>glucose</b> linearity standards in the range 1. 42 ̆ 01327. 9 mM. Therefore, it is ideal for diabetic blood glucose monitoring. The developed bioanalytical procedure for preparation of GOx-bound graphene-functionalized GCEs had high production reproducibility and high storage stability, which is appropriate for the commercial mass production of enzyme-bound electrodes.

40|$|Part 21 : Electronics: ApplicationsInternational audienceGlucose sensing is {{an issue}} with great {{interest}} in medical and biological applications. One possible approach to glucose detection takes advantage of measuring changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent donor and an acceptor within a protein which undergoes glucose-induced changes in conformation. This demands the detection of fluorescent signals in the visible spectrum. In this paper we analyzed the emission spectrum obtained from fluorescent labels attached to a protein which changes its conformation {{in the presence of}} <b>glucose</b> using a <b>commercial</b> spectrofluorometer. Different <b>glucose</b> nanosensors were used to measure the output spectra with fluorescent signals located at the cyan and yellow bands of the spectrum. A new device is presented based on multilayered a-SiC:H heterostructures to detect identical transient visible signals. The transducer consists of a p-i’(a-SiC:H) -n/p-i(a-Si:H) -n heterostructure optimized for the detection of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores with excitation in the violet (400 nm) and emissions in the cyan (470 nm) and yellow (588 nm) range of the spectrum. Results show that the device photocurrent signal measured under reverse bias and using appropriate steady state optical bias, allows the separate detection of the cyan and yellow fluorescence signals. presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} characterization of maltodextrin DP 3 - 9 (produced by enzymatic hydrolysis and membrane separation process) as compared to <b>commercial</b> maltodextrin and <b>glucose</b> and assessment of its potential application as carbohydrate source in sport drink. The research showed that application of maltodextrin DP 3 - 9 had some advantages as compared to glucose with regard to absorption rate that was 2 times longer (60 minutes instead of 30 minutes), osmolality degree that was 5, 6 times lower (178 mOsmol/kg as compared to 1000 mOsmol/kg), and relative sweetness degree that was 10 - 11 times lower (6, 15 - 7, 20 as compared to 57, 00 - 61, 00). However, thie application of maltodekstrin DP 3 - 9 had limitation which was shown by its viscosity characteristic that was 5, 70 [...] 6, 20 % higher (1, 29 cSt and 1, 37 cSt as compared to 1, 22 cSt and 1, 29 cSt). When compared to commercial maltodextrin, maltodextrin DP 3 - 9 is favorable as carbohydrate source in sport drink based on its absorption rate {{that was more than}} 2 times faster (60 minutes as compared to more than 120 minutes) and storage stability at refrigeration temperature (which was more than 8 weeks, with or without sterilization; with sterilization) ...|$|R
