2500|$|In 1873 Jones rebuilt no. 10 as a 4-4-0 to <b>counter</b> <b>flange</b> wear {{problems}} on the Dingwall & Skye line. He used the Adams bogie arrangement and replaced the cylinders with new ones of [...] bore and stroke. This engine was effectively the prototype for the F Class built from 1874 onwards. In 1875 a second locomotive (no. 7) was similarly rebuilt, although this {{seems to have been}} a trial for new features adopted for the Skye bogies. The other 5 locomotives of this batch remained as 2-4-0s but were rebuilt with cabs and longer ( [...] stroke) cylinders between 1875 and 1880. All were withdrawn between 1893 and 1899.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{accelerating}} gradients of 15 - 25 MV/m with the superconducting cavi-ties in the TESLA Test Facility, considerable effort is put into preparing the cavities and the auxiliary components to avoid field emission due to particle contamination. The particle cleanliness has to be preserved throughout the whole assembly procedure of the cavities. Most crucial is the mounting of the flange connections which have to be UHV-leaktight with the cavities immersed in superfluid helium. In the present design, the niobium cavities are fabricated with Nb sealing surfaces with a thickness of 3 mm. Split stainless steel rings and spring-type gaskets (Helicoflex) are used to provide UHV-tight connections to the stainless steel <b>counter</b> <b>flanges.</b> This design has several disadvantages. The gaskets can not be prop-erly made “particle-free ” and {{the handling of the}} split flanges may contaminate the cavities during assembly. Moreover, the sealing surfaces of the Nb cavities get quite soft during the 1400 ˚C heat treatment, which often results in leak problems due to plastic deformations. An alternative approach are NbTi-flanges directly welded to the Nb cavities. They should allow an easier assembly of the <b>counter</b> <b>flanges.</b> Various types of spring-less gaskets are under investigation and the results will be presented. ...|$|R
