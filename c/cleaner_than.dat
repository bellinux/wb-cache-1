5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E

25|$|Propane autogas is a {{domestically}} produced {{alternative fuel}} which {{costs less than}} conventional fuels. Over the past 30 years, propane autogas has cost, on average, 30 percent less than gasoline and 40 percent less than diesel. More than 90 percent is produced in the U.S. (and an additional 7 percent from Canada), which lessens American dependency on foreign oil. The fuel burns substantially <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> gasoline or diesel.|$|E

25|$|The Trabant 1100 (also {{known as}} the P1100) was a 601 with a better-performing 1.05-liter, 45HP VW Polo engine. With a more-modern look (including a {{floor-mounted}} gearshift), it was quieter and <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor. The 1100 had front disc brakes, and its wheel assembly was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced between from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1100.|$|E

The river remains vulnerable to these pollution events, such as the one that occurred in October 2009 when an accidental release of cyanide from a factory into the sewer system in Stoke-on-Trent, affected the treatment works at Strongford. This resulted in the release of raw sewage and the chemical into the river, killing thousands of fish, and posing a health risk to river users as far south as Burton.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to heavy}} pollution, the East River is {{dangerous}} to people who fall in or attempt to swim in it, although as of mid-2007 the water was <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> {{it had been in}} decades. As of 2010, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) categorizes the East River as Use Classification I, meaning it is safe for secondary contact activities such as boating and fishing. According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just as it does in the Hudson River {{on the other side of}} Manhattan. That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} vehicle owners was {{conducted}} in New York State and California to explore the potential target market for methanol in the household sector. Data were collected on revealed and reported premium gasoline purchase behavior and willingness to pay for cleaner fuels and more power. We found that drivers {{are willing to pay}} slightly more for <b>cleaner</b> fuels <b>than</b> for more power, although we do not interpret this to mean that when confronted at a fuel pump with two choices, one fuel cleaner but more expensive than the other, a motorist would select the more expensive cleaner-burning fuel. We found that income is not an important variable in predicting the purchase of cleaner fuels and that female drivers and Californians are willing to spend more on <b>cleaner</b> fuels <b>than</b> are male drivers and New Yorkers, respectively. Current premium gasoline users are willing to pay more for additional power and <b>cleaner</b> fuels <b>than</b> are regular gasoline users, indicating that premium gasoline users are likely to be initial buyers of methanol fuel and methanol-powered vehicles...|$|R

25|$|A final consideration, {{especially}} for the Great Plains Project, {{was the use of}} methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 had to be very large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel tankage, and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul liquified natural gas, using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) was an obvious choice. Methane burns much <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the look}} for Smallville came from Millar, {{who wanted the}} epitome of [...] "Smalltown, USA". Construction {{coordinator}} Rob Maier explained, [...] "It had to be <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> clean, nicer than nice, more beautiful {{than it would be}} in the real world. All of the people in Smallville are beautiful; all of the colors are bright and sharp." [...] For the Kent farm, Nutter wanted to have [...] "an old world sensibility and tone". For the pilot, the production crew only built a kitchen and dining room to represent the Kent home. All the exterior shots of the farm were taken at the Andalinis farm, owned by a local couple who also gave the crew permission to paint their forest green house yellow. Since the Vancouver farm already had a barn, the production crew only had to build a loft with stairs leading up to it.|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists in many {{different}} styles. Elvis Presley used the song in a large dance scene in his 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and released it as a single with the title song on the B-side. It became a gold record. Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, the Big Three, Eddie Cochran, Bobby Darin, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Nancy Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Trini Lopez, Roy Orbison, Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash and June Carter, Rare Earth and The Ronettes all put their own style on the song. [...] Checkmates, Ltd. released {{a version of the}} song as part of a medley on their 1967 debut album, Live! At Caesar's Palace. [...] Jerry Lee Lewis found particular success with his rendition in 1961, which peaked at number 30 and spent eight weeks on the charts. Charles noticed, later writing [...] "I saw that many of the stations which had banned the tune started playing it when it was covered by white artists. That seemed strange to me, as though white sex was <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> black sex. But once they began playing the white version, they lifted the ban and also played the original." [...] In 2001 the italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari sampled part of the melody for his song Porca l'oca, included in the album Shake.|$|E
40|$|Geographical {{variation}} {{in the outcome of}} interspecific interactions has a range of proximate ecological causes. For instance, cleaning interactions between coral reef fishes can result in benefits for both the cleaner and its clients. However, because both parties can cheat and because the rewards of cheating may depend on the local abundance of ectoparasites on clients, the interaction might range from exploitative to mutualistic. In a comparative analysis of behavioural measures of the association between the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and all its client species, we compared cleaning interactions between two sites on the Great Barrier Reef that differ with respect to mean ectoparasite abundance. At Heron Island, where client fish consistently harbour fewer ectoparasites, client species that tended to pose for cleaners were more likely to receive feeding bites by <b>cleaners</b> <b>than</b> client species that did not pose for cleaners. This was not the case at Lizard Island, where ectoparasites are significantly more abundant. Client fish generally spent more time posing for cleaners at Lizard Island than their conspecifics at Heron Island. However, fish at Heron Island were inspected longer on average by <b>cleaners</b> <b>than</b> conspecifics at Lizard Island, and they incurred more bites and swipes at their sides per unit time from cleaners. These and other differences between the two sites suggest that the local availability of ectoparasites as a food source for cleaners may determine whether clients will seek cleaning, and whether cleaners will feed on parasites or attempt to feed on client mucus. The results suggest that cleaning symbiosis is a mosaic of different outcomes driven by geographical differences in the benefits for both participants...|$|R

Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of eye candy with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you {{have a pretty good idea}} what this one looks like."

500|$|In September 2014 the UCS {{published}} an updated analysis of its 2012 report. The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer [...] equivalent emissions per mile {{than the most}} efficient hybrid. The UCS study found several reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. The 2014 study used electric-utility emissions based on EPA's 2010 estimates, but since coal use nationwide is down by about 5% from 2010 to 2014, actual efficiency in 2014 is better than estimated in the UCS study. Second, electric vehicles have become more efficient, as the average 2013 all-electric vehicle used 0.33 kWh per mile, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. Also, some new models are <b>cleaner</b> <b>than</b> the average, such as the BMW i3, which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. An i3 charged with power from the Midwest grid would be as clean as a gasoline-powered car with about , up from [...] for the average electric car in the 2012 study. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to [...] equivalent from [...] in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a [...] gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.|$|E
