40|$|The role of {{government}} policies in achieving gender equality in leadership is increasingly being questioned. Scholars argue public policies often fail to overcome such adversities {{because of lack of}} understanding of the ‘sexual politics’ within organizations where gender is ‘relational, contested and always political’. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to determine the effectiveness of Australian policies with regard to promoting more women into key managerial/executive personnel positions. The paper involves a <b>cross-country</b> <b>review</b> of literatures regarding the interrelationship between public policy interface and the gender order of a society. It has also utilised unrefined primary data gleaned from interviews with Australian working women aged between 25 and 45. The findings suggest gender equality legislation and work/life balance policies are not proving effective in developing more gender equal dual earner/carer household model. Moreover, equal opportunity is yet to be universal. The consequences, thus, are a thicker glass-ceiling, wider gender pay gap and slipping or stagnant growth of female participation in leadership roles. The paper argues that persistent stereotypical gender division of labour as well as societal attitude towards ‘legitimate differences’ between men and women; and a lack of long term comprehensive policy initiative are primarily to blame. Therefore, the paper advocates for policy reforms in which gender, not just women, is mainstreamed through the promotion of both men and women as ideal workers and carers.

This study explores whether and how self-management support is integrated into chronic care approaches in 13 European countries. In addition, it investigates the level of and barriers to implementation of support strategies in health care practice. Methods We conducted a review among the 13 participating countries, based on a common data template informed by the Chronic Care Model. Key informants presented a sample of representative chronic care approaches and related self-management support strategies. The <b>cross-country</b> <b>review</b> was complemented by a Dutch case study of health professionals’ views on the implementation of self-management support in practice. Results Self-management support for chronically ill patients remains relatively underdeveloped in Europe. Similarities between countries exist mostly in involved providers (nurses) and settings (primary care). Differences prevail in mode and format of support, and materials used. Support activities focus primarily on patients’ medical and behavioral management, and less on emotional management. According to Dutch providers, self-management support is not (yet) an integral part of daily practice; implementation is hampered by barriers related to, among others, funding, IT and medical culture. Conclusions Although collaborative care for chronic conditions is becoming more important in European health systems, adequate self-management support for patients with chronic disease is far from accomplished in most countries. There is a need for better understanding of how we can encourage both patients and health care providers to engage in productive interactions in daily chronic care practice, which can improve health and social outcomes.

This transformative view, as translated {{into a kind of}} “implicit industrial policy”–is richly reflected in the metaphors used by Brazilians to refer to the outsider firms–locomotives, anchor firms, leader firms and, even, mother firms. Policy advice proffered by international financial institutions backs this view, as do many governments themselves; for those who are interested, there is plenty of confirmation to be found in a large body of case-study research.

Because the evidence is so mixed, the question I address here–and for which policymakers and program designers need help–is not whether or not outsider firms actually do work their magic on host regions. Rather, why does this happen in some cases and not others, and how could policy and program design help to elicit such positive outcomes? The paper attempts to throw some little light on the matter by drawing on interviews with various large firms, policymakers, and development professionals in Northeast Brazil–a lagging region of nine states and 40 million people–and on experiences outside the Northeast and Brazil, including the U.

Knowing that culture {{has an effect on}} LBP symptomatology, assessment findings and clinical decision making, the aim of this review is to perform a <b>cross-country</b> comparative <b>review</b> amongst the published classification systems, addressing each country’s similarities and differences as well as exploring whether cultural factors have been incorporated into the subclassification process. A systematic search of databases limited to human adults was undertaken by Medline, Cinahl, AMED and PEDro databases between January 1980 and October 2005. Classification systems from nine countries were identified. Most studies were classified according to pathoanatomic and/or clinical features, whereas fewer studies utilized a psychosocial and even less, a biopsychosocial approach. Most studies were limited in use to the country of the system’s developer. Very few studies addressed cultural issues, highlighting the lack of information on the impact of specific cultural factors on LBP classification procedures. However, there seem to be certain ‘cultural trends’ in classification systems within each country, which are discussed. Despite the plethora of classification studies, there is still no system which is internationally established, effective, reliable and valid. Future research should aim to develop a LBP classification system within a well identified cultural setting, addressing the multi-dimensional features of the LBP presentation...|$|R

In 2012 in Hungary the general opinion of people about their financial situation was showing the lowest confidence in the world, with a significant declining trend, reaching an extremely low level. Although the general expectation would be that this pessimism triggers a set-back in consumer spending, figures show that Hungarians were {{on the other end of}} the scale regarding their expenditures and were greatly increasing their spending.

Equivalent results are found using self-reported unhappiness data. Second, there is a large body of data on happiness that is unavailable on the U-index. For example, according to happiness research well-being across nations is lower the higher is the unemployment rate, the current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life. Higher inequality also lowers happiness. Third, we know little about the predictive power of the U-index. Happiness and life satisfaction data seem able to forecast migration flows.

40|$|<b>Reviewing</b> <b>cross-country</b> {{experience}} with sugar policies, and policy reform, the authors conclude that long-standing government interventions - rooted in historical trade arrangements, fear of shortages, and conflicting interests between growers, and sugar mills - often displace both the markets, and the institutions {{required to produce}} efficient outcomes. Arrangements rooted in colonial eras, still shape policies, and trade in the United States, the European Union (EU), and many developing countries. Once policies, and institutions are put in place, households, {{and the value of}} investments grow dependent on them, even as their usefulness fades. Firms and households make decisions that are costly to reverse. And the result is a legacy of path-dependent policies, in which approaches, and instruments are greatly influenced by past agreements, and previous interventions. The cumulative effects of these interventions are embodied in livelihoods, political institutions, capital stocks, and factor markets - which not only dictate the starting point for reform, but also determine which reform paths are feasible. Experiments with public ownership, common in many countries, have not succeeded. So most countries have initiated some measure of market reform. And events relating to NAFTA, Lome, and expansion of the EU, may bring about significant changes in the EU, and US sugar regimes, with cascading effects on other countries. Common problems in the sector include determining cane quality, finding methods for fairly sharing revenues from joint production, finding ways to take advantage of preferential trade arrangements with minimal negative consequences, finding ways to finance, and encourage research, and other activities with common benefits, identifying practices that facilitate equitable, sustainable privatization, and determining the relationship between sugar market reform, and markets in land, water, credit, and other inputs.

40|$|This report {{argues that}} Australian {{commercial}} fisheries can gain a global competitive edge by embracing {{the benefits of}} marine reserves. Introduction The world’s oceans {{are at risk of}} collapse, with significant implications for fishing industries, food security and marine biodiversity. Historically, overfishing has been the main threat to global fish stocks. This is now being exacerbated by the risks of climate change, pollution and pests. Yet with risk comes opportunity. Countries with well-managed fish stocks, supported by healthy marine ecosystems, will be better placed to tap rapidly growing markets for sustainably certified seafood. In the long‑term, they should also benefit from stronger commercial fishing industries. This report finds that Australia can gain a global competitive edge by embracing the benefits of marine reserves. The United Nations and Global Ocean Commission have recommended 10 to 30 per cent of the world’s oceans be placed in marine protected areas (MPAs). Implementation of the Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network (CMRN) of MPAs would establish Australia as a world leader in marine protection. This policy has bipartisan support, but implementation has been suspended pending a review by the current Commonwealth Government. This report analyses the effects of marine reserves on the economic sustainability of Australia’s commercial fishing industry. For the purpose of this report, ‘marine reserves’ refer to those areas within MPAs such as the Marine National Park Zones within the CMRN (see Figure 1 below). These are ‘no-take’ zones: highly protected areas where no fishing is allowed at all. The focus of this report is primarily on the relationship of these marine reserves to commercial fisheries in Commonwealth waters. Examples are also drawn from overseas and State waters. This is not to diminish marine reserves’ ecological and biological importance. CPD notes the 1998 policy guidelines specified biodiversity conservation as the primary purpose of MPAs. [i] There are also broader issues of intergenerational equity to consider. However, this report focuses on points where the economic and ecological arguments intersect: fisheries are central to that debate.     Findings Marine reserves deliver economic, reputational and ecosystem benefits that can provide a competitive advantage for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s commercial fisheries. This includes a potential marketing edge, and insurance against vulnerability to rising fuel costs and unpredictable prices. Rapid growth in sustainably certified seafood should provide an opportunity to improve the margins of Australian commercial fisheries. Given the variety and quality of Australian seafood, sustainably certified products are an increasingly feasible sector of the market for commercial fisheries to target. 	Sustainably certified seafood is a growing global market. Worldwide, the number of fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) jumped more than four-fold over the four years to 2012. Last year there was a 35 per cent increase in MSC labelled products globally. 	Leading Australian seafood businesses are supporting sustainable certification. The World Wildlife Fund has partnered with Blackmores, Coles, John West and Tassal to help them shift to responsibly sourced seafood and fish oil products. 	Australian retailers including Woolworths, Coles and Aldi have made the MSC certification central to their sustainable seafood sourcing policy, with Woolworths aiming to have all of their wild-catch seafood MSC certified. Marine reserves can make it easier for commercial fisheries to gain and maintain sustainability certification. MSC performance indicators assess how appropriate fisheries management and its outcomes are for ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries and the ecosystems that support them. Benefits generated by MPAs can assist in improving scores, and may make it easier to retain certification even if standards rise over time. 	Marine reserves provide key information to help commercial fisheries get their management strategies right, and demonstrate this to the MSC. 	Marine reserves provide a buffer that may help ecosystems recover from shocks and fisheries to maintain scores against MSC performance indicators. This is important because even the best fisheries management settings can be inadequate in the face of unforseen risks. Marine reserves can increase fish stock populations in surrounding areas, improving the economics of commercial fisheries. Spill-overs occur when fish leave marine reserves. This increases fish stock populations in surrounding areas. Spill-overs can benefit commercial fishers by increasing the amount caught for the same level of effort, and by enabling harvests of larger and more highly valued fish. 	Global comparison shows that in some cases the catch per unit of effort can increase by up to 66 per cent near ‘no-take’ zones within MPAs, within five years of protection. 	Global examples show fisher income can be as much as 135 per cent higher near ‘no-take’ zones within MPAs in some cases, compared to open access areas. Marine reserves provide long-term insurance against population crashes. The increased diversity and density of marine species improves the overall health and resilience of marine ecosystems. This allows ecosystems to support larger and more stable populations of commercial fish stocks, insuring against risks – such as climate change, pollution and pests – that are hard to address with fisheries management tools. 	Based on <b>cross-country</b> <b>reviews,</b> on average ‘no-take’ zones see {{an increase in the number}} of species by 21 per cent, size of organisms by 28 per cent, organism density by 166 per cent and biomass by 446 per cent – when compared to nearby unprotected areas, or the same areas before protection. 	International evidence shows that under proper management, ‘no-take’ zones within MPAs have twice as many large fish species, five times more large fish biomass, and 14 times more shark biomass on average than fished areas. Recommendations This report recommends the current review of the CMRN be used to establish marine reserves that will deliver benefits for the long-term. 1. Ensure the design of marine reserves is informed by the latest science. MPAs are a conservative investment in Australia’s key marine assets. Adequately sized and appropriately located ‘no-take’ zones will enable increasing dividends to flow from MPAs in the future. This review should start by accepting that scientific consensus on the benefits of MPAs dates back to 2001. It should also focus on the latest scientific evidence for designing effective ‘no-take’ zones, and consider the possibility that ecological risks will increase over time. 2. Find common ground between stakeholders by focusing on MPA benefits. Well-planned marine protection generates a range of economic benefits, in addition to ecological benefits. To increase community acceptance of final decisions on zoning, the Bioregional Advisory Panels should seek to find common ground between stakeholders. Attention should be directed to the long-term benefits of well-designed MPAs to all stakeholders, rather than on short-term costs. 3. Set aside sufficient funding for structural adjustment and ongoing management. Australia has learned from previous adjustment packages, and now has a more rational policy and rigorous assessment process for determining and targeting adjustment funding. However, there may be opportunities to achieve a double dividend from adjustment funding by identifying opportunities to buy out excess commercial fishing fleet capacity. To ensure MPAs are effective, 15 years of funding sufficient for ongoing management should be placed in a trust. Getting this right is an opportunity we do not want to miss. Chopping and changing policy on marine protection will short-change all Australians, and deny future generations the chance to enjoy the same benefits from marine assets as their parents and grandparents.
