5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 <b>cycles</b> of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 <b>cycles,</b> and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C receptacles are both {{designed for a}} minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 <b>cycles</b> of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E

5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical <b>cycles,</b> appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar <b>cycles</b> were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial <b>cycles,</b> and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} <b>cycles</b> of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity.
