In this paper, penalty {{finite element}} method {{is applied to the}} {{simulation}} of three-dimensional incompressible viscous steady flow, and the program is coded for analysis of three-dimensional flow process of plastic melt in extrusion die. Slit die is typical in polymer extrusion process, and the relevant part is used widely. Because the flow law is different for various polymers with different rheological character even in the same die, the polymer flow in slit die is simulated for Newtonian fluid and power-law fluid by the program and ANSYS, respectively. Flow laws of two kinds of fluid are compared, and the result shows that the non-uniform velocity distribution in outlet is caused by the non-Newtonian effect of material. The penalty factor is important for the penalty finite element model, which decides the precision and efficiency to a great extent. The proper penalty value is decided by some factors, for example, the character of the whole equations and geometric model. Numerical solution with <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> value and viscosity is analyzed, and the result shows that the penalty value should be suited with viscosity in special range for penalty finite element model. The experiment has been developed, and the velocity distribution in outlet of slit die is measured. The result of finite element analysis is consistent with experimental result basically, and the reason of result divergence of the two ways is analyzed. The results show that the given model is suited for the polymer extrusion process, and the advice of the selection of penalty value is instructional for penalty element model...|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} ration optimization {{method was}} applied to a beef cattle fattening system to evaluate the utilization of food by-products under various situations. The method was extended to reduce feed costs (i. e., economic factors) and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions (i. e., environmental factors) by introducing <b>penalty</b> coefficients <b>of</b> nitrogen and phosphorus contents in each ingredient of the diet in the objective function in traditional linear programming. Six regional food by-products, five commercial concentrates and two roughages were used as ingredients of the fermented total mixed ration. Constraints for the feed formulation were based mainly on nutrient requirements in the Japanese Feeding Standard for Beef Cattle. The replacement price (or acquisition cost) of food by-products {{was defined as the}} maximum price of food by-products when the feed cost with the use of food by-products was below the cost with the use of conventional concentrates. The results showed that although the replacement prices were not greatly affected by the penalty levels, they were associated with the changes in the substitution rate of food by-products for concentrates and the price of concentrates. The replacement prices were about 16 (yen/kg, as-fed basis) against the present price level of concentrates, when food by-products were substituted for a half of concentrates. Feed compositions were altered and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions were decreased by the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalties,</b> in spite <b>of</b> the small <b>change</b> in the replacement price of food by-products. Both nitrogen and phosphorus penalties greatly reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus excretions, indicating that nitrogen and phosphorus penalty coefficients should be introduced together in the objective function in order to reduce both excretions efficiently...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the target}} {{velocity}} {{is within the}} range of 0 - 2 ppf with a possible jitter of 0.5 ppf, the pixel can move up to 2.5 ppf in the horizontal and vertical directions; hence, a valid area from which a pixel might origin from in the previous frame is a 7 × 7 pixel area (matrix). Such a search area can be resized according to different velocity ranges and jitter values. The search area will define the probability matrices that contain the probabilities of pixels in the previous frames being the origin of the pixel in the current frame. To take into account unreasonable <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> direction, <b>penalty</b> matrices are introduced with the aim of building probability matrices for the different possible directions of movement. These matrices give high probabilities to pixels in the estimated direction and decreasing probabilities (punishment) as the direction varies from the estimated direction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Over the years, many {{improvements}} and refine-ments of the backpropagation learning algorithm have been reported. In this paper, a new adaptive penalty-based learning extension for the backpropagation learning algorithm and its variants is proposed. The new method initially {{puts pressure on}} artificial neural networks {{in order to get}} all outputs for all training patterns into the correct half of the output range, instead of mainly focusing on minimizing the difference between the target and actual output values. The technique is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. In this study, the new approach has been applied to the backpropagation learning algorithm as well as the RPROP learning algorithm and simulations have been performed. The superiority of the new proposed method is demonstrated. By applying the extension, the number of successful runs can be greatly increased and the average number of epochs to convergence can be well reduced on various problem instances. Furthermore, the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> values during training has been studied and its observation shows the active role the penalties play within the learning process. I...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} the standpoints of Polish penal code writing {{with respect to}} basic directives <b>of</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> formulated {{on the basis of}} Penal Code of 1969. The first part presents three basic directives contained in Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code of 1969, i. e. a) a directive of the degree of social danger of a criminal act (identified by most authors with the justice-based rationalization); b) a directive of social influence <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> (corresponding with the principle of general crime prevention); c) a directive of individual influence <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> (corresponding with the principle of individual crime prevention). The interpretation of Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code does not indicate that the legislator would treat any of these directives in a preferential way. It may mean that each of them should be reflected in the individual measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty.</b> The Penal Code is also silent on the question of priority of one of these directives in case of conflict between them, leaving the choice to the discretionary powers of the court. Such an arrangement of basic directives <b>of</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> has {{since the early days of}} the Penal Code raised numerous controversies, most of them focused around the problem of a so-called leading directive <b>of</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty.</b> The second part of the article shows the course of a twenty-year-old discussion on the conceptions <b>of</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty.</b> The first stage of that discussion took place in years 1959 - 1974. Three basic standpoints were represented in legal writing at that time. Most writers supported the conception of equality of directives provided for in Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code (among others I. Andrejew, Z. Kaczmarek, Z. Kubec, J. Majewski, W. Swida, J. Sliwowski, Z. Sienkiewicz). The second group of authors supported the conception of domination of one of the preventive directives, mostly the one of individual crime prevention, over the others (K. Buchała, A. Spotowski, A. Zoll, A. Krukowski). Finally, the third view was for the conception of priority of the directive of social danger. The problems of basic directives <b>of</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> were again in the focus of interest of legal writing in years 1981 - 1982, in connection with amendements to the Penal Code. Most authors were then for the leading role of individual prevention modified by the needs of just requital, or for the equivalent position of both directives (e. g. A. Spotowski, A. Marek, A. Zoll). Almost unanimous was in legal writing the renouncement of the directive of general crime prevention. The two projects of amendments to the Penal Code (a government and a so-called social draft) incorporated the above proposals <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code. In 1988, The Commission for the Penal Law Reform appointed by the Minister of Justice issued Guidelines on the Penal Law Reform. However, the Guidelines were not clear as to the standpoint with respect to <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> Art. 50 of the Penal Code. The above Guidelines were also analysed by the Scientific Society of Penal Law. The opinion of that organization stated that the measurement <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> should include two aims: the satisfaction of social sense of justice through the severity <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> commensurate with the degree of guilt, and individual crime prevention directed towards resocialization. In case of conflict of those two directives, priority should be given to individual crime prevention, with the exception of fellonies. The author is fully in support for the standpoint expressed in the Opinion of the Scientific Society of Penal Law.

40|$|Recently, penalized {{regression}} {{has been}} used for dealing problems which found in maximum likelihood estimation such as correlated parameters and a large number of predictors. The main issues in this regression is how to select the optimal model. In this thesis, Schall’s algorithm is proposed as an automatic selection <b>of</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>penalty.</b> The algorithm has two steps. First, the coefficient estimates are obtained with an arbitrary penalty weight. Second, an estimate <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> weight λ can be calculated by the ratio of the variance of error and the variance of coefficient. The iteration is continued from step one until an estimate <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> weight converge. The computational cost is minimized because the optimal weight <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> could be obtained within a small number of iterations. In this thesis, Schall’s algorithm is investigated for ridge regression, lasso regression and two-dimensional histogram smoothing. The proposed algorithm are applied to real data sets and simulation data sets. In addition, a new algorithm for lasso regression is proposed. The performance of results of the algorithm was almost comparable in all applications. Schall’s algorithm can be an efficient algorithm for selection <b>of</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>penalty...</b>|$|R
