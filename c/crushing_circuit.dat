The processing operation at Mowana is a standard flotation plant designed to produce copper concentrates from oxide, supergene, and sulphide ores. The expected average output of 16. 2 tons per hour of copper concentrates has never been attained since plant commissioning. The major bottleneck has been established to be located around the <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit</b> of the Mowana production chain. The major hypotheses of this research are that performance in a crushing plant is adversely influenced by moderate and discrete changes in the process. The ultimate objective {{is to develop a}} dynamic process simulator, administered in Simulink/MATLAB® background, for application in the design of a control model utilising two crusher variables and a self-tuning control algorithm. In this research work, a process model describing the dynamic operation of an Osborn 57 S gyrasphere cone crusher is investigated. Modelling of the Mowana <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit</b> is carried out by combining the steady-state and dynamic components of the crushing equipment in the Simulink/Matlab® environment. Eccentric speed (ES) and closed-side setting (CSS) are amongst the important inputs to the models. The rest of the inputs (crusher power, crusher cavity level, federate, pulley diameters, liner wear measurement, number of teeth of the pinion and bevel gear) are extracted from the data collected across the Mowana mine <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit.</b> While it has been demonstrated that the crusher CSS is the most influential controllable parameter, it has also been demonstrated that crusher capacity and power can be used effectively to optimise the circuit. The use of crushing power and cavity level control is suitable for the <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit</b> since the crushers are running on a constant ES and the CSS is set and reset manually. The outcome of the study presents an insight into the optimization of the Mowana mine <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit</b> through the design of a self-tuning controller for the cone crusher and for prototyping, parameters of a PID controller were determined in the Simulink/MATLAB® environment.

40|$|Every {{process is}} {{subjected}} to changes in performance and efficiency over time. These dynamics can originate upstream and be inherent through the process or occur anywhere in the downstream process. Traditional plant simulations are performed with steady-state simulation, which are limited to give the performance in an ideal situation. However, plant performance usually tends to deviate away from the predicted plant performance. These dynamics are usually consequences of an altered state of the plant due to factors such as natural variation, unmatched, inappropriate or degrading equipment performance and/or stochastic events.

40|$|The primary <b>crushing</b> <b>circuit</b> at Premier Diamond Mine was {{simulated}} {{to improve}} operating costs and diamond recovery. Due to surges in certain feed streams a dynamic simulation was done. The {{applicability of the}} general-purpose simulator, Siman 4, for simulating a metallurgical plant is evaluated in this work. Due to the constraints of a discrete dynamic simulation the streams of material had to be divided into streams of entities (1 ton, 10 ton blocks of material) {{each with its own}} attributes. Because of these constraints the screen model, which is based on the model of Karra, and the crusher model, which is based on the Simon-Whiten model, had to be mathematically manipulated to allow the size distributions to be described by two attributes. These adjusted models were tested by comparing them with the plant data. After satisfactory validation of the plant model, it was used to predict alternatives plant operations. This included different screen aperture sizes, closed side settings for the crushers, tonnages and operating practices for the shuttle conveyor. The success of this method of simulation indicates that it could be used to simulate other metallurgical plants. This means that mining companies that have already invested in general-purpose simulators can use them to simulate their metallurgical operations.

40|$|Much of {{the studies}} related to copper flash {{smelting}} focuses on the burner and reaction shaft, while settler part of the furnace is not much evaluated. In the settler part, matte and slag separation take place, and it is critical in determining the final matte grade. In this thesis, a novel experimental procedure is employed to evaluate the time-dependent behavior of matte during settling process. Copper concentrate and synthetic slag mixture of known SiO 2 /Fe ratio was contacted at 1300 oC in air atmosphere and inert Argon atmosphere. The ratio corresponded to the actual fluxing ratio of an industrial flash smelting furnace (SiO 2 /Fe 0. 7 – 1. 0). The experiments were carried out at several different reaction times, and subsequently analyzed with SEM-EDS to see the progression of matte-slag interactions and reactions. Additional experiments were also conducted by introducing 5 - 10 mm sized <b>crushed</b> printed <b>circuit</b> boards (PCB) to the mixture. These additional experiments provide initial analysis regarding how the minor metals in the PCB behave in copper smelting.

It was found that oxygen mass transport in slag is the limiting factor of the overall reaction rate. Separation and settling of matte ceased after 10 minutes, while continuous feeding of air leads to total loss of matte to the slag phase after just 5 minutes, with Cu content in the matte reaching peak level after 2 - 3 minutes. Precious metals in the PCB mostly distributed to the matte to create a Cu-Fe alloy phase distributed rather randomly within the matte.

40|$|A closed <b>circuit</b> <b>crushing</b> {{consists}} of a crusher that breaks the feed material, a screen that classifies the material and a conveyor system that returns the over size back to the crusher. The capacity of a centrifugal crusher with a given motor power depends on its rotation frequency. The lower the rotation frequency the lower the specific energy, or breakage intensity, that the particles obtain before breakage and hence the greater {{the capacity of the}} crusher to provide a low specific energy to the feed particles On the other hand, according to the breakage model the fraction of the feed that breaks below the feed size class is greater as the kinetic energy given to the particles increases. The combination of these two parameters has two effects: a) the energy cost per mass of the material broken by the crusher decreases as the breakage intensity decreases and b) the circulating load that has to be returned to the crusher increases as the breakage intensity decreases.

The strength of the fragments produced in a blast is clearly important to the performance of the <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuit</b> as it affects the energy required to break the feed to a target product size. In order to validate the effect of blasting on fragment strength several lumps of granite were blasted, under controlled conditions, using three very different explosive products. The resulting fragments were subjected to standard comminution ore characterisation tests. Obtained comminution parameters were then used to simulate the performance of a SAG mill.

40|$|AbstractElectronic waste, such as {{printed circuit}} boards, are an {{important}} secondary resource if processed with environment-friendly technologies for obtaining precious metal, such as gold. The gold bioleaching from electronic waste was recently getting paid attractive attention because its available deposit is limited. This review was focused on Chromobacterium violaceum (C.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of test methods are {{available}} to the rock mechanics engineer {{in order to assess}} rock strength. The application of these test techniques to the prediction of comminution behaviour is investigated. Previously test methods that rely on inducing tensile failure have been found to correlate well with power consumption and product grading from crushing machinery. Building on this previous work the point load, fracture toughness and Hopkinson Pressure Bar core based tests are examined in relation to breakage. The application of these testing techniques to the prediction of comminution behaviour has tremendous potential if the rock strength parameters can be linked to a measure of breakage. The measure of breakage used in this study is the drop weight apparatus developed at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre. The A, b and t 10 parameters provided by the drop weight test describe the ore-specific rock breakage in the context of comminution. This approach has been successfully used in the simulation and optimisation of numerous <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuits.</b> As such this paper seeks to investigate the relationship between the parameters of tensile based tests and those of the drop weight test. Given the expense of obtaining drill core samples it is essential that the samples yield the maximum amount of information. Early indications suggest that this technique will enable data required for comminution plant design to be obtained from core samples...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to improve energy {{efficiency}} of industrial crushing and grinding operations (comminution). Mathematical models of the comminution process {{are being used to}} study methods for optimizing he product size distribution, so that the amount of excessively fine material produced can be minimized. This will save energy by reducing the amount of material that is ground below the target size, and will also reduce the quantity of materials wasted as ''slimes'' that are too fine to be useful. This will be accomplished by: (1) modeling alternative circuit arrangements to determine methods for minimizing overgrinding, and (2) determining whether new technologies, such as high-pressure roll crushing, can be used to alter particle breakage behavior to minimize fines production. In previous quarters, it was determined that the primary grinding mills were operating at less than full capacity, suggesting that a shift of grinding load to the primary mills could liberate more material before it reached the secondary mills, allowing more complete liberation with a coarser grind. In the eighth quarter, further analysis was carried out to determine {{the full extent of the}} benefit that could be obtained by this shift in grinding load. A key part of this analysis was the development of a correlation of the circuit capacity with (a) ore work index, (b) the quantity of primary mill ''pebbles'' that were crushed by a cone <b>crusher</b> in the <b>circuit,</b> and (c) the fraction of the crushed pebbles that were also processed by a high-pressure roll mill...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{companies}} have long recognised {{the importance of}} ore breakage characterisation in design and optimisation of their <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuits.</b> In one of the industry standard methods relevant to AG/SAG milling, ore is characterised using mainly high energy single impact tests. However recent DEM {{studies have suggested that}} breakage in AG/SAG mills is mainly due to low energy repetitive (or multiple) collisions rather than single high energy impacts. Hence a study was initiated at the JKMRC to investigate the behaviour of ores under such conditions. Carefully designed experiments have been performed using two laboratory mill sizes (0. 6 m and 1. 1 m diameter) to mimic the reported low energy repetitive impact breakage under low load conditions. The breakage characterisation parameters derived from standard high energy single impact tests on the same ores was then used to predict the low energy repetitive impact breakage. Significant bias was found in the simulations which clearly warranted further investigation. The extensive experimental program which followed employed three separate methods: the JKRBT (JK Rotary Breakage Tester) for high energy single impact and low energy repetitive impacts, gravity drops for low energy repetitive impacts, and laboratory mills to provide an extended number of low energy repetitive impacts. The breakage energies associated with these experiments were accurately measured with a high speed video camera. Two breakage indices, the degree of breakage (t 10) and the breakage probability (S) were used to describe the breakage test results. This paper summarises the major results from this experimental study, which has facilitated {{the development of a new}} breakage characterization method relevant to AG/SAG mill modelling...|$|R
40|$|In {{large scale}} metalliferous mining, there is {{documented}} evidence that by providing an appropriate size distribution to <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuits,</b> a measurable increased throughput and/or reduced power draw can be obtained. Tailoring blast designs to suit specific fragmentation requirements is becoming common place {{at both the}} prefeasibility and feasibility study stages. This is particularly the case when significant increases in ore production rates are being considered. Given the variability associated {{with many of the}} input parameters that are used to estimate fragmentation outcomes, a simple deterministic empirical approach is limited. This is the case at the feasibility stages, where there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the definition of blasting domains. Complex processes, such as explosive rock breakage and fragmentation, are suited to modelling techniques involving stochastic methods. As part of the feasibility study of a large open pit expansion project, there was a requirement to estimate fragmentation envelopes for a set of design parameters and rock mass conditions. This paper gives a description of a stochastic approach to blast fragmentation modelling and uses this expansion project to demonstrate its application. In this particular case study, there was a need to estimate the expected run of mine fragmentation associated with blasting in the deeper and more competent ore domains. Results from several simulations using the proposed modelling approach have shown the importance of including the measured variability of input parameters such intact rock properties and degree of fracturing at the feasibility stages. Modelling results also identified significant differences in ore fragmentation envelopes if current designs were to be applied in the more competent domains as the pit expands. From this analysis, a number of blast design options have been evaluated and recommendations made in order to achieve future ore handling and processing targets. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Maney on behalf of the Institute and The AusIM...|$|R

The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone <b>crusher</b> rock sizing <b>circuit.</b> When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft.

40|$|Accurate {{crushing}} {{and screening}} models {{are essential for}} the meaningful simulation of ore dressing plants such as the iron ore beneficiation plant studies in this work. Crushing and screening models were studies, developed and enhanced. The basic simulator used was Microsim, which was subsequently expanded to incorporate these new models. The models were then evaluated individually. The Whiten crushing model was modified for haematite, as this is a particularly hard ore. A new model was developed for the gyradisc crushing of haematite, with two interparticle breakage mechanisms {{taking place in the}} crushing chamber. The gyradisc model has only the crusher closed side setting as parameter. Both models showed good agreement with experimental data. The Karra screen model was enhanced to include the use of ‘poly’ decks and non-square screen apertures, as used on the plant. The Rose efficiency model was developed to use efficiencies from plant data or experiments. The Rose model showed a better relative accuracy than the entirely empirical enhanced Karra model. The screen models developed can be used for different ores but the crushing models are not transferable. Thereafter simulation was done for the quaternary sub-plant manufacturing two or three products respectively. The product ratios obtained by simulation were accurate in both cases. The optimization routine was then used to calculate an improved fine to lumpy ore ratio. It was found that only a small improvement could be achieved in the quaternary plant. Simulation of the preliminary comminution plant, however, failed to give accurate results. This plant does not operate in steady state, therefore the error could be ascribed to this. The accuracy of the Nordberg gyratory crushing model used in this sub-plant could not be established. The washing and screening plant was successfully simulated with the new screening models. The choice of size classes was found to be very important in the simulation of <b>crushing</b> and screening <b>circuits.</b> The maximum number must be used and should coincide with screen apertures.

40|$|Comminution, or {{particle}} size reduction, involving crushing and grinding, {{is a highly}} energy intensive process. This {{is largely due to}} the prevailing use of tumbling mills for grinding, where the nature of the particle breakage process is unconstrained and random. This indiscriminate nature of breakage contributes to the inefficient use of energy and may not promote liberation of valuable minerals in the ore. It results in high energy consumption and the generation of critical size material and ultra fines, both of which are difficult to process. The total demand for minerals is increasing to meet the requirements of the developing world and beyond. As a result, large reserves of high grade ore deposits have already been depleted. This has seen the need to mine and process ever lower grade, more competent and finely disseminated ores at much higher throughputs and finer product sizes. The inefficient nature of the comminution process coupled with ore reserves of declining head grade and the imminent introduction of a carbon trading scheme, suggests that the long term viability of the mineral processing industry depends on developing new methods and strategies to improve the efficiency of all processes. This will facilitate higher throughput rates at lower energy consumption. This is particularly important for the comminution process, as it is the most energy intensive part of a mineral processing circuit. A review of the current comminution circuit design practices reveals a general view that the comminution circuit design process is complicated and inexact involving the consideration of many interacting factors. A trend has been the repeated design and installation of large, low capital cost and uncomplicated <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuits.</b> These normally feature one or two stages of crushing, followed by one or two large tumbling mills and a single classification stage. For most new comminution circuits, the general configuration and layout are more similar than different, where the size of the tumbling mills are dictated by the target product size and the throughput rate. The methodology for energy efficient comminution circuit design presented in this thesis challenges the popular trend of large and generic comminution circuits. The methodology promotes a better understanding and use of the ore properties and options to reduce energy consumption, including: • The inclusion of pre-concentration techniques {{at the head of a}} comminution circuit. The purpose of pre-concentration is to remove coarse size liberated gangue from later stages of processing and energy intensive {{particle size}} reduction. The selection of pre-concentration techniques is based on inherent ore textures and ore properties at a large scale. • The use of more efficient comminution equipment and autogenous grinding techniques. Through the re-distribution of comminution energy in a comminution circuit, the generation of problematic size fractions such as critical size material and ultra fines can be minimised or even eliminated. This aids the overall efficiency of the comminution process and minimises power usage for the same throughput and product size. It also limits the consumption of grinding media and the associated embedded energy resulting from grinding media manufacture. • The selection of the coarsest possible target product size(s) for a comminution circuit. This is achieved by thorough analysis and understanding of mineral liberation data of a coarse stream in a comminution circuit and the options and methods available to separate composite valuable mineral bearing particles from mainly liberated gangue in the stream. When these energy efficient strategies are combined in the design and configuration of a comminution circuit, energy savings are likely to be significant. However, it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact on energy savings and circuit operation when all three energy efficient strategies feature in the design of a comminution circuit. Instead, studies in this thesis have shown that the use of just one these strategies in the design of a comminution circuit can: • Reduce the total energy consumption by up to 42 % (when compared to a conventional <b>crushing</b> and grinding <b>circuit)</b> through the use of more efficient comminution equipment and autogenous grinding techniques. This equates to grinding energy and grinding consumables savings in excess of $ 11 M per annum for a typical 5 Mtpa concentrator. It also can reduce the operating costs by up to a half. • Reduce the energy required for size reduction by 46 % when liberated non-sulphide gangue is removed from a coarse stream in the comminution circuit and from further size reduction. This opportunity is identified by the thorough examination of mineral liberation data of this stream. The rejection of gangue at this point in the comminution circuit can provide a saving of approximately $ 3. 5 m per year in total grinding costs. It is noted that these energy savings can be at the cost of greater capital cost investment and, some may say, increased operating complexity. Incorporating the energy efficient strategies in a design methodology for comminution circuits can have a few significant implications: • It can increase size and value of the resource being treated as the rejection of liberated gangue by pre-concentration can decrease the mine cut-off grade. • It can improve performance of downstream separation processes as less gangue is present in the feed and the feed size distribution is narrower, allowing for better separation efficiency. • It can reduce the consumption of grinding consumables and minimise the associated energy used it their manufacture. • It may require higher capital cost investment but this is likely to be off set by the reduced energy and grinding media consumption as well as increasing energy costs and the introduction of a carbon trading scheme. This thesis develops and demonstrates a methodology, or a conceptual framework, for comminution circuit design which links together energy efficient design strategies which can reduce all forms of energy consumption and their cost...|$|R
