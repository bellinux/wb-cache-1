5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a <b>collimating</b> <b>lens.</b> A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
500|$|A {{common type}} (used in {{applications}} such as aircraft gun sights) uses a <b>collimating</b> <b>lens</b> and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90° to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E

50|$|In the {{original}} spectroscope {{design in the}} early 19th century, light entered a slit and a <b>collimating</b> <b>lens</b> transformed the light into a thin beam of parallel rays. The light then passed through a prism (in hand-held spectroscopes, usually an Amici prism) that refracted the beam into a spectrum because different wavelengths were refracted different amounts due to dispersion. This image was then viewed through a tube with a scale that was transposed upon the spectral image, enabling its direct measurement.|$|E

50|$|For {{interference}} lithography to be successful, coherence requirements must be met. First, a spatially {{coherent light}} source must be used. This is effectively a point light source {{in combination with}} a <b>collimating</b> <b>lens.</b> A laser or synchrotron beam are also often used directly without additional collimation. The spatial coherence guarantees a uniform wavefront prior to beam splitting. Second, it is preferred to use a monochromatic or temporally coherent light source. This is readily achieved with a laser but broadband sources would require a filter. The monochromatic requirement can be lifted if a diffraction grating {{is used as a}} beam splitter, since different wavelengths would diffract into different angles but eventually recombine anyway. Even in this case, spatial coherence and normal incidence would still be required.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} system, {{illumination}} {{is provided by}} a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a <b>collimating</b> <b>lens.</b> A focusing lens after the pair of flats would produce an inverted image of the source if the flats were not present; all light emitted from a point on the source is focused to a single point in the system's image plane. In the accompanying illustration, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen.

In this case, in the light path, there are a <b>collimated</b> <b>lens</b> and a 4 -well plate. The lens has two faces and a percentage of losses of about 3 %, and the 4 -well plate adds a percentage of losses near 10 % according to the manufacturers.

40|$|Optical {{backplane}} bus {{based on}} glass substrate with volume holographic gratings on top surface possesses a great ability to broadcast information. This feature is utilized {{to accomplish a}} bit-interleaved optical interconnect system. In this system, each daughter board sends only one bit per round and the bit pulses from different boards can cascade in a designed series when the transmitters are distributed in an appropriate manner. In this way, even slow electronic chips can be coordinated to generate an aggregate bandwidth up to 10 Gbps, which is impossible to achieve with a multi-drop electrical bus. Besides the benefits of high data rate and low crosstalk, such a bit-interleaved architecture provides a secure data storage method.
