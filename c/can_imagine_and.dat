Andy Pryor, the casting director, did not believe Gambon would be available, and was surprised when Gambon accepted the role. Smith, Gillan, and Darvill were very honoured to work with him. Moffat stated, [...] "Michael Gambon is as distinguished an actor as I <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that he was}} Dumbledore means that he is already known to millions of children". Kazran was played as a boy by Laurence Belcher and as a young adult by Danny Horn. Director Toby Haynes said that acting came naturally to Belcher and he [...] "captured the story" [...] and drew the audience in.|$|E

For this record, Melua {{went back to her}} native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women's Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was time for us to part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other. Yeah – it wasn’t easy, as you <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> <b>And</b> I'm still incredibly proud of the work we did together. But it had to happen and I think it has been mutual ... um, eventually." ...|$|E
500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick at times... I got called every name you <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> <b>and</b> every four-letter word you can think of was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E

Director Ram Gopal Varma called Manam an [...] "avant garde product but {{deeply rooted in}} earth" [...] and [...] "the first {{constructive}} demonstration that Tollywood actually can go into a new age of cinema". He added that both Nagarjuna and Vikram deserved multiple salutes for making a film like Manam, and the only tragedy was that Nageswara Rao was not alive to see this film, which Varma termed an [...] "astounding celebration of human emotions". Ram Charan called Manam a film that induces [...] "Love, joy, passion, hatred, excitement and almost every feeling you <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>and</b> more". Kamal Haasan watched the film on 29 May 2014, at a special screening in Chennai. Haasan became emotional and could not control his tears. Regarding this, he said [...] "I {{have always been a}} fan of ANR and this film has brought back very fond memories. I turned emotional when I saw ANR on the big screen.

While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis would have a lot of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that it was wonderful to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— as you <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> <b>And</b> if I said that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E
