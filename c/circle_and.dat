5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, <b>Circle</b> <b>and</b> District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the <b>Circle</b> <b>and</b> Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E

40|$|A signed graph is a graph whose {{edges are}} {{labelled}} positive or negative. The {{sign of a}} circle (cycle, circuit) {{is the product of}} the signs of its edges. Most of the essential properties of a signed graph depend on the signs of its circles.

Topics include incidence between signed <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> edges or vertices, characterizing signed graphs with special circle properties, counting negative <b>circles,</b> signed-circle packing <b>and</b> covering, signed <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> eigenvalues, and directed cycles in signed digraphs.

Goldmine Magazine called <b>Circles</b> <b>and</b> Squares a “tour-de-force that’s not to be missed," [...] comparing it to Paul McCartney’s 1970’s solo debut, McCartney. The songs Shine <b>and</b> <b>Circles</b> <b>and</b> Squares were [...] "DJ PICKS" [...] on the taste-making Los Angeles radio station KCRW. Swirsky played all of the instruments on the album, except for two small parts. The fourth song from the album, Far Away, was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2016 Hollywood Music and Movie Awards.|$|R
5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> a smaller regular hexagon inside the <b>circle,</b> <b>and</b> progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic <b>Circle,</b> <b>and</b> the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
