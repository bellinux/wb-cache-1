Bush. He has presented programmes such as Westminster Live, Weekend Breakfast and Late Night Live on BBC Radio 5 Live, and Newsnight on BBC Two. He earns between £250,000 and £299,999 as a BBC journalist.|$|E
5|$|The letter <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in {{the upper}} echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added {{an image of a}} broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{light on}} both sides; Révolutionnaire lost five men killed and four wounded, {{including}} Thévenard {{who had suffered}} minor wounds, while Artois was the only British ship engaged, losing two sailors and a lieutenant of Royal Marines killed and five men wounded. Pellew's squadron brought Révolutionnaire back to Falmouth immediately, having discovered an outbreak of small pox among the prisoners of war taken from the French frigate. Subsequently, the light damage the ship had suffered enabled the Royal Navy to rapidly purchase and commission the frigate as the 38-gun HMS Révolutionnaire {{under the command of}} Captain Francis Cole and attach the ship to Pellew's squadron. Eighteen months later, Révolutionnaire fought and captured the French frigate Unité at the Action of 12 April 1796, and remained in the Royal Navy throughout the following 21 years of warfare. The arrival of Révolutionnaire in Britain <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among naval architects as the frigate was significantly larger than those produced in Britain at the time. The ship was extensively planned and modelled and a ship was commissioned for the Royal Navy to the design of Révolutionnaire, although severe delays at the shipyards meant that HMS Forte, as the ship was eventually named, was not launched until 1814.|$|E
50|$|Also <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> was the Investorenbejubeln (Investors' Celebration), a {{demonstration}} {{on the river}} Spree in which protestors used rubber dinghies and paddle boats to follow a boat-cruise of Mediaspree investors, which was then broken off prematurely.|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was filmed by several media outlets, and <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in Israel and elsewhere, despite Palestinian police attempts at confiscating the footage {{immediately after the}} incident.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{his former}} daughter-in-law, Inge Lynn Collins Bongo, the first wife {{of his son}} Ali Bongo Ondimba, <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> when she {{appeared}} on the US music channel VH1's reality show, Really Rich Real Estate. She was featured trying to buy a US$25,000,000 mansion in Malibu, California.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, as {{complete}} outsiders {{but with a}} song which has strong national (Montenegrin) identity, they got most of the votes from the jury appointed by the RTCG, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among the Serbian and Montenegrin followers of the Eurovision Song Contest.|$|R

25|$|In the 1908 Prix de Rome competition, Boulanger <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> by {{submitting}} {{an instrumental}} fugue {{rather than the}} required vocal fugue. The subject was {{taken up by the}} national and international newspapers, and was resolved only when the French Minister of Public Information decreed that Boulanger's work be judged on its musical merit alone. She won the Second Grand Prix for her cantata, La Sirène.|$|E
25|$|A local daily, The Star {{reported}} that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw to regulate the Azan {{so that it will}} not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the Dewan Rakyat. Muslim MPs accused him of being insensitive and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz blasted the DAP member for allegedly trying to destroy the multi-religious tolerance in the country.|$|E
25|$|Although HRT {{admitted}} {{they crossed the}} line two weeks ago when they reported {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' the results for the second round election night. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> within HRT against the main editor of the news program Hloverka Novak-Srzić who was faced with scandals long before the election night incident. Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E
50|$|Bonbon {{is known}} for its edgy and {{sometimes}} provocative advertising. Some ads depicted sexually charged imagery. In 2012, bonbon published a YouTube video, a longer version of its TV ad that portrayed two girls kissing, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the local media, but drawing praises from LGBT friendly web sites.|$|R
50|$|Following his release, in 2015, Yamaguchi {{distributed}} pamphlets {{to members}} of the Diet calling for former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to resign as head of the 2020 Summer Olympics organizing committee, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the political world as Yamaguchi and Mori had been acquaintances since Mori was still a student.|$|R
5000|$|Psycharis {{did more}} than <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among {{established}} writers.

Notable among these were [...] and Alexandros Pallis.|$|R
25|$|At its 2007 convention, the PPD {{approved}} a new philosophy and set of ideals for the party. The new philosophy commits {{the party to}} defending a political status for the island that is based in the irrevocable {{right of the people}} of Puerto Rico to form a sovereign country. This shift in philosophy <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among party detractors, since the PPD was not known for being that liberal before. Its conservative stance had been represented by its unshakable defense of the commonwealth status quo.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, {{the printer}} {{of the local}} Home {{newsletter}} was fined for distributing an article deemed obscene by the Pierce County Superior Court. Later the same year, several Home colonists traveled to nearby Anderson Island and lectured about anarchy. The Tacoma Evening News denounced the lecture and many in Tacoma believed two of the Home colonists garnered government pensions. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among people along the Puget Sound, as it was widely spread {{that the government was}} in a roundabout way supporting anarchy.|$|E
25|$|In 365 BC Perdiccas III avenged his brother's {{murder by}} murdering Ptolemy {{and taking the}} throne. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> amongst the {{families}} of Macedon, which called in Pelopidas to re-establish peace. As part of the peace settlement, Philip II was taken as a hostage to Thebes. Perdiccas reigned until 359 BC, and already weakened by struggles against Athens, he confronted the Illyrian ruler Bardylis and died along with 4000 of his men in a disastrous battle. Eventually his youngest brother Philip II {{took control of the}} kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{positive}} results were not published because, {{in the words}} of Chester Stock, Sugiura's supervisor, [...] "it would have caused all kind of havoc." [...] Nevertheless, they were leaked in 1973, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir.</b> Consequently laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems, and a Sloan-Kettering press release concluded that laetrile showed no beneficial effects.|$|R

25|$|In December 1997 Tele Danmark {{announced}} {{that from the}} beginning of 1998 they would start collecting a yearly fee (of 340 DKK excluding VAT) for every registered domain name via DK Hostmaster. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in FIL's members, as they had not been informed. While there had been talks about some sort of fee to DK Hostmaster to cover its expenses, no review of DK Hostmaster’s actual budget was available since it was financially all but a part of Tele Danmark. This was therefore seen by FIL as abuse of power and profit making via the supposedly non-profit DK Hostmaster organization.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 {{the move}} by pro-slavery forced in Kansas to legalize slavery <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> nationwide. Willard {{came out in}} support of the pro-slavery position, and {{supported}} President James Buchanan or Stephen Douglas. The event was the breaking point for the state's Democratic party. Most of the party's newspapers came out strongly against Willard, and numerous members began to switch to the Republican Party. In 1858 the legislature launched an investigation on the sale of public land in northeast Indiana. They discovered that over $100,000 had been embezzled by commissioners that had been appointed by the governor. Legislators began accusing Willard of corruption. He ignored their attacks, but removed the commissioners.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, Disney {{announced}} that Lost {{would be available}} for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, {{as part of a}} two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of Lost episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements. In 2009, Lost was named the most-watched show on the Internet based on viewers of episodes on ABC's website. The Nielsen Company reported that 1.425million unique viewers have watched at least one episode on ABC's website.|$|E
