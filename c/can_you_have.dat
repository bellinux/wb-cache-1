500|$|To the Australian Daily Telegraph, Gaga {{explained}} that [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was about struggling to balance success and love. Further explanations {{said that the}} song was about trying to win the paparazzi and the media in one's favor. [...] "It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> both, or can you only have one", she concluded. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was the album's third single in Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, the fourth in Canada and the United States and the fifth in Australia, France and New Zealand. Although released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia, [...] "LoveGame" [...] initially had been planned as the third single release in the former but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, {{it was decided that}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] would be released instead.|$|E
500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline has been such an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E
500|$|The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two {{surviving}} victims, {{was originally}} offered to Christopher Reeve {{based on his}} work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a [...] "funny situation" [...] with Oldman wanting a prominent [...] "credit". She said: [...] "Now how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first)." [...] Oldman was apparently [...] "out" [...] of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go [...] "unbilled". Oldman would become transformed and [...] "unrecognizable as himself" [...] to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: [...] "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures , and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy." [...] Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to [...] "do it anonymously" [...] under the heavy make-up. In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} altogether. But {{there are other}} ways--in cultivation, refinement, higher tastes and aims than the great mass of people <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> risen yourself, Mr. Peck." ...|$|R

2500|$|Trainers later {{enforced}} some standard diet rules: {{to be an}} Olympic victor, [...] "you have to eat {{according to}} regulations, keep away from desserts (…); you must not drink cold water nor <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a drink of wine whenever you want". It seems this diet was primarily based on meat, for Galen (ca. 180 AD) accused athletes of his day of [...] "always gorging themselved on flesh and blood". Pausanias also refers to a [...] "meat diet".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to this scenario, Tashi Wangdi, {{the representative of the}} 14th Dalai Lama, replied that the Chinese government's selection would be meaningless. [...] "You can't impose an Imam, an Archbishop, saints, any religion...you can't politically impose these things on people," [...] said Wangdi. [...] "It has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The Chinese can use their political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like their Panchen Lama. And they can't keep their Panchen Lama in Tibet. They tried to bring him to his monastery many times but people would not see him. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a religious leader like that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{reshuffle}} of the ministry, Rudd demoted Garrett as Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. This demotion was {{in response}} to Garrett's administration of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) that was linked to four deaths, over 100 house fires and allegations of fraud. It was revealed in May 2010 that Garrett had written to Prime Minister Rudd on four occasions raising concerns about safety. Further to this, following the 2010 Labor leadership spill, Gary Gray was reported to believe that Garrett was demoted because [...] "Rudd had a shocking interview on The 7.30 Report and needed a scapegoat". Gray stated:The majority of caucus felt he had been badly treated. For Rudd and his office to position Garrett as the fall guy was disgraceful, weak, sneaky, unprincipled and just plain wrong. All along, Peter properly put his objections to the administration of the program on the record. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a situation where Rudd executes complete and total influence, micromanages everything, yet not the home insulation program? The shape and execution of the program was certainly designed by the prime minister's office, if not the prime minister himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, they ain't; they ain't {{been paid}} in full at all; you knows they ain't." [...] As he said this, Mr. Hart walked on in front, {{and stood in}} the pathway, facing Mountjoy. [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>'ave</b> the cheek to say we've been paid in full? You know it ain't true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better stand guard," [...] I replied. [...] "If any {{one comes}} {{get them out}} of the {{forecastle}} the best way <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> a chisel or something like it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] he said, [...] "I {{wish you}} would {{let me give you}} a lift in the only way I <b>can.</b> <b>You</b> know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never any idea of economy, and I'm afraid you must find it hard to get along." ...|$|R
2500|$|Samantha Womack {{admitted}} that she thought the plot was [...] "implausible". She commented: [...] "I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one," [...] she told the Daily Mirror. [...] "But Ronnie is a soap character {{and she is not}} necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it." [...] On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented [...] "in an offensive manner" [...] because it [...] "appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world." ...|$|E

5000|$|Johnson was {{selected}} in the inaugural United Football League (UFL) draft by the New York Sentinels. Johnson had said at UFL tryouts, [...] "It's a chance to keep playing football ... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to take every opportunity <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to keep knocking on doors. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to show them <b>you</b> <b>can</b> compete, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the physical tools they want." [...] He signed with the team on August 5, 2009, but was released on September 28, 2009.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, very well, if {{you think}} you're worth it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>'ave</b> it." [...] Then he paused and sometimes, with a steely eye, added: [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>'ave</b> your notice too." ...|$|R
