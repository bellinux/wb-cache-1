40|$|Purple blotch of onion by Alternaria porri (Ellis) Neerg. causes heavy {{yield loss}} in both bulb and seed crops. Using {{biocontrol}} agent {{to manage the}} disease {{is one of the}} most important approaches for successful disease management and sustainable onion production. For the development of bioagents based strategy seventeen isolates of fungal and six isolates of bacterial bioagents obtained from different sources were tested for their bioefficacy against A. porri. Effective isolates (Th- 3, Th- 30, Tv- 12, Tv- 15, Pf- 3 and Bs- 2) were selected and tested for volatile and non-volatile metabolites production and vigour induction under in vitro. Trichoderma harzianum isolate (Th- 3) expressed high level of disease reduction and growth promotion in susceptible onion (cv. Pusa Red) when different methods viz., seed treatment, seedling dip and three foliar sprays were evaluated on onion bulb <b>crop</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> house and field conditions. Field experiments (2008 - 2010) on onion seed crop also confirmed the potential of Th- 3 isolate on disease suppression and growth promotion. </p...|$|E

40|$|How can {{the harmful}} Duponchelia insect best be trapped for optimum detection? A water trap {{was found to}} be most {{effective}} in a field test by Plant Research International. Another advantage is the low maintenance required by this trap. The composition of the Duponchelia sex pheromone was identified just over a year ago and now growers are using pheromone traps on a large scale for a timely detection of this difficult pest insect. The caterpillars of this moth cause damage in all sorts of <b>crops</b> grown <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> such as the floricultural crops kalanchoë, begonia, cyclamen, gerbera and ros...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{presents}} the environmental {{aspects of the}} use, management and disposal of mineral wool. Fiber structure makes that wool products have many unique properties enabling them to be versatile. With all the advantages of mineral wool is one very significant drawback - does not decompose. From {{the point of view}} of slowing (retardation) transformation of environmental resources, the introduction of mineral wool to <b>crops</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> in a very much reduced use of peatlands, which for reasons of natural resources are extremely important. On the other hand, problems of rational use of mineral wool already postconsumer caused among others formation of "wild dumps" and thus transforming the landscape, and, due to their characteristics (respirable fibers), the risk to health. Manufacture of asbestiform can cause ecological consequences within almost all elements of the environment. Therefore, the overall assessment of the impact in this case, mineral wool on the environment would need to be so. "Life cycle assessment" - called the method of LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) which is commonly called the "cradle to grave" - that is, from extraction of raw materials, through processing, exploitation, to the storage of waste. Therefore, the responsibility for the redevelopment of the post-production of mineral wool should lie with the producer of wool. These issues are the subject of discussion in this study...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{believed}} to be native to Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico. It has spread to certain Caribbean Islands, Hawaii and French Guiana, and also to parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Indonesia and Thailand. It was discovered in Bradenton, Florida, in the United States in 1998 feeding on hibiscus, and four years later it had been detected on eighteen different plant species in the state. It has since been found in Texas and California and it is likely to become more widely distributed on the Gulf Coast, and perhaps also in <b>crops</b> grown <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> further north in the United States. The introduction of this species has caused damage to papaya cultivation in South India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.It was recently noted in Réunion in the Indian Ocean.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the greenhouse industry in Iowa in the last decade, lettuce {{has become the most}} important vegetable <b>crop</b> grown <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> in this state. In some seasons a disease known as downy mildew {{is one of the most}} serious troubles met with in forcing this crop. Competition with garden lettuce from the Pacific Coast and the Gulf States, together with the high cost of production in recent years, makes the control of downy mildew an urgent question with many Iowa growers. The downy mildew of lettuce, long known as a destructive garden and greenhouse disease, is caused by a parasitic fungus. Brenda lactucae, which is widely distributed in both Europe and America. It is somewhat similar to the fungus which causes rose mildew, and develops typical white, downy growths which are readily seen. These are found especially on the lower surface of the leaf. They consist of grayish masses of fungous growth, which produce myriads of spores, conidophores, by which the fungus is propagated...|$|R
