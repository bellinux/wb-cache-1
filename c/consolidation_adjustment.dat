In case if companies cannot achieve an additional capital from shareholders, the need for funding can be achieved only through financial intermediation services and implicitly through the services that we treat in this paper. Lately non-banking financial services have witnessed an interesting evolution, which led us to realize an analysis of their dynamics in Romania in the period 2008 - 2013, for which we have used the studies of literature and statistical data provided by the National Institute of Statistics and the National Bank of Romania.

Results confirm the hypotheses that, besides economic conditions, fragmentation of decision-making, ideology of the party in government, and closeness to elections affect fiscal policy in general and adjustment strategies in particular. During the nineties, the ideology of the party in government has become the most powerful predictor of fiscal policies and strategies of adjustment. Evidence shows that in the new context, socialist governments prefer to use balanced budgets to finance supply-side policies of capital formation and to maintain public employment, and are reluctant to cut these expenditures even at the expense of public consumption and transfers.

When the renewable energy industry matches its internal advantages to its external opportunities, it will create core competencies in meeting the basic requirements of China’s energy sector.

The total investment in those renewables projects including solar power and wind power has suffered a sharp decline, and unfortunately, the trend of investment shrinking is likely to continue. Once the correction period occurs, the investment shrinkage will be reversed. The shrinkage is attributed to external causes at best, while the real reasons for the shortage of funds in the renewable energy market are still the internal ones.

The results show that large and back-loaded fiscal adjustments have the highest likelihood of success. Fiscal consolidations based on expenditure cuts increase the probability of approaching and achieving fiscal sustainability but are insufficient to maintain it unless accompanied by revenue reforms. Adjustment episodes launched in countries where governments enjoy a parliamentary majority and do not face imminent elections, are found to be more successful.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In the past, five {{different}} monitoring systems {{were used in}} the various areas of the care supply for substance-related problems in Switzerland, without any real coordination between them. In 1999, a project aiming at the harmonisation of these five monitoring systems was launched by federal agencies. A further aim was to ensure compatibility with the Treatment Demand Indicator (TDI) adopted as European standard. METHODS: The different steps of the conceptualisation process and their rationales are described. They involve a first phase of consultation among all key players, a second phase of preliminary realisation according to the target criteria, a third phase of probation by the application of a pilot survey, and a last phase of <b>consolidation</b> and <b>adjustments</b> before the official implementation. RESULTS: A comprehensive and flexible monitoring system was settled for all fields of the addiction care in Switzerland. It consists of a fully standardised pool of core items to be shared by the five treatment sectors as well as optional items intended for specific needs. The practical aspects of the implementation, like data protection, organisation of data collection, and valorisation of the results are presented. The first experiences in the different treatment sectors are also reported. CONCLUSION: The implementation of "act-info" is still an ongoing process that began in 2003. Since 2005, the new monitoring system is well implemented in three out of five treatment sectors, whereas its introduction proves more challenging in the two remaining sectors.

40|$|Private {{investment}} {{is the principal}} transmission channel through which fiscal policy affects growth in high-income countries. In low-income countries, governance and also other considerations suggest that the primary channel is factor productivity. Empirical results reported in this paper confirm this expectation: in low-income countries, factor productivity is some four times more effective than investment as a channel for increasing growth through fiscal policy. Although the private investment response to fiscal contraction may be minor, high-deficit, low-income countries can nonetheless benefit from a reduction in unsustainable fiscal deficits because of governance-related factor productivity responses that increase growth.

The report made clear that the railway had over-extended itself with large capital projects sustained by profits from its passenger traffic, which suddenly declined as a result of the crisis. Several of the country lines were losing money, and resultantly Schuster was forced to resign in favour of new chairman Peter Northall Lawrie. This led to a period of network <b>consolidation,</b> and engineering <b>adjustment</b> of the LB&SCR system by Banister to cope only with defined traffic bottlenecks.

The second vector of influence is based on the national background and on domestic politics: Which is the room of manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or transmitter?

40|$|We use a {{panel of}} 21 OECD {{countries}} from 1970 to 2009 to investigate the effects of different fiscal adjustment strategies on long-term interest rates – a key fiscal indicator reflecting the costs of government debt service. A government confronted with high deficits and rising debt will sooner or later need to enact fiscal adjustments {{in order to avoid}} solvency problems. Over the last four decades, such measures taken by governments in OECD countries have varied in duration, size, composition and in their success to re-establish fiscal sustainability. Controlling for various economic, fiscal and political factors, we find that the size and the composition of a fiscal adjustment significantly affect interest rates as well as yield spreads. Adjustments that are relatively large and those that primarily depend on expenditure cuts lead to substantially lower long-term interest rates. However, periods of fiscal adjustments do not generally have an influence on interest rates, even if they were successful and led to lower deficits and debt levels. Instead, financial markets only seem to value strict and decisive measures – a clear sign that the government’s pledge to cut the deficit is credible. fiscal <b>adjustment,</b> <b>consolidation</b> policy, government debt, deficit, interest rates...|$|R
