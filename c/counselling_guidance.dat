40|$|Mentorship {{relationship}} {{as a system}} of knowledge, reciprocal learning, acting and relationship-building After the introductory discussion on how to conceptualize mentoring, a process with many dimensions: teaching, <b>counselling,</b> <b>guidance,</b> animation, friendship and many other, the author deals with the mentoring relationship (edu-cation and communication) within mentoring pairs. In a mentoring relationship there are two actors, a mentor and a mentee. There is also a »third, excluded partner« (company, educational organisation, etc.) providing supportive organisational rules for the mentoring relationship. The author examines {{the transformation of the}} mentor, mentee and their social environment as well as the process of transmission of knowledge. She points out that the significance of a mentoring relationship lies less in the transmission of knowledge than in the mentor’s and mentee’s joint creation of new knowledge. She stresses the importance of action, the main drive for learning. A mentoring relationship includes communication and reciprocity as well as transmission of knowledge by means of predominantly non-informal edu- cational programmes, as well as learning and relationship building. It has several phases, some of which are more interactive than others, with more cognitive dissonance and with richer emotions...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} neuropsychiatric disabilities {{has increased}} in recent years, resulting in {{an increasing number of}} adults requesting neuropsychiatric evaluation. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe adult clients' experiences of participating actively in a supportive assessment process in which they received a diagnosis of either autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and then received follow-up <b>counselling,</b> <b>guidance,</b> and compensatory resources that were immediate and directly integrated into the diagnostic experience. The Occupational Performance History Interview – Second Version (OPHI-II) was selected because it is client-centred. It measures how a significant life event affects a person's occupational identity, occupational competence, and interaction with the environment. The OPHI-II was administered to capture 15 participants' experiences of being diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD as the significant life event of focus. Three categories were formed by using qualitative content analysis: (i) strengthened occupational identity; (ii) compensatory support enhances occupational competence, and (iii) effects of the social environment on relationships. Findings indicated that the diagnostic experience had transformative effects on participants' occupational identities, occupational competence, and ability to self-advocate for increased understanding and resources within their environments.

40|$|Master of EducationThe {{development}} of the school psychology, guidance and welfare work of <b>Counselling,</b> <b>Guidance</b> and Clinical Services (formerly the Psychology Branch, then-the-Psychology and-Guidance Branch) 1947 - 1985 is presented. Archival material and interviews with former administrators provided {{the sources of the}} finding. On the whole, the services developed in the manner described in the literature on this topic. The very early work was in the traditional mode: psychometric, direct services to children. Subsequently, the range extended to include the four levels of intervention discussed by Joel Meyers (1973) : direct services to children, indirect services to children, direct services to teachers and services to the school as a system. In addition, services to the Department/Ministry of Education and to the community of which the school is a part were provided. Some research was conducted and liaison with tertiary institutions and professional bodies was emphasized. The extension of the range of services appears to have been an appropriate response to the increasing demands on the psychology, guidance and welfare staff. Current developments in Victorian education suggest that, while all levels of intervention will be required, much attention should be given to services to the school system and to the community of which the school is a part. Services at the systems level, however, will continue to be geared to facilitating the optimal {{development of}} the individual child in the system. Suggestions for further research are made.

These particular statistics indicate only the number of reported cases, which according to Lewis (1999) and Starke (1995) should be tripled to estimate the true number of children being abused every day. Action research was selected for this study to assist the parents and the children in extending their understanding of their situation and thus resolve problems that confront them. A high percentage of parents are aware that abuse and neglect exists in their relationships; they are also aware that behavioural problems may be exhibited by their children as a result of exposure to abuse and neglect. There is a growing need for <b>counselling,</b> <b>guidance</b> and support amongst the youth to be assertive, and be safe in their contexts. The psycho-education programme was based on the model of psychoeducation. Psycho-education as an alternative does not focus on sick or abnormal behaviour but rather has as its core a preventative focus-training in skills to solve problems now and in the future. During group work the children were trained to collectively experience, explore and communicate their feelings, and to learn alternative ways of dealing with abuse and neglect in their different contexts. The programme's effectiveness was evaluated. All the children acquired prevention concepts after the exposure to the programme. Fifty six percent of the parents observed some improvement in their children's behaviour, and eighty percent of the children reported that they were still afraid to talk to their parents about issues of discipline, for example corporal punishment...|$|E

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} on the learning support provision for learners with visual impairment at a senior secondary school in Botswana. The objectives {{of the study were}} to describe and explain the learning support provided to the learners with visual impairment at the school and to suggest ways for improving the learning support services to the learners. The study is qualitative in nature. The target population was the school community and its stakeholders. Data was collected using document study, interviews and observation. Qualitative data analysis was employed extensively through descriptions. The research study findings established that {{there are a variety of}} learning support programmes provided to learners with visual impairment at the school to enhance their understanding of the academic material. The learning support programmes range from <b>counselling,</b> <b>guidance,</b> advisory, consultancy, assessment, physical orientation of the environment, the school curriculum, tactile orientation of graphically presented learning materials to mention but a few. However, these learning support programmes are not adequate and effective enough to help the learners perform better academically. The shortage of human and material resources especially in the recent past has negatively influenced the performance of learners with visual impairment. There are also main areas of weaknesses such as lack of adequate stakeholder consultation and involvement in the planning and implementation of special educational programmes. The study recommends that partnership between the school and its stakeholders be improved. It is also important that the entire school community and stakeholders be involved in thoughtful, carefully researched learning support programmes. Large class sizes, imbalances in resource provision, counselling services and low production rate of learning and teaching materials at the Resource Centre all need serious attention.

40|$|Children are {{vulnerable}} {{due to their}} age and developmental level. They rely on parents and other adults for survival and care. However, some children become more vulnerable than others as parents and families are poor and cannot afford {{to provide for their}} basic needs. Poverty can make children vulnerable by depriving them of their right to have their basic needs met, such as food, health care, clothing and shelter. While this situation is affected by high rates of unemployment it is also compounded by chronic illness such as HIV and AIDS. The effects of poverty, unemployment, and HIV and AIDS can {{have a negative impact on}} children’s physical, psychological, social and intellectual development. In its quest to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable children, the South African government makes provision for the establishment of drop-in centres (Children’s Act 38 of 2005). Drop-in centres are facilities aimed at addressing the physical, emotional, psychological and social developmental needs of vulnerable children within their communities and closer to their homes. Drop-in centres provide basic services such as food, clothing, school support and hygiene, as well as optional services such as <b>counselling,</b> <b>guidance,</b> life skills development and educational and recreational programmes. The goal of this study was to explore the experiences of vulnerable children regarding services they receive from drop-in centres. A qualitative research approach was followed and in-depth interviews were conducted to obtain information from a group of 12 adolescent participants on their experiences of the services they received from drop-in centres. The participants were selected based on stratified random sampling. The findings of the study indicate that participants received basic services such as food, clothing and school attendance support, as well as psychosocial support services from the drop-in centres. The participants were of the opinion that the services they received at the drop-in centres resulted in an improvement in their general appearance, self-esteem, school performance, health, friendships and life skills. It can be concluded that participants’ experiences of the services provided by drop-in centres proved positive on a number of aspects. The services enhanced their quality of life, their dignity and their general sense of well-being. The findings suggest that drop-in centres can attain their purpose as an intervention strategy for providing accessible, community-based services to meet the physical, emotional and social developmental needs of vulnerable children. The participants as a group of vulnerable children, benefited from the services which they received, which is in support of developmental social welfare. It is important that services are provided within an environment in which children’s rights to confidentiality and respect are upheld. Recommendations include that increased funding is essential for maintaining the basic services of drop-in centres, as well as expanding the optional services such as sport and recreation programmes. As the findings of the study cannot be generalised because of the small sample size, further research on the topic is recommended.
