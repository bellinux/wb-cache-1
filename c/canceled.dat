40|$|Background/Objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{incidence}} of <b>cancelling</b> treasury shares events in Malaysia and examines the financial characteristics of companies that {{are more likely to}} <b>cancel</b> their shares. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The study utilizes descriptive analysis to assess {{the incidence of}} <b>cancelling</b> treasury share events among non-financial and non utility Malaysian companies. Tobit regression analysis is used to gauge the relationship between firm financial characteristics and the incidence of <b>cancelling</b> treasury share events. Findings: There were a total of 175 events of <b>cancelling</b> treasury shares occurred between the years 2001 and 2012. This study finds that profitability positively and significantly affects the decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury shares, while excess cash flows negatively influence a firm’s decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury shares. Furthermore, smaller size companies are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>cancelling</b> their shares. Application/Improvements: The study finds that smaller firms are more likely to <b>cancel</b> their treasury shares as these companies may have severe information asymmetry problems...|$|R
