5000|$|Pectinase is {{an enzyme}} that breaks down pectin, a {{polysaccharide}} found in plant cell walls. Commonly {{referred to as}} pectic enzymes, they include pectolyase, pectozyme, and polygalacturonase, {{one of the most}} studied and widely used commercial pectinases. It is useful because pectin is the jelly-like matrix which helps cement plant cells together and in which other cell wall components, such as cellulose fibrils, are embedded. Therefore, pectinase enzymes are commonly used in processes involving the degradation of plant materials, such as speeding up the extraction of fruit juice from fruit, including apples and sapota. Pectinases have also been used in wine production since the 1960s. The function of pectinase in brewing is twofold, first it helps break down the plant (typically fruit) material and so helps the extraction of flavours from the mash. Secondly the presence of pectin in finished wine causes a haze or slight cloudiness. Pectinase is used to break this down and so <b>clear</b> the <b>wine.</b>|$|R

He also introduced corks (instead of wood), which were fastened to bottles with hemp string soaked in oil in order to keep the wines fresh and sparkling, and used thicker glass in order to strengthen the bottles (which were prone to explode at that time). The development of sparkling wines as the main style of production in Champagne occurred progressively in the 19th century, more than a century after Dom Pérignon's death.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the erosive effect of different wine samples on the enamel of human permanent teeth. Twenty-one extracted, sound, permanent human incisor teeth were imbedded in epoxy resin and seven immersed in each of the three different wine samples for 0, 2, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute periods. The Knoop hardness for each tooth at each of the immersed periods was determined as a measure of the degree of enamel erosion (demineralisation). The main finding was that all three wines eroded enamel (softer enamel) which should mainly be due to their very low pH values (3. 2, 3. 7, 3. 8) and high total acid content. From the Wilcoxon non-parametric tests it was <b>clear</b> that <b>wine</b> 2 had the severest influence on the hardness of the teeth, and the wines differed significantly (p 5 %). It is concluded that all three wine samples were erosive to enamel and it is difficult to predict the relative erosion rate of different kinds of wines according to their chemical compositions, as this process is most probably governed and affected by a large number of a combination of factors. The only reliable way to know the exact degree of erosion of a specific wine is by means of a laboratory study. Possible ways to decrease the damaging effect of erosion caused by wine are provided.
