50|$|Several {{types of}} tray {{are used in}} {{different}} applications. A solid-bottom tray provides the maximum protection to cables, but requires cutting the tray or using fittings to enter or exit cables. A deep, solid enclosure for cables is called a cable channel or <b>cable</b> <b>trough.</b>|$|E
40|$|Have {{you ever}} had {{problems}} sorting your cables, are the winders you use too big and crude then the EC-winder is the product for you. The EC-winder concept is a compact and intelligent winder for home application. Its simple design and subtle looks enables it {{to blend in with}} the surrounding environment. Its function is designed so that it with ease can be handled by any one after only a couple of instructions. You simply thread the <b>cable</b> <b>trough</b> the opening on the winder and then you rotate the upper part until the cable reaches the desired length. After use the winder can be opened to enable easy extraction of the cable...|$|E
40|$|Cable {{circuits}} {{installed in}} unfilled troughs must often support high current ratings. To achieve higher ratings in unfilled troughs in the U. K., trough lids {{can be replaced}} by ventilated grilles, provided that the trough is within a substation site. While several methods exist for rating the traditional covered trough design, no standard method exists for naturally ventilated installations. To examine the possible uprating available, a coupled numerical model has been created for <b>cable</b> <b>trough</b> installations. Following successful benchmarking tests where the covered trough was modelled, the method has been extended to troughs with full natural ventilation. The results have been compared to commonly used engineering assumptions in order to validate simpler analytical methods. It was found that by allowing full natural ventilation of existing covered troughs, the continuous rating could be increased {{by as much as}} 28 %...|$|E

50|$|A new {{purpose was}} found for the canal route in 1979, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) {{installed}} underground <b>cables</b> in a <b>trough</b> below the towpath between St John's Wood and City Road. These 400 kV cables now form part of the National Grid, supplying electrical power to London. Pumped canal water is circulated as a coolant for the high-voltage cables.|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} about choice of {{internet}} connection. In my paper I focus on application methods of multicriterial evaluation of alternatives (VHV) on {{different types of}} internet connection. In my paper I want to compare different types of VHV and I want to say if they are convenient or not to use them in choice of internet connection. In this paper I compare different tariffs of internet connection and different types of internet connections between each other. For comparison I chose ADSL connection, connection <b>trough</b> <b>cable</b> TV and wireless connection. In comparison I used next methods: lexicographical method, ORESTE, WSA, TOPSIS and ELECTRE III. For internet connection is the best to use connection <b>trough</b> <b>cable</b> TV, second is ADSL connection and the worst is wireless connection. Lexicographical method is not very good for choice of internet connection. It is usable only in special cases. Other methods are acceptable for choice of internet connection...|$|R
40|$|Often river dunes are {{considered}} as regular bed patterns, {{with a mean}} dune height and a mean dune length. In reality however, river dunes are threedimensional and irregular features that cannot be fully described by their mean values. In fact, dune dimensions {{can be considered as}} stochastic variables. Their probability distribution can be characterized by a mean value and variance. The stochastic properties of dune dimensions are relevant for (see e. g. Van der Mark et al., 2005) : • Shipping - highest crests • Pipelines & <b>cables</b> - deepest <b>troughs</b> • Modelling cross-strata sets - troughs, dune heights • Modelling vertical sorting - troughs • Modelling bed roughness - dune heights In the present research the stochastics of crest elevation, trough elevation and dune height are investigated by analysing three sets of flume experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} a modeling procedure for a DC traction power system (TPS) of electrified railway to study lightning transients with EMTP. The TPS included overhead lines, electric cables on the ground, masts and other associated components. The nonlinear ionization characteristic of earth resistance and the flashover characteristic of insulators {{were taken into}} account. These models were integrated to represent the whole TPS in open track, which was subject to a lightning stroke. Lightning transients on the TPS were simulated using EMTP. The maximum voltage on the <b>cables</b> installed in <b>trough</b> was estimated. The crest voltage under different stroke scenarios was presented to address {{the risk of a}} flashover on the cables in the paper. A sensitivity study of earth resistance for the masts is presented finally. The low earth resistance effectively reduces the surge voltage on the cablesDepartment of Building Services EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
