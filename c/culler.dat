5|$|Bickford was {{expected}} to start the 1948 season {{in the minor leagues}} due to lack of control. However, a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster. His Major League debut was on April 24, 1948 in a 16–9 loss against the New York Giants. He entered in relief {{at the top of the}} fourth inning, after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning. He got Sid Gordon to hit to a double play and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize, he retired Willard Marshall on a grounder to end the inning. He made his first career start against the Pirates, a 4–1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits. On June 7, he pitched a four-hitter in an 11–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, throwing five perfect innings before giving up a hit to Dick <b>Culler</b> to start the sixth inning. He finished with an 11–5 mark and a 3.27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In his only World Series appearance, he started Game 3, where he gave up one run on four hits in 3.1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate causes of <b>culling</b> in industrial dairy herds in Fars province and to describe the pattern of reason-specific <b>culling</b> with respect to age of animal and interval from calving to <b>culling.</b> A total number of 9 dairy herds were selected for the study and information about <b>culling</b> reasons, birth date, last calving date and <b>culling</b> date was collected for <b>culled</b> cows during 2005 - 2006. Infertility (32. 6 % of all <b>culls)</b> was the most prevalent reason of <b>culling</b> followed by mastitis (6. 5 %). The time interval from last calving to <b>culling</b> averaged 240 days (SD = 176) and nearly 28 % of cows were <b>culled</b> in the first 100 days after calving. Mean age of animals at <b>culling</b> was 6 years (SD = 2. 7) and median was 5. 7 years. In Cox proportional hazard model for calving to <b>culling</b> interval, infertility (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 26) showed lower risk whereas mastitis (HR = 2. 40), left displaced abomasum (HR = 2. 60) and peripartum problems (HR = 2. 60) had higher risk of <b>culling</b> compared with voluntary <b>cull.</b> In the Cox model for age at <b>culling,</b> risk of <b>culling</b> was significantly higher for infertility (HR = 1. 70), left displaced abomasum (HR = 3. 15), and peripartum problems (HR = 2. 10) compared with voluntary <b>culling.</b> In conclusion, farmers tend to keep infertile cows for longer period from calving to <b>culling</b> while infertile cows are generally <b>culled</b> at younger age.

40|$|AbstractTo {{describe}} proportion {{and pattern}} of <b>culling</b> in commercial dairy herds of Khorasan Razavi Province, this survey {{was carried out}} from 21 st March 2008 to 20 th March 2009 in 15 industrialized dairy herds. For each <b>culled</b> cow data related to parity at <b>culling,</b> last calving to <b>culling</b> interval and primary reason for <b>culling</b> were recorded. Annual herd exit rate was 20. 9 %. Out {{of a total of}} 652 <b>culled</b> cows, the proportions of <b>culled</b> dairy cows were due mainly to involuntary <b>culling</b> with very small proportion of voluntary <b>culling</b> (4 %). The involuntary <b>culling</b> were mainly from infertility or reproductive disorders (23. 6 %), udder disorders (17. 5 %) and digestive tract disorders (15. 9 %). Average ± SD of parity at <b>culling</b> was 3. 15 ± 1. 96. <b>Culled</b> cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and infectious diseases were significantly younger than those of other <b>culling</b> reasons (P < 0. 05). Mean ± SD of last calving to <b>culling</b> interval was 194 ± 159 days. <b>Culled</b> cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and udder disorders were removed earlier in lactation period than cows <b>culled</b> from reproductive disorders, infectious diseases and lameness (P < 0. 05). Low proportion of voluntary and high percentage of involuntary <b>culling</b> specially from health problems should be considered as an important economic loss and precaution measures are necessary to reduce this loss...|$|R
40|$|This study {{studied the}} {{relation}} between longevity, the interval from last insemination to <b>culling</b> in days (IL 2 C) with 7 different <b>cull</b> classes; 1.

Peri-partum <b>cull</b> class and 7. Unknown <b>cull</b> class. Overall, the most important <b>cull</b> classes were reproduction (19 %) and production (50 %). The IL 2 C for production (146. 3 ± 1. 2) and reproduction (87. 4 ± 1. 9) were significantly {{different from each other}} but also from locomotion (127. 0 ± 3. 6), accident (120. 1 ± 7. 3), general disorder (105. 4 ± 5. 5), peri-partum (109. 6 ± 5. 7) <b>cull</b> classes. Sows that were <b>culled</b> for production reasons had significantly the highest average parity number at <b>culling</b> (4. 6 ± 0. 2) compared to all other <b>culling</b> reasons such as reproduction (3. 1 ± 0. 2), locomotion (2. 3 ± 0. 3), accident (2. 9 ± 0. 5), general disorder (3. 3 ± 0. 4) and peri-partum (3. 3 ± 0. 4) <b>cull</b> classes. Furthermore, it was found that age in days, parity number at <b>culling</b> and IL 2 C showed to be heritable traits (0. 13 ± 0. 05, 0. 16 ± 0. 05 and 0. 10 ± 0. 04 respectively). The genetic correlation between parity number at <b>culling</b> and IL 2 C was not significantly different from 0 (- 0. 04 ± 0. 28). Because IL 2 C is a heritable trait and sows that are <b>culled</b> within the production <b>cull</b> class obtain on average a higher parity and show the longest IL 2 C, this study showed the potential to select on longer IL 2 C and thereby select against sows to be <b>culled</b> within the reproduction, locomotion, accident, general disorder and peri-partum <b>cull</b> class and to be <b>culled</b> {{at the end of a}} parity. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cull</b> {{cows are}} often {{overlooked}} {{as an important}} source of income to the cow-calf enterprise. Depending upon the relationships between <b>cull</b> cow and calf prices, and the herd <b>culling</b> rate, <b>cull</b> cow receipts generally account for 15 - 30 percent of income from the cow-calf enterprise. However, some producers give little attention to this source of income and ways of enhancing it. For many producers, <b>cull</b> cows are sold at the time <b>culling</b> takes place, and much of this <b>culling</b> is done in the late fall soon after calves are weaned. Is it most profitable to sell cows when they are <b>culled,</b> or should they be fed for a period of time? Several factors need to be considered to properly answer that question and that is {{the purpose of this paper}} and presentation. Cows are <b>culled</b> from a herd for a number of reasons and the reason for <b>culling</b> will most likely affect the time <b>culling</b> takes place and could alter the most profitable marketing strategy. Reproductive failure, problems resulting from old age, and unsatisfactory performance are the most common reasons for <b>culling</b> an animal. While reproductive failure is generally diagnosed in the fall of the year, <b>culling</b> for other reasons could take place at other times. Three factors of importance regarding the decision to sell cows when <b>culled</b> versus feeding them and selling at a latter time are: (1) the seasonality of <b>cull</b> cow prices, (2) the price difference between <b>cull</b> cow slaughter grades and the percentage of <b>cull</b> cows in each grade, and (3) the cost of feeding <b>cull</b> cows.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{effective}} control {{of human and}} livestock diseases is challenging where infection persists in wildlife populations. The Randomised Badger <b>Culling</b> Trial (RBCT) demonstrated that, while it was underway, proactive badger (Meles meles) <b>culling</b> reduced bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidence inside <b>culled</b> areas but increased incidence in neighboring areas, suggesting {{that the costs of}} such <b>culling</b> might outweigh the benefits. Objectives and designThe objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>culling</b> impacts persisted more than one year following the cessation of <b>culling</b> (the ‘post-trial’ period). We compared TB incidence in and around RBCT proactive <b>culling</b> areas with that in and around matched unculled areas. Results: During the post-trial period, cattle TB incidence inside <b>culled</b> areas was reduced, to an extent significantly greater (p= 0. 002) than during <b>culling.</b> In neighboring areas, elevated risks observed during <b>culling</b> were not observed post-trial (p= 0. 038). However, the post-trial effects were comparable to those observed towards the end of the trial (inside RBCT areas: p= 0. 18 and neighboring areas: p= 0. 14). ConclusionsAlthough to-date the overall benefits of <b>culling</b> remain modest, they were greater than was apparent during the <b>culling</b> period alone. Continued monitoring will demonstrate how long beneficial effects last, indicating the overall capacity of such <b>culling</b> to reduce cattle TB incidence...|$|R

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB) has re-emerged as a {{major problem}} for British cattle farmers.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of widespread invasive {{species such as}} wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is limited by resources available to devote to the effort. Better insight {{of the effectiveness of}} different management strategies on population dynamics is important for guiding decisions of resource allocation over space and time. Using a dynamic population model, we quantified effects of <b>culling</b> intensities and time between <b>culling</b> events on population dynamics of wild pigs in the USA using empirical <b>culling</b> patterns and data-based demographic parameters. In simulated populations closed to immigration, substantial population declines (50 - 100 %) occurred within 4 years when 20 - 60 % of the population was <b>culled</b> annually, but when immigration from surrounding areas occurred, there was a maximum of 50 % reduction, even with the maximum <b>culling</b> intensity of 60 %. Incorporating hypothetical levels of fertility control with realistic <b>culling</b> intensities was most effective in reducing populations when they were closed to immigration and when intrinsic population growth rate was too high (> = 1. 78) to be controlled by <b>culling</b> alone. However, substantial benefits from fertility control used in conjunction with <b>culling</b> may only occur over a narrow range of net population growth rates (i. e., where net is the result of intrinsic growth rates and <b>culling)</b> that varies depending on intrinsic population growth rate. The management implications are that the decision to use fertility control in conjunction with <b>culling</b> should rely on concurrent consideration of achievable <b>culling</b> intensity, underlying demographic parameters, and costs of <b>culling</b> and fertility control. The addition of fertility control reduced abundance substantially more than <b>culling</b> alone, however the effects of fertility control were weaker than in populations without immigration. Because these populations were not being reduced substantially by <b>culling</b> alone, fertility control could be an especially helpful enhancement to <b>culling</b> for reducing abundance to target levels in areas where immigration can't be prevented...|$|R
