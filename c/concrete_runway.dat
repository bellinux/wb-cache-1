We climbed up to about 200 metres, when {{suddenly}} two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E

All 90 passengers safely disembarked from the aircraft {{and returned to the}} pre-departure area.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, the Air Ministry {{decided to}} upgrade the {{airfield}} to bomber standard and, early in 1943, work began on laying concrete runways and the perimeter track to the Class A airfield standard, the main feature {{of which was a}} set of three converging runways each containing a <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern.|$|E

25|$|To {{improve the}} airport, it was {{upgraded}} with a <b>concrete</b> <b>runway,</b> which {{was completed in}} 1943. Prior to the war the only structures at Hattfjelldal were a church and some farms. By {{the end of the}} war there were significant structures which had been built at and around the airport, which were taken over by the community and became the municipal hall, school and community center. A major employer, Arbor, established itself in the hangar during the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The General Santos International Airport is {{the largest}} airport in Mindanao. It has a 3,227-metre <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> capable of {{handling}} wide-bodied jets like Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It was also called Rajah Buayan Airport in the 1990s and Tambler Airport in year 2008 before it was renamed to its current name. Flights to and from Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu are currently being operated in the airport by Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. General Santos International Airport is the second busiest airport in Mindanao and 9th busiest airport in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} thirty Curtiss C-46 Commandos (an {{unproven}} cargo transport whose performance was significantly {{superior to the}} C-47's in cargo capacity and ceiling) arrived in India on 21 April 1943. In May the 22nd Ferrying Group began C-46 operations from the still uncompleted base at Jorhat, which had a <b>concrete</b> <b>runway.</b> In June, {{despite the fact that}} the British—and later the U.S. Army's Services of Supply—failed to complete construction of all-weather runways at Mohanbari and Sookerating, the activation of the 28th, 29th, and 30th Transport Groups proceeded, an attempt to expand the C-46's role to meet projected levels of tonnage.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian {{military}} {{had no use}} for the entire encampment and defensive structures, and therefore most of the area was quickly returned to civilian use. However, the air station itself was of interest to the air force and was kept as a military installation. In December 1946 the military concluded that {{there was no need for}} the aerodrome and started the process of closing the facility. The wooden runway was dismantled and given as building supplies to the local population. Most of buildings were dismantled and moved elsewhere. The <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> was kept as an emergency airfield for civilian aircraft. Two of the major hangars burned down in 1947.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{government}} of the Republic of Vietnam requested the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to plan for expansion of the Tan Son Nhut airport. A taxiway parallel to the original runway had just been completed by the E.V. Lane company for the U.S. Operations Mission, but parking aprons and connections to the taxiways were required. Under the direction of the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction, these items were constructed by the American construction company RMK-BRJ in 1962. RMK-BRJ also constructed an air-control radar station in 1962, and the passenger and freight terminals in 1963. In 1967, RMK-BRJ constructed the second 10,000-foot <b>concrete</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash {{occurred}} on 10 July 1965 when Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV, flown during a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais Airport, Oise, France, crashed on landing at its intended destination of Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom. The accident {{was due to}} the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. This caused the nose wheels to dig in and the aircraft to overturn, losing both wings and the starboard tailplane in the process. All 52 people on board survived. This was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. A <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> was later installed at Lympne.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in May 1940. The aerodrome {{was then}} prepared {{through the summer}} of 1940 with <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> (the first in north Lincolnshire) to accommodate bombers of 1 Group. The aerodrome became operational {{in the summer of}} 1941 and was initially a satellite airfield for the nearby RAF Binbrook. The Wellington squadrons based at Binbrook would use Waltham as their own airfield did not have <b>concrete</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today {{the remains}} of the {{airfield}} are mostly woodland maintained by the Forestry Commission with the old <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> still accessible.|$|R
5000|$|On December 17, 1936 {{the airport}} opened as the [...] "Dayton Municipal Airport" [...] with three 3600 ft <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> and {{connecting}} taxiways.|$|R
25|$|During World War II (1939–1945) the Rock {{was again}} {{turned into a}} {{fortress}} and the civilian residents of Gibraltar were evacuated. Initially, in May 1940, 16,700 people went to French Morocco. However, after the French-German Armistice and the subsequent destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria by the British Navy in July 1940, the French-Moroccan authorities asked all Gibraltarian evacuees to be removed. 12,000 went to Britain, while about 3,000 went to Madeira or Jamaica, with the rest moving to Spain or Tanger. Control of Gibraltar gave the Allied Powers control of the entry to the Mediterranean Sea (the {{other side of the}} Strait being Spanish territory, and thus non-belligerent). The Rock was {{a key part of the}} Allied supply lines to Malta and North Africa and base of the British Navy Force H, and prior to the war the racecourse on the isthmus was converted into an airbase and a <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> constructed (1938). The repatriation of the civilians started in 1944 and proceeded until 1951, causing considerable suffering and frustration. However, most of the population had returned by 1946.|$|E
500|$|From 24 September to 5 November, 2 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 27 {{were based}} there. Facilities at the {{airfield}} were improved, by erecting new hangars and constructing a new [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>runway.</b> On 27 December 1940, Saint-Inglevert was again bombed by the Royal Air Force. The airfield was largely abandoned by 1941, with occasional use by Junkers 52s as a refuelling station.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1965 accident, {{which had}} been caused by the {{nose-wheel}} of the aircraft digging into soft ground, a [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> was constructed. It was reported in January 1968 that planning permission had been granted and the new runway came into use on 11 April 1968. Skyways Coach-Air leased an Avro 748 from Leeward Islands Air Transport in 1968 for a two-year period to replace the aircraft lost in the 1965 accident.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the site}} {{originally}} consisted of grass runways, flooding {{of the land}} soon caused these to become unusable, and two <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> were installed during 1942.|$|R
50|$|The airport has two {{parallel}} <b>runways</b> and one <b>concrete</b> helipad. The two <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> (08R/26L and 26R/08L) are each 4000 m long and 60 m wide.|$|R
50|$|It is {{situated}} 1270 m above sea level. It has two parallel <b>concrete</b> <b>runways,</b> one measuring 1219.2 m {{and the other}} measuring 2514.6 m in length.|$|R
500|$|Duxford {{remains an}} active {{airfield}} [...] and maintains two parallel runways; an unpaved 880m grass strip, and a <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> with a usable length of 1199m, both oriented at 060/240-degrees. The runway was originally purchased from the Ministry of Defence by the Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. In October 2008, an {{agreement was reached}} between the council and the Imperial War Museum, under which the runways and [...] of surrounding grassland would be sold to the museum for approximately £1.6 million.|$|E
500|$|Northolt {{became an}} active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and Polish Air Force squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It {{was the first}} RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with No.111 Squadron {{receiving}} the first four aircraft in December 1937, and reaching its full complement by February 1938. In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields. As a result, by 1939 Northolt had a new [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>runway.</b> Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields. Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with radios, compasses and speed indicators.|$|E
500|$|On September 18, the airmen woke up {{very early}} to make final preparations. A weather {{observation}} aircraft took off {{an hour before}} the first B-29 to report the latest meteorological conditions along the path ahead. Dumbo and Super Dumbo aircraft (B-17s and B-29s rigged for air-sea rescue) stood by, on alert. With the airfield lit by truck headlamps, Number 1 commanded by Giles was first to take off, a little after 6:00 local time, as dawn began to glow in the east. Next, LeMay's ship took off at 6:15am, 4:15pm Eastern War Time in Washington, with Lieutenant Colonel Kingsbury at the throttles and First Lieutenant Potts at the controls. O'Donnell's Number 3 took off a few minutes later. The heavily loaded machines required every bit of the [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> to get airborne—and some of the gravel beyond—reaching [...] before lifting from the ground. All three bombers were expected to be in Washington by 5pm the next day.|$|E
50|$|It {{opened on}} 15 November 1943 and closed on 31 March 1947, {{operating}} under RAF Transport Command. It consisted of 3 <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> in triangular configuration.|$|R
50|$|With KG 3 moved out, the Germans revamped Le Culot {{with two}} <b>concrete</b> <b>runways,</b> taxiways, <b>concrete</b> revetments, and a {{maintenance}} station including hangars, shops and barracks.|$|R
50|$|Twinwood Farm {{opened in}} mid 1941 when the RAF {{began to use}} the grassed field. By April 1942 it had three <b>concrete</b> <b>runways</b> and {{additional}} temporary buildings.|$|R
500|$|Nimoy {{approached}} ILM {{early in}} development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences. Many shots used matte paintings to extend backgrounds and create establishing shots without {{the cost of}} building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would [...] "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" [...] and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor Craig Barron believed that there were too many elements in the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Following the NATO {{expansion}} in the late 1950s, a new [...] <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> was built, aligned 14/32. Parallel to this runs a [...] concrete taxiway. This is a rebuilding and extension of the former wooden runway. The German <b>concrete</b> <b>runway</b> was kept, although relegated {{to serve as a}} secondary runway. The shooting field of Marka was located southeast of the aerodrome. It features twenty-four bunkers, including a commando bunker from the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|The airport meets International Civil Aviation Organization 4D standards. It has one <b>concrete</b> <b>runway,</b> 04/22, PCN 59/R/C/W/T, [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. The minimum {{visibility}} for take-off is 200 m.|$|E
5000|$|Felts Field - general {{aviation}} airport in Spokane located about 25 mi northeast of Cheney, with two <b>concrete</b> <b>runways,</b> and one water based runway for float planes.|$|R
50|$|RAF Finmere {{consisted}} of three <b>concrete</b> <b>runways,</b> radiating from two adjacent points in the north-west corner of the site, with twenty-seven hardstandings and two hangars (types B1 and T2).|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} built in early 1941 and opened in July of that year. It had three <b>concrete</b> <b>runways,</b> several {{permanent}} hangars and a watch office with meteorology section.|$|R
