In these interspecific incompatible <b>crosses,</b> <b>fertilization</b> takes place but the embryo aborts a few days later.

40|$|Aquaculture {{production}} of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{is expected to}} increase dramatically over the next decade, particularly in Norway. There is growing concern over the environmental impact of farmed escapees, especially the consequences of genetic introgression with wild coastal cod. Given the fact that Norwegian coastal cod stocks are presently at a historical low, knowledge on how farmed escapees can impact these wild populations through genetic introgression is of paramount importance. The ability of cod escapees to interact with their wild counterparts will depend on a number of factors including gamete quality. In order to determine whether spawning success of farmed escapees can be correlated to differences in sperm competition we undertook a spawning study using farmed and wild cod from the same putative coastal population. Multiple <b>cross</b> <b>fertilizations</b> were performed under controlled conditions using eggs from both wild and farmed females fertilized using milt of equal quantities from a wild and farmed male. Male paternity of the offspring was determined by microsatellite DNA analysis. In addition, blood samples were taken for steroid hormone analysis.

40|$|This {{is a book}} on {{symplectic}} topology, {{a rapidly}} developing field of mathematics which originated as a geometric tool for problems of classical mechanics. Since the 1980 s, powerful methods such as Gromov's pseudo-holomorphic curves and Morse-Floer theory on loop spaces {{gave rise to the}} discovery of unexpected symplectic phenomena. The present book focuses on function spaces associated with a symplectic manifold. A number of recent advances show that these spaces exhibit intriguing properties and structures, giving rise to an alternative intuition and new tools in symplectic topology. The book provides an essentially self-contained introduction into these developments along with applications to symplectic topology, algebra and geometry of symplectomorphism groups, Hamiltonian dynamics and quantum mechanics. It will appeal to researchers and students from the graduate level onwards. I like the spirit of this book. It formulates concepts clearly and explains the relationship between them.

40|$|International audienceClinical {{research}} {{may be seen}} {{in the context of the}} more general problem of an exchange of knowledge between psychopathology and neurosciences. While this interaction is not contested by the specialists in either field, we cannot, nonetheless, ignore the question of their various levels of congruence. More generally, we are increasingly aware of a need for enhanced formalization of the models derived from the two disciplines with a view to setting up transpositions or even <b>cross</b> <b>fertilizations.</b> The two communities, that of psychiatrists and that of neurobiologists, while they fascinate each other, have rarely been able to produce joint findings. The psychopathologist expects a positive validation of his clinical concepts from the neurobiologist, while the neurobiologist, who has frequently not resisted the etiological temptation, wants the clinician to give him pointers to enable him to refine his own experimental models. What is required, however, is that both the psychopathologist and the neurobiologist reduce their expectations and agree to move outside of their respective disciplinary autarkies. This would avoid two traps: that of the homological temptation which leads both to graft an experimental model onto clinical entities without checking the levels of congruence or non-congruence, making do with a simple behavioral similarity; the second error consists in using the complexity of the clinical picture as an unavoidable obstacle to any coming-together of the two disciplines.

2500|$|Genetic {{traits are}} {{contained}} within the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of chromosomes—by combining one of each type of chromosomes from each parent, an organism is formed containing a doubled set of chromosomes. This double-chromosome stage is called [...] "diploid", while the single-chromosome stage is [...] "haploid". Diploid organisms can, in turn, form haploid cells (gametes) that randomly contain one {{of each of the}} chromosome pairs, via meiosis. Meiosis also involves a stage of chromosomal crossover, in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched types of chromosomes, to form a new pair of mixed chromosomes. <b>Crossing</b> over and <b>fertilization</b> (the recombining of single sets of chromosomes to make a new diploid) result in the new organism containing a different set of genetic traits from either parent.|$|R
50|$|Reproductive {{isolation}} acts as {{the primary}} mechanism driving genetic divergence in allopatry and can be amplified by divergent selection. Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation are often the most cited mechanisms for allopatric speciation, and as such, {{it is difficult to}} determine which form evolved first in an allopatric speciation event. Pre-zygotic simply implies the presence of a barrier prior to any act of fertilization (e.g. an environmental barrier dividing two populations) while post-zygotic implies the prevention of successful inter-population <b>crossing</b> after <b>fertilization</b> (e.g. the production of an infertile hybrid). Since species pairs who diverged in allopatry often exhibit pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms, investigation of the earliest stages in the life cycle of the species can indicate whether or not divergence occurred due to a pre-zygotic or post-zygotic factor. However, establishing the specific mechanism may not be accurate, as a species pair continually diverges over time. For example, if a plant experiences a chromosome duplication event, reproduction will occur, but sterile hybrids will result—functioning as a form of post-zygotic isolation. Subsequently, the newly formed species pair may experience pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction as selection, acting on each species independently, will ultimately lead to genetic changes making hybrids impossible. From the researchers perspective, the current isolating mechanism may not reflect the past isolating mechanism.|$|R

Here we examine the efficacy of prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms within these corals including spawning times and choice and no-choice <b>fertilization</b> <b>crosses.</b> We show that these species have subtly different mean but overlapping spawning times, suggesting that temporal isolation is likely not an effective barrier to hybridization. We found species-specific differences in gametic incompatibilities. Acropora palmata eggs were relatively resistant to hybridization, especially when conspecific sperm are available to outcompete heterospecific sperm. Acropora cervicornis eggs demonstrated no evidence for gametic incompatibility and no evidence of reduced viability after aging four hours.
