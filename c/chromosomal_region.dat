5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region</b> containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region</b> is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region</b> that encodes an {{antibody}} {{is large}} and contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} {{sites in}} the cellular genome of human papillomavirus are located in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> always associated with oncogenes or other known tumor phenotypes. Two regions, 8 q 24 and 12 q 13, are common to several cases of cervical carcinoma and can have integrated more than one type of papillomavirus DNA. These two <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> contain several genes implicated in oncogenesis. These observations strongly imply that viral integration sites of DNA tumor viruses {{can be used as}} the access point to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> where genes implicated in the tumor phenotype are located, a situation similar to that of non-transforming retroviruses...|$|R

30|$|SD-containing <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> {{that did}} not {{correspond}} to or overlap hybrid barriers (either gametophyte or sterility genes) regions were detected on chromosome 2 (region for mSD at 29.91 – 31.48 Mbp of Nipponbare Pseudomolecule) and chromosome 12 (region for fSD at region of 19.44 – 25.00 Mbp).

25|$|The first {{imprinted}} genetic disorders to {{be described}} in humans were the reciprocally inherited Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Both syndromes are associated with loss of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region</b> 15q11-13 (band 11 of the long arm of chromosome 15). This region contains the paternally expressed genes SNRPN and NDN and the maternally expressed gene UBE3A.|$|E
25|$|DCC {{would fall}} into the {{chromosomal}} instability category. The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region</b> of 18q has shown consistent LOH for nearly twenty years. Approximately 70% of primary colorectal cancers display LOH in this region, and the percentage increases when comparing early to advanced cancers. This increase in DCC loss in advanced cancer may indicate that DCC loss {{is more important to}} tumour progression than tumour formation. However, region 18q is not the location of DCC alone, and many studies are in conflict when reporting whether 18q LOH is attributable to DCC or other tumour suppressor candidates in the neighbouring areas. Many reviews refuse to comment on DCC due to its history of conflicting information, stating that more study is required.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a diverse}} {{classification}} scheme {{for the various}} genomic changes that {{may contribute to the}} generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small <b>chromosomal</b> <b>region,</b> usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.|$|E
50|$|Employing a {{more general}} approach, {{researchers}} used genome-wide linkage analysis to identify <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> associated with political attitudes assessed using scores on a liberalism-conservativism scale. Their analysis identified several significant linkage peaks and the associated <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> implicate a possible role for NMDA and glutamate related receptors in forming political attitudes. However, this role is speculative as linkage analysis cannot identify the effect of individual genes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> can adopt {{stable and}} {{heritable}} alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without {{changes to the}} DNA sequence. Epigenetic control {{is often associated with}} alternative covalent modifications of histones. The stability and heritability of states of larger <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> are suggested to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. A simplified stochastic model for this type of epigenetics is found here.|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} feature {{enrichment}} {{is a widely}} used method to characterize a set of genes. While several tools have been designed for nominal features such as Gene Ontology annotations or KEGG Pathways, very little has been proposed to tackle numerical features such as the chromosomal positions of genes. For instance, microarray studies typically generate gene lists that are differentially expressed in the sample subgroups under investigation, and when studying diseases caused by genome alterations, it is {{of great interest to}} delineate the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> that are significantly enriched in these lists. In this article, we present a positional gene enrichment analysis method (PGE) for the identification of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> that are significantly enriched in a given set of genes. The strength of our method relies on an original query optimization approach that allows to virtually consider all the possible <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> for enrichment, and on the multiple testing correction which discriminates truly enriched regions versus those that can occur by chance. We have developed a Web tool implementing this method applied to the human genome ([URL] to bioiuser/pge). We validated PGE on published lists of differentially expressed genes. These analyses showed significant overrepresentation of known aberrant <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} pig <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> associated with susceptibility to salmonellosis. Genomic DNA from pig reference populations with differences in susceptibility to Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis as quantified by spleen and liver bacterial colonization at day 7 post-infection (dpi; Van Diemen et al. 2002) was used. These samples belonged to the offspring of a sire thought to be heterozygous for genes involved in susceptibility to salmonellosis. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were created and used to determine associations with spleen or bacterial counts at 7 dpi. To position linked markers, two mapping populations, the Roslin and Uppsala PiGMaP pedigrees were used to create an integrated map which included the AFLP markers associated with salmonellosis. Twenty-six AFLP markers located in 14 different <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> in the porcine genome were found to be significantly associated with susceptibility (Chi-square P < 0. 05). More than one linked marker was found on chromosomes 1, 7, 13, 14 and 18. It is likely that these regions contain genes involved in Salmonella susceptibility. Regions on chromosomes 1, 7 and 14 were significantly associated with Salmonella counts in the liver and regions on chromosomes 11, 13 and 18 with counts in spleen. The identification of these <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> highlights specific areas to search for candidate genes that may be involved in innate or adaptive immunity. Further investigation into these <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> would be useful to improve our understanding of host responses to infection with this widespread pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{systematic}} {{integration of}} expression profiles {{and other types}} of gene information, such as chromosomal localization, ontological annotations and sequence characteristics, still represents a challenge in the gene expression arena. In particular, the analysis of transcriptional data in context of the physical location of genes in a genome appears promising in detecting <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> with transcriptional imbalances often characterizing cancer. Results: A computational tool named locally adaptive statistical procedure (LAP), which incorporates transcriptional data and structural information for the identification of differentially expressed <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions,</b> is described. LAP accounts for variations in the distance between genes and in gene density by smoothing standard statistics on gene position before testing the significance of their differential levels of gene expression. The procedure smoothes parameters and computes p-values locally to account for the complex structure of the genome and to more precisely estimate the differential expression of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions.</b> The application of LAP to three independent sets of raw expression data allowed identifying differentially expressed regions that are directly involved in known chromosomal aberrations characteristic of tumors...|$|R
40|$|Serum lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) {{is used in}} diagnosing many diseases and is significantly determined by genetic factors. Three genes coding for LDH isoenzymes were mapped to chromosome 11 q 15 and 12 p 12. We used 330 Framingham Heart Study largest families for microsatellite linkage scan and 100 K SNPs association scan to determine quantitative trait loci of LDH level. We estimated the heritability at 41 %. Our genome-wide linkage analysis yielded several <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions,</b> other than 11 q and 12 p, with LOD scores between 1 and 2. 5.

Our study demonstrated a strong genetic effect on the variation of LDH levels. There may not be a single gene with a large effect, instead may be several genes with small effects in controlling the variation of serum LDH.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) - 5 mediates GH stimulation of IGF-I gene {{expression in the}} liver. Previous studies suggested that STAT 5 might exert this effect by binding to an IGF-I intron 2 region and a distal 5 ′-flanking region each containing two STAT 5 binding sites. Here we report the identification of three additional <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> containing {{a total of five}} putative STAT 5 binding sites that may mediate GH-induced STAT 5 activation of IGF-I gene expression in the mouse liver. By comparing an 170 -kb mouse genomic DNA containing the IGF-I gene with the corresponding human sequence, we identified 19 putative STAT 5 binding sites that bear the consensus sequence of STAT 5 binding site and are conserved across the two species. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that five <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> containing a total of nine of the 19 putative STAT 5 binding sites were bound by STAT 5 in the mouse liver in response to GH administration and that these bindings preceded or coincided with GH-increased IGF-I gene transcription. Two of the five <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> correspond to those previously identified in other species, and the three new <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> that contain a total of five putative STAT 5 binding sites are IGF-I intron 3 regions located at least 26 kb from the transcription start site. Gel-shift assays confirmed the binding of the five new putative STAT 5 binding sites as well as three of the four previously identified STAT 5 binding sites to GH-activated STAT 5 from the mouse liver. Cotransfection analyses indicated that, although each of the five <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> was able to mediate STAT 5 activation of reporter gene expression, together they mediated greater STAT 5 activation of reporter gene expression in response to GH. Overall, these results suggest that GH-induced STAT 5 activation of IGF-I gene expression in the mouse liver might be collectively mediated by at least eight STAT 5 binding sites located in distal intronic and 5 ′-flanking regions of the IGF-I gene...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{comparative}} expressed sequence hybridization (CESH) {{has been}} used to compare gene expression patterns in three morphologically different breast cancer subtypes: classic-type invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), poorly differentiated ERBB 2 -negative invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS), and poorly differentiated ERBB 2 -positive IDC-NOS. CESH allows global detection of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> with differential gene expression in a way similar to that of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Eight cases of each breast cancer subtype were included in the study. For each subtype, two pools of four cases each were constructed. CESH was used to compare both pools within the same morphological subtype, followed by a comparison of pools belonging to different subtypes. This revealed three <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> that were differentially expressed in ductal and lobular carcinomas, including relative overexpression at 8 q 13 -q 23 and 16 q 22, and relative underexpression at 8 p 21 -p 22. In addition, an expression signature characterized by relative overexpression at 3 q 24 -q 26. 3, 14 q 23 - 31, 17 q 12, and 20 q 12 - 13 was identified for ERBB 2 -positive IDC-NOS. In summary, CESH analysis highlights <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> of differential gene expression that are associated with morphologically defined breast cancer subtypes and suggests that regions on chromosome 8 are of interest in the discrimination between ductal and lobular carcinomas. In addition, using CESH, it was possible to identify an ERBB 2 expression signature, comprising four <b>chromosomal</b> <b>regions</b> with potential significance in the aggressive behaviour of ERBB 2 -positive IDC-NOS. status: publishe...|$|R
