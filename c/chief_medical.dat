5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's <b>chief</b> <b>medical</b> officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the <b>chief</b> <b>medical</b> officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E
