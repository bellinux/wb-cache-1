40|$|Abstract: Banks {{are in the}} {{business}} of lending to risky and hard-to-value businesses. This paper show that both the price and non-price terms of bank loans reflect observable components of borrower risk. As expected, riskier borrowers [...] smaller borrowers, borrowers with less cash, and borrowers that are harder for outside investors to value [...] pay more for their loans. In addition, the non-price terms of loans are systematically related to pricing; small loans, loans that are secured, and loans with relatively short maturity carry higher interest rates than other loans, even after controlling for publicly available measures of risk. This suggests that banks use both the price and non-price terms of loans as complements in dealing with borrower risk. To validate this interpretation, I also show that observably riskier firms face tighter non-price terms in their loan contracts. Loans to small firms, firms with low ratings, and firms with little cash available to service debt, for example, are more likely to be small, to be secured by collateral, and to have a short <b>contractual</b> <b>maturity.</b> Larger and more profitable firms are able to borrow on better terms across all three of these non-price dimensions...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} annuity contract with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) promises {{to return the}} entire initial investment through cash withdrawals during the policy life plus the remaining account balance at maturity, regardless of the portfolio performance. We assume that market is complete in financial risk and also there is no mortality risk (in the event of policyholder death, the contract is maintained by bene-ficiary), thus the annuity price can be expressed as an appropriate expectation. Under the optimal withdrawal strategy of a policyholder, the pricing of variable annuities with GMWB is an optimal stochastic control problem. The surrender feature available in marketed products allows {{termination of the contract}} before maturity, making it also an optimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in {{variable annuity}} contracts, {{there appears to be no}} published analysis and results for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behavior - results found in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a feature. Recently, Azimzadeh and Forsyth (2014) prove the existence of an optimal bang-bang control for a Guaranteed Lifelong Withdrawal Benefits (GLWB) contract. In particular, they find that the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writers losses by only ever performing nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full surrender. This dramatically reduces the optimal strategy space. However, they also demonstrate that the related GMWB contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the bang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases. For GMWB under optimal withdrawal assumption, the numerical algorithms developed by Dai et al. (2008), Chen and Forsyth (2008) and Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a) appear to be the only ones found in the literature, but none of them actually performed calculations with surrender option on top of optimal withdrawal strategy. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler bang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB strategy with surrender option. Recently, in Luo and Shevchenko (2015 a), we have developed a new efficient numerical algorithm for pricing GMWB contracts in the case when transition density of the underlying asset between withdrawal dates or its moments are known. This algorithm relies on computing the expected contract value through a high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a cubic spline interpolation and much faster than the standard partial differential equation methods. In this paper we extend our algorithm to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different policyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that following a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to significant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison with the optimal strategy. We also observed that the extra value added by the surrender option strongly depends on volatility and the penalty charge, among other factors such as <b>contractual</b> rate, <b>maturity</b> and interest rate etc. At high volatility or at low penalty charge, the surrender feature adds very significant value to the GMWB contract - the required fair fee is more than doubled in some cases; thus it is critical to account for surrender feature in pricing of real products. We also performed calculations for static withdrawal with surrender option, which is the same as bang-bang minus the “no-withdrawal” choice. We find that the fee for such contract is only less than 1 % smaller when compared to the case of bang-bang strategy, meaning that the “no-withdrawal” option adds little value to the contract. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|How {{should we}} value and manage deposit {{accounts}} where deposits have a zero <b>contractual</b> <b>maturity,</b> but which, in practice, remain stable through time and are remunerated below market rates? Does the economic {{value of the}} deposit account differ from the face value and can we reliably measure it? To what extent is the economic value sensitive to yield curve changes? In this paper, we try to answer the above questions. The valuation is performed on yield curve, deposit rate and deposit balance data between December 1994 and June 2005 for a sample of Belgian bank retail savings deposits accounts. We find that the deposits premium component of Belgian savings deposits is economically and statistically significant, though sensitive to assumptions about servicing costs and outstanding balances average decay rates. We also find that deposit liability values depreciate significantly when market rates increase, thereby offsetting some of the value losses on the asset side. The hedging characteristics of deposit accounts depend primarily {{on the nature of}} the underlying interest rate shock (yield curve level versus slope shock) and on the average decay rate. We assess the reliability of the reported point estimates and also report corresponding duration estimates that results from a dynamic replicating portfolio model approach more commonly used by large international banks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for the modelling of non-maturing liabilities, the latter referring to deposits without a specific maturity or deposits whose actual time horizon significantly differs from their <b>contractual</b> <b>maturity.</b> The set of non-maturing liabilities include most of the traditional deposit accounts like demand deposits and savings accounts and form the basis of the funding for depository institutions. Our framework consists of three pieces: models for market rates, deposit rates and deposit volumes. For the market rate an extended one-factor Vasicek model is used but the framework developed is general and any other and potentially more sophisticated and accurate model for the market rate can be applied. Deposit rates are modelled using policy functions which are allowed to depend on the current market rate and the volume deposited. Concerning deposit volumes we develop a framework in which models for deposit volumes can be derived in theoretically sound way. This is done in two steps. In the first step we propose reasonable rules or strategies based on which we attempt to capture the behaviour of the individual customer. In the second step we then define notions of homogeneity in customer behaviour and use these to derive models for the behaviour of the 'average customer' and for the volumes deposited by the 'average customer'. Finally, the pieces of the framework are integrated in a valuation formula, we here use the approach of Jarrow and Van Deventer [1998. The arbitrage-free valuation and hedging of demand deposits and credit card loans. Journal of Banking and Finance 22, 249 - 272], and a value is assigned to a portfolio of demand deposits. This valuation formula also forms the basis for the risk management of the interest rate risk embedded in the demand deposits. ...|$|E
