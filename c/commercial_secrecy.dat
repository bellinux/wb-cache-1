50|$|As a consequence, in {{practice}} {{it is difficult}} to obtain comprehensive information on the ownership structures of some media outlets, in particular private broadcasters. In fact, in June 2012, some amendments to the Law on the Registration of Legal Entities, on <b>Commercial</b> <b>Secrecy</b> and the Law on Obtaining of Information further worsened the transparency situation since information about corporate owners and their shareholdings of private media have been declared commercial secrets and deleted from public websites and registers. This makes possible for members of Parliament and other public officials that are banned from owning a business to not to be accountable to public scrutiny.|$|E
50|$|Simeon Shaw, in {{his work}} History of the Staffordshire Potteries (1829), made much of the <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{employed}} by the Elers brothers in their Burslem pottery; Shaw relied on local oral tradition. He wrote that they employed the stupidest workmen they could obtain; and an idiot to turn the wheel. At last Josiah Twyford and John Astbury discovered the secret, the latter by feigning idiocy. More prosaically, the Elers brothers became the targets of legal action by John Dwight, also of Fulham, who had a monopoly of stoneware. They set up in Staffordshire in the period 1691 to 1693, but also kept a London outlet, and a works in Vauxhall. They settled with Dwight by taking out a license that ran to 1698.|$|E
50|$|On June 6, 2011, United States District Court for the Central District of California denied The Walt Disney Company's {{request that}} its film Cars 2 not be {{reviewed}} for discovery {{for the purposes}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy</b> and threat of piracy, and ordered the defendants to immediately produce the screenplay/script and an audio-visual copy of Cars 2. It also ruled that the plaintiff showed a justified need for the film and actual harm if he did not receive a copy of it, because {{he would not be able}} to bring a preliminary injunction motion without it. Moreover, due to the dissimilarity between the plots, producing a copy of their film and screenplay/script would not result in any harm to the defendants. Disney therefore provided copies of Cookie & Co., Cars/Auto-Excess/Cars Chaos, a DVD copy of the motion picture Cars, and a DVD copy of animated shorts for CARS Toon: Mater's Tall Tales for the District Court's review.|$|E
40|$|Contracting {{over the}} {{disclosure}} of scientific knowledge Motivated by {{the central role of}} voluntary knowledge disclosure in ensuring cumulative progress, this paper evaluates the conditions supporting {{the disclosure of}} privately funded new knowledge through scientific publication, patenting, or both. We ground our analysis in the incentives facing researchers and their funders: scientists have incentives to disclose discoveries through scientific publication, while firms have incentives to protect their ideas through patenting or secrecy. When negotiating their compensation, researchers and firms bargain over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed. We evaluate four different disclosure regimes: <b>secrecy,</b> <b>commercial</b> science (where the only disclosures result from patenting), open science (where the only disclosures occur through scientific publication) and patent-paper pairs (where the firm discloses along both dimensions). Our model derives conditions under which each of these outcomes emerges {{as the result of the}} strategic interaction between researchers and researc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring hard times, {{suppliers}} {{need to set}} up {{the means}} to carry out demonstrations and pilot-production of the kind of devices needed by an increasingly-sophisticated customer base. Technology partnerships are one aspect of the hand-holding which is becoming prevalent throughout the industry, but there are others, kept well away from the spotlight, but which are important means to get things done. This is clear in merchant epitaxy where <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy</b> is vital to maintain the customer base...|$|E
40|$|A manuscript, dated 1889, was {{discovered}} among the unpublished papers of James Graves, the first Superintendent at the Valentia Island transatlantic cable station. It {{was intended to}} appear in the Institution's Journal but its publication was blocked by his employer on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. In the paper, Graves hoped to reinforce his claim to the invention of the sea earth. This technique of using the outer metal sheathing of a cable as the earth return connection was to become standard practise in submarine telegraphy, although, {{as a direct result of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy,</b> its development is still uncertain. In the paper, the basis of Graves's claim is examined in the light of available documentary evidence. The unpublished paper and the correspondence which is generated are presented together. A brief resumé of the financial conditions which led to the suppression of the paper is presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the Swiss have grown {{defensive}} about the bad reputation their banks have earned for hiding so-called 2 ̆ 2 dirty 2 ̆ 2 money. A common perception is that through the protection of strict Swiss banking and <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy</b> laws, Swiss numbered accounts hold the ill-gotten gains of organized crime, corrupt politicians, United States income tax evaders, and inside traders on United States securities markets.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{nutritional}} quality of the American oil-palm (Elaeis oleifera) mesocarp oil is superior to that of African oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq. Tenera) mesocarp oil. Therefore, it is of important to identify the genetic features for its superior value. This could be achieved through the genome sequencing of the oil-palm. However, the genome sequence is not available in the public domain due to <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy.</b> Hence, we constructed a cDNA library and generated expressed sequence tags (3, 205) from the mesocarp tissue of the American oil-palm. We continued to annotate each of these cDNAs after submitting to GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL. A rough analysis turned our attention to the beta-carotene hydroxylase (Chyb) enzyme encoding cDNA. Then, we completed the full sequencing of cDNA clone for its both strands using M 13 forward and reverse primers. The full nucleotide and protein sequence was further analyzed and annotated using various Bioinformatics tools. The analysis results showed the presence of fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily domain in the protein sequence. The multiple sequence alignment of selected Chyb amino acid sequences from other plant species and algal members with E. oleifera Chyb using ClustalW and its phylogenetic analysis suggest that Chyb from monocotyledonous plant species, Lilium hubrid, Crocus sativus and Zea mays are the most evolutionary related with E. oleifera Chyb. This study reports the annotation of E. oleifera Chyb...|$|E
40|$|Antireflection {{coatings}} (ARCs) are {{deposited on}} {{the surfaces of}} optical elements like spectacle lenses to increase light transmission and improve their performance. In the ophthalmic industry, plastic lenses are rapidly displacing glass lenses due to several advantageous features. However, the deposition of ARCs on plastic lenses is a challenging task, because the plastic surface needs treatment for adhesion improvement and surface hardening before depositing the ARC. This surface treatment is usually done in a multi-stage process—exposure to energetic radiations, followed by deposition of a carbonyl hard coating by spin or dip coating processes, UV curing, etc. However, this treatment can also be done by plasma processes. Moreover, the plasma polymerization process allows deposition of optical films at room temperature, essential for plastics. The energetic ions in plasma processes provide similar effects as in ion assisted physical deposition processes to produce hard coatings, without requiring sophisticated ion sources. The plasma polymerization process is more economical than ion-assisted physical vapour deposition processes as regards equipment and source materials and is more cost-effective, enabling the surface treatment and deposition of the ARC in the same deposition system in a single run by varying the system parameters at each step. Since published results of the plasma polymerization processes developed abroad are rather sketchy and the techniques are mostly veiled in <b>commercial</b> <b>secrecy,</b> innovative and indigenous plasma-based techniques have been developed in this work for depositing the complete ARCs on plastic substrates...|$|E
