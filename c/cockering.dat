5|$|<b>Cocker</b> Spaniels are dogs {{belonging}} to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel and the English <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel, {{both of which}} are commonly called simply <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, <b>Cocker</b> Spaniels also included small hunting Spaniels.|$|R
50|$|The American <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel was {{developed}} from the English <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel in the 19th century to retrieve quail and woodcock. They were originally divided from the English <b>Cocker</b> solely on a size basis, but were bred over the years for different specific traits. The two <b>Cocker</b> Spaniels were shown together in America until 1936, when the English <b>Cocker</b> received status as a separate breed. The American Kennel Club granted a separate breed designation for the English <b>Cocker</b> Spaniel in 1946.The American breed has a shorter snout, {{is more likely to}} get ear infections, and is groomed differently from the English <b>Cocker.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Not {{the least}} disgusting {{feature of this}} Gospel {{according}} to the Platform is its reference to religion, and even to the Christian Religion, as an authority and mandate for what it does. Christian Religion? Does the Christian or any religion prescribe love of scoundrels, then? I hope it prescribes a healthy hatred of scoundrels;--otherwise what am I, in Heaven's name, to make of it? Me, for one, it will not serve as a religion on those strange terms. Just hatred of scoundrels, I say; fixed, irreconcilable, inexorable enmity to the enemies of God: this, and not love for them, and incessant whitewashing, and dressing and <b>cockering</b> of them, must, if you look into it, be the backbone of any human religion whatsoever. Christian Religion! In what words can I address you, ye unfortunates, sunk in the slushy ooze till the worship of mud-serpents, and unutterable Pythons and poisonous slimy monstrosities, seems to you the worship of God? This is the rotten carcass of Christianity; this mal-odorous phosphorescence of post-mortem sentimentalism. O Heavens, from the Christianity of Oliver Cromwell, wrestling in grim fight with Satan and his incarnate Blackguardisms, Hypocrisies, Injustices, and legion of human and infernal angels, to that of eloquent Mr. Hesperus Fiddlestring denouncing capital punishments, and inculcating the benevolence on platforms, what a road have we travelled! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{personal}} {{disappointment of}} having missed {{his brother was}} great. Richard was very lonely. The Princes, and Hamlyn de Valence, were the only persons who knew his secret, and both by Prince Edmund and De Valence he was treated with indifference or dislike. Edward himself, though {{the object of his}} fervent affection, and his protector in all essentials, was of a reserved nature, and kept all his attendants at a great distance. On very rare occasions, when his feelings had been strongly stirred--as in the instance of his visit to his uncle's death-chamber--he might sometimes unbend; and momentary flashes from the glow of his warm deep heart went further in securing the love and devotion of those around him, than would the daily affability of a lower nature; but in ordinary life, towards all concerned with him except his nearest relations, he was a strict, cold, grave disciplinarian, ever just, though on the side of severity, and stern towards the slightest neglect or breach of observance, nor did he make any exception in favour of Richard. If the youth seldom received one of his brief annihilating reproofs, it was because they were scarcely ever merited; but he had experienced that any want of exactitude in his duties was quite as severely visited as if he had not been the Prince's close kinsman, romantically rescued by him, and placed near his person by his special desire. And Eleanor, with all her gentle courtesy and kindness, was strictly withheld by her husband from pampering or <b>cockering</b> his pages; nor did she ever transgress his will.|$|E

5000|$|A 15-year-old Jarvis <b>Cocker</b> and {{his friend}} Peter Dalton, who was 14, {{conceived}} the band at The City School in Sheffield. <b>Cocker's</b> original preference was to name the band after the film Pulp starring Michael Caine, though {{it was decided that}} this was too short. Instead, the two took inspiration from a copy of the Financial Times which listed the Arabicas coffee bean in its commodity index. <b>Cocker</b> and Dalton used this, with a slight spelling change, and the band became [...] "Arabicus". Early rehearsals took place in <b>Cocker's</b> house and featured <b>Cocker,</b> Dalton and Dalton's younger brother Ian.
