5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common whitefish and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> train or lake boat from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on October 4, 1940, winning via second-round stoppage over Joe Echevarria. Robinson fought five more times in 1940, winning each time, with four wins <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> way of knockout. In 1941, he defeated world champion Sammy Angott, future champion Marty Servo and former champion Fritzie Zivic. The Robinson-Angott fight was held above the lightweight limit, since Angott {{did not want}} to risk losing his lightweight title. Robinson defeated Zivic in front of 20,551 at Madison Square Garden—one of the largest crowds in the arena to that date. Robinson won the first five rounds according to The New York Times Joseph C. Nichols, before Zivic came back to land several punches to Robinson's head in the sixth and seventh rounds. Robinson controlled the next two rounds, and had Zivic in the ninth. After a close tenth round, Robinson was announced as the winner on all three scorecards.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Scheldt started 1 November 1944, with 4th Special Service Brigade {{assigned}} {{to carry out}} a seaborne assault on the island of Walcheren. The plan was for the island to be attacked from two directions, with the Commandos <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> sea and the Canadian 2nd Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking across the causeway. No. 4 Commando landed at Flushing and No. 41 and 48 at Westkapelle. No. 47 Commando was held in reserve and landed after No.s 41 and 48. They were to advance past No. 48 Commando and attempt to link up with No. 4 Commando in the south. On the first day No. 41 captured an artillery observation tower at Westkapelle and cleared the rest of the town. They then moved along the coast and dealt with the coastal defence installations.|$|E

He fought at the York Hall in Bethnal Green, London against veteran 36 year old {{journeyman}} Michael Pinnock (4-52-8, 2 KOs), who weighed 10 pounds more than Froch, in a scheduled 6 round bout. Froch won the fight via a fourth-round technical knockout. Froch fought a further four times that year, winning them all with three <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> first-round knockout against Ojay Abrahams, Darren Covill and Mike Duffield and one victory <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> a points decision win against Paul Bonson. Froch started 2003 with a knockout win against Valery Odin, fighting {{for the first time at}} the Nottingham Arena, the same arena he would win his first world title five years later. Froch would next fight in March, April and October of that year defeating Varujan Davtyan and Michael Monaghan by knockout and Vage Kocharyan via a points decision, respectively. At this point in his career, Froch racked up 9 wins in as many fights, with 7 <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> way of knockout.|$|E

25|$|The tide {{of foreign}} {{immigration}} receded, so that many groups had largely stopped <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. Some, however, were just starting to immigrate. Southern and Eastern European immigration, especially from Italy and Croatia, began in not insignificant amounts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as they came to work in Iowan coal mines. The early 20th century also saw the start of significant immigration from Mexico, and the mid-1970s saw immigration from Southeast Asia (especially the Tai Dam, Vietnamese, and Lao) as refugees from the Vietnam War searched for a peaceful place to live.|$|E
25|$|The {{part of the}} {{expedition}} that took place over land took about 40–51 days to get to San Diego. The contingent <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> sea encountered the south flowing California Current and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, {{most of the men}} aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from scurvy, and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the Presidio of San Diego on May 14, 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcala was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).|$|E
25|$|Beginning in August 1980 Ağca, {{under the}} alias of Vilperi, began {{criss-crossing}} the Mediterranean region, changing passports and identities, perhaps {{to hide his}} point of origin in Sofia, Bulgaria. He entered Rome on 10 May 1981, <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> train from Milan. According to Ağca's later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and two Bulgarians, with operation being commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attaché in Italy. He {{said that he was}} assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir Çelenk in Bulgaria. According to Ağca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire on the pope in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion.|$|E

Durán got back on track with successful title defenses against Jimmy Robertson, Hector Thompson and future Lightweight Champion Guts Ishimatsu. In 1974, Durán avenged his loss to De Jesus with a brutal eleventh round knock out. In 1976, he defeated future Light Welterweight Champion Saoul Mamby. Overall, Durán made twelve successful defenses of his title (eleven <b>coming</b> <b>by</b> knockout) and amassed a record of 62-1, his last defense coming in 1978 when Durán fought a third bout with De Jesus in a unification match wherein Durán once again knocked out De Jesus and captured his WBC Lightweight Championship. Durán gave up the Undisputed Lightweight Championship in February 1979.|$|E

In addition, MBTA inspectors with handheld validators were stationed at the busiest stops to deduct money from and verify monthly passes on CharlieCards, also allowing these riders to enter through any door.

25|$|The third Mongol {{invasion}} {{began in}} 1287. It was better organized {{than the previous}} effort; a large fleet and plentiful stocks of food were used. The Mongol Yuan forces, {{under the command of}} Toghan, moved to Vạn Kiếp from the north west and met the infantry and cavalry of Kublai's Kipchak commander Omar (<b>coming</b> <b>by</b> another way along the Red River) and quickly won the battle. The naval fleet rapidly attained victory in Vân Đồn near Hạ Long Bay. However, the Đại Việt General Trần Khánh Dư managed to intercept and captured the heavy, fully stocked cargo ships, filled with food and supplies for Toghan's army. As a result, the Mongolian army in Thăng Long suffered an acute shortage of food. With no news about the supply fleet, Toghan ordered his army to retreat to Vạn Kiếp. The Đại Việt army began their general offensive and recaptured a number of locations occupied by the Mongols. Groups of Đại Việt infantry were ordered to attack the Mongols in Vạn Kiếp. Toghan had to split his army into two and retreated in 1288.|$|E
