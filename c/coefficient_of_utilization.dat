The purpose is to find a cover glass that gives a better <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization.</b> The writer wills trough experiments find a cover glass that got an optimal ability to capture the sun energy. To find the optimal cover glass the writer will have to work with two parameters. The first one is the sun factor end the second one is the U-value. The advantage with a high sun factor is that you get a high inflow of the sun energy. The sun factor is a measurer of how match sun energy that transmission trough a glass construction. The advantage with a low U-value is that the cover glass get a good ability to isolate, in question of setting the heath energy free that the solar collector has captured. It is impossible to get a cover glass that has both a high sun factor and a low U-value. The writer idea is to find an optimal cover glass.

The usual systems for the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical and/or electrical energy work due to the high temperature difference available between the source (i. e., combustion products) and the sink (i. e., the ambient). The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a promising process for conversion of heat at low and medium temperature to electricity. An ORC system works like a Clausiusâ€“Rankine steam power plant but uses an organic working fluid instead of water. A certain challenge is the choice of the organic working fluid and of the particular design of the cycle. The process should have high thermal efficiency and allow a high <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> of the available heat source. Moreover, the working fluid should fulfill safety criteria, it should be environmentally friendly, and allow low cost for the power plant.
