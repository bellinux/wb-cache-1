25|$|Taking <b>citalopram</b> with Omeprazole {{may cause}} higher {{blood levels of}} <b>citalopram.</b> This is a {{potentially}} dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs, {{including}} <b>citalopram,</b> {{can increase}} the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. <b>Citalopram</b> is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> has {{the second}} most {{selectivity}} for SERT, no effects on NE or DA re-uptake and nor does it have affinity to other neuroreceptors. <b>Citalopram</b> is composed of two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-, which are mirror images of each other (figure 7). Researches has shown that nearly all the activity resides in the (S)-enantiomer and that (R)-citalopram actually counteracts {{the action of the}} (S)-enantiomer. The combination of the two enantiomers is known as racemic <b>citalopram</b> and has weak antihistaminic properties that reside in the (R)-enantiomer. Solution to improve the properties of racemic <b>citalopram</b> is to remove the unwanted (R)-enantiomer. The resulting drug is better known as escitalopram, but it is composed of only the pure active (S)-(+)-isomer. This change appears to remove the antihistaminic properties of the drug. By removing the (R)-enantiomer, the lowest dose of escitalopram becomes more efficacious and faster onset than comparable dose of <b>citalopram,</b> where escitalopram has twice the activity of <b>citalopram</b> and is at least 27 times more potent than the (R)-enantiomer. Escitalopram is therefore the only SSRI drug for which pure SERT inhibition is responsible for almost all of its pharmacological action. Escitalopram is the newest and most selective inhibitor of the SSRIs and is today considered the best tolerated SSRI.|$|E
25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor <b>citalopram.</b> The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers <b>citalopram</b> prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to <b>citalopram</b> in efficacy and tolerability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> {{and other}} SSRIs {{can be used}} to treat hot flashes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> {{has been}} found to reduce the {{symptoms}} of diabetic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> is well tolerated and as {{effective}} as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that <b>citalopram</b> {{can be useful in}} reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer’s disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> {{theoretically}} causes {{side effects}} {{by increasing the}} concentration of serotonin {{in other parts of}} the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. <b>Citalopram</b> is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} SSRIs, <b>citalopram</b> can cause an {{increase}} in serum prolactin level.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{effectiveness}} of <b>citalopram</b> for treating depression in children is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Overdosage {{may result}} in vomiting, sedation, {{disturbances}} in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremor, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions. Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with <b>citalopram</b> as the sole agent. <b>Citalopram</b> and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma <b>citalopram</b> concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50-400 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000-3000 μg/l in patients who survive acute overdosage and 3–30mg/l in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> {{and other}} SSRIs can induce a mixed state, {{especially}} {{in those with}} undiagnosed bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> is {{frequently}} used off-label to treat anxiety, panic disorder, dysthymia premenstrual dysphoric disorder, {{body dysmorphic disorder}} and obsessive–compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{ranking of}} 10 {{antidepressants}} for efficacy and cost-effectiveness <b>citalopram</b> is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. The ranking results {{were based on}} the meta-analysis by Andrea Cipriani. In another analysis by Cipriani, <b>citalopram</b> was found to be more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine, and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine, and venlafaxine, but less efficacious than escitalopram.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>citalopram</b> {{carries a}} boxed warning stating it may {{increase}} suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24.|$|E
25|$|Netherlands: In the Netherlands, paroxetine, {{marketed as}} Seroxat among generic preparations, {{is the most}} {{prescribed}} antidepressant, followed by amitriptyline, <b>citalopram</b> and venlafaxine.|$|E
25|$|While {{on its own}} <b>citalopram</b> is less {{effective}} than amitriptyline {{in the prevention of}} migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> has no {{significant}} effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> has {{produced}} a modest reduction in alcoholic drink intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward.|$|E
25|$|While {{scientists}} {{were trying to}} create a new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named talopram and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed in spite of being potent SNRIs {{because of the fact that}} number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With minor changes to the chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called <b>citalopram.</b> But <b>citalopram</b> can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> and escitalopram are {{associated}} with dose-dependent QT interval prolongation {{and should not be}} used in those with congenital long QT syndrome or known pre-existing QT interval prolongation, or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval. ECG measurements should be considered for patients with cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected before starting treatment. In December 2011, the UK implemented new restrictions on the maximum daily doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada did not similarly order restrictions on escitalopram dosage, only on its predecessor <b>citalopram.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} of <b>citalopram</b> include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), {{increase}} in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime {{rather than in the}} morning. Some data suggest <b>citalopram</b> may cause nightmares.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests <b>citalopram</b> interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, {{and this is}} put forward as a potential cause {{of some of the}} drug's antidepressant effect.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{multisite}} {{randomized controlled}} study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from <b>citalopram,</b> raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior {{in children with}} autism.|$|E
25|$|A meta-analysis, {{including}} {{studies with}} fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and <b>citalopram</b> versus placebo, showed SSRIs {{to be effective}} in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{doses of}} escitalopram usually cause {{relatively}} minor untoward effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, <b>citalopram.</b> Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than <b>citalopram</b> in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that sertraline {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, <b>citalopram,</b> fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and mirtazapine. There is low quality evidence that sertraline is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, over 24.4 million {{prescriptions}} for generic fluoxetine were {{filled in the}} United States, making it the third-most prescribed antidepressant after sertraline and <b>citalopram.</b> In 2011, 6 million {{prescriptions for}} fluoxetine were filled in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citalopram</b> is {{considered}} safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct {{from some other}} agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 review {{concluded}} that 51% {{of studies of}} various SSRIs yielded positive outcomes. Sertraline is statistically similar in efficacy to other SSRIs such asparoxetine, <b>citalopram,</b> escitalopram and venlafaxine (SNRI). Evidence suggests that sertraline {{may be more effective}} thanfluoxetine(Prozac) for some subtypes of depression.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{statistical}} or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among {{any of the}} medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, <b>citalopram,</b> lithium, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, sertraline, triiodothyronine, tranylcypromine, and venlafaxine extended release.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{exposure}} (including <b>citalopram)</b> {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not {{associated with an increased}} risk of spontaneous abortion.|$|E
25|$|One {{study has}} found that genetic {{variations}} between individuals in the HTR2A gene may to some extent account for the difference in outcome of antidepressant treatment, so that patients suffering from major depressive disorder and treated with <b>citalopram</b> may benefit more than others if they have one particular genotype.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{can occur}} when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with <b>citalopram</b> should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{more active}} S-enantiomer of <b>citalopram.</b> May {{be the most}} efficacious of the SSRIs (although no {{statistically}} significant difference between the efficacy of sertraline and escitalopram have been teased out to date). Based on the available evidence it is less toxic than its racemic counterpart, (R,S)-citalopram, in overdose. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Roy {{had also}} been taking Celexa for some time. In the United States, <b>citalopram</b> carries a boxed warning stating it may {{increase}} suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. In 2016 the judge had refused the defense's request for funds to hire an expert on Celexa, describing it as 'speculative'.|$|E
