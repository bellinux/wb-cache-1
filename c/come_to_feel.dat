25|$|Penderecki {{explained}} this shift {{by stating that}} he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that the experimentation of the avant-garde {{had gone too far}} from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: 'The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez and Cage was for us, the young – hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country – a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone'. Penderecki concluded that he was 'saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition'.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s, Blake had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that one}} of the major {{problems}} with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.|$|E
25|$|From 1881 to 1882, some 30 Jewish {{families}} left Sana'a {{and several}} nearby settlements, {{and made the}} long trek by foot and by sea to Jerusalem, where most had settled in Silwan. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen, who continued to move into British-ruled Palestine until 1914. The majority of these groups would later move into Jerusalem proper and Jaffa. Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf, who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1891, described in his autobiography the hardships the Yemenite Jewish community faced in their new country, {{where there were no}} hostelries to accommodate wayfarers and new immigrants. On the other hand, he writes that the Sephardi kollelim (seminaries) had taken under their auspices the Yemenite Jews from the moment they stepped foot in Jerusalem. Later, however, the Yemenites would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> discriminated against by the Sephardic community, who compelled them to no longer make use of their own soft, pliable matzah, but to buy from them only the hard cracker-like matzah made weeks in advance prior to Passover. He also mentions that the Yemenite community would pay the prescribed tax to the public coffers; yet, they were not being allotted an equal share or subsidy as had been given to the Sephardic Jews. By 1910, the Yemenites had broken away from the Sephardic seminaries.|$|E

500|$|In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote Desire, {{which was}} another retelling {{of the myth}} of Myrrha as it was {{presented}} in the Metamorphoses by Ovid. The case of Myrrha, critic Langdon Hammer notes, is the worst possible made against desire, because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can lead people to destroy others as well as themselves. He comments that [...] "the [...] "precious bitter resin" [...] into which Myrrha's tears are changed tastes bitter and sweet, like Desire as a whole". He further writes: [...] "The inescapability of desire makes Bidart's long story of submission to it a kind of affirmation. Rather than aberrant, the Ovidian characters <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> exemplary".|$|E

Rodriguez writes: [...] "To be sure, Extra Texture boasted several fine cuts... but the remainder of the collection was almost entirely weary in tone, amounting to a prolonged buzz kill." [...] Nick DeRiso, co-founder of the music website Something Else!, includes it on his list of the five worst solo albums by either John Lennon, McCartney or Harrison, and describes it as a [...] "grinding, relentlessly downbeat album, where even the name Extra Texture has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like a cruel joke".|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} complimentary. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote, [...] "there are some {{powerful}} and touching moments in 'Sein und Zeit', but others that miss the mark so widely that {{it hurts to}} think what this episode might have been." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards the focus on Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that does little to satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E

500|$|The fact is, I used to {{get very}} involved, {{six or seven years}} ago, and before that, in {{questions}} of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres.... Nowadays, I've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that talking about categories, about [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.|$|E
500|$|In November 1950, Namuth and Pollock's {{relationship}} came to {{an abrupt}} conclusion. [...] After coming in from the cold-weather shoot of the glass painting, Pollock, who had been treated in the 1930s for alcoholism, poured himself a tumbler of bourbon whiskey after supposedly having been sober for two years. [...] An argument between Namuth and Pollock ensued with each calling the other a [...] "phony", culminating in Pollock overturning a table of food and dinnerware in front of several guests. [...] From then on, Pollock reverted to a more figure-oriented style of painting, leading some to say that Namuth's sessions robbed Pollock of his rawness and made Pollock <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> disingenuous about doing things for the camera that he had originally done spontaneously. [...] Art critic Jonathan Jones suggests that by filming Pollock, Namuth [...] "broke the myth of trance" [...] and by framing Pollock's work in the larger surrounding landscape, destroyed Pollock's view that his paintings were boundless. [...] Jeffrey Potter, a close friend of Pollock's, described Namuth as commanding, frequently telling Pollock when to start and stop painting. [...] According to Potter, Pollock [...] "felt what was happening was phony." [...] Namuth himself describes Pollock as being [...] "very nervous and very self-conscious" [...] of the filming at the time, but less so when Pollock discussed it in a later interview.|$|E
500|$|The {{period that}} historians {{refer to as}} the [...] "tyranny" [...] of Richard II began {{towards the end of the}} 1390s. The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's {{motivation}} are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case. It is more likely that Richard had simply <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386–88 and eliminate them as threats to his power. Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed. Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood. Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel's brother Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life. Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting retainers for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1840 Tolstoy was {{transferred}} back to Russia {{to a position}} in the Tsar's Imperial State Chancellery 2nd Department where he continued to work for many years, slowly rising in the hierarchy. As time went by, though, he showed less and less enthusiasm, for the demands of his position had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like a major hindrance to his literary aspirations. In [...] May 1841 Tolstoy [...] debuted with The Vampire (a novella published under the pen name of [...] "Krasnorogsky", a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence).

2500|$|A {{subsequent}} licensing {{deal with}} Warner Bros. Entertainment brought the studio {{the rights to}} develop games based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead and Bill Willingham's Fables comics. The first endeavor completed was the 2012 The Walking Dead video game, which had the same episodic nature as the studio's earlier games but was built more on developing characters and story over traditional puzzle elements. The game required the player to make significant game-changing decisions including the death of non-playable characters, sometimes {{with only a few}} seconds to deliberate which option to select through quick time events. Choices made would create determinants that would carry through the remaining episodes and into subsequent seasons, allowing players to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as if the story they are presented was more personal due to the choices they made. The game was praised critically for its emotional story and use of the adventure genre, as well as designed its release around a timed episodic schedule. The Walking Dead was considered very successful, and one of the biggest surprises for the video game industry in 2012, and a [...] "refresh" [...] of the adventure game genre; Ron Gilbert noted that The Walking Deads approach to appear to the mass market can make adventure games as relevant as other genres to larger publishers. Following The Walking Dead, Telltale secures further deals to produce additional seasons of The Walking Dead, and seasons based on the A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones book series, and the Borderlands and Minecraft video games, among other deals. Telltale's episodic and deterministic narrative model has also been used by other developers, including Life Is Strange and Dreamfall Chapters.|$|E
