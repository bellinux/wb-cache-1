25|$|Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on {{a similar}} continuum. A 150-page merger {{agreement}} between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A <b>commercial</b> <b>lease</b> for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing {{the members of a}} neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{arguments}} and evidence for reform of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases</b> through legislative intervention. It identifies and explains {{the causes of}} landlord and tenant disputes arising mainly from poorly drafted <b>commercial</b> <b>leases.</b> It investigates the relevant codes for leasing business premises, the Law Society business lease, the regulatory reform of part II of the 1954 Act, the British Property Federation lease, and various other attempts at reform of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases.</b> This research also investigates the potential need for ethnic minorities in commercial property to have the key legal terms of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases</b> made available in both English and other languages. There is little previous academic research on reform of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases</b> through legislative intervention (other than Crosby Reading reports). This research aims to contributute towards filling the gap {{that exists in the}} literature by investigating reform through legislation. This research involved semi-structured interviews with participants from five groups: lawyers, surveyors/agents, landlords, tenants and business owners. Most interviewed supported reform of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases</b> through legislative intervention, and better guidance explaining the meaning of key legal terms of <b>commercial</b> property <b>leases,</b> especially from ethnic minority businesses...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the traditional, upward-only rent review clauses in English <b>commercial</b> <b>leases</b> can be replaced by rent indexation. Analysis of the existing literature found widespread criticism of upward-only rent reviews. Most importantly, they represent a disadvantage for tenants and an advantage for landlords. Contrary to this, analysis of the qualitative data, gathered through semi-structured interviews with professionals, showed that property market forces have shifted. This leaves tenants in a stronger negotiation position. A clear trend towards shorter leases and break options as opposed to rent review mechanisms. The evidence within the study suggests that the Codes of Leasing Practice have not had a significant impact on the flexibility of <b>commercial</b> <b>leases.</b> The findings of the study indicate that the Government should not legislate against upward-only rent reviews as this could have major negative impacts on the property market. Indexation was found to be a fair and reasonable option for both landlords and tenants. However, the exclusive use of indexation in <b>commercial</b> <b>leases</b> would lead to a distortion of the property market as the determination of market rents and values would be impossible. The principal conclusion of this dissertation was that the self-adjustment of the market, which led to a higher flexibility in <b>commercial</b> <b>leases,</b> made a restriction of upward-only rent reviews unnecessary. Moreover, rent indexation is a well-established rent review mechanism in England – a tool whereby both parties can benefit. An exclusive use of indexation in <b>commercial</b> <b>leases</b> though seems most unlikely...|$|R
40|$|The Protectorate Land Ordinance of 1927 was {{introduced}} to "simplify the law relating to the tenure of land by non-natives in the Protectorate". It {{was an attempt to}} regularize and unify existing practices, which in part were based on very old African customs around the so-called landlord-stranger relationship. Section 6 provides that if a tenancy created by a lease exceeds three years, a deed, i. e. an agreement under seal, has to be executed. Section 9 requires these deeds to be registered in Freetown.
