5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
40|$|The {{mammary gland}} {{is a system}} of hollow {{interconnecting}} tubes which develops from an invasive branching cord of epithelial cells. This ultrastructural study of the developing mam-mary gland focuses on how the lumen forms and establishes the polarized epithelial lining of the gland. The earliest signs of lumen formation are many small cavities and crevices lined with microvilli which appear at scattered sites throughout the branching cords and neck of the gland. It is suggested that these initial small lumina form quite simply by separation of cells whose opposing faces are non-adhesive. The continuous central lumen of the gland develops by fusion and enlargement of the many small lumina. The cells adjacent to the developing lumen will form the polarized epithelial lining of the gland. Excess, more basal, epithelial cells degenerate. The lumen begins to appear when the branching pattern is almost complete. Thus, during morphogenesis, invasion by the mammary gland epithelium involves penetration of the mesenchyme by a solid <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> We suggest that this cellular organization may be a fundamental characteristic of invasive epithelia and that a crucial step {{in the development of}} malignant epithelial tumours is a change in cell organization from a polarized cell sheet to a solid <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> which can invade...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRegardless {{of their}} sex {{chromosome}} karyotype, amniotes develop {{two pairs of}} genital ducts, the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts. As the Müllerian duct forms, its growing tip is intimately associated with the Wolffian duct as it elongates to the urogenital sinus. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the presence of the Wolffian duct is required for the development and maintenance of the Müllerian duct. The Müllerian duct is known to form by invagination of the coelomic epithelium, but the mechanism for its elongation to the urogenital sinus remains to be defined. Using genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate that the Wolffian duct does not contribute cells to the Müllerian duct. Experimental embryological manipulations and molecular studies show that precursor cells at the caudal tip of the Müllerian duct proliferate to deposit a <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> along the length of the urogenital ridge. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis reveals that the cells of the developing Müllerian duct are mesoepithelial when deposited, and subsequently differentiate into an epithelial tube and eventually the female reproductive tract. Our studies define cellular and molecular mechanisms for Müllerian duct formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{first one}} to three mm {{of each of the}} paired female oviducts in Rana pipiens {{consists}} of a folded mucosa lacking tubular glands and enclosed by a serosa. Most of the remainder of the oviduct is lined by a folded mucosa richly endowed with simple tubular, jelly-secreting glands. The final one to two cm of the uterine portion of the oviduct, however, has a smooth mucosal lining which lacks tubular glands. Jelly-secreting glands penetrate {{to the base of the}} mucosa and open to the lumen between ridges capped with ciliated or mucous secreting epithelial cells. As cells of the jelly-secreting glands grow and differentiate during the summer, they accumulate a granular secretory product which exhibits basohpilia in hematoxylinstained specimens. This is the essential change in the histological structure of the gland throughout the growing season. The adult male oviduct is a solid <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> for about one-third of its length.

Adult male tilapia, average body weight 150. 0 ± 23. 3 g, were exposed to environmentally relevant (0. 03 mg/L- 1) and sublethal (5. 00 mg/L- 1) doses of dimethoate for 15 and 30 days. Fish exposed to 0. 03 mg/L- 1 dimethoate exhibited significant decrease in the serum LH. While, 5. 00 mg/L- 1 dimethoate revealed significant increase in serum LH. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) displayed significant increase in 5. 00 mg/L- 1 group exposed for 15 days. However, a significant reduction was observed in 0. 03 mg/L- 1 group exposed for 30 days. Histological structure of the testes of the control tilapia showed numerous spermatogenic cysts; lumina filled with spermatozoa and little interstitial tissue. Fish exposed to dimethoate for 15 days showed scarcely spermatozoa, narrow seminiferous tubules and increase in the interstitial connective tissue. After 30 days, 5. 00 mg/L- 1 exposed fish showed progressive reduction of spermatozoa, empty tubules and a degenerative cell debris in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. Immunohistochemically, the LH cells were localised in proximal parse distalis of the tilapia adenohypophysis. LH cells were isolated, clustered or formed <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> surrounding the neurohypophyseal branches. In dimethoate exposed fish, LH cells displayed a reduction in size and mass distribution in the adenohypophysis. The cytoplasm of the LH cells were vacuolated and showing the sings of degeneration. The changes appeared in testicular structures and LH cells of the O. niloticus were in a dose and time-dependent manner. Based on these observations, sublethal or environmentally relevant concentrations of dimethoate exhibited an endocrine disruptive action at pituitary-testicular axis of Nile tilapia that might lower its reproductive potential...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Limbal {{epithelial}} crypt (LEC) {{is a solid}} <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> approximately 120 microns long. It {{arises from}} the undersurface of interpalisade rete ridges of the limbal palisades of Vogt and extends deeper into the limbal stroma parallel or perpendicular to the palisade. There are up to 6 or 7 such LEC, variably distributed along the limbus in each human eye. Morphological and immunohistochemical studies on the limbal epithelial crypt (LEC) have demonstrated the presence of limbal stem cells in this region. The purpose of this microarray study was to characterise the transcriptional profile of the LEC and compare with other ocular surface epithelial regions to support our hypothesis that LEC preferentially harbours stem cells (SC). Results LEC {{was found to be}} enriched for SC related Gene Ontology (GO) terms including those identified in quiescent adult SC, however similar to cornea, limbus had significant GO terms related to proliferating SC, transient amplifying cells (TAC) and differentiated cells (DC). LEC and limbus were metabolically dormant with low protein synthesis and downregulated cell cycling. Cornea had upregulated genes for cell cycling and self renewal such as FZD 7, BTG 1, CCNG, and STAT 3 which were identified from other SC populations. Upregulated gene expression for growth factors, cytokines, WNT, Notch, TGF-Beta pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation were noted in cornea. LEC had highest number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), downregulated and unknown genes, compared to other regions. Genes expressed in LEC such as CDH 1, SERPINF 1, LEF 1, FRZB 1, KRT 19, SOD 2, EGR 1 are known to be involved in SC maintenance. Genes of interest, in LEC belonging to the category of cell adhesion molecules, WNT and Notch signalling pathway were validated with real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Conclusions Our transcriptional profiling study identifies the LEC as a preferential site for limbal SC with some characteristics suggesting that it could function as a 'SC niche' supporting quiescent SC. It also strengthens the evidence for the presence of "transient cells" in the corneal epithelium. These cells are immediate progeny of SC with self-renewal capacity and could be responsible for maintaining epithelial turn over in normal healthy conditions of the ocular surface (OS). The limbus has mixed population of differentiated and undifferentiated cells. </p...|$|E

Cytologic criteria of malignancy as applied to tissues or exfoliated cells in vivo served as guidelines for the diagnoses in vitro. Diagnosis was made on stained coverslip preparations sent coded from Bethesda to Provi-dence. Neoplastic state was determined at Bethesda by implantation of samples of the tissue culture cells in compatible hosts for assay of their capacity to grow progressively as invasive, serially transplantable neo-plasms. Several populations <b>of</b> mixed <b>cell</b> types from embryos of the mouse, hamster, and rat were followed during long-term culture. <b>Of</b> the 12 <b>cell</b> lines initiated, all but one underwent neoplastic transformation.

40|$|Limbal {{stem cell}} {{deficiency}} (LSCD) {{is one of}} the most prominent causes of cornea related blindness in the world with an incidence of approximately 240 new cases per year in the UK alone. Symptoms of LSCD include reduced vision, pain, watering, redness, photophobia and blepharospasm due to chronic inflammation and breakdown of the corneal epithelium. LSCD mainly results in loss of barrier between the corneal and conjunctival epithelium with overgrowth of conjunctival epithelium over the cornea resulting in corneal vascularisation and scarring. Therefore, LSCD not only causes debilitating blindness depending on the severity of the condition but also leads to long term morbidity. Despite the availability of advanced treatment options for LSCD such as limbal tissue grafting and ex-vivo corneal epithelium transplantation, basic research questions such as the identification of limbal stem cell markers (LSC) for effective isolation of a pure population of LSCs from the corneal epithelium remains unanswered. Anatomical studies on the ocular surface have identified a new structure at the limbus termed Limbal Epithelial Crypt (LEC). It is a solid <b>cord</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> arising from the undersurface of palisades of Vogt and extends into the subepithelial stroma of the limbus. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies have demonstrated the presence of SCs in this region. The primary aim of this research is to confirm the hypothesis that LEC is a corneal SC niche (SCN) and to identify any SC related genes of interest in the LEe. The transcriptional profiling of the ocular surface (OS) epithelial regions was performed with the in-house manufactured spotted oligonucleotide and the Gene 1. 0 ST arrays platform. Comparison of the results of these two microarray studies facilitated validation of the results and also contributed to the gene database of the as epithelial regions. Methods Frozen tissue blocks of corneoscleral buttons were cryosectioned to obtain serial tissue sections. Good quality tissue sections comprising of as epithelial regions were transferred onto PALM slides for laser microdissection. Extracted RNA samples were amplified & hybridised to the in-house manufactured 30, 000 k spotted human oligonucleotide microarray chips and Gene LOST arrays. Primary analysis of raw data of both the microarrays studies was performed to filter and normalise the microarray data for removal of the noise and to smoothen the raw data. Secondary analysis of the data involved statistical methods such as ANOVA, principal component analysis unpaired t-test and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). A differentially expressed gene list for each as epithelial region was generated with these statistical analysis methods. The gene lists in both the microarray studies were further analysed at tertiary level for pathway analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and geneontology with Database for Annotation, Visualisation, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software respectively. The genes of interest in the microarray studies were validated with quantitative gene expression analysis (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry.

Notably, cells generating neurons are not well characterized. The present study deals with the origin <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood <b>cells</b> generating neurons and mechanisms allowing the neuronal differentiation. We studied neuronal markers of both total fractions <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood and stem/progenitor cord blood cells before and after selections and cultures. We also compared neuronal commitment <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood <b>cells</b> to that observed for the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE(2). Before cultures, neuronal markers are found within the total fraction <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood <b>cells.</b> In CD 133 + stem/progenitor cell fraction only immature neuronal markers are detected. However, CD 133 + cells are unable to give rise to neurons in cultures, whereas this is achieved when total fraction <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood <b>cells</b> is used. In fact, mature functional neurons can be generated from CD 133 + cells only in cell-to-cell close contact with either CD 133 - fraction or a neurogenic epithelium. Furthermore, since CD 133 + fraction is heterogenous, we used several selections to precisely identify the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood-derived neuronal stem/progenitor cells. Results reveal that only CD 34 - cells from CD 133 + fraction possess neuronal potential. These data show the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood neuronal stem/progenitor cells and the crucial role of direct cell-to-cell contact to achieve their commitment.

40|$|Aim: The present {{work was}} {{targeted}} {{to form the}} baseline data of normal morphological and histological picture of parathyroid gland in female Kuttanad ducks. Materials and Methods: A Histomorphological study of the parathyroid gland {{was carried out in}} twelve adult female Kuttanad ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) of 20 weeks of age. Birds reared semintensively were procured from Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Poultry and Duck Farm and sacrificed humanely. Glands were collected and gross parameters were recorded. The glands were fixed in 10 percent neutral buffered formalin. The small sized glands were processed as such by routine histological methods, paraffin blocks were prepared and sectioned to a thickness of 5 µ. The tissues were stained by Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for routine histological studies and Gomori's rapid one step trichrome method for connective tissue fibres. Micrometric parameters were recorded using ocular micrometer. Results: Parathyroid glands in Kuttanad ducks lay just caudal to the division of the innominate artery into the subclavian and common carotid arteries. Parathyroids were oval to spherical in shape, yellow in colour and smaller than thyroid gland of the representative sides. The arterial blood supply was from common carotid artery and blood from gland was drained directly into jugular vein. Although it lied close to the thyroid, thymus and ultimobranchial gland, parathyroid tissue did not merge to any of the above mentioned three glands. Parenchyma was composed irregular anatomizing <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> supplied by connective tissue stroma penetrated by blood capillaries. Parenchyma was predominantly made <b>of</b> lightly stained <b>cell,</b> the chief cell. The nuclei were round and contain one or two nucleoli. Oxyphil cells present in parathyroid glands of other mammals were not seen in the present study. Conclusion: Histomorphological features or characteristics of Parathyroid gland in Kuttanad duck were studied. Cranial parathyroids were larger in size as compared to the caudal parathyroids. Parathyroid glands were enclosed by a well-developed connective tissue capsule made predominantly of collagen fibers. Parenchyma was composed <b>of</b> irregular anatomizing <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> supplied by connective tissue stroma and penetrated by blood capillaries. Oxyphil cells were absent similar to other aves. Parathyroid gland is very vital in maintaining the homeostasis of the plasma calciumReference?.

The aim {{was to develop a}} polarized model to elucidate the mechanisms of ductular morphogenesis and functional differentiation of hBEC. METHODS: The morphological, phenotypic and functional properties of hBEC cultured as three-dimensional aggregates in collagen gel were assessed in medium supplemented with (or without) human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) and foetal bovine serum. RESULTS: In the absence of added mitogens and serum, cells maintained as morphologically polarized aggregates, organized around a central lumen, were positive for phenotypic markers of biliary epithelium and negative for markers <b>of</b> other <b>cell</b> types. Functional markers, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, anion exchanger- 2, responses to gamma interferon and forskolin induced secretion, were preserved. hHGF increased both the size and number of aggregates and induced hBEC to invade the gel and lumena forming anastomosing networks <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Collagen gel culture in the absence of added growth factors and serum provides a model for analysis of the polarized functions of hBEC.

Similar to cancer invasion, {{we found that the}} injured cells invade into the ECM as cords, involving heterotypical cell-cell interactions. Mesenchymal <b>cells</b> with properties <b>of</b> activated repair <b>cells</b> that typically locate to a wound edge are present in leader positions at the front of ZO- 1 -rich invading <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> where they extend vimentin intermediate filament-enriched protrusions into the 3 D ECM.

Moreover, while the bEND. 3 cells formed large tumors in nude mice within 48 hr, the TS 1 -expressing cells failed to form tumors even after 1 month. The TS 1 -transfected cells expressed transforming growth factor beta mRNA and bioactivity at levels {{similar to those of}} the parental or vector-transfected bEND. 3 cells, indicating that the effects of TS 1 expression are not due to the activation of transforming growth factor beta by TS 1. TS 1 expression resulted in a > 100 -fold decrease in net fibrinolytic (urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPA) activity due to more plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 and less uPA secretion. TS 1 thus appears to be an important regulator <b>of</b> endothelial <b>cell</b> phenotype required for maintaining the quiescent, differentiated state...|$|R
40|$|Intensely GFAP immunoreactive elemnts {{were found}} dudring tail spinal cord {{regeneration}} {{respect to the}} intact spinal <b>cord.</b> Many <b>of</b> these <b>cells</b> are tanycytes because they {{are present in the}} subependymal layer and also in grey matter and are restricted to dorsolateral and ventrolateral parts of the canal. This robust GFAP-ir expression presumably reflects a changing role for these cells, which are, very likely, supportive to regrowing axons...|$|R
40|$|Thymidine uptake in PHA-stimulated culture <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> blood <b>cells</b> {{from smoking}} mothers {{is greater than}} that from non-smoking mothers. There was no such {{difference}} when separated lymphocytes were studied; this suggests that smoking suppresses a suppressor cell.

40|$|A case of {{multifocal}} epithelioid angiosarcoma of the femur, tibia, fibula, and astragalus in a 54 -year-old man is reported. The {{tumor was}} composed <b>of</b> nests and <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> malignant <b>cells</b> with epithelioid morphology, with foci of vascular differentiation, necrosis, and hemorrhage. By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells showed positivity for endothelial cell markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII-related antigen, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I), epithelial markers (cytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen), and vimentin. The authors' findings {{point out the}} need for a panel of antibodies for the careful search of histologic features of vascular differentiation to correctly diagnose vascular bone tumors with epithelioid features, especially in evaluating small core biopsy specimens in which a sheetlike rather than obviously vasoformative architecture may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a {{relatively}} rare and moderately aggressive type of vascular tumor. We describe a case of EHE that presented in a 24 -year-old woman as a palpable nodule in the left cervical area. Radiological examinations and fine-needle aspiration cytology led to a preliminary diagnosis of metastatic lymphadenopathy with an unknown primary site. However, during surgery, we determined that the nodule was an intravascular tumor arising from the left internal jugular vein. The histopathological examination revealed <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> epithelioid endothelial <b>cells</b> distributed in a hyaline stroma, compatible with a diagnosis of EHE...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{suppressor}} activity <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> T lymphocytes contrasts markedly with their mainly CD 4 (helper) rather than CD 8 (suppressor) phenotype. We studied the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> CD 3, CD 4 and CD 8 cells compared to adult cells using the monoclonal antibodies, 2 H 4, 4 B 4, and UCHL 1. Almost all cord CD 4 lymphocytes carried the suppressor-inducer marker 2 H 4, whereas 4 B 4 + UCHL 1 + helper-inducer cells were virtually absent; CD 8 <b>cord</b> <b>cells</b> were also <b>of</b> the 2 H 4 + 4 B 4 - UCHL 1 - phenotype. In contrast in adult peripheral blood, half <b>of</b> the T <b>cells,</b> whether CD 4 or CD 8, were 2 H 4 + and half 4 B 4 /UCHL 1 +. The suppressor-inducer phenotype <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> T <b>cells</b> was shown, in parallel functional experiments, to correlate with their enhanced proliferation to lectin and poor production of immunoglobulin {{and with the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>cord</b> mononuclear <b>cells</b> to suppress proliferation and immunoglobulin production by adult cells in co-culture experiments. These {{results indicate that the}} major imbalance in the cord CD 4 subset in favour of 2 H 4 cells can explain many of the functional differences from adult <b>cells.</b> However, involvement <b>of</b> other <b>cell</b> types, in particular of the monocyte lineage, is necessary to explain other properties <b>of</b> immunocompetent <b>cord</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{healing of}} full {{thickness}} surgical wounds from 0 to 14 days {{has been studied}} in hairless mice. Within 2 days after wounding the surrounding epidermis is thickened and primarily composed <b>of</b> enlarged basophilic <b>cells.</b> The remnants <b>of</b> the hair follicles attached to the epidermis are converted into <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> enlarged basophilic <b>cells.</b> Epidermal thickening is maximum at 7 days. Associated with the epidermal thickening surrounding the wound edge {{is an increase in}} the total number <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in the stratum granulosum and in the stratum spinosum.

40|$|The {{intradermal}} {{injection of}} 140 μg of Propionibacterium acnes (CN 6134) into {{the ears of}} female Sprague-Dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with formation of acneiform lesions. Inflammation was characterized {{by more than a}} doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3 – 4 times control levels at day 21. At 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. Histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. Pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic <b>cords</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. By day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. Three isolates of P. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results {{similar to that of the}} strain CN 6134. In these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. In contrast, samples of Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli B, and Staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. Benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and transretinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of P. acnes CN 6134 -induced ear thickening. The corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. The specificity for Propionibacterium acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne...|$|R
