40|$|A {{modified}} <b>cyclone</b> <b>washer</b> was designed, fabricated, and {{its collection}} efficiency evaluated. This equipment {{consists of an}} American-type cyclone separator with a triple cone and a spray nozzle was introduced into its cylindrical body. The study consisted of an experimental evaluation of the operating conditions at ambient and higher than ambient temperatures, varying chimney height and water flow rate, {{with the purpose of}} humidifying the dust. The collection efficiency of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>washer</b> was evaluated particles of micronized quartz with an average diameter of 7. 48 mu m and a density of 2. 650 g/cm(3). The amount of particles varied from 20 - 100 mg/m(3) of air. An average efficiency of 97. 07 +/- 1. 03 % was obtained with four spray nozzles, a chimney height of 0. 645 m and 0. 358 m(3) /s of gas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach {{for developing a}} vulnerability model to predict the probability and extent of damage to metal-clad industrial buildings due to extreme wind loading. Structural reliability-based methods that describe the spatially distributed wind load and component/connection strengths probabilistically {{are used in the}} model. Two failure mechanisms are considered for the roof envelop, namely; failure of roof cladding, and purlin failure. Interdependency between the failure mechanisms, load sharing effects due to connection/component failure, and internal pressure variation due to roof cladding failure are also considered. The industrial building examined in the study is a hot rolled structural steel, metal-clad, gable-end building designed for cyclonic regions in Australia. The likelihood and extent of roof damage for this buildings is presented using wind vulnerability curves obtained from the probabilistic model. It is found that internal pressure (e. g. an open door) and the use of <b>cyclone</b> <b>washers</b> has a significant effect on wind vulnerability. The utilisation of <b>cyclone</b> <b>washers</b> is found to reduce damage risks by over 70 %...|$|R
