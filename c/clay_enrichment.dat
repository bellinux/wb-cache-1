40|$|Abstract: Due {{to severe}} soil erosion the {{fertility}} of the soils of the Chinese loess plateau decreases. Together with the sediment also nutrients are lost. Near Luoyang (Henan province, China) field plots were constructed to measure nutrient and soil losses under different tillage practices. In {{addition to the}} measurements under natural rainfall conditions, rainfall simulations were carried out on bare soil {{on the field and}} in the laboratory. Rainfall simulations in the lab were used to correlate nutrient losses to sediment losses. The average enrichment ratios of phosphorus, organic carbon and CaCO 3 varied between 1 and 1. 3. The influence of the unit sediment load on the enrichment values was limited. Similar values were found for the rainfall simulations on the field. In the beginning of the rainfall simulation a preferential transport of fine particles took place, but after 30 minutes the <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> ratio decreased towards 1. Nutrient analyses of the runoff from the field plots under natural rain indicated much higher enrichment ratios for organic carbon and available phosphorus. Possibly these values are due to application of P fertilizer, but additional field measurements have to confirm this...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} Woburn Erosion Reference Experiment (Bedfordshire, UK) {{were used to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that losses of phosphorus (P) in small erosion events are as great as those in infrequent large events, and to examine the effect of storm characteristics on the selective enrichment of P in eroded sediment. For almost every plot event in the period 1988 to 1994, the clay-sized fraction of the sediment was enriched compared with the soil of the plots. There was more variation in <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> for smaller erosion events than for larger ones. The clay and P contents of the sediment were strongly correlated (p 100 kg). The greater frequency of smaller events, combined with the likelihood of higher P concentrations in the sediment, therefore accounted for a greater proportion of the P lost over the 6 -yr period than the infrequent large events. Phosphorus concentrations generally increased with increasing peak discharge and decreased with increasing event duration. For the same return period, P losses were generally greater from plots cultivated up and down the slope than from those cultivated across the slope. Overall, our results suggest that small erosion events should be controlled to prevent P contamination of surface waters and that the most effective means of doing this are by the introduction of minimal tillage techniques and across-slope cultivations...|$|E
40|$|Subsurface {{features}} causative to foundation {{failure and}} palpable leaning of a low-rise superstructure in Zaria area, Nigeria were studied using 2 D seismic refraction tomography. The building {{is characterized by}} severe foundation-based cracks and rotational leaning angle of about 5. 50. Seismic Refraction Tomography (SRT) data were collected along eight profile lines mapped {{in the vicinity of}} the building. P-wave velocities in the range of 226 - 3238 ms- 1 which encompass the velocities of most clayey soils and the bedrock in the area were registered during the survey. The interpreted data shows that sandy soil and clay soil predominantly characterise the foundation depths of the superstructure whereas at greater depths, the bedrock is basically gneissic. Results also show evidence of velocity contrast at < 2. 0 m foundation depths between adjacent sides of the building. Interpreted tomograms show that the superstructure leans east-westerly towards a synclinal subsurface structure. Free swell test carried out on soil samples confirmed that the building’s vicinity has swelling <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> with swell increment ratio of range 0. 70 - 2. 50. Based on p-wave and calculated s-wave data, high compressibility of 1. 46 x 10 - 10 - 4. 17 x 10 - 10 Pa- 1 was estimated. The interpreted results showed that there was velocity contrasts between the flanking sides of the building. Also, there were creepy ground movements as a consequence of swelling clay.

40|$|Late Pliocene to Recent sediments {{from the}} {{southern}} Brazil Basin (DSDP Hole 515 A, hydraulic piston core) were analyzed for evidence of episodic flow of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) through the Vema Channel. Carbonate-enriched layers punctuate the post-Pliocene section, otherwise composed predominantly of terrigenous silt and <b>clay.</b> Carbonate <b>enrichment</b> is thought to result from rapid deposition of fine-grained calcareous turbidites, originating in canyons incised on the northern margin of the Rio Grande Rise. The composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages {{and the presence of}} stratigraphically displaced discoasters is consistent with a turbidite origin. Based on the presence of displaced Antarctic diatoms, AABW flow through the Vema Channel apparently has had a major influence on this site for only four periods during the last 2. 7 Ma (about 45 to 250; 375 to 430; 700 to 780; 1320 to 1345 thousand yr. ago) ...|$|R
40|$|Thrusting {{fault zone}} in {{foreland}} basins {{are characterized by}} highly foliated zones generally enriched in phyllosilicates which can {{play a major role}} on the mechanical behaviour of the fault. In this context, investigations of synkinematic clay minerals permit to determine the origin of the fluid from which they precipitated as well as the mechanisms of deformation. Our study is focused on clay mineral assemblages (illite and chlorite) in a major thrust fault located in the Monte Perdido massif (southern Pyrenees), a shallow thrust that affects upper cretaceous-paleocene platform carbonates and lower Eocene marls and turbidites. It implied 3 km of displacement of the Monte Perdido thrust unit with respect to the underlying Gavarnie unit. In this area the cleavage development by pressure-solution is linked to the Monte Perdido and Gavarnie thrust activity. The core zone of the fault, about 6 m thick, consists of an interval of intensely deformed clay-bearing rocks bounded by major shear surfaces. The deformed sediment is markedly darker than the protolith. Calcite-quartz shear veins along the shear planes are abundant. Detailed SEM and TEM observations of highly deformed fault zone samples indicate that <b>clay</b> mineral <b>enrichment</b> in the core zone of the fault is not only related to passive increase by pressure-solution mechanism but that dissolution-recrystallization of phyllosilicates occurs during deformation. A mineral segregation is observed in the highly deformed zone. Newly formed 2 M 1 muscovite is present along the cleavage whereas IIb chlorite crystals fill SV 2 shear veins suggesting syntectonic growth of phyllosilicates in the presence of fluids in low-grade metamorphic conditions. These mineralogical reactions act as weakening processes and would favour Monte Perdido fault creeping...|$|R
40|$|Smectite clay {{minerals}} are abundant in soils and sediments worldwide and are typically rich in Fe. While recent investigations {{have shown that}} the structural Fe(III) bound in {{clay minerals}} is reduced by microorganisms, previous studies have not tested growth with clay minerals as the sole electron acceptor. Here we have demonstrated that a pure culture of Shewanella oneidensis strain MR- 1 as well as enrichment cultures of Fe(III) -reducing bacteria from rice paddy soil and subsurface sediments are capable of conserving energy for growth with the structural Fe(III) bound in smectite clay as the sole electron acceptor. Pure cultures of S. oneidensis were used for more detailed growth rate and yield experiments on various solid- and soluble-phase electron acceptors [smectite, Fe(III) oxyhydroxide FeOOH, Fe(III) citrate, and oxygen] in the same minimal medium. Growth was assessed as direct cell counts or as an increase in cell carbon (measured as particulate organic carbon). Cell counts showed that similar growth of S. oneidensis (108 cells ml− 1) occurred with smectitic Fe(III) and on other Fe forms [amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxide, and Fe citrate] or oxygen as the electron acceptor. In contrast, cell yields of S. oneidensis measured as the increase in cell carbon were similar on all Fe forms tested while yields on oxygen were five times higher, in agreement with thermodynamic predictions. Over a range of particle loadings (0. 5 to 4 g liter− 1), the increase in cell number was highly correlated to the amount of structural Fe in smectite reduced. From phylogenetic analysis of the complete 16 S rRNA gene sequences, a predominance of clones retrieved from the <b>clay</b> mineral-reducing <b>enrichment</b> cultures were most closely related to the low-G+C gram-positive members of the Bacteria (Clostridium and Desulfitobacterium) and the δ-Proteobacteria (members of the Geobacteraceae). Results indicate that growth with smectitic Fe(III) is similar in magnitude to that with Fe(III) oxide minerals and is dependent upon the mineral surface area available. Iron(III) bound in clay minerals should be considered an important electron acceptor supporting the growth of bacteria in soils or sedimentary environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{elemental}} chemostratigraphy of the Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Member of the Mancos Shale {{shows that}} six chemostratigraphic zones {{can be identified}} in the Piceance Basin, Colorado, based on geochemical data collected from cuttings at 10 -, 20 -, and 30 -ft (3. 05, 6. 10, and 9. 14 m) intervals. Chemostratigraphic correlations of nine wells spaced 20 mi (~ 32 km) apart closely match lithostratigraphic correlations made using gamma-ray and deep-resistivity logs. Lithologic interpretations made from wireline logs indicate that the Niobrara Member and equivalent strata consist primarily of interbedded calcareous shale and shaley limestone facies that increase in thickness to the northwest of the basin. The geochemical data suggest that during deposition of the Niobrara Member, anoxia and calcium enrichment increased {{to the east of}} the basin, whereas terrestrial input and <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> increased to the northwest. Element cross-plots suggest that {{a large portion of the}} silicon is detrital and that the Niobrara Member becomes an increasingly more clastic than carbonate system to the west. The Δ Log R-derived total organic carbon (TOC) calculated using a sonic-resistivity overlay analysis technique shows that the Niobrara Member comprises organic-rich and organic-poor deposits. Average TOC values range between 1 (in organic-poor deposits) and 2. 37 wt. % (in organic-rich deposits) with higher TOC values recorded in the southern and eastern portions of the basin. Relative-rock brittleness estimates from element and TOC data show the stratigraphic variability of alternating ductile (TOC rich, Ca and Si/Al poor) and brittle intervals (TOC poor, Ca and Si/Al rich) for the Niobrara Member...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} comparison {{was made}} of two bathymetric charts of the Lagoon of Venice (LV) from 1970 and 2000, in tandem with a comparison of sediment grain size data. Analysis of the data revealed marked changes in both morphology and sedimentation, with more than 50 % of the 400 km 2 assessed in this study 15 ? 20 cm shallower in 1970 than in 2000. The four sub-basins into which the LV is subdivided saw different patterns of change. The Northern basin A was identified as ?pristine?, i. e. still in quasi-natural condition, with slight <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> and a small degree of deepening (4 ? 5 cm), essentially due to sea level rise (SLR). The bathymetry and sedimentology of the northern-central sub-basin B (identified as ?urban?) and the southern-central basin C (identified as ?open?) were affected by infill activities and excavation of industrial navigation channels in the 1970 s, causing the loss of ~ 60 km 2 of mudflats, and creating an ?open? lagoon. The southernmost basin D (identified as ?exploited-subsiding?) of the LV {{was found to be}} relatively unchanged and still in semi-natural condition. Comparison of sediment types showed depletion of fine-grained fractions (b 22 &# 956;m) in all sub-basins except the northernmost one. Consequent enrichment in sand (N 63 &# 956;m) was recorded, except in the southerncentral sub-basin C where medium and coarse sand fractions declined. The results suggest that climate-related SLR accounts for a small fraction of bathymetric change, whilst variations in hydrodynamics (currents and wind patterns) and sediment supply are likely causal factors for the different evolution of the four sub-basins. Definition of the attributes of each sub-basin provided data that was essential not only for the LV but also for predicting the fate of transitional environments facing both anthropic (fishing, navigation, land use changes) as well as natural (SLR, eustatism) forcing factors...|$|E
40|$|Termite mounds are {{commonly}} enriched in clay and nutrients relative to surrounding topsoils. We hypothesized that: (1) nutrient enrichment of mounds differs between fungus-culturing (FC) and non-FC termites; (2) FC termites preferentially acquire materials rich in scarce nutrients which promote growth of their fungus cultures; and (3) micro-nutrient enrichment in mounds of FC termites is beneficial for wildlife. In a preliminary investigation of these hypotheses, we sampled mounds (and adjacent topsoil) of Macrotermes (FC) and Trinervitermes (non-FC) termites in Namibia and South Africa, respectively. Analyses included: 27 elements by ICPMS after a nitric acid-hydrogen peroxide digest, organic carbon, a seven fraction particle size analysis, and pH and EC (1 : 5 soil:water extracts). Macrotermes mounds showed significant (1. 6 - 3. 7 -fold) enrichment of 23 of the 27 elements analysed relative to topsoil. By contrast, Trinervitermes mounds showed no enrichment. <b>Clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> of Macrotermes mounds (4. 7 - 6. 5 -fold) was strongly correlated with element enrichment (r 2 range: 0. 76 - 0. 77), suggesting that amendment of soil texture is a main factor in enrichment. Marked enrichment of only certain nutrients in mounds - namely Mn, Co, Cu and Se - was evident at certain nutrient-poor sites, suggesting that specific {{materials such as}} Mn oxides (which adsorb Co, Cu and Se) may be gathered by termites in disproportionate amounts relative to their abundance in soils. These nutrients are likely to enhance the productivity of the fungus culture and hence the termite colony. Parts of certain mounds were enriched in Se (1. 3 - 3. 6 mg Se kg- 1) to a degree likely to attract geophagy. It is suggested that in some landscapes Macrotermes mounds provide a critical supply of micro-nutrients to wildlife. © 2009 The Zoological Society of London. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Large {{uncertainties}} {{still exist}} {{on both the}} rates of soil organic carbon (SOC) mobilization by soil erosion {{as well as the}} fate of the eroded C. Using a range of techniques we characterized soil C redistribution by water erosion in two small agricultural catchments in the Belgian Loess Belt. Results from rainfall simulations showed that C enrichment in eroded sediments was much higher than <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> (average enrichment ratios of 2. 47 and 1. 36 on average respectively). Selectivity was also observed in depositional processes: sediments deposited within the catchments were depleted in C and finer fractions as compared to the source soil. Selectivity was much more pronounced in winter than in summer, which is related to the degree of aggregation of the transported/deposited sediment. The combined selectivity of erosion and depositional processes resulted in a significant C enrichment of the sediment exported from the catchments with the C enrichment ratio (CER) between 1. 2 and 3. 0. Overall, catchment-scale C enrichment was higher than clay enrichment: enrichment ratios varied both with season and event intensity. The uncertainties on catchment-wide erosion and deposition rates precluded the closure of the sediment-C budgets. However, using a simple model we were able to show that both the magnitude and variation of observed catchment-scale CER was as expected from our understanding of C mobilization and deposition within the catchment. This suggests that most of the mobilized C was not mineralized during the erosion events but either re-deposited within the catchment or exported with the runoff. This was confirmed by the comparison of the elemental and isotopic signatures between exported sediments and source soil. In order to assess the role of erosion in the C cycle, understanding how C is mobilized and re-deposited selectively by erosion appears therefore as important as improving our understanding of the impact of erosion on C mineralization.

40|$|Lower Toarcian strata (Lower Jurassic) {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied {{with a view}} to understanding the oceanographic, climatic and biological processes that drove the Earth’s system into an Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE). For this time period, the evolution of the European marine seaways is now relatively well constrained owing to multiple geochemical studies, but investigations regarding climatic trends in the continental realm remain sparse. In the present study, we test the clay mineralogy as a continental climate-sensitive proxy in the well-documented Sancerre core (southern Paris Basin). We compare variations in the kaolinite content with pCO 2 fluctuations (derived from paired carbon isotopes; Δ 13 C = δ 13 Ccarb – δ 13 Corg), taking advantage of the detailed chemostratigraphic, palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphy frameworks established for this core material. The results indicate a substantial decrease in kaolinite abundance {{at the end of the}} Pliensbachian, which is compatible with a long-term diminution in continental weathering and an inferred temperature decrease. The early Toarcian, prior to the carbon cycle perturbation and deposition of black shale facies, remained relatively cold with minima in both the proportion of kaolinite and reconstructed pCO 2. The mineralogical and geochemical responses across the prominent negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) itself are not univocal. The first of four steps that compose the negative limb of the CIE at Sancerre is associated with decreased kaolinite and pCO 2, and increased carbonate oxygen isotope ratios. Taken together, these trends are compatible with a transient cooling phase immediately preceding the onset of black shale deposition. Conversely, the subsequent steps are marked by substantial enrichment in kaolinite that matches increased osmium isotope ratios measured in Yorkshire, providing compelling evidence for rapid increases in continental weathering and riverine runoff forced by intensification of greenhouse conditions during the CIE. Relaxation in the intensity of continental weathering, as suggested by resumed low kaolinite abundance is seen immediately after the cessation of CO 2 input (after the fourth step of the CIE). The interval spanning the upper portion of the early Toarcian and the middle Toarcian records a subsequent long-term increase in the proportion of kaolinite synchronous with significant <b>clay</b> <b>enrichment</b> of the sediment. Continued greenhouse conditions, even after the recovery from the carbon isotope perturbation and “regional” black shale deposition, are likely related to sustained CO 2 emission by Karoo-Ferrar volcanism through the considered interval. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} a {{suite of}} seventy-four formation-water samples from Mississippian and Pennsylvanian carbonate and siliciclastic strata in the Illinois basin for major, minor, and trace element concentrations and for strontium isotopic composition. A subset of these samples was also analyzed for boron isotopic composition. Data are used to interpret origin of salinity and chemical and Sr isotopic evolution of the brines and in comparison with a similar data set from an earlier study of basin formation waters from Silurian-Devonian reservoirs. Systematics of Cl-Br-Na show that present Mississippian-Pennsylvanian brine salinity {{can be explained by}} a combination of subaerial seawater evaporation short of halite saturation and subsurface dissolution of halite from an evaporite zone in the middle Mississippian St. Louis Limestone, along with extensive dilution by mixing with meteoric waters. Additional diagenetic modifications in the subsurface interpreted from cation/Br ratios include K depletion through interaction with <b>clay</b> minerals, Ca <b>enrichment,</b> and Mg depletion by dolomitization, and Sr enrichment through CaCO 3 recrystallization and dolomitization. Ste. Genevieve Limestone (middle Mississippian) formation waters show 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in the range 0. 70782 - 0. 70900, whereas waters from the siliciclastic reservoirs are in the range 0. 70900 - 0. 71052. Inverse correlations between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and B, Li, and Mg concentrations suggest that the brines acquired radiogenic 87 Sr through interaction with siliciclastic minerals. Completely unsystematic relations between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 1 /Sr are observed; Sr concentrations in Ste. Genevieve and Aux Vases (middle Mississippian) waters appear to be buffered by equilibrium with respect to SrSO 4. Although there are many similarities in their origin and evolution, these formation waters are distinguished from Silurian-Devonian brines in the basin by elevated Cl/Br and Na/Br ratios and by unsystematic Sr isotope relationships. Thus waters from these two major segments of the Illinois basin stratigraphic column form distinct geochemical regimes which are separated by the New Albany Shale Group (Devonian-Mississippian) regional aquitard.

The following parameters were measured: temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (i. e. salinity) and alkalinity; these data were used to compute partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2). Furthermore, samples were collected to characterise waters from a chemical point of view (major elements). To implement our data - base, chemical analyses of 6 CO 2 - rich mineral waters of Rome were considered. Hydrochemical survey was mainly devoted to: i) classify waters in chemical facies; ii) investigate the main water-rock interaction processes governing the water’s chemical evolution, also affected by variable amounts of dissolved CO 2 and iii) define the pCO 2 level in groundwater {{in the frame of}} the knowledge so far acquired in the Tyrrhenian sector of central Italy [...] Groundwater shows a dominant Ca-HCO 3 chemistry; some samples belong to Na-HCO 3, Na-Cl and CaCl 2 hydrochemical facies. In the dominant facies waters show a large variability in the abundance of chemical elements, in their salinity (ranging between 0. 46 e 3. 83 g/l) and pH (in the interval 5. 87 - 7. 22); these features are mainly due to different water-rock interaction processes together with the presence of variable CO 2 contents. Na-HCO 3 waters show the lowest salinity values (TDS up to 0. 32 g/l) and strongly alkaline pH; cation exchange processes with <b>clays,</b> causing Na <b>enrichment</b> and Ca and Mg removal from solution, can be invoked to justify the observed chemistry. Waters of the Castel Fusano Natural Reserve (CFNR) belong to the Na-Cl and Ca-Cl 2 facies; the different chemistry reflects the geochemical processes going on in the considered coastal aquifers such as: i) mixing between freshwater and saline waters of marine origin (fossil waters, seawater intrusion) and ii) cationic exchanges with clays that make up the less permeable sediments of the area. Two samples of the CFNR group have Ca-HCO 3 chemistry and represent aquifers not affected by salinization processes. Calculated pCO 2 distribution is highly variable, from low (0. 03 bar) to high values (0. 72 bar), implying different CO 2 input (and origin) in the studied aquifers.

40|$|Deep-water {{sedimentary}} {{sequences of}} mid-Cretaceous age, rich in organic carbon, {{have been recovered}} at many DSDP sites in the Atlantic Ocean. Most of these sequences have a marked cyclicity in amount of organic carbon resulting in interbedded multicolored shale, marlstone, and (or) limestone that have cycle periods of 20, 000 to 100, 000 years and average 40, 000 to 50, 000 years. These cycles {{may be related to}} some climatic control on influx of terrigenous organic matter and sediment, rates of upwelling and sea-surface production of organic matter, and preservation of organic matter related to deeper-water dissolved oxygen concentration. These variations in supply of organic matter had pronounced effects on the potential of the sediment for subsequent diagenetic changes and geochemical partitioning in adjacent beds. Many trace elements are enriched in organic-carbon-rich lithologies relative to interbedded organic-carbon-poor lithologies. Elements that are most commonly enriched are Cr, Ni, V, Cu, Zn, and Mo. The association of high traceelement concentrations with organic matter {{may be the result of}} concentration of these elements by organisms or by chemical sorption and precipitation processes under anoxic conditions. Detailed trace-element profiles from organiccarbon- rich strata at Site 530 suggest that there may be differential mobility of trace elements, with diffusion of some elements over distances of at least tens of meters. The sequence of trace-element mobility, from highest to lowest, is approximately Ba, Mn, Pb, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, Zn, V, Cd, and Mo. Slowly deposited, oxidized clays directly overlying some black shale sequences are enriched in some metals, particularly Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu, relative to normal pelagic <b>clays,</b> and this <b>enrichment</b> may be the result of upward migration of metals in pore waters during compaction or diffusion from the underlying black shale. Most depositional models that have been used to explain the accumulation of the organic-carbon-rich strata imply that reducing conditions in the sediments (and therefore the increased degree of preservation of organic matter) were the result of anoxic or near-anoxic conditions in oceanic bottom waters, or in a midwater oxygen-minimum zone. Evidence from several DSDP sites in the Atlantic, however, indicate that some of these middle Cretaceous "black shale" beds may be the result of variations in rate of supply of organic matter that produced anoxia or near-anoxia within midwater oxygen-minimum zones and possibly, under extreme conditions, throughout much of the bottomwater mass. Although bottom-water anoxia may have occurred during periods of organic-carbon-rich strata, it was not necessarily the only cause for accumulation of these strata. The main reason for the accumulation of organic-carbonrich strata was an increase in the relative amount of organic debris being deposited. Some of this organic debris was derived from continental-margin areas of increased production, accumulation, and preservation of organic matter from marine, terrestrial, or mixed sources and transported to slope and basinal sites by turbidity currents...|$|R
