5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> tail.|$|E

5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet {{is more likely to be}} closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E

5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{brighter}} {{star of the}} Pleione binary pair, component A, is a hot type B star 190 {{times more}} luminous than the Sun. It is classified as Be star with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other. The primary star rotates rapidly, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> breakup velocity, even faster than Achernar. Although some research on the companion star has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the accretion disks {{is about}} 10millionyears. By {{the time the}} star reaches the classical T-Tauri stage, the disk becomes thinner and cools. Less volatile materials start to condense <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> center, forming 0.1–1μm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates. The transport of the material from the outer disk can mix these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones, which contain organic matter and other volatiles. This mixing can explain some peculiarities {{in the composition of}} Solar System bodies such as the presence of interstellar grains in the primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
5|$|HD 49674 {{is a star}} in Auriga {{with one}} planet {{orbiting}} it. This G5V type star is faint, at magnitude 8.1, and fairly distant, at 40.7 parsecs from Earth. Like the other stars, it is similar in size to the Sun, with a mass of 1.07 solar masses and a radius of 0.94 solar radii. Its planet, HD 49674 b, is a smaller planet, at 0.115 Jupiter masses. It orbits very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> star, at 0.058 AU, every 4.94 days. HD 49674 b was discovered by radial velocity observations in 2002. HAT-P-9 b is the first transiting exoplanet confirmed in Auriga, orbiting the star HAT-P-9. Unlike the other exoplanets in Auriga, detected by radial velocity measurements, HAT-P-9 b was detected using the transit method in 2008. It has a mass of 0.67 Jupiter masses and orbits just 0.053 AU from its parent star, with a period of 3.92 days; its radius is 1.4 Jupiter radii, making it a hot Jupiter. Its parent star, HAT-P-9, is an F-type star approximately 480 parsecs from Earth. It has a mass of 1.28 solar masses and a radius of 1.32 solar radii.|$|E
