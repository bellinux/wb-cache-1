5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three decades, has <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries. Those in the United Kingdom are primarily from South Asia, in France from North and West Africa, in Germany from Turkey, in Belgium from Morocco, and in the Netherlands from Morocco and Turkey.}} While there are no official statistics, {{a significant portion of the}} estimated 175,000–200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in Nørrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>{{increasing}}</b> catches of fish include {{an increasing number}} of mechanised and motorised boats, installation of fish aggregating devices which improve the efficiency of fishing activities, and improvements in infrastructure for collecting and handling the fish catch. Of the pelagic species, skipjack tuna has been almost exclusively exploited. The pelagic fisheries may have considerable expansion potential, especially further from the coast, targeting species such as yellowfin. Demersal and reef species can also be exploited at higher levels. At present, development is limited by limited local facilities for storing and transporting fish.|$|E
25|$|As the Byzantine Empire {{declined}} under Basil's successors, {{invasions of}} Pechenegs and rising taxes <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> discontent, {{which resulted in}} several major uprisings in 1040–41, the 1070s, and the 1080s. The initial centre of the resistance was the theme of Bulgaria, {{in what is now}} Macedonia, where the massive Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040–41) and the Uprising of Georgi Voiteh (1072) took place. Both were quelled with great difficulty by Byzantine authorities. These were followed by rebellions in Paristrion and Thrace. During the Comnenian Restoration and the temporary stabilisation of the Byzantine Empire {{in the first half of}} the 12th century, the Bulgarians were pacified and no major rebellions took place until later in the century.|$|E

2500|$|The turn of {{the decades}} spelled a {{political}} disaster for Tejada: the Alfonsist pretender was nominated as the future king and Carlism was firmly {{taken over by the}} hugocarlistas. On the official front, in 1972 he was trialed for anti-government remarks. On the Carlist front, his 1971 last-minute doctrinal summary, ¿Qué es el carlismo?, made the Traditionalist position crystal clear, but failed to prevent transformation of Javierismo into the socialist-dominated Partido Carlista. During last years of Francoism he witnessed and indeed <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> decomposition of Traditionalism. In 1972 he was skeptical about launching an anti-hugocarlista organization on the Requeté basis and ridiculed its leaders, attracting some criticism in return. However, he engaged in another anti-hugocarlista initiative, Real Tercio de Requetés de Castilla, and neared the youngest of the Borbón-Parmas, Don Sixto, considered even his intellectual mentor. In 1975 he accepted Don Sixto as royal leader, though neither as a claimant nor regent but as a vaguely styled [...] "abanderado de la Tradición".|$|E

2500|$|Allen's {{response}} was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report {{could be made}} by a liaison officer or more senior officer. [...] MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. [...] To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: [...] "Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty." [...] Allen replied, in part: [...] "I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel {{that they could not}} have done better." [...] Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having [...] "botched" [...] the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. [...] The pressure for more haste thereby <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement [...] and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.|$|E

Since the fatty acid composition of waste oil shows that there are still many unsaturated fatty acids present, the fatty acids composition may not be the only factor <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> performance.

50|$|The Upper Paleolithic has the {{earliest}} known evidence of organized settlements, {{in the form of}} campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also noted, from artifacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types.
