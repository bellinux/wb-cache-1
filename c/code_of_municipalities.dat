Este estudo teve como objetivo geral identificar as dificuldades da efetivação da Rede Sentinela de Notificação de Acidentes e Agravos em saúde dos trabalhadores a partir da visão dos/as gestores/as e trabalhadores/as/SUS da Regional de Saúde de Rondonópolis-MT, 2009 - 2011. Tratou-se de um estudo descritivo-explicativo por meio de pesquisa documental e questionário junto aos gestores e trabalhadores/SUS que responderam as questões fechadas e semi-abertas, com análise quantitativa. Os resultados possibilitaram as seguintes assertivas: as notificações de agravos e acidentes de trabalho no SINAN Sistema de Informação de Agravos e Notificações não estão em conformidade com os registros do MPS/DATAPREV, CAT, SUB; existe alto índice de subnotificação nos dados do SINAN; falta treinamento para os trabalhadores/SUS; não existem profissionais designados especificamente para atuar na saúde do trabalhador e o Código Sanitário dos Municípios da Regional de Saúde de Rondonópolis não aborda aspectos da saúde do trabalhador. Neste sentido, concluiu-se que os gestores não possuem conhecimento real sobre os casos de acidentes de trabalho, por isso, não percebem a importância de ações para reduzir os problemas de subnotificações dos atendimentos realizados na Rede Sentinela. Concluiuse ainda que os trabalhadores são atendidos, porém não notificados, sugerindo-se maior efetividade nas notificações. The {{matter of}} worker s health {{has been getting}} a bigger {{attention}} {{in the field of}} social discussions, Public Engagement and Public Health, proving the fragility in the area of injuries and work accidents treatment. This study had as general objective identify the difficulties met in the process of effectuation of Rede Sentinela de Notificação de Acidentes e Agravos em Saúde dos Trabalhadores (Sentinel Network for Notification of Accidents and Injuries in the Workers Health), from the view of the managers and workers at SUSRegional de Saúde de Rondonópolis-MT (Health Public System-Regional Health Center of Rondonopolis-MT), in the period 2009 - 2011. It s a descriptive-explanatory study, which used the documental research and questionnaire to interview managers and workers from SUS (Public Health System), who answered closed and semi -open questions, according to quantitative analysis. The results indicated the following statement: the notifications of injuries and work accidents in SINAN Sistema de Informação de Agravos e Notificações (SINAN=System of information and notification of injuries) are not in conformity with the records of MPS/DATAPREV, CAT, SUB; there is a high level of sub-notification of data in SINAN; {{there is a lack of}} training for workers/SUS; there aren t especifically designated professionals to work with the workers health and the Sanitary <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Municipalities</b> from Health Regional of Rondonópolis doesn t address aspects concerning the workers health. There fore, it can be concluded that the managers don t have the real knowledge of the cases concerning the work accidents, and because of that, they don t realize the importance of actions to reduce problems of sub-notifications of the care provided at Rede Sentinela (Sentinel Network). It was also concluded that even though the workers have received care, they are not registered, situation which suggests a better effectiveness in the notifications...|$|E

40|$|The {{need and}} desire to achieve {{sustainable}} architectures, including control of energy relations between climate and built environment to optimize energy consumptions and reduction of environmental impact, require an integrated planning dealt with a multiscale and integral view of building-plant system. In this paper the case of multifunctional building complex Solaria is described: a redevelopment project of a disused industrial area, approximately 20, 000 m 2, located {{in the center of}} Ponte San Giovanni, a town in the immediate periphery of Perugia (Italy), conceived and designed in accordance with the logic above mentioned. Objective of the study has been to achieve an integrated approach to the problems related to demands of comfort and healthy living, sustainability of building process, containment of energy consumptions and use of renewable energy resources. The coordination for energy efficiency has supported an accurate study of plant-structural interventions and innovative experimental components, which synergistically integrated in a single project have enabled to reach important results, as demonstrated by the assessment of avoided CO 2 emissions, equal to nearly 500 tons per year. The project plans, for instance, to provide the building complex with: a high-efficiency tri-generation plant (525 kW of electric power) coupled with a distribution network for district heating/cooling; a photovoltaic generation system with 20 kW of peak power and solar thermal panels for sanitary warm water production, able to supply over 50 % of the needs; passive solar systems (solar greenhouses and "heat cushions"), equipped with sliding brise-soleils. Moreover, the results are certified through energy certification and sustainability valuation, in accordance with the building <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Municipality</b> <b>of</b> Perugia, and through the BESTClass certification methodology promoted by SACERT. The process for reaching better energy efficiency class has been analyzed under environmental and economic profiles, in terms of avoided emissions and higher costs compared to a standard design. The realization of energy efficiency solutions designed for Solaria makes the complex an advanced model, but also repeatable, of integrated planning unique in the regional scene, as well as a practical application of European Directives on the energy performance of buildings (2002 / 91 /EC) and on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (2006 / 32 /EC) ...|$|R

In this paper an overall approach for defining a sustainability scale is proposed for residential buildings, based on new local recommendations in North-East of Italy, defining rules based on existing European and national standards. This label is going to be introduced and applied by local governments for planning new buildings and defining rules for retrofit of buildings.

40|$|Background and objectives: In the {{discussion}} concerning centralisation of out-of-hours (OOH) {{primary health care}} services in Norway, travel time and distance have received considerable attention. It {{has been shown that}} long distance is associated with lower use of different types of health services. For OOH services, this is insufficiently investigated. The main objectives of this thesis were to characterise travel time and distance to Norwegian casualty clinics, and to examine any association between distance and utilisation of OOH services. Materials and methods: We developed and validated a method to calculate average travel time and distance based on population and post <b>code</b> coordinates <b>of</b> a <b>municipality.</b> Distance to casualty clinic for 417 municipalities were calculated. Activity data were taken from seven representative OOH services, and from OOH reimbursement claims in 2011. The association between distance and OOH utilisation was analysed by exponential regression. The influence from certain organisational, demographic and socioeconomic factors were also examined. Results: Increasing distance to casualty clinic was associated with reduced OOH utilisation, except telephone consultations with a doctor. The demographic and socioeconomic factors had minimal effect on OOH utilisation, but when adjusted for distance, collocation with hospital and participation in inter-municipal services were associated with lower use. The population of the 23 % <b>of</b> <b>municipalities</b> that had more than 40 minutes travel time constituted only five percent of the population. Therefore, recommendations for secondary on-call duty based on long distances apply to only a very small proportion of the population. Conclusion and consequences: Increasing travel time and distance are strongly associated with reduced OOH utilisation. It is crucial to take travel time and distance into consideration when planning the OOH services of the future. Measures to counteract inequalities in OOH utilisation due to long distance should be considered. </p...|$|R
