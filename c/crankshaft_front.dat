5000|$|The Ford car was {{thoroughly}} updated in 1941, {{in preparation for}} a time of unpredictability surrounding World War II. The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until the more modern 1949 Fords were ready. During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably. The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damage could be replaced easily. During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined. The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version. The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.Five different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan — front of the <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>front</b> of the generator (rare) and on a bracket. This is thought to be the first Ford to offer an oil filter. The two interior heaters were a [...] "Southwind" [...] gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type. Both had window defrosters. It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers. Three different convertible power top mechanisms (vacuum, electric screw, and hydraulic) and two different header bar latching systems were used. Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not. It had excellent brakes for the time, and the best handling of an ordinary car at the time. It was a very transitional car.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} develop a method of predicting cylinder indicated torques in a reciprocating engine by measurement of crankshaft angular velocity fluctuations. Cylinder indicated pressures were measured for all three cylinders of a two-stroke Diesel engine with pressure transducers. Time-resolved angular position was measured at the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>front</b> and at the flywheel. A six degree-of-freedom torsional crankshaft model was developed. Two solution methods are described to solve the equations of motion: a time-marching ODE solver, and a Finite Element solution in the time domain. Using these methods with the measured cylinder torques, the angular positions are predicted and compared to measured angular positions for model calibration. An inverse solution method was developed to determine the cylinder indicated torques from the measured angular position at the crankshaft endpoints. The method is theoretically demostrated to be useful for explicit solutions for two-stroke engines up to three cylinders, and four-stroke engines up to four cylinders. Experimental {{results show that the}} method is useful in predicting cylinder indicated torques from angular velocity measurements. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

50|$|Because {{the single}} driving axle {{was behind the}} firebox, Crampton {{locomotives}} usually had outside cylinders. However, some inside cylinder versions were built using indirect drive, then known as a jackshaft. The inside cylinders drove a <b>crankshaft</b> located in <b>front</b> of the firebox and the crankshaft {{was connected to the}} driving wheels by outside rods. Some long-wheelbase 0-4-0 tank locomotives were also built using this crankshaft system. The boiler feed-pump was often driven from the crankshaft as well because many Cramptons were built before the injector was invented.|$|R

50|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} the Bentley 4½ Litre and the Blower was {{the addition of a}} Roots-type supercharger to the Blower engine by engineer Amherst Villiers, who had also produced the supercharger. W. O. Bentley, as chief engineer of the company he had founded, refused to allow the engine to be modified to incorporate the supercharger. As a result, the supercharger was placed {{at the end of the}} <b>crankshaft,</b> in <b>front</b> of the radiator. This gave the Blower Bentley an easily recognisable appearance and also increased the car's understeer due to the additional weight at the front. A guard protected the two carburetters located at the compressor intake. Similar protection was used, both in the 4½ Litre and the Blower, for the fuel tank at the rear, because a flying stone punctured the 3 Litre of Frank Clement and John Duff during the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, which contributed to their defeat.|$|R
50|$|He was {{recruited}} in 1926 by Cadillac general manager Lawrence P. Fisher (October 19, 1888 in Norwalk, Ohio - September 3, 1961 in Detroit, Michigan) {{to work at}} the Cadillac Division of General Motors Corporation (GM). Nacker became head of engine development. He designed a 45 degree Overhead valve V-8 with an aluminum crankcase, five main bearings, counterweighted <b>crankshaft</b> with a <b>front</b> vibration damper and timing chain driving the generator. Cylinder blocks included cast nickel-iron liners extending into the crankcase with cast iron heads. This was the engine for Cadillac Division's new 1927 LaSalle companion model.|$|R
50|$|The dual {{crankshafts}} {{are geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch, while the <b>front</b> <b>crankshaft</b> also drives a counter balancer shaft mounted between the two crankshafts. The counterbalance shaft, unusual on a two-stroke, assists with damping engine vibrations. The engine is cooled by thermostatically controlled liquid cooling, an auxiliary electric fan mounted behind the radiator cuts in at quite high but acceptable working temperatures (e.g. when stationary in traffic).Lubrication is by direct injection into the inlet manifolds using Yamaha's 'Autolube' pump system. Normally controlled in other two-stroke engines by throttle position, the engine oil pump {{is controlled by the}} YPVS servo motor ensuring that the oil supply is not shut off at high engine revolutions.|$|R
5000|$|A Moto Guzzi Technical Services {{representative}} {{tried to}} explain to LA Times columnist Susan Carpenter that Moto Guzzi engines are [...] "called 'transverse' because the engine is mounted with the <b>crankshaft</b> oriented <b>front</b> to back instead of left to right." [...] In spite of this, it could be assumed that those who call V-twin motorcycle engines [...] "transverse" [...] when they are mounted with the crankshaft front-to-back and the cylinders sticking out the sides are saying that to them, the engine's axis is the line passing from one cylinder to the other, at a right angle to the crankshaft, rather than going by the crankshaft's axis. Highly technical sources, such as V. Cossleter's Motorcycle Dynamics, or Gaetaeno Cocco's Motorcycle Design and Technology are careful not simply to use the terms [...] "longitudinal engine" [...] or [...] "transverse engine," [...] but rather to specify that they mark the engine's orientation based on the crankshaft, and so they will say [...] "transverse crankshaft engine" [...] or [...] "longitudinal crankshaft engine", or, conversely, [...] "transversely mounted cylinders" [...] in referenced to the classic BMW orientation, with a longitudinal crankshaft and cylinders at a right angle to the axis of the frame.|$|R
50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the <b>crankshaft</b> on the <b>front</b> of the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|R
