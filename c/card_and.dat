5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between the <b>card</b> <b>and</b> reader {{based on the}} ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the <b>card</b> <b>and</b> reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus <b>card</b> <b>and</b> system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E

When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
