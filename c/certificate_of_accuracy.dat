50|$|If {{the primary}} {{document}} {{has to be}} translated, an additional certificate is usually required. For example, a birth certificate in Russian {{is to be used}} in an English-speaking country. Typically, the document must be translated professionally and have the professional's <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> attached to the translation together with a copy of the primary document. Then, the primary document, the translation, and the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> are photocopied {{in the form of a}} certified copy. In the case of a birth certificate in English to be used in Russia, it is possible that a notarized copy will be required.|$|E
50|$|In 1707 Rand, and {{nineteen}} other members, including Petiver and Joseph Miller, took a lease of the Chelsea garden, {{to assist}} the Society of Apothecaries, and were constituted trustees; and for some time prior {{to the death of}} Petiver in 1718 Rand seems either to have assisted him or to have succeeded him in the office of demonstrator of plants to the society. In 1724 he was appointed to the newly created office of præfectus horti, or director of the garden. Among other duties he had to give at least two demonstrations in the garden in each of the six summer months, and to transmit to the Royal Society the fifty specimens per annum required by the terms of Sir Hans Sloane's donation of the garden. Lists of the plants sent for several years are in the Sloane MSS. Philip Miller was gardener throughout Rand's tenure of the office of præfectus, and it was in 1736 that Carl Linnæus visited the garden. Dillenius's edition of John Ray's Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum (1724) contains several records by Rand, whose assistance is acknowledged in the preface, and he is specially mentioned by the illustrator Elizabeth Blackwell as having assisted her with specimens for her Curious Herbal (1737-39), which was executed at Chelsea. He is one of those who prefix to the work a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy,</b> and a copy in the British Museum Library has manuscript notes by him.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a tool for}} addressing a key component in many algorithms for planning robot trajectories under uncertainty: evaluation of {{the safety of a}} robot whose actions are governed by a closed-loop feedback policy near a nominal planned trajectory. We describe an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo framework that enables the evaluation of a given control policy for satisfaction of a probabilistic collision avoidance constraint which also provides an associated <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> (in the form of a confidence interval). In particular this adaptive technique is well-suited to addressing the complexities of rigid-body collision checking applied to non-linear robot dynamics. As a Monte Carlo method it is amenable to parallelization for computational tractability, and is generally applicable to a wide gamut of simulatable systems, including alternative noise models. Numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive importance sampling procedure are presented and discussed...|$|E
50|$|When {{translating}} a text {{within the}} field of law, the translator should keep the following in mind. The legal system of the source text (ST) is structured in a way that suits that culture and this is reflected in the legal language; similarly, the target text (TT) is to be read by someone who is familiar with the other legal system (corresponding to the jurisdiction for which TT is prepared) and its language. Most forms of legal writing, and contracts in particular, seek to establish clearly defined rights and duties for certain individuals. It is essential to ensure precise correspondence of these rights and duties in the source text and in the translation. Legal translation may also involve, <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy,</b> witness statements, depositions, trusts, wills, articles of incorporation, litigation documents, immigration documents, property/exhibit labels and in some cases attendance in court by the translator(s).|$|R

In civil cases, although ordinary writs of error were authorized, the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division remained important [...] because it permitted appeals without regard to the amount in controversy and interlocutory appeals. Inasmuch as the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division permitted the Supreme Court some measure of control over its docket, it is a precursor to modern certiorari jurisdiction.|$|R
