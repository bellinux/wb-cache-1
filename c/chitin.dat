5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide <b>chitin,</b> which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. <b>Chitin,</b> hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the more}} ancient clade Systellommatophora, <b>chitin</b> darts {{are found in}} the pulmonate sea slugs of the family Onchidiidae, in the {{superfamily}} Onchidioidea.|$|E
5|$|Chitinous (composed of <b>chitin)</b> love darts {{occur in}} the pulmonate land snail {{families}} Ariophantidae (superfamily Helicarionoidea), in the family Helicarionidae (superfamily Helicarionoidea), in the Vitrinidae (superfamily Limacoidea), and in the slug family Parmacellidae (superfamily Parmacelloidea).|$|E
5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no <b>chitin,</b> and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous <b>chitin</b> and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack <b>chitin.</b> Hyphochytrids have both <b>chitin</b> and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E
5|$|Although fungi are opisthokonts—a {{grouping}} of evolutionarily related organisms broadly {{characterized by a}} single posterior flagellum—all phyla except for the chytrids have lost their posterior flagella. Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a cell wall that, in addition to glucans (e.g., β-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the biopolymer <b>chitin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of <b>chitin</b> and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. Chitosan derived from <b>chitin</b> induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases and insects including cyst nematodes, both are approved as biopesticides by the EPA to reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} <b>chitin</b> of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the <b>chitin</b> exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus tylopili {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} mycorrhizosphere of T.felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect {{the activity of the}} microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to break down the biomolecule <b>chitin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and <b>chitin</b> in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.|$|E
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly <b>chitin</b> and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of <b>chitin</b> and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of <b>chitin,</b> as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, <b>chitin</b> in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of <b>chitin</b> and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The <b>chitin</b> {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the <b>chitin</b> exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} <b>chitin</b> in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein {{very similar to that}} used in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as <b>chitin,</b> collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of <b>chitin</b> and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of <b>chitin</b> and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|The wings lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are elytra made of tough <b>chitin,</b> acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E
5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of <b>chitin.</b> The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|The thorax and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of <b>chitin.</b> The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines {{and there are a}} pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of <b>chitin.</b> The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of <b>chitin,</b> a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of <b>chitin</b> and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of <b>chitin</b> in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of <b>chitin,</b> so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in <b>chitin</b> that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the <b>chitin</b> exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing <b>chitin</b> and bone. Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a similar}} line of argument, Langley and Hungate (2003) {{argued that the}} {{abundance}} of <b>chitin</b> in ectomycorrhizal tissues may reduce decomposition rates of these fungi, {{under the assumption that}} <b>chitin</b> is recalcitrant. This possibility was tested and refuted recently. Fernandez and Koide (2012) show that <b>chitin</b> does not decompose more slowly than other chemical compounds in ectomycorrhizal tissues, and that <b>chitin</b> concentrations positively correlated with mycorrhizal biomass decomposition rates, rather than negatively.|$|E
25|$|Other natural resins — {{cellulose}} or <b>chitin,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|Arthropods (class Athropoda) {{are covered}} with a tough, {{resilient}} integument or exoskeleton of <b>chitin.</b> Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the <b>chitin</b> is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens {{in parts of the}} body where {{there is a need for}} rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the <b>chitin</b> and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the <b>chitin</b> supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin.|$|E
