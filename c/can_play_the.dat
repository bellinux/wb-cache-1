5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25W·h {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion polymer battery}} {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter.

The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20kHz.

25|$|Real Madrid {{use this}} style of play {{extremely}} well because they have very quick players in the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema of whom can speed in behind the defence and take them on when on the break at a quick pace. They also have passing masters in Kroos and Modric of whom <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> killer through ball in the spaces created. And for effect, they have a solid defence in Ramos and Varane to defend leads. Marcelo and Carvajal are also very quick full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the game is to score goals into the opponent's goal or net. The team with the most goals {{at the end of a}} game is {{declared}} the winner. In some tournaments, if the scores are tied after regular time, an additional overtime period is played to determine a winner. In the overtime period (in most cases), six players, three on each team, play five minutes without a goalie. The team to score more goals in the overtime period is declared the winner. In the event of another tie, a second overtime period may be played. In some games a shootout period will be played. The shooter has the choice to have the ball placed a specified distance from the net or, like in hockey, <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> ball from center ice.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of trying to shoot the moon, players attempt to discard high cards, especially high hearts or spades, and try to avoid winning points. This can either be accomplished by creating a void, or playing a high card last in a trick that has no points. Generally speaking, it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick. Players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in suits {{that they do not}} have padding low cards in. For example, if a player had A,5,4,3,2 the A would not be much of an issue; they <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> four lower cards and hopefully exhaust other player's spades before being forced to play the A. In contrast, if they only had A, then they would be forced to play the A the first time spades were led, with the risk that another player will respond with the queen.|$|E

25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team {{to get control of}} the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to the}} puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> puck behind the net.|$|E

500|$|The now three-piece Oasis {{chose to}} {{continue}} recording the album, with Noel Gallagher re-recording most of Arthurs' guitar and McGuigan's bass parts.

Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort. The band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in Andy Bell, former guitarist/songwriter of Ride and Hurricane No.1 as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying that Liam said, [...] "If he <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> guitar, he <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> fookin' bass"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled tour of America in December 1999.|$|E
