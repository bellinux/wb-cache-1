40|$|A brief {{review is}} given {{of the data}} {{obtained}} by the horizon-scanning 5577 -A airglow photometer flown aboard OGO 6. Data are presented which show the contributions to the 5577 -A emission from the F- 1 region and the Chapman airglow layer. Emission rates are calculated for both regions {{on the basis of the}} dissociative-recombination and <b>Chapman</b> <b>reactions,</b> and the atomic oxygen density and downward flux are inferred from the emission rates and several assumptions concerning the temperature dependence of the rate constants. Latitude variations in the emission rates are discussed along with variations in the altitude of the 5577 -A airglow. It is shown that there is a large semiannual variation in the average effective transport properties of the lower thermosphere, that the atomic oxygen profiles near 110 km suggest a maximum in eddy diffusion at about that altitude, and that systematic variations in the altitude of the atomic oxygen maximum probably do not exceed 2 km...|$|E
40|$|SAGE II {{observations}} of ozone at sunrise and sunset (solar zenith angle = 90 deg) at {{approximately the same}} tropical latitude and {{on the same day}} exhibit larger concentrations at sunrise than at sunset between 55 and 65 km. Because of the rapid conversion between atomic oxygen and ozone, the onion-peeling scheme used in SAGE II retrievals, which is based on an assumption of constant ozone, is invalid. A one-dimensional photochemical model is used to simulate the diurnal variation of ozone particularly within the solar zenith angle of 80 deg - 100 deg. This model indicates that the retrieved SAGE II sunrise and sunset ozone values are both overestimated. The <b>Chapman</b> <b>reactions</b> produce an adequate simulation of the ozone sunrise/sunset ratio only below 60 km, while above 60 km this ratio is highly affected by the odd oxygen loss due to odd hydrogen reactions, particularly OH. The SAGE II ozone measurements are in excellent agreement with model results to which an onion peeling procedure is applied. The SAGE II ozone observations provide information on the mesospheric chemistry not only through the ozone profile averages but also from the sunrise/sunset ratio...|$|E

40|$|The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is {{utilised}} {{to study}} the daily ozone cycle and underlying photochemical and dynamical processes. The analysis {{is focused on the}} daily ozone cycle in the middle stratosphere at 5 hPa where satellite-based trend estimates of stratospheric ozone are most biased by diurnal sampling effects and drifting satellite orbits. The simulated ozone cycle shows a minimum after sunrise and a maximum in the late afternoon. Further, a seasonal variation of the daily ozone cycle in the stratosphere was found. Depending on season and latitude, the peak-to-valley difference of the daily ozone cycle varies mostly between 3 – 5 % (0. 4 ppmv) with respect to the midnight ozone volume mixing ratio. The maximal variation of 15 % (0. 8 ppmv) is found at the polar circle in summer. The global pattern of the strength of the daily ozone cycle is mainly governed by the solar zenith angle and the sunshine duration. In addition, we find synoptic scale variations in the strength of the daily ozone cycle. These variations are often anti-correlated to regional temperature anomalies and are due to the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients k 2 and k 3 of the <b>Chapman</b> cycle <b>reactions.</b> Further, the NO x catalytic cycle counteracts to the accumulation of ozone during daytime and leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in NO x and the strength of the daily ozone cycle. Similarly, ozone recombines with atomic oxygen which leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in ozone abundance and the strength of the daily ozone cycle. At higher latitudes, an increase of the westerly (easterly) wind cause a decrease (increase) in the sunshine duration of an air parcel leading to a weaker (stronger) daily ozone cycle...|$|R

The modified <b>Chapman</b> scheme of <b>reactions</b> (8 to 11) assumes that NaO is mostly {{produced in the}} excited state NaO*(A) rather than in ground-state NaO(X) following Shi et al. (1993) and Wright et al. (1993). In the modified scheme of reactions (8 to 11), the first possibility is that the excited NaO*(A) produced can be reduced by atomic oxygen to yield the excited Na atoms, which in turn, de-excites to give the airglow emissions. Secondly, NaO*(A) may be converted to NaO(X) through collisional quenching with M before being reacted with O. In a recent paper, Plane et al. (2012) have used a zenith-sky viewing telescope and a Czerny-Turner spectrograph {{for a series of}} ground-based long-term measurements of RD at several locations and found that RD varies between 1.5 and 2.0, with an average value of 1.67. These results were interpreted using a statistical model of the Na nightglow which involves initial production of electronically excited NaO*(A) from the reaction between Na and O 3, followed either by reaction with O to generate Na(2 P [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{role of the}} Chapman {{chemical}} {{scheme in}} producing the Na airglow at the MLT region has been recognized over the years. Plane (2003) had presented a review on the validity of this scheme. However, {{in the context of}} explaining the observed Na airglow intensity and its variation, there has been widespread debate over the values of α and RD. Clemesha et al. had estimated the value of α to be within 0.05 to 0.2 with a best estimate of 0.1 based on the rocket‒borne photometry and ground-based lidar measurements (Clemesha et al. 1995). Also, Hecht et al. had found the value of α in between 0.02 and 0.04, even though temperature of the mesopause region on that night was very low (165  K) and the Na layer and the airglow emission layers were peaked around 95  km (Hecht et al. 2000). In contrast to these evaluations, considerably smaller value (less than 0.01) of α was found in an early laboratory measurement (Plane and Husain 1986). The reasons for these disagreement in the values of α have been looked at through a series of laboratory experiments, and it has been found that the earlier laboratory estimate of Plane and Husain was smaller, probably because reaction (1) produces most of the NaO in the (A 2 Σ+) excited electronic state rather than in the (X 2 Π) ground state (Shi et al. 1993; Wright et al. 1993), and excited NaO*(A 2 Σ+) (‘*’ denoting excited state) has a longer radiative lifetime and is not quenched effectively by N 2. Hence, reaction (2) should involve mainly the NaO*(A) (Joo et al. 1999). Also, in 2001, through an elegant experiment, Griffin et al. had shown that α for NaO*(A)[*]+[*]O is 0.14 [*]±[*] 0.04 (Griffin et al. 2001). This indicates that the earlier laboratory estimate of α by Plane and Husain was smaller because it involved the reaction between ground-state NaO(X) and O. Hence, the inconsistency in the values of α is not explainable with the original <b>Chapman</b> mechanism of <b>reactions</b> (1 to 2).|$|R
40|$|INTRAUTERINE {{inflammation}} is a {{major cause}} of preterm birth, which, in turn, is associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality (Goldenberg et al. 2000; Schelonka and Waites 2007). However, clinical studies correlate intrauterine inflammation with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and experimental studies indicate that inflammation stimulates surfactant production and improves preterm lung function (Jobe et al. 2000; Moss et al. 2002 a; Moss et al. 2002 b). The underlying mechanisms whereby inflammation induces preterm lung ‘maturation’ are not known but {{it has been suggested that}} these effects may be mediated by activating a fetal stress response, resulting in increased circulating cortisol levels (Watterberg et al. 1997), known to have a critical role in lung maturation (Laatikainen et al. 1988; Ye et al. 2004). This now appears unlikely but it is possible that proinflammatory stimuli may modulate enzymatic regulation of cortisol to influence its tissue availability, or may alter tissue sensitivity to cortisol by altering its receptor levels. Alternatively, the maturational effects within the preterm lung may be mediated by prostaglandins (PGs), fundamental inflammatory mediators with established roles in mediating lung maturation (Bustos et al. 1978; Morsy et al. 2001). Therefore, the general aims of this thesis were two-fold: to investigate how intrauterine inflammation may alter tissue availability of, and sensitivity to, cortisol in the fetal lung; and to examine the role of prostaglandins in the fetal pulmonary response to intrauterine inflammation. Tissue availability of cortisol is modulated by expression of the enzymes 11 β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type- 1 and - 2. 11 β-HSD- 1 converts inactive cortisone to cortisol, increasing local levels and availability of cortisol for glucocorticoid signalling, whereas 11 β-HSD- 2 catalyzes the reverse <b>reaction</b> (<b>Chapman</b> et al. 2006). The effects of intrauterine inflammation on the 11 β-HSD enzymes and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which mediates the majority of glucocorticoid actions (Rupprecht et al. 1993; Schaaf and Cidlowski 2003), had not been investigated in the fetal lung in vivo prior to the studies presented in this thesis. The experiments in Chapter 3 demonstrated that fetal sheep lung GR mRNA levels are not altered in response to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS), indicating that inflammation-induced changes in fetal lung development are not likely to be mediated by increases in tissue sensitivity to cortisol. However, IA LPS induced a time-specific increase in 11 β-HSD- 1 and decrease in 11 β-HSD- 2 mRNA levels in the fetal lung that accompanied increases in surfactant protein mRNA levels and improvements in lung compliance. These data indicate that IA LPS may increase local tissue availability of glucocorticoids, and suggest that locally-produced glucocorticoids may mediate, at least in part, the fetal lung’s response to intra-uterine inflammation. Although inflammation alters 11 β-HSD enzyme expression in the lungs, it appears that inflammation-induced lung maturation occurs via an additional mechanism to glucocorticoid signaling given that the characteristics of the fetal lung response to inflammation are different to those of glucocorticoid-induced lung maturation in preterm lambs (Sweet et al. 2008; Moss et al. 2009). Prostaglandins may represent an alternative mechanism for inflammation-induced lung maturation given that some, such as PGE 2, are known to increase surfactant production by the preterm fetal lung (Acarregui et al. 1990; Morsy et al. 2001). This is supported by the data in Chapter 4, which demonstrate that IA LPS induces increases in amniotic fluid PGE 2 and lung mRNA levels of PGH synthase- 2, PGE synthase, and one of the PGE 2 receptors, EP 4 in response to intrauterine inflammation. Assessment of responses 2 and 7 days after IA LPS administration, enabled us to distinguish when these changes in gene expression occur relative to the changes in lung maturation. Thus, these findings suggest that increased PGE 2 synthesis and activity play a role in mediating inflammation-induced alterations in fetal lung development. In Chapter 5, the aim was to further elucidate the role of prostaglandins in the fetal pulmonary response to intra-uterine inflammation. We used a maternal nimesulide infusion to preferentially inhibit inducible prostaglandin production and to assess the effects on the fetal lung’s response to a proinflammatory stimulus in vivo. Nimesulide inhibited LPS-induced increases in PGE 2 concentrations, reduced fetal lung inflammation and altered mRNA levels of surfactant proteins, EP receptors, and prostaglandin synthetic enzymes in the fetal lung. The data in Chapter 5 show that inducible prostaglandin inhibition modulates the inflammatory response in the fetal lung and alters surfactant protein mRNA levels, thereby providing some of the strongest evidence to date that inducible prostaglandins have a critical role in mediating the fetal lung’s response to intrauterine inflammation. In conclusion, these studies increase our understanding of the likely mediators involved in inflammation-induced fetal lung maturation and support the theory that these changes are not mediated by increases in circulating cortisol. IA LPS may regulate pulmonary expression of 11 β-HSD- 1 and - 2 to increase local availability of cortisol in the fetal lung, although further investigation is required to confirm the precise roles of these enzymes in the fetal lung’s response to inflammation. Defining these roles may be particularly complex since the response in the lungs may not be directly mediated by an increase in tissue availability of cortisol, but by cortisol activation of different pathways, such as that of prostaglandins. Indeed, we showed that prostaglandins have a regulatory role in the development of an inflammatory response to IA LPS and gene expression of the surfactant proteins in vivo. This suggests that inducible prostaglandins are likely to be involved in mediating fetal lung maturation in response to intrauterine inflammation. Understanding the effects and mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in lung development will ultimately enable the development of alternative therapies that prevent the adverse respiratory consequences of preterm birth...|$|R
