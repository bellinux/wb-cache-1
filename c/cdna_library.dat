5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human <b>cDNA</b> <b>library</b> in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E

5000|$|... <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> are {{commonly}} used when reproducing eukaryotic genomes, {{as the amount of}} information is reduced to remove the large numbers of non-coding regions from the <b>library.</b> <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> are used to express eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do not have introns in their DNA and therefore do not possess any enzymes that can cut it out during transcription process. cDNA does not have introns and therefore can be expressed in prokaryotic cells. <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> are most useful in reverse genetics where the additional genomic information is of less use.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> {{are widely}} used to {{identify}} genes and splice variants, and as a physical resource for full-length clones. Conventionally-generated <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> contain {{a high percentage of}} 5 '-truncated clones. Current library construction methods that enrich for full-length mRNA are laborious, and involve several enzymatic steps performed on mRNA, which renders them sensitive to RNA degradation. The SMART technique for full-length enrichment is robust but results in limited cDNA insert size of the library. Results We describe a method to construct SMART full-length enriched <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> with large insert sizes. Sub-libraries were generated from size-fractionated cDNA with an average insert size of up to seven kb. The percentage of full-length clones was calculated for different size ranges from BLAST results of over 12, 000 5 'ESTs. Conclusions The presented technique is suitable to generate full-length enriched <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> with large average insert sizes in a straightforward and robust way. The representation of full-coding clones is high also for large cDNAs (70 %, 4 – 10 kb), when high-quality starting mRNA is used. </p...|$|R
5000|$|... pVI {{has been}} widely used for the display of <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries.</b> The display of <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> via phage display is an {{attractive}} alternative to the yeast-2-hybrid method for the discovery of interacting proteins and peptides due to its high throughput capability. pVI has been used preferentially to pVIII and pIII {{for the expression of}} <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> because one can add the protein of interest to the C-terminus of pVI without greatly affecting pVI's role in phage assembly. This means that the stop codon in the cDNA is no longer an issue. However, phage display of cDNA is always limited by the inability of most prokaryotes in producing post-translational modifications present in eukaryotic cells or by the misfolding of multi-domain proteins.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A <b>cDNA</b> <b>library</b> is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells {{of types of}} cell. This library can be ligated into a construct {{so that it is}} attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of Ty 1 -copia-type and Ty 3 -gypsy-type retrotransposons in the International Triticeae EST Consortium (ITEC) database (61, 942 sequences: 82 % wheat, 10 % barley, 8 % rye) and the DuPont EST database (86, 628 wheat sequences) was estimated using BLASTN searches. These ESTs {{were obtained from}} 94 <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> from different tissues (leaves, roots, spikes, flowers and seeds) and different growing conditions, excluding subtracted and normalized <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries.</b> Triticeae EST databases were screened using four different Ty 1 -copia-type, 12 reverse transcriptase sequences, and three Ty 3 -gypsy-type Triticeae retrotransposon sequences. Using a selection threshold of BLASTN scores higher than 100 or E values smaller than e - 20, 0. 145 % of the ESTs {{were found to be}} significantly similar to {{at least one of the}} retrotransposons used in the search (0. 064 % Ty 1 -copia, 10. 081 % Ty 3 -gypsy). This percentage increased to 0. 176 % when the BLASTN threshold was changed to E < e - 10. The percentage of ESTs similar to retrotransposons was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> from leaf tissues than in <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> from roots, anthers, or spikes. In addition, the percentage of ESTs similar to retrotransposons in <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> from plants under stress conditions (0. 25 % at E < e- 20, and 0. 30 % at E < e - 10) was three to four folds higher (P < 0. 0001) than in <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> from plants grown under normal conditions (0. 07 % at E < e - 20, and 0. 09 % at E < e - 10).

This large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provides an opportunity, unprecedented in plants, to perform ?digital differential screening? on selected <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries.</b> In general, the frequency of a particular EST correlates with transcript accumulation in the tissues from which the <b>cDNA</b> <b>libraries</b> were constructed, so {{it is possible to}} compare the whole transcriptome from different tissues using computer-assisted analysis of an EST database. In our research we analyzed sugarcane ESTs according to tissue expression and identified more than 1, 000 putative flower-specific genes. The fact that using this technique we were able to identify sugarcane homologues of several genes previously described as pollen-specific justifies this method of assessing tissue specificity. In addition, ESTs similar to genes specific to reproductive organs were detected e. g. a sugarcane gene encoding a meiotic protein essential for assembly of the synaptonemal complex and normal synapsis. This approach also allowed the identification of many flower-specific anonymous sequences that are good candidates for being novel genes involved in plant reproduction.
