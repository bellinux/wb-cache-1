40|$|Industry {{multiples}} {{are used}} often in practice, both to provide stand-alone “quick and dirty ” valuations {{as well as}} to anchor more complex discounted cash flow valuations. Under this approach, valuations are generated by multiplying a value driver (such as earnings) by a multiple which is based on the ratio of stock price to that value driver for a group of comparable firms. Choices for value drivers include various measures of revenues, book value, earnings and cash flow, but earnings and cash flows are by far the most commonly used. In this study we compare the valuation performance of earnings multiples versus multiples based on two measures of cash flows—operating cash flows and dividends—for a large sample of firms drawn from ten markets. 1 To clarify, valuation performance here does not refer to picking mispriced stocks.

40|$|AbstractGiven an {{extension}} T {{of the theory}} of commutative rings with 1 admitting elimination of quantifiers, we set up a spectrum functor T-Spec from the category of commutative rings with 1 into the category of topological spaces. T-Spec A consists of equivalence classes of homomorphisms of A into models of T. ‘Closed’ formulae - defined as those equivalent to a positive quantifier-free formulae - are used to define a topology on T-Spec A making it into a spectral space. Additional properties, such as the existence of ‘enough prime models’ and ‘closed projections’ are defined snd discussed. If there are enough prime models, we define affine space in a way familiar to algebraic geometers. Affine space enjoys an Artin-Lang property. Finally, we define sheaves of definable sections and continuous definable sections which turn out to be classical sheaves in the classical examples of the Zariski and real spectra. Notions such as continuous, closed, bounded, and having stalks which are local rings are defined in a purely model- theoretic way, and we are able to prove some rather general continuity results about T-Spec as a functor into the category of locally ringed spaces. We pay considerable attention to a new example - the real valuation spectrum - based upon Cherlin and Dickmann's work on the theory of real <b>closed</b> <b>valuation</b> rings.

40|$|We {{provide a}} general and {{flexible}} approach to LIBOR modeling {{based on the}} class of affine factor processes.

Additionally, and most importantly, our approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR payoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the CIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications, since <b>closed</b> form <b>valuation</b> formulas for caps and swaptions are derived. ...|$|R

Although closed form solutions for the valuation equations implied by the modified square root process are {{the exception rather than the}} rule we are able to show that analytic solutions, in the form of infinite power series expansions, will always exist.

40|$|Stochastic {{instantaneous}} volatility models such as Heston, SABR or SV-LMM {{have mostly}} {{been developed to}} control the shape and joint dynamics of the implied volatility surface. In principle, they are well suited for pricing and hedging vanilla and exotic options, for relative value strategies or for risk management. In practice however, most SV models lack a <b>closed</b> form <b>valuation</b> for European options. This book presents the recently developed Asymptotic Chaos Expansions methodology (ACE) which addresses that issue. Indeed its generic algorithm provides, for any regular SV model, the pure asymptotes at any order for both the static and dynamic maps of the implied volatility surface. Furthermore, ACE is programmable and can complement other approximation methods. Hence it allows a systematic approach to designing, parameterising, calibrating and exploiting SV models, typically for Vega hedging or American Monte-Carlo. Asymptotic Chaos Expansions in Finance illustrates the ACE approach for single underlyings (such as a stock price or FX rate), baskets (indexes, spreads) and term structure models (especially SV-HJM and SV-LMM). It also establishes fundamental links between the Wiener chaos of the instantaneous volatility and the small-time asymptotic structure of the stochastic implied volatility framework. It is addressed primarily to financial mathematics researchers and graduate students, interested in stochastic volatility, asymptotics or market models. Moreover, as it contains many self-contained approximation results, it will be useful to practitioners modelling {{the shape of the}} smile and its evolution...|$|R

With a <b>valuation</b> <b>close</b> to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga has become the biggest web IPO since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social networking companies, and in particular Zynga, brings up the question {{whether or not they are}} overvalued. The common denominator of all these IPOs is that a lot of estimates about their valuation have been circulating, without any specifics given about the methodology or assumptions used to obtain those numbers. To bring more substance to the debate, we propose a two-tiered approach. First, we introduce a new model to forecast the global user base of Zynga, based on the analysis of the individual dynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a logistic growth function, a standard model for growth in competition. This leads to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios (base one, optimistic and very optimistic) : 4. 17 billion USD in the base case, 5. 16 billion in the high growth and 7. 02 billion in the extreme growth scenario respectively. Thus, only the unlikely extreme growth scenario could potentially justify today's 6. 6 billion USD valuation of Zynga. This suggests that Zynga at its IPO has been overpriced. ...|$|R
