5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} and {{did their best}} to {{restrict}} Liverpool's passing game in the opening 45 minutes through tackling and quick counter-attacking with the long ball; with the game's flow interrupted and the two teams cancelling each other out, neither side built any momentum in the first half with few clear-cut chances. The first notable action <b>came</b> <b>for</b> Arsenal when a cross from Michael Thomas on the right which was met by Steve Bould, but Steve Nicol cleared it over the bar for a corner. Liverpool responded with a shot from outside the box from Rush after being teed up by Aldridge. However, soon after Rush was forced to go off with a groin strain and had to be replaced by Peter Beardsley in the 32nd minute. The score was 0–0 at half time.|$|E
5|$|Belton House {{remained}} relatively untouched during this period, largely {{owing to the}} failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived {{for only a few}} months of the year at Belton, where they <b>came</b> <b>for</b> the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the death duties arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time <b>came</b> <b>for</b> the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany <b>came</b> <b>for</b> the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006.

Named as Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, the video contained a live date from the tour, filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987. It was also aired as a television special in Japan only and was the first television broadcast there, using Dolby Surround sound. The release was a commercial success, prompting Warner to release a different version of the tour video, for the rest of the world. Although the Japanese concert was released on VHS and LaserDisc, Warner Music Japan has never officially made it available on DVD.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction that familiarity of words in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> {{the second time in}} a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the first time. One type of vowel in the words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that in the words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in the words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the second time is smaller than that in words that <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R

5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams <b>came</b> <b>for</b> voice recording sessions during {{breaks in the}} shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E

Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija.
