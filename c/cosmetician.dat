40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automatic}} evaluating sys-tem of human skin surface condition based on sub-jective evaluation provided by <b>cosmeticians.</b> In the proposed system, image features extracted on skin image and subjective evaluation by <b>cosmeticians</b> are flexibly connected {{by using a}} back-propagation neural network, {{so that it can}} automatically estimate human skin surface condition on based on subjective evalu-ation from our various skin images. We show some experimental results. Using the trained neural net-work, human skin surface condition based on subjec-tive evaluation is estimated for unlearned skin images. Then subjective evaluation by this system was com-pared with that by <b>cosmeticians.</b> Since the proposed system can successfully estimate human skin surface condition like cometicians, the effect of the system is demonstrated. ...|$|R

FF UK 2011 The author {{searches}} for {{reasons for the}} body hair removal and its modifications. As the base she uses an analyse {{of the media and}} literature and her research among Czech women. The paper emanates, that certain subjects try to define norms of body hair removal. These norms are presented in medical and cosmetical literature, in magazines, internet articles, films, adverts, in the language and in the folklore. Accordingly the normative subjects are doctores, <b>cosmeticians,</b> editors and authors of magazines, participants of internet discussions, film makers and producers of cosmetic products. Nevertheles women participate on the creation of norms too. The author postulates some attitudes, how the hair removal is perceived and presented: as hygienical and medical, as dichotomy of human and animal (nature vs. culture), as dichotomy of feminity and masculinity, as an attribute of maturity, as an esthetic aspect. Most of the women remove hair from their bodies. Young women "shave" more, but the difference between the generations is not that big. Yet a vast difference exists between the age of todays teenagers when they started removing (on an averge of 12 years) and the older generations (at 24 years) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Skin {{diseases}} {{constitute an}} essential health and aesthetic {{problem in the}} elderly. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the knowledge of the elderly residents of public nursing homes and participants of the University of the Third Age in Bialystok, Poland surrounding the factors influencing skin ageing, the awareness of skin conditions in agening skin, and the impact of skin ageing on the volunteers. The study was performed from April to June 2015 in Bialystok, in two groups: among 100 public nursing home residents (PNH) and 100 members of University of the Third Age (U 3 A), (all over 60 years old). The study made use of a diagnostic survey conducted via a questionnaire prepared by the authors. Nearly half of those surveyed (42. 5 %; n = 85) sunbathed in the past, while 28. 0 % (n = 56) of those surveyed now take part in this type of leisure activity. More than half of respondents (53. 0 %; n = 106) protected their skin using special protective preparations. A majority of Bialystok inhabitants surveyed (80. 5 %; n = 161) noticed the features of skin ageing. They reported birthmarks, fungal infections and bedsores as the main skin problems of the old age. Nearly half (40 %) of respondents assessed their knowledge as average and 26. 0 % as poor. The study showed some statistical differences in the knowledge and awareness between the residents of public nursing homes and the students of the University of the Third Age, e. g., the use of the Internet by the U 3 A group for finding out information. There is a desire to receive education in the field of the agening skin conditions/diseases among the elderly because their level of knowledge is relatively poor. Education of seniors in this area can increase their awareness of the basic principles of skin care and prevention marking of skin ageing. The benefits of greater knowledge of seniors about the conditions of agening skin can help reduce the medical burden and reduce the incidence on certain skin diseases. Furthermore, there is a need for educating of the younger population on the factors of skin ageing to prevent certain skin conditions as they become older. Seniors should be professionally educated by qualified specialists; for example, dermatologists or <b>cosmeticians,</b> so that the information they receive is in line with evidence-based medicine...|$|R
