25|$|TeleXitos is {{a digital}} {{multicast}} network that was originally {{launched by the}} network's parent division Telemundo Television Group in January 2012 as Exitos TV. In its original format, the network primarily featured reruns of telenovelas previously aired on Telemundo, and was exclusive to Telemundo's owned-and-operated stations. The network adopted its current name on December 1, 2014, when it was relaunched with a new focus toward Spanish-dubbed reruns of action and adventure series as well as feature films sourced primarily from the <b>content</b> <b>library</b> of corporate sister NBCUniversal Television Distribution, in addition to featuring select programs from other distributors.|$|E
25|$|The Hulu monthly {{subscription}} service called Hulu Plus {{was launched in}} beta (preview) on June 29, 2010 and officially launched on November 17, 2010. Like the free version of Hulu, the content available with a Hulu subscription also contains advertising. However, it offers an expanded <b>content</b> <b>library</b> including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available through the free Hulu. A Hulu subscription also provides a wider array of viewing choices. The free-access to Hulu was only available on PCs and laptops, while a Hulu subscription allows viewers to access Hulu through all Hulu-supported devices including set-top boxes, smart TVs, gaming consoles, mobile devices and more. A {{little more than a}} year after the launch of the Hulu subscription service, the number of paying subscribers reached 1.5 million. In May 2016, Hulu reported it had reached 12 million subscribers.|$|E
25|$|At Rock Band 4 release, {{the game}} {{supported}} three main modes. Quickplay allows {{the players to}} select any song to play that is on disc or in the downloadable <b>content</b> <b>library</b> of songs. Players can also engage in Shows which {{are a series of}} songs broken up into a number of sets. Some songs in these Shows are predetermined, but others are left to be voted on during a short period between songs by the band members; individual members also have the opportunity to select a song from a limited list during periods of the current song when their musical part is inactive. The available options are based on what songs the collective band members have in their library and the band's chosen theme, and voting options may include specific songs (including one selected mid-song), or broad classifications such as by genre type, release year, or song length. To aid in the cooperative nature of the game, any scoring multipliers and remaining Overdrive are carried over between songs in Gig lists as well as between sets in the Career mode.|$|E
40|$|BIM <b>Content</b> <b>Libraries</b> are {{performing}} as online sources for building product models. In order to effectively use the product models, {{it is important}} to organize them systematically within these databases. But currently there is no standard or guideline for this purpose. Products in these libraries are being categorized based on different criteria such as the object classes in the target platform, by referring to multiple classification systems or based on customized categories. This paper studies some of the BIM <b>Content</b> <b>Libraries</b> and investigates the structure that each library is using for product categorization.

500|$|In the game's Quickplay+ mode, {{players can}} play any song on-disc or from their {{downloadable}} <b>content</b> <b>library.</b> Each song has 13 different achievements to be completed. Twelve {{are similar to}} the Challenges introduced in Guitar Hero 5, such as getting a high score, maintain a long note streak, or accumulating an amount of Star Power, and each has 3 levels (gold, platinum, and diamond) that translate to 1 to 3 additional stars once reached. If the player has unlocked the Warrior character powers in the Quest mode, they can enable these powers to try to get up to a maximum of 20 stars (21 for successfully completing the song without missing a note or hitting notes that aren't there) on each song for the thirteenth challenge. [...] As the player earns stars in this mode, they will advance in rank and gain additional unlockable features such as alternate outfits or guitars and additional venue selections. Party mode introduced in Guitar Hero 5 is also available, where the game will automatically play songs like a jukebox, and allow for players to drop-in or drop-out at any time. The competitive modes introduced in Guitar Hero 5 are also carried over into Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and are expanded to include band-vs-band variants.|$|E

2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} brought some new {{technological}} {{changes to the}} publishing industry. These changes include e-books, print on demand, and accessible publishing. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. Google, Amazon.com, and Sony have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's Kindle reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the Apple iPad and the Nook from Barnes & Noble.

2500|$|On July 23, 2009, Logic Pro 9 was announced. A {{major new}} feature {{included}} [...] "Flex Time", Apple's take on [...] "elastic" [...] audio, which allows audio to be quantized. A {{version of the}} pedalboard from GarageBand was included, together with a new virtual guitar amplifier where the modeled components could be combined in different ways. There were also a number of improvements to audio editing, fulfilled user requests such as [...] "bounce in place" [...] and selective track and channel strip import, {{as well as an}} expanded <b>content</b> <b>library</b> including one more Jam Pack. Some of the bundled software, including MainStage 2 and Soundtrack Pro 3, was also improved. Logic Pro 9 is Universal Binary, although not officially supported for use on PowerPC computers. SoundDiver, which had been quietly bundled with previous versions, was dropped, eliminating support for arguably the world's most popular synthesizer editor/librarian. As Apple has bundled so many software instruments with Logic, it is not likely that we'll see the return of integration with external synthesizer hardware to the Logic platform.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{engineering}} design task often consists of combining {{a large number}} of reusable components from design libraries taken from related domains. Although, perhaps, rich in <b>content,</b> today’s <b>libraries</b> are poor in using domain knowledge to help designers access <b>library</b> <b>contents</b> during the course of design. In this paper, we describe a prototype system, ACTIVE CATALOG, that utilizes a rich body of domain knowledge to facilitate the access of <b>library</b> <b>contents.</b> The domain knowledge-base also provides a vocabulary that is at a much higher level of conceptualization than those used by traditional database query or the key-word match technique widely employed by Web applications. Based on the knowledge of the domain and the meaning of the queries specified in this vocabulary, a search engine accesses library components that satisfy the “semantics ” defined by the queries. This is a much deeper match than the usual syntactical key-word match. ACTIVE CATALOG’s facility on accessing <b>library</b> <b>contents</b> goes even further. ACTIVE CATALOG contains, suggested by its name, active information together with a rich set of models of different modalities {{that can be used to}} extend traditional <b>library</b> <b>contents</b> and that enable a designer to down-load models, viewers or even simulation code to evaluate dynamic and behavioral aspects of a component via interactive simulation...|$|R
