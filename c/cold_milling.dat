40|$|During {{the cold}} rolling of thin strip on the 1220 mm five-stand tandem <b>cold</b> <b>mills,</b> scratch marks {{occur on the}} {{surfaces}} of strip and work roll. The surface quality of strip is degraded and the roll wear increases, which resulting in significant economic loss. In this paper, the mechanics of strip scratch marks was studied by carrying out both field experiments and theoretical analysis. Slippage Factor (SF) and Scratch Mark Factor (SMF) were presented to indicate the conditions of strip scratch marks. Meanwhile, mathematical models and simulation code were developed to optimise the rolling schedules and to improve the scratch marks. The practical application of the developed models to the 1220 mm five-stand tandem <b>cold</b> <b>mills</b> verifies {{the effectiveness of the}} developed models.

40|$|The {{highways}} in the Midwest {{are experiencing}} {{a considerable amount}} of truck traffic due to increased freight transportation. There is clearly a risk to the highway infrastructure caused by this additional truck traffic that will also have an increasingly detrimental effect on the safety of the citizens, the traveling public in terms of congestion, and the economy of the entire region. Traditionally the life of the pavements has been extended by a variety of rehabilitation techniques. For example, techniques used by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) include route and crack seal, chip seal, 1 - to 4 -inch overlay, 1 - to 4 -inch inlay, heater scarification, cold in-place recycling (4 -inch), and <b>cold</b> <b>milling.</b> Recently, due to a tight maintenance budget, thin surfacing, like the ultra-thin bonded bituminous surface (NovaChip), and modified slurry seal (microsurfacing), is being used increasingly. The thin-surfacing strategy has been touted {{as one of the most}} cost-effective measures that can extend pavement life, improve ride quality, correct surface defects (leveling), improve safety characteristics, enhance appearance, and reduce road-tire noise.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} three common hot mix asphalt rehabilitation strategies on 149 pavements {{over a period of}} seven years. All three strategies place two-inch overlays on the pavement to be rehabilitated. The first strategy includes an overlay on the existing pavement after sweeping the surface and applying a tack coat. The second strategy places the overlay after removing two inches of the existing pavement by <b>cold</b> <b>milling.</b> The third strategy places the overlay after treating the existing pavement using the heater scarification process. Performance was evaluated with respect to PG binder temperature range, traffic volume, overlay nominal maximum aggregate size, and climate. Data analyzed in the study was obtained from a pavement management system that is updated annually with respect to pavement condition. Results of this analysis indicate that two of the rehabilitation strategies perform approximately equal with one performing slightly better than the other, and both performing significantly better than the third. Polymer modified asphalts enhanced pavement performance depending on which rehabilitation strategy was utilized. Pavements were generally rehabilitated before reaching the zero service life threshold. However, when fatigue cracking was present in the original pavements, this was not the case. These pavements were rehabilitated when the zero remaining service life threshold had been reached or when pavement condition exceeded this threshold. This indicates rehabilitation would have been warranted earlier in the life of these pavements. As a result, the expected life of the rehabilitation strategies utilized on these pavements may be shorter than could be expected had rehabilitation been done before distress reached this high level...|$|E

In this technology, working roll curve adapt the combination of cosine curve and high order curve, backup roll adapt the combination of cosine curve, straight line and high order curve. The cosine subentry of working roll and the high order curve subentry are used to control edge wave, the high order curve subentry of working roll is used to control the roll contact, the cosine subentry of backup roll is used to reduce the center wave.
