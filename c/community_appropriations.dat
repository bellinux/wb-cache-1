40|$|Organizing vision {{theory is}} an {{institutional}} {{alternative to the}} economic-rationality view of IT innovation diffusion. Institutional theorists have called for more attention to cognitive processes and structures {{in order to understand}} institutional mechanisms. Our objective was to unpack the cognitive structure of an organizing vision to understand its role in the diffusion of IT innovations. We focus on the know-why component of organizing visions and on social media as an IT innovation. In a two-stage study, Stage I leveraged schema theory, the “orders of worth ” framework’s six justificatory principles, and relational class analysis to discover the hierarchical structure of the social media organizing vision. This resulted in a view of the organizing vision as comprised of four schemas, which we conceptualized as visions-in-use, and ten nested business use cases, each comprised of different combinations of the six principles. Based on this understanding, Stage II explored how <b>community</b> <b>appropriations</b> of visions-in-use and business use cases from the repertoire provided by an organizing vision shape four facets of an organizing vision—coherence, continuity, clarity, and diversity—and how these facets influence diffusion of the IT innovation. We found that the two vision facets we surfaced— clarity and diversity—are essential to understanding diffusion and how and why coherence and continuity matter to diffusion. Much as the “vision ” of a musical jam session emerges from players ’ multivocal performances, an organizing vision emerges from community members ’ multivocal discourse about an I...|$|E

Tolley and Hall-Arber (2015) studied the Fish Locally Collaborative (FLC) of New England that promotes diversity with small-scale fisheries as an alternative economy.

Analysing the qualitative statements that are relevant to the aspect of “community centricity” (Fig.  3, Table  1), it may be said that while these subaltern peddlers from Bihar are socially embedded and have a reasonable voice in their peddling organization, the ownership is vested with the controller of the peddling organization. The owner of the peddling organization is more akin to the head of a family rather than like the owner of a corporation. The owner takes care of his “children” and makes sure that the workers do not suffer owing to occasional drop in revenues. It follows that the alternative economy in which the subalterns work is characterized by social embeddedness, and moderate levels of community lead, and community control. Community ownership and <b>community</b> <b>appropriation</b> are not manifested owing to ownership by a benevolent patriarch.|$|R

We will discuss how the community museum combines and integrates complex processes aimed at strengthening the community as a collective subject, asserting its identity, improving its quality of life and building alliances between communities. In the second part, which has a methodological focus, we will discuss how the museum is born out of community aspirations to strengthen its identity and integrity, the initial process of consensus-building, the roles of different agents, both internal and external to the community, as well as some factors that foster or prevent <b>community</b> <b>appropriation.</b> To conclude we will emphasize the potential of community museum networks as a strategy to generate a broader field of action, in which communities can exercise greater autonomy, by collectively developing and appropriating projects of regional and even international scope. ...|$|R

40|$|Information and {{knowledge}} management {{in line with}} a traditional epistemology equates knowledge with science. This approach assumes that knowing is trans-historical and universal, and strives to arrive at unassailable justifications for truth claims by defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for which a proposition {{is known to be}} true. Imagining an idealised knower, without emotions or history, the goal is absolute abstraction and universal solutions. Traditional epistemologists operate under the assumption that certainty is only achieved by stripping away all but the bare reasoning required to make inferences; thus rendering the social, historical and economic context of the knower irrelevant. The perspective of this idealised knower is a ‘view from nowhere’ (Nagel, 1986). In this paper we analyse and critique this view in the light of its applicability to the situation and needs of urban dwellers. The findings of our analysis allow us to call for a broadening of knowledge discourse beyond science and technology. We argue for the development of an epistemological model which takes into account and values transitory, informal, soft, implicit, contextual and tacit forms of knowledge, and its sources and utility outside the hard sciences. This model requires policy changes towards a democratisation of knowledge production and exchange and an acknowledgement of the significance of supporting education and urban community networking as mechanisms which enable knowledge sharing and participation in knowledge societies. Our proposed epistemological model supports a ‘view from everywhere’. We hope it can uncover policy as well as technical opportunities and help inform ways and approaches to enable the social and <b>community</b> <b>appropriation</b> of information and communication technology for local knowledge production and exchange...|$|R

40|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of Johannesburg areas, the Newtown Electric Power Station Heritage Precinct does not fully realise its potential for spatial relations facilitating creative means of living. Creativity is a powerful tool to engage present and future possibilities. A Centre to stimulate creativity will benefit the direct area users, as well as contribute to the prominence of the historical and cultural richness of Newtown. The vacant site adjacent to the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre provides an apt location for the Creativity Centre as the intervening programme will activate, strengthen and define the presently underutilised street corner edges. The proposed architectural spaces aim to direct the site’s current movement routes created by pedestrian commuters, in order for creativity to become more ingrained in daily life. The proposed architectural elements aim to facilitate creative activities - both curatorial and organically inspired through <b>community</b> <b>appropriation</b> of specifically designed open, or adaptable, spaces. The Centre aims to become a creative community gathering hub: becoming integral to the existing creative individuals currently pursuing artistic practices in Newtown. Gesamtkunstwerk theoretically guides the project: in terms of the architectural intervention being comprised of singular elements all contributing to a greater whole. Gesamtkunstwerk also programmatically unites the entire Electric Power Station city block, through promoting the unification of art forms with life, as a holistic, creative entity. The Centre acts as a crucial beacon highlighting the importance of creativity in the contemporary South African situation where it is undervalued and underutilised. It also articulates that as a directorial element of societal authorisations and processes, architectural design should articulate the value of creativity through facilitating and inspiring creative modes of living.

40|$|Ecomuseums are {{innovative}} {{institutions in}} which new museological systems {{are used to}} conserve and interpret the tangible and intangible heritage of a defined geographical area and its corresponding community. Ecomuseums have {{a strong interest in}} public participation, in terms of both creation and subsequent development. Such institutions aim to establish an enduring dialogue between staff and community members and to influence positively the social and economic development of the locality. This research focuses on two ecomuseums in rural communities in Mexico. I analyse the impact of both museums on their communities in terms of social improvement within statutes of sustainability. I look at their value in enabling environmental and cultural conservation; and I examine the various communication processes linking outside “experts” and community members. The two museums tell markedly contrasting stories and show different processes of creation and <b>community</b> <b>appropriation.</b> The museum of San Juan Raya, located in a desert community in central Mexico, is a success story where an outside initiative was transformed into a beneficial community project largely run by local people. On the other hand the museum of Frontera Corozal, in the tropical jungle of southern Mexico, developed in a complex and fraught historic-political background, shows a much more problematic identity and no management continuity. My research draws the conclusion that, assuming appropriate communication processes are established, ecomuseums have the ability to help to empower rural communities, to promote social change, and to implement successful techniques of conservation and management of natural resources. Although these two museums are of interest in themselves, this research considers and finds meaning in their different trajectories. The results of this evaluation are relevant to other worldwide communities setting up equivalent institutions, and may facilitate the understanding and development of community museums.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use and effects of domicide: the {{deliberate}} and permanent separation of occupants from their home which causes suffering (Porteous and Smith 2001 : 12). Specifically it charts domicidal acts as a long-running feature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel’s varied use of domicide, both historic and contemporary, reveals underlying biopolitical, expansionist, disciplinary and memoricidal aims. These dovetail into one goal: maintaining the ‘Jewish State’. However as with any effort to ‘produce space’ domicide generates contestations over spatial meaning. How these struggles, and domicide’s unanticipated effects, manifest within forms of cultural production and social practice occupies the subsequent focus of this thesis. The significance house-keys have acquired within Palestinian inter-familial and communal customs, as well as within cultural (re) production, provides insight into the suffering of domicide victims. Attachment to the house-key is viewed as emblematic of that felt towards the lost home – even a continuation of that connection by other means. A series of analyses explores the re-configuration of the key’s symbolic value as it permeates different arenas of cultural production and activity, embodying both loss and resistance toward the goals of domicide. Attention shifts to Beit Arabiya, Anata, a post-domicide landscape serving as venue for the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions’ (ICAHD) 2013 rebuilding camp. An ethnographic study critically examines the <b>community’s</b> <b>appropriation</b> of this site {{in their efforts to}} re-frame meaning into a direct challenge to domicide’s aims. It is proposed that by revealing the inherent struggle(s) over spatial meaning caused by domicide, deterministic understandings of spatial production are demonstrably flawed. Nevertheless, while unable to effectively silence alternative narratives, domicide still inflicts profound suffering – evidenced by this wide-ranging analysis of its practice.

40|$|This project {{traces the}} {{seemingly}} improbable intersections between performances of blackness {{and the development}} and traces of an American liberalism defined by Gunnar Myrdal's overwhelmingly influential, sociological text, An American Dilemma. I argue that when Myrdal determined in his 1944 study on the "Negro problem" that the messy inconsistencies between how the United States articulated its laudable egalitarianism and the violent histories of oppression defining the lives of African Americans was a matter resting in the "hearts and minds of white America" rather than entrenched structural inequalities, he enabled a radicalized version of sentimentality that would structure how liberalism attempted to rectify this racial paradox right into the 21 st century - to walk in someone else's skin rather than their shoes. While American liberalism is a notoriously contested and slippery set of ideologies, the texts I study provide a performative logic of American liberalism that deconstructs and historicizes its own ideological impulses around notions of racial difference. The project situates the discursive legacies of Myrdal's study alongside a series of spectacularized narratives of what I call "racial im/posture" - adventures in racial impersonation authorized by American liberalism and reliant on the logics of both blackface minstrelsy and racial passing. I consider these narratives of racial im/posture in the literary genres of memoir, autobiography, fiction, and speculative fiction, along with the legal brief, the film, and the photograph. Although I read these seemingly disparate texts from my own epistemological disciplining of literary studies, the methodology employed here is an interdisciplinary one indebted to performance and visual studies, race and queer theory, {{as well as new}} Southern studies. The project intervenes in the conventional thinking around racial masquerade by reframing the temporality of what has largely been considered an issue of the 19 th and early 20 th centuries as well as by considering these texts through the anxieties, ironies, and contentions of the discursive legacies of American liberalism. In five chapters that satellite around the ideological apparatuses of our sociopolitical and cultural landscape including social and literary fictions, the law, and transnational capital, I think through issues of authenticity, belonging, <b>community,</b> <b>appropriation,</b> and performance.

The {{intensive}} resource extraction over the last ten years, together with the societal challenges occurring at a global scale, and the progress of the sustainability agenda, are changing the way mining impacts on local communities. Understanding the social implications of mining operations at the local community level appears to be a challenging research exercise that resembles a complex puzzle. The study presented in this thesis seeks to explore the complexities and drivers generating social impacts of mining at a local community level and how this relates to community’s long-term development. The concept of social sustainability is the primarily focus used to examine and interpret the consequences from contemporary mining operations. Studying the rural community of Boddington in south-west Australia, the research links the concepts of social impacts and social sustainability. It reflects on the qualitative changes occurring in the social landscape and analyses the role of mining for long-term community development by examining its contribution against the social implications it evokes. The findings of this inquiry demonstrate the complex nature of the social impacts caused by mining operations. It identifies three new phenomena impacting the social sustainability prospects of the <b>community,</b> namely the <b>appropriation</b> of human resources, transiency and dependency culture. The case study unveils the inextricable links between the drivers that generate impacts and brings forward the importance of analysing and exploring the dynamic interactions between the various social indicators in order to understand how mining affects local communities...|$|R

It challenges several of the interpretations which other scholars have made about the history and impact of the New Left and social movements in the United States since 1960. This study applies social network analysis to politics to explain the successes and failures these social movements had in the city in winning the reforms that they sought for their communities. As the activists grew in their political sophistication, so their political networks matured. Pittsburgh activists did not ignore the means of power that social movement scholars traditionally study, power at the polls and in the streets. But in addition to such tools, activists built a base of trust, respect, and mutual support between themselves and local politicians. By gathering and disseminating information about the problems afflicting their communities, African-Americans in the 1960 s and feminists and gays in the 1970 s won converts to their cause among the city's political elite. Leaders within the three movements leveraged their growing rapport with political leaders to win appointments to government commissions for <b>community</b> members and <b>appropriations</b> for programs aiding their communities. These positions brought activists further contacts and alliances with leaders at other levels of government.

40|$|Square Viger was {{designed}} as an opulent and lush Victorian park in the mid- nineteenth century {{for the use of}} nearby wealthy residents. The park had trees lining promenades, benches, fountains, and a glass greenhouse. Over time, the influx of industry brought more working class citizens to the Ville-Marie borough and pushed the bourgeoisie to other areas in the early twentieth century. Historians of Montreal’s built environment mark this change in demographic as the decline of the park. Since then the park has undergone drastic redevelopment due to changes in transportation infrastructure. Sculptor Charles Daudelin (1920 - 2001) redesigned the site and built the Agora in 1983, but his designs were met with animosity from the media and the public the site was intended for. Using archival research, interviews with artists, and site analysis, this thesis investigates the Agora’s appropriation by homeless groups and individuals and the artistic interventions the site has also incurred. Square Viger is a telling example of Montreal’s push for modernization but is also an indication of the large-scale redevelopment projects that have taken place on the island. In March 2012, Square Viger has been defined as a threatened emblematic site by Heritage Montreal and its redevelopment looms in the very near future.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} methods used by one group of women to {{increase}} the social spaces available to Edmonton lesbians. Ultimately, this paper analyzes the contributions of social space to community identity. In this case, Edmonton's longest running lesbian organization "Womonspace" serves as a unique testament {{to the importance of}} social methods for strengthening a sense of community identity. In 1981, the founders of "Womonspace" set out to provide lesbians with a safe place in which to socialize and to foster a positive lesbian identity. The impetus for a growing lesbian organization came in part from a shared sense of oppression from both straight feminist groups and sexist gay male organizations. The mandate of the group stressed safeguarding the privacy of its members. Womonspace organizers believed that overt political involvement discouraged closeted lesbians from joining the group. Thus, organizers did not adopt a political agenda. Not every member agreed with this policy. However, the goal of building a community and increasing social networks for lesbians called for a reasonable alternative to the more public face of activism. Ultimately, the efforts of Womonspace strengthened the visibility of Edmonton's once scattered and indiscernible lesbian population. Dances provided the central social event followed by a number of other leisure activities. Word of mouth, along with a monthly newsletter, kept lesbians abreast of social happenings in and around Edmonton. Before long, the organization attracted women from both the city and from nearby rural areas. Thus, Womonspace expanded and transformed the cultural development of lesbian networks. This study of the phenomenon of building a lesbian community argues that historians neglect the significance of social space upon gay and lesbian organizing. Much historical attentiveness towards the more outstanding issues and outcomes of political reform, activism, and the struggle for gay rights, exceeds the issue of building a viable, visible gay/lesbian <b>community</b> through the <b>appropriation</b> of social space. In addition, historical inquiry into gay history tends to examines gay community history from the male perspective. In Canada, lesbian history lags far behind gay male history. The work of such predominant and influential Canadian historians as Gary Kinsman and Steven Maynard has substantially increased understanding of the politics of same-sex gender relations particularly gay male history. A thorough historical inquiry of lesbian culture in Canada is lacking, even more so in terms of Western Canada. By investigating Alberta's largest and most successful autonomous lesbian organization, this thesis will encourage other scholars to do similar studies...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{research}} to understand change processes and knowledge management in health service organisations, and indeed public sector organisations in general. This research seeks to explain how knowledge becomes formulated and thereby mobile, and also how practice has come to be established, visibilised and thereby sustained in a specific context. Exploring practice within a health service organisation, and in particular a public health service organisation, is a particular feature of this research. The research demonstrates how collaboration becomes necessitated under pressure of enacting increasingly complex work activities, an outcome being changing practices and extended accountability relationships which enacts discipline while realising expertise. Using an ethnographic approach, the research explores how the practice of early childhood nursing in the South Western Sydney Area Health Service became a specialised expert undertaking. The research examines how change has occurred, whereby early childhood nursing was refined from being one part of the generalist community nursing practice to being a specialised practice through the increasing technologisation of practice. The technologisation of practice refers to the artefacts, conduct and the processes through which the conceptualisation and enactment of early childhood nursing has become increasingly standardised. Through the technologisation of practice explicit knowledge becomes distributed within the artefacts for practice and tacit knowing becomes distributed across, and is continually enacted by, the collaboration of the practice community. There are four interrelated aspects to the technologisation of practice. Firstly, the technologisation of practice involves standardising the conceptualisation and enactment of practice through constructing a multi-dimensional practice resource within a community of practice. Secondly, the technologisation of practice involves the mobilisation and refinement of the multi-dimensional practice resource to realise a practice network involving extended relationships of accountability. These relationships of accountability are within a profession and also with other professionals. Thirdly, the technologisation of practice involves the ongoing enactment of accountability in a collaborative community of practice. The research shows that a team can become a collaborative community by constructing an accountability context, reorganising and facilitating the team, and then amalgamating the organising and service delivery activities through integrating formal meetings and informal interactions. Fourthly, the technologisation of practice involves the collaborative <b>community</b> assemblage and/or <b>appropriation</b> of further technologies into practice thereby strengthening the local and extended relationships of accountability and expanding the boundaries of practice. The research describes how the technologisation of practice is the enactment of a number of mutually enabling practice dualities, which together simultaneously discipline and realise expertise. The interrelated practice dualities are individual-community, subjective-objective, local-global, formal-informal and governmentality-communal self-governance. The situatedness of practice is shown to necessitate a subjectivity-objectivity duality, whereby individual and communal experience is drawn upon to see through the otherwise opaque nature of statistics and information. The alignment of practice with the broader organisation and professional colleagues realises a local-global duality, whereby the community's local understandings are informed and shaped by distant issues. The formal-informal duality is a mechanism by which practice is increasingly collaboratively conceptualised and enacted, and thereby standardised. Individual and communal 'expertise' becomes realised through the assemblage and appropriation of organising and transforming tools and artefacts, or alternatively technologies. At the same time, the community in defining the use of such technologies as competent practice is disciplining their own conduct. Through this action a governmentality-communal self-governance duality is realised as the nursing community pursues expertise while disciplining themselves; by engaging in collaborative interactions and using standardised technologies the community constructs and makes visible their knowing, practice and expertise...|$|R

Para tal, é importante pensar o ensino de ciências a partir da perspectiva da alfabetização científica, favorecendo o uso de situações investigativas e resoluções de problemas nos quais os alunos sejam iniciados nas práticas científicas escolares, se apropriando de práticas próprias da Ciência, tais como a linguagem e a construção coletiva do conhecimento. Neste contexto, acreditamos que a resolução de problemas em sequências didáticas investigativas de ecologia favorece a aprendizagem de conceitos e de etapas de como a ciência é construída, como o levantamento de hipóteses. Assim, {{dado que}} o levantamento de hipóteses é uma ação importante nas aulas de ciências, acreditamos que a averiguação desse momento da aula pode apontar indicadores de aulas investigativas. Assim, a questão de pesquisa deste trabalho é: C̈omo as hipóteses escolares em sequências didáticas investigativas podem ser caracterizadas nas aulas de ciências? P̈ara identificar as hipóteses utilizamos o padrão de raciocínio hipotético dedutivo e propomos características para hipóteses escolares considerando a sua função, estrutura, qualidade e conteúdo. Defendemos que a construção de hipóteses utilizando o raciocínio hipotético dedutivo nas aulas de ciências é importante para uma comunicação estruturada que usa a maneira lógica nos moldes do raciocínio cientifico, e que favorece ao aluno desenvolver habilidades próprias da comunidade científica como a apropriação da linguagem. As hipóteses escolares podem ser consideradas em dez características. Considerar as características da hipótese escolar é ir além do simples preenchimento dos elementos de raciocínio hipotético dedutivo, é avaliar a qualidade da hipótese que o aluno levanta. Isso ajuda no planejamento e execução de ações que auxiliem no aprendizado dos alunos pois indica quais as relações de ideias os alunos estão fazendo durante a resolução dos problemas e pode ser um indicador do eixo funcional da alfabetização científica. This work adopts {{conception}} {{of which the}} sciences teaching must give conditions so that the pupil can learn sciences, learn on sciences and learn to do sciences. For such, the sciences teaching is important to think {{from the perspective of}} the scientific literacy, favoring the use of situations investigative and resolutions of problems into which the pupils are initiated in school scientific practices, appropriating of practices own to the Science, such as the language and the collective construction of the knowledge. In this context, we believe that the problems resolution in didactics sequences of ecology favors the apprenticeship of concepts and of steps of as the science is built, like the lifting hypothesis. Thus, since the hypothesis survey is an important action in the science classes, we believe that the investigation of this moment of the class can indicate indicators of investigative classes. Thus, the research question of this work is: Ḧow can school hypotheses in investigative didactic sequences be characterized in science classes?T̈o identify the hypotheses we use the hypothetical deductive reasoning pattern and propose characteristics for school hypotheses considering their function, structure, quality and content. We argue that the construction of hypotheses using deductive hypothetical reasoning in science classes is important for a structured communication that uses the logical way in the scientific reasoning, and that favors the student to develop skills proper to the scientific <b>community</b> as the <b>appropriation</b> of language. The school hypotheses can be considered in ten characteristics. Consider the characteristics of the school hypothesis is to go beyond simply filling in the elements of hypothetical deductive reasoning, it is to evaluate the quality of the hypothesis that the student raises. This helps in the planning and execution of actions that aid in student learning because it indicates what ideas relationships students are doing during problem solving and can be an indicator of the functional axis of scientific literacy...|$|R
