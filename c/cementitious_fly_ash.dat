40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of corrosion on the bond characteristics between the reinforcing steel and the surrounding concrete. The results indicate that as the corrosion level increased, the tension stiffening of the concrete decreased and also the bond between the reinforcing steel and the concrete diminished considerably. Further, the comparison was made between the normal portland cement (NPC) concrete with a water-cement ratio (w/c) of 0. 32, NPC concrete a with w/c ratio of 0. 52 and NPC concrete with high volume (58 % by total weight of <b>cementitious</b> materials) <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> content, in terms of bond characteristics and corrosion resistance.

40|$|Herein, the {{flexural}} behaviour of high strength <b>cementitious</b> composites containing <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (FA) and manufactured sand is investigated. Long hooked-end steel fibres {{have been added}} to the mix design and compressive strength and flexural strength tests have been performed at the age of 7, 28 and 56 days and 14, 28 and 56 days respectively. The results of this engineered cementitious material have then been compared to plain concrete and also a reference <b>cementitious</b> composite containing <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> (FA). The flexural test is conducted under a 4 point bend test following fibre reinforced concrete relevant standards. Results indicate that adding the long hooked-end steel fibre to the cementitious mix demonstrates strain hardening and multiple cracking phenomenons. This characteristic categorizes the mix as high flexural strength cementitious composite demonstrating acceptable post peak behaviour. Concrete’s ability to withstand compressive stresses is significantly higher than its ability to hold tensile strength, thus the addition of steel bars into concrete are used to reinforce the concrete in its tensile zone.

Blending of cement with supplementary <b>cementitious</b> materials like <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> rice husk ash, and silica fume makes concrete more durable. The main objective {{of this study is to}} make use of the rice husk ash and lime powder (LP) as a replacement of Portland pozzolana cement considering various replacement levels. The engineering and durability performance in concrete with LP were performed through compressive strength and void measurement.

The modified Andreasen 2 ̆ 6 amp; Andersen particle packing model is utilized to achieve a densely compacted <b>cementitious</b> matrix. <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and limestone powder (LP) are used to replace cement, and their effects on the properties of the designed UHPC are analyzed. The results show that the influence of FA, GGBS or LP on the early hydration kinetics of the UHPC is very similar during the initial five days, while the hydration rate of the blends with GGBS is mostly accelerated afterwards. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the mixture with GGBS are superior, compared to that with FA or LP at both 28 and 91 days. Due to the very low water amount and relatively large superplasticizer dosage in UHPC, the pozzolanic reaction of FA is significantly retarded. Additionally, the calculations of the embedded CO 2 emission demonstrate that the cement and mineral admixtures are efficiently used in the developed UHPC, which reduce its environmental impact compared to other UHPCs found in the literature...|$|R

The coarseness of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> particle decreases the activity number and plasticity index of black cotton soils. Volume change behavior of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> stabilized clays studied by Phanikumar and Sharma [24] revealed effective results of swell potential and consolidation. Stabilization of expansive soils with <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> resulted in decrease of swell potential, swelling pressure, plasticity index, activity, free swell and axial shrinkage percent {{with an increase in}} <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> content [30]. Several field investigations revealed properties of dumped waste stabilization using <b>cementitious</b> materials and <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Laboratory tests such as California bearing ratio (CBR) and direct shear test performed on dumped waste with addition of varying percentages of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> revealed that with addition of 20 % <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> the shear strength parameters of dumped waste have increased considerably. Bottom ash has been used as light fill material in soft ground, due to its lower bulk density and excellent drainage capacity [26]. Many researchers have conducted experimental studies to determine the suitability of bottom ash to be used in backfilling material in highway embankment [4]. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the suitability of bottom ash as filler material in the asphalt pavement. These studies indicate that, replacement of bottom ash in asphalt mixture improve the structural stability, skid resistance and resilient modulus [3]. Past studies show that, municipal solid waste incinerator ash can be utilized in geotechnical applications such as embankments, landfills and aggregate in road construction [6].|$|R
40|$|Recycling part {{or all of}} the {{pavement}} materials in an existing road during reconstruction is an attractive construction alternative. When reconstructing roads surfaced with hot mix asphalt (HMA), the HMA, underlying base, and a portion of the existing subgrade often are pulverized to form a new base material referred to as recycled pavement material (RPM). Compacted RPM is overlain with a new HMA layer to create a reconstructed or rehabilitated pavement. This process {{is often referred to as}} full-depth reclamation. Similarly, when an unpaved road with a gravel surface is upgraded to a paved road, the existing road surface gravel (RSG) is blended and compacted to form a new base layer that is overlain with an HMA surface. Recycling pavement and road materials in this manner is both cost effective and environmentally friendly. However, recycled base materials may contain asphalt binder, fines, and/or other deleterious materials that can adversely affect strength and stiffness. To address this issue, chemical stabilizing agents can be blended with RPM or RSG. Use of industrial material resources for stabilization (e. g., <b>cementitious</b> coal <b>fly</b> <b>ash)</b> is particularly attractive in the context of sustainability. The purpose of this study was to develop a practical method to design local roadways using stabilized RPM or SRSG as the base layer and Class C <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> as the stabilizing agent.

Compressive strength, chloride permeability, water sorptivity, and water absorption properties of concretes were obtained in this study for different testing ages up to 90 days. The influences of <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> metakaolin, and testing age on the properties of concretes have been identified using the analysis of variance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of <b>cementitious</b> high carbon <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (CHCFA) stabilized recycled asphalt pavement as a base course material in a real world setting. Three test road cells were built at MnROAD facility in Minnesota. These cells have the same asphalt surface layers, subbases, and subgrades, but three different base courses: conventional crushed aggregates, untreated recycled pavement materials (RPM), and CHCFA stabilized RPM materials. During and after the construction of the three cells, laboratory and field tests were carried out to characterize the material properties. The test results were used in the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG) to predict the pavement performance. Based on the performance prediction, the life cycle analyses of cost, energy consumption, and greenhouse gasses were performed. The leaching impacts of these three types of base materials were compared. The laboratory and field tests showed that <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> stabilized RPM had higher modulus than crushed aggregate and RPM did. Based on the MEPDG performance prediction, the service life of the Cell 79 containing <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> stabilized RPM, is 23. 5 years, which is about twice the service life (11 years) of the Cell 77 with RPM base, and about three times the service life (7. 5 years) of the Cell 78 with crushed aggregate base. The life cycle analysis indicated that the usage of the <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> stabilized RPM as the base of the flexible pavement can significantly reduce the life cycle cost, the energy consumption, the greenhouse gases emission.

2500|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> can {{significantly}} improve the workability of concrete. Recently, techniques {{have been developed}} to replace partial cement with high-volume <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (50% cement replacement). For roller-compacted concrete (RCC), replacement values of 70% have been achieved with processed <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> at the Ghatghar dam project in Maharashtra, India.

This paper briefly presents the compressive strength development of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> aggregate concrete at different ages. The split tensile strength and flexural strength of all the concrete mixes were also investigated at different days of curing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} blended steel slag-superfine <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> mineral {{admixture}} and ordinary <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> on {{the properties of}} concrete were compared in this study. The results show that, {{in the case of}} the same adding amount, blended steel slag-superfine <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> mineral admixture and ordinary <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> have similar effects on the early strength and chloride ion permeability of concrete. Blended mineral admixture has higher ability to improve the late strength of concrete than ordinary <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Paste and concrete containing blended mineral admixture have smaller porosities than that containing ordinary <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Blended steel slag-superfine <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> is an ideal mineral admixture for concrete...|$|R

Treatment of the <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> {{can reduce the}} leach rate of metals, {{and allow it to}} be disposed in less prescribed landfill. A geopolymer matrix was investigated as a potential stabilisation method for brown coal <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Precipitator <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> was obtained from electrostatic precipitators and leached <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> was collected from ash disposal ponds, and leaching tests were conducted on both types of geopolymer stabilised <b>fly</b> <b>ashes.</b> The ratio of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> to geopolymer was varied {{to determine the effects of}} different compositions on leaching rates. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{treated with}} self-cementing <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} Iowa to stabilize fine-grained pavement subgrades, but without a complete understanding of the short- and long-term behavior. To develop a broader understanding of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> engineering properties, mixtures of five different soil types, ranging from ML to CH, and several different <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> sources (including hydrated and conditioned <b>fly</b> <b>ashes)</b> were evaluated. Results show that soil compaction characteristics, compressive strength, wet/dry durability, freeze/thaw durability, hydration characteristics, rate of strength gain, and plasticity characteristics are all affected {{by the addition of}} <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Specifically, Iowa selfcementing <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> are effective at stabilizing fine-grained Iowa soils for earthwork and paving operations; <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> increases compacted dry density and reduces the optimum moisture content; strength gain in soil-fly ash mixtures depends on cure time and temperature, compaction energy, and compaction delay; sulfur contents can form expansive minerals in soil–fly ash mixtures, which severely reduces the long-term strength and durability; <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> increases the California bearing ratio of fine-grained soil–fly ash effectively dries wet soils and provides an initial rapid strength gain; <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> decreases swell potential of expansive soils; soil-fly ash mixtures cured below freezing temperatures and then soaked in water are highly susceptible to slaking and strength loss; soil stabilized with <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> exhibits increased freeze-thaw durability; soil strength can be increased with the addition of hydrated <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> and conditioned <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> but at higher rates and not as effectively as self-cementing <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Based on the results of this study, three proposed specifications were developed for the use of self-cementing <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> hydrated <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> and conditioned <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> The specifications describe laboratory evaluation, field placement, moisture conditioning, compaction, quality control testing procedures, and basis of payment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> on the consistency, compactness, acidic properties, and strength of organic soil. The presence of organic content in the soil has detrimental impacts on the physical and strength behavior of soil. To investigate the effectiveness of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> in the stabilization of organic soil, two types of <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> (Type I and Type II) at different percentages were used. It is found that <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> significantly reduces the plasticity index of the organic soil, whereas the liquid and plastic limits increase. The dry density of the fly ash-soil mixture increases significantly, while the water requirement reduces due to the addition of <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> The increase of dry density compromises higher strength. The increase of qu with the increase of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> content is mainly due to the pozzolanic reaction of <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> although the reduction in water content results from the addition of dry <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> solid. Moreover, Type I <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> contributes a higher value of qu compared to Type II <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> This is attributed to the characteristics of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> including CaO and CaO/SiO 2 ratio...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> can {{significantly}} improve the workability of concrete. Recently, techniques {{have been developed}} to replace partial cement with high-volume <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (50% cement replacement). For roller-compacted concrete (RCC)in dam construction, replacement values of 70% have been achieved with processed <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> at the Ghatghar dam project in Maharashtra, India. Due to the spherical shape of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> particles, it can increase workability of cement while reducing water demand. Proponents of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> claim that replacing Portland cement with <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> reduces the greenhouse gas [...] "footprint" [...] of concrete, as the production of one ton of Portland cement generates approximately one ton of CO2, compared to no CO2 generated with <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> New <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> production, i.e., the burning of coal, produces approximately 20 to 30 tons of CO2 per ton of <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Since the worldwide production of Portland cement is expected to reach nearly 2 billion tons by 2010, replacement of any large portion of this cement by <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> could significantly reduce carbon emissions associated with construction, as long as the comparison takes the production of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> as a given.|$|R
