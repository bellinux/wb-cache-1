25|$|THC and <b>cannabidiol</b> {{are also}} neuroprotective antioxidants. Research in rats has {{indicated}} that THC prevented hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well as or better than other antioxidants in a chemical (Fenton reaction) system and neuronal cultures. <b>Cannabidiol</b> was significantly more protective than either vitamin E or vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Early Discovery: Roger Adams {{isolated}} and identified <b>cannabidiol</b> from Cannabis sativa, showed {{its relationship to}} cannabinol, and tetrahydrocannabinol.|$|E
25|$|THC, {{similarly}} to <b>cannabidiol,</b> albeit less potently, {{is a positive}} allosteric modulator of the μ- and δ-opioid receptors.|$|E

25|$|Female {{cannabis}} plants contain {{at least}} 113 cannabinoids, including <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD), {{thought to be}} the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis; and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis.|$|E
25|$|The Therapeutic Hemp Medical Access Act of 2015 (Senate 1333) was {{introduced}} (not passed yet) with 11 co-sponsors {{to amend the}} Controlled Substances Act to exclude <b>cannabidiol</b> and cannabidiol-rich plants from the definition of marijuana. It was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.|$|E
25|$|It ignores ongoing {{scientific}} {{testing on}} alternative treatments... It {{asks us to}} trust but not to verify. It asks us to legalize the limited use of <b>cannabidiol</b> oil, contrary to federal law. And it asks us to look past the potential for misuse and abuse with criminal intent.|$|E
25|$|The federal Schedule 1 drug {{classification}} blocks broad {{scientific research}} on cannabis. However, in late 2015, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) eased some regulatory requirements {{imposed by the}} Controlled Substances Act (CSA) {{for those who are}} conducting FDA-approved clinical trials on <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD). These modifications will streamline the research process regarding CBD’s possible medicinal value and help foster ongoing scientific studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 26 {{varieties}} of hemp with {{low levels of}} tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are certified by the European Union (EU). They have, unlike other types, a very high fiber content of 30-40%. In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2% THC and they are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana. The most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD) with a proportion of 1 to 5%.|$|E
25|$|The recent anecdotal {{reports of}} {{positive}} effects of the marijuana derivative <b>cannabidiol</b> for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, {{we must remember that}} these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.|$|E
25|$|Although {{cannabis}} as a {{drug and}} industrial hemp both derive from the species Cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), they are distinct strains with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD), which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects. The legality of industrial hemp varies widely between countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content.|$|E
25|$|According to some studies, {{the more}} often {{cannabis}} is used {{the more likely}} a person {{is to develop a}} psychotic illness, with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by some, it remains controversial, with pre-existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, CBD may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{effects may}} include a general {{alteration}} of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased {{appreciation of the}} arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. <b>Cannabidiol</b> (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including anxiety, that some consumers experience.|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 2017, the FDA sent warning {{letters to}} four CBD marketers, {{including}} Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, LLC (d/b/a CW Botanicals, d/b/a CW Hemp), {{the producer of}} Charlotte's Web. They were warned [...] "against making medical claims about <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD). The agency also took issue with the businesses marketing CBD products as dietary supplements".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, MMI and CannaVEST, an {{exchange-traded}} fund, each {{invested in}} a company called Kannalife Sciences Inc. [...] Kannalife had been founded in 2010 by Dean Petkanas, former CFO of Stratton Oakmont, the penny-stock trading company depicted in The Wolf of Wall Street, and Thoma Kikis. Kannalife was founded to commercialize inventions made at the NIH concerning methods to use <b>cannabidiol</b> as a neuroprotectant. [...] As of 2016, Kannalife was working on novel analogs of CBD that are more drug-like than CBD.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte's Web was {{developed}} in 2011 by the Stanley brothers (Joel, Jesse, Jon, Jordan, Jared and Josh) through crossbreeding a strain of marijuana with industrial hemp. This process created a variety with less tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD) than typical varieties of marijuana. The variety shows potential for medical usage, especially {{for those who do}} not wish to experience the typical high of recreational marijuana use. As it is so low in THC, the variety was originally called [...] "Hippie's Disappointment", and also has been labeled [...] "boring". It is a less profitable plant with [...] "close to no value to traditional marijuana consumers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the main}} psychoactive {{constituent}} of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), {{the plant is}} known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these [...] "minor" [...] cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is <b>cannabidiol</b> (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system. Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain CBD, CBN, or other cannabinoids, {{which is one reason}} why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.|$|E
2500|$|THC is metabolized {{mainly to}} 11-OH-THC by the body. This {{metabolite}} is still psychoactive and is further oxidized to 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). In humans and animals, more than 100 metabolites could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the dominating metabolites. Metabolism occurs {{mainly in the}} liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. More than 55% of THC is excreted in the feces and ~20% in the urine. The main metabolite in urine is the ester of glucuronic acid and THC-COOH and free THC-COOH. In the feces, mainly 11-OH-THC was detected.-Tetrahydrocannabinol, <b>Cannabidiol</b> and Cannabinol | journal = Cannabinoids | volume = 168 | issue = 168 | pages = 657–90 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16596792 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-26573-2_23 | isbn = 3-540-22565-X | series = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology }} ...|$|E
2500|$|Physicians have {{expressed}} both positive interest {{and worry about}} the sudden explosion {{of interest in the}} legalization of medical marijuana and its research, admitting legalization is both [...] "a scientist's dream or a doctor's nightmare." [...] They fear that some parents are too open to trying anything before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are [...] "alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false..." [...] and [...] "...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents." [...] There is also danger that [...] "the [...] movement also opens the way for bad medicine...through treatments at best giving hope to the hysterical and at worst delivering damaging side effects." [...] According to Alan Shackelford, Charlotte Figi's physician: [...] "We really don't know how it works... The <b>cannabidiol</b> seems to act as a neuro-stabilizer, but how? The research is minuscule on this." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{cannabinoid}} receptor antagonist, also {{known simply as}} a cannabinoid antagonist or as an anticannabinoid, {{is a type of}} cannabinoidergic drug that binds to {{cannabinoid receptor}}s (CBR) and prevents their activation by endocannabinoids. They include antagonists, inverse agonists, and antibodies of CBRs. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system {{led to the development of}} CB1 receptor antagonists. The first CBR antagonist, rimonabant, was described in 1994. Rimonabant blocks the CB1 receptor selectively and has been shown to decrease food intake and regulate body-weight gain. The prevalence of obesity worldwide is increasing dramatically and has a great impact on public health. The lack of efficient and well-tolerated drugs to cure obesity has led to an increased interest [...] in research and development of CBR antagonists. <b>Cannabidiol</b> (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, is a non-competitive CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist. And Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, modulate the effects of THC via direct blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, thus behaving like first-generation CB1 receptor inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. CBD is a very low-affinity CB1 ligand, that can nevertheless affect CB1 receptor activity in vivo in an indirect manner, while THCV is a high-affinity CB1 receptor ligand and potent antagonist in vitro and yet only occasionally produces effects in vivo resulting from CB1 receptor antagonism. THCV has also high affinity for CB2 receptors and signals as a partial agonist, differing from both CBD and rimonabant.|$|E
