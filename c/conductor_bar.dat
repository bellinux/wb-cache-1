40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} is proposed, {{concerning}} {{the temperature rise}} estimation at stationary electrical contacts, operating in the power supply network, during short-circuit. The method consists {{in the formation of}} a mathematical model, which simulates the operation of the contact/conductors system under heavy fault currents. The model comprises analytical mathematical expressions that enable temperature estimations lengthwise the aforementioned system. From the analysis results, it can be concluded that the <b>conductor</b> (<b>bar)</b> cross-section is of primary importance as far as overheating is concerned. It is convincingly shown that the equipment deterioration can be delayed by lowering the maximum contact temperature during, short-circuit transient phenomena. An approximate equation is also proposed as an extra calculating test for the contact and bar overheating under short-circuit conditions. The proposed model could be a criterion for the selection of conductors and switchgear components. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

This paper presents a rotor design of a LSsynRM to improve starting performance of a prototype, which is fabricated as a device of household appliances. The design variables are the number {{and the size of the}} <b>conductor</b> <b>bars</b> in the rotor. The motor characteristics are analyzed by finite element analysis (FEA).

5000|$|In {{industrial}} applications, <b>conductor</b> <b>bars</b> {{are often}} pre-assembled with insulators in grounded enclosures. This assembly, known as bus duct or busway, {{can be used}} for connections to large switchgear or for bringing the main power feed into a building. A form of bus duct known as [...] "plug-in bus" [...] is used to distribute power down the length of a building; it is constructed to allow tap-off switches or motor controllers to be installed at designated places along the bus. The big advantage of this scheme is the ability to remove or add a branch circuit without removing voltage from the whole duct.|$|R
50|$|The stator of an {{induction}} motor consists of poles carrying supply current to induce {{a magnetic field}} that penetrates the rotor. To optimize {{the distribution of the}} magnetic field, windings are distributed in slots around the stator, with the magnetic field having the same number of north and south poles. Induction motors are most commonly run on single-phase or three-phase power, but two-phase motors exist; in theory, {{induction motor}}s can have any number of phases. Many single-phase motors having two windings can be viewed as two-phase motors, since a capacitor is used to generate a second power phase 90° from the single-phase supply and feeds it to the second motor winding. Single-phase motors require some mechanism to produce a rotating field on startup. Cage induction motor rotor's <b>conductor</b> <b>bars</b> are typically skewed to avoid magnetic locking.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{advantages}} of substituting die-cast copper for aluminum in the motor rotor. This advance in motor technology has been long sought by the motor industry but short die life due to the high melting point of copper frustrated attempts to manufacture by pressure die casting. The nickel-base alloy hot die technology developed to solve the manufacturing problem is briefly reviewed. Development work done prior to the present program and commercial motors derived from that work {{have focused on the}} increased electrical energy efficiency achievable by using copper with its higher electrical conductivity in the rotor. Performance characteristics of example industrial motors are presented. Modification of the <b>conductor</b> <b>bar</b> shape to control in-rush current and starting torque to accommodate copper in the rotor will be discussed. Modeling by motor manufacturers has shown that by using copper in the rotor, a lighter motor than an aluminum rotor motor at the same efficiency can be built. An example of weight savings calculated for a 15 Hp (11 kW) motor is presented. Data presented here show that motors with copper rotors run cooler. Industry experience shows that cooler operation translates to reduced maintenance costs, improved reliability and longer motor life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{fast growing}} amount of {{renewable}} energy from wind or solar plants with their inherent production fluctuations re-quires conventional backup and storage capacity {{in order to keep}} grids stable. Hence, hydropower plants in Switzerland are in-creasingly selling peak energy in a liberalized European electrici-ty market. This development leads to higher start/stop-cycle frequencies of their hydrogenerators and some older machines are also subjected to more starts per year than they were origi-nally designed for. In consequence the high voltage insulation system in the stator <b>conductor</b> <b>bars</b> is stressed by a higher num-ber of thermal cycles which might shorten machine lifetimes sig-nificantly. In this paper a new test for assessing the impact of thermal cycling in modern mica/epoxy insulation systems is pre-sented. The new method isolates insulation aging exclusively caused by thermal cycling by the use of cycles with short heating intervals and a maximum temperature close to the glass transition point of the insulation system’s binder (epoxy) resin. The insulation aging condition is monitored with non-destructive measurements of the Dissipation Factor and Par-tial Discharges during, and a destructive voltage endurance test after completion of the thermal cycling. A first implementation of the new test method with 1. 500 cycles resulted in no severely greater deterioration of the cycled group compared to an un-cycled group but shows the necessity of further investigation...|$|R

40|$|A {{parameter}} {{of interest}} influencing {{the performance of}} electrical contacts is the contact temperature during operation, dependent on the heat generation and dissipation rates around the system of sliding contact/conductors. A theoretical investigation is attempted and an experimental survey is displayed concerning the overheating of sliding contacts. The experimental results present satisfactory consistency {{with the results of}} the suggested mathematical relations. It is convincingly shown that the heat generated at the contacts is dissipated to the surrounding area basically by the <b>conductors</b> or <b>bars,</b> and that fact is determinant as far as the contact temperature is concerned. This could aid selections of conductors and industrial components (circuit breakers, fuse carriers, isolators, etc.) in LV or MV electrical panels, and installations where requirements of high reliability exist. © IEE, 1996...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{deal with the}} finite-element (FE) {{modeling}} of eddy-current effects in form-wound windings of electrical machines using a previously proposed general frequency- and time-domain homogenization method. By way of demonstration and val- idation, a real-life 1250 -kW induction machine with double-layer stator winding is considered. The skin and proximity effects in one stator <b>conductor</b> (copper <b>bar)</b> are first quantified {{by means of a}} simple low-cost FE model, leading to complex and frequency-dependent coefficients for the homogenized winding (reluctivity for proximity effect and conductivity or resistance for skin effect). These com- plex coefficients are subsequently translated into real-valued and constant coefficients that allow for time-domain homogenization when introducing a limited number of additional degrees of freedom in the FE model. All results obtained with the homogenized model (con- sidering one conductor or a complete slot) agree well with those produced by a brute-force approach (modeling and finely discretizing each conductor). status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|In this illustration, a solid copper <b>bar</b> <b>conductor</b> on a {{rotating}} armature is just passing under {{the tip of}} the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.|$|R
40|$|Structure of a Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) has double salient {{poles and}} does not include {{permanent}} magnet, <b>conductor</b> and <b>bar.</b> Therefore, this geometrical structure {{is intended to be}} used as an advantage for the screw pump proposal; magnetic rotor has been designed partially, inspired from the structure of radial and axial flux SRM. Proposed SRM has 6 / 4 poles and 3 phase configuration. Screw rotor, which is made of non-magnetic material, has been installed between magnetic rotor and the rotor structure of the screw pump has been obtained. In stator, there are 4 coils of 2000 turns installed in flux path for each phase. The screw rotor isn't included in the magnetic coupling. Here the pump rotor itself is an actuator of direct drive application. This system has been called as SP-SRM. Electrical and magnetic quantities like inductance, torque, power, magnetic flux of the SPSRM have been calculated analytically and predicted by finite elements method (Ansoft Maxwell 3 D); it doesn't cover mechanics and dynamics of the proposed system. In the direct drive actuator application where the rotor itself is considered as an actuator, the SP-SRM looks like an attractive choice with its superiority of eliminating the used of a driver motor, couplings and gear boxes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the skin and}} proximity effects in different conductive nonmagnetic straight conductors’ configurations subjected to applied alternating currents and voltages. These effects have important consequences, including a rise of the ac resistance, which in turn increases power loss, thus limiting the rating for the conductor. The alternating current (ac) resistance is important in power <b>conductors</b> and bus <b>bars</b> for line frequency applications {{as well as in}} smaller conductors for high frequency applications. Despite the importance of this topic, it is usually not analyzed in detail in undergraduate and even in graduate studies. For this purpose, this paper compares the results provided by available exact formulas for simple geometries with those obtained by means of two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental results. The paper also shows that FEM results are very accurate and more general than those provided by the formulas, since FEM models can be applied {{in a wide range of}} electrical frequencies and configurationsPostprint (published version...|$|R
50|$|The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is {{an example}} of the iron vane type, used for {{measuring}} large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non-sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the clamping assembly to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the hinged end of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large <b>conductors</b> and bus <b>bars</b> up to 4+1/2 in wide. As the illustration shows, the scale is very non-linear and unsuitable for measuring low currents, with currents of less than half the full-scale deflection crammed into a short section of the dial.|$|R
40|$|In {{power systems}} {{currents}} that usually flow through flat copper or aluminium <b>conductors</b> called bus <b>bars.</b> Therefore, {{there is a}} practical demand for bus bars to be employed in current measurement applications. The present investigation, taking into account this practical demand, has as its objective {{the development of a}} cheap and automatic current monitoring system applicable to electrical bus bars. The requirement to develop a low cost system {{is the first step in}} order to obtain a possible future industrial production of this system and it affected the choice of the hardware tools used in this project. The bus bars taken into consideration in this project are employed in an electrical LV distribution panel intended for use in the industrial sector. The panel is employed for the supply of four different 3 -phase circuits that provide energy to distinct groups of electrical loads. This automatic system of monitoring has the purpose of measuring the current flowing through every bar with the future goal to check, at any time, electrical information of the electrical system, such as the load curve that denotes every circuit. The application developed in this investigation assumes that the magnetic field around a bus bar, at a certain distance, is proportional to the applied current at all times. Thus, it is possible to find out the electrical information of a bus bar by measuring and analysing the emanated magnetic field. In order to analyse the Magnetic field, it has been taken into consideration, principally for the cost-effectiveness, the implementation of a number of Magnetoresistive sensors installed into the panel and supported by an Arduino® board, specially programmed for the case in study. The main develop of the project was realized using a 3 D model of the distribution panel, designed with the support of the Solidworks® software and subsequently implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software for FEM analysis. The use of the FEM simulation software has been fundamental in order to find out the correct position and configuration of the sensors. The main goal obtained with the FEM simulations it was the elimination of the influence of stray MFs in the sensors measures through the setting of an anti-differential configuration of the sensors. At the end of the work it has been reached an advanced level of the project, with the correct functioning of the simulating measurement system and the implementation of an Arduino® algorithm to control the board supported the sensors. The correct functioning of the simulating system was figure out with a graphical study of the measured currents trends, developed in a Matlab® environment. Universidad de Sevilla.
