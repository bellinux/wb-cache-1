With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves.

Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.|$|E

5000|$|By 1400, the Aztec empire {{took over}} a sizable part of Mesoamerica. They {{were not able to}} grow cacao themselves, but were forced to import it. All of the areas that were conquered by the Aztecs that grew cacao beans were ordered to pay them as a tax, or as the Aztecs called it, a [...] "tribute". The <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> became a form of currency. The Spanish conquistadors left records {{of the value of the}} <b>cacao</b> <b>bean,</b> noting for {{instance}} that 100 beans could purchase a canoe filled with fresh water or a turkey hen. The Aztecs associated cacao with the god Quetzacoatl, whom they believed had been condemned by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans. Unlike the Maya of Yucatán, the Aztecs drank chocolate cold. It was consumed for a variety of purposes, as an aphrodisiac or as a treat for men after banquets, and it was also included in the rations of Aztec soldiers.|$|E

50|$|A typical 20 kg dog will {{normally}} experience great intestinal distress {{after eating}} less than 240 g of dark chocolate, {{but will not}} necessarily experience bradycardia or tachycardia unless it eats {{at least a half}} a kilogram (1.1 lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, approximately 1.3 grams of baker's chocolate per kilogram of a dog's body weight (0.02 oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical 25 g baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a 20 kg dog. Of course, baking chocolate is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure. Given access, dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings. There are reports that mulch made from <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.|$|E
