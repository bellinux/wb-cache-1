40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40) The {{influence of}} lateral visibility from the vehicle <b>cabin</b> on <b>safety</b> was evaluated {{by examining the}} differences in lane-change crashes of four-door and two-door body styles of the same vehicle models. These two vehicle styles were used because B-pillars on four-door models are farther forward, and thus nearer the fore-aft position of the driver. (Furthermore, the B-pillars on two-door models can be narrower, and some two-door models have no B-pillars at all.) To control for driver differences between these two body styles, going-straight-ahead crashes were used for comparison. The analysis used 2000 - 2003 North Carolina crash data, and considered the crash experience of four-door and two-door body styles for the same 10 vehicles for model years 1995 and newer. The main finding is that four-door body styles {{are more likely to}} be involved in lanechange crashes than are two-door body styles of the same vehicle models.

40|$|Helicopter {{occupant}} {{crash safety}} investigations are {{being carried out}} in the frame of a European consortium project 'HeliSafe', which aims to improve the survivability of occupants in helicopter crashes and to minimise the risk of injuries. This is achieved by an advanced <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> system concept based on interacting safety features such as enhanced safety seats, improved belt systems and deployment of airbags. A key feature of HeliSafe described in this paper is the application of numerical simulation tools to predict cabin and occupant response to crash loads, in order to design and optimise the layout of the safety system. A safety analysis and simulation software concept covering the interaction of relevant cockpit or <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> equipment with structural crash response is described. Full scale sled tests on a generic cockpit mock-up with safety seat and airbag are simulated under both horizontal and vertical crash conditions to validate he simulation methodology.

40|$|The fire {{simulation}} curve {{this paper}} presents {{is based on a}} curve which is proposed by Barnett in 2002. The curve is used to study the temperature change in a fire scenario in the interior of a rectangular compartment. However, it is not applicable to use in some long, limited spaces with arc boundaries, such as aircraft cabins. Some improvements and simplifications are made to the curve to solve this problem. A numerical simulation is conducted via the modified curve in a B 737 fuselage during a postcrash fire. The result is compared with a fire dynamics simulator (FDS) simulation and a full-scale test undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The practicability and accuracy of the modified curve is proved through the relevant analysis and the main relative error analysis. The time to flashover is also predicted by the curve and the FDS simulation, respectively. Several parameters are chosen as influence factors to study their effect on the time to flashover in order to delay the occurrence of the flashover. This study may provide a technical support for the <b>cabin</b> fire <b>safety</b> design, safety management, and fire safety engineering...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSafety is {{compulsory}} in today’s production lines. Those lines {{often use}} laser material processing applications. The highest {{risk for the}} operator or a bystander of a laser application is the exposure to the direct beam. With the present laser beam intensities, an accident at least causes sudden blindness or severe burns. Even if the process works correctly, which means the beam is always oriented towards the workpiece, the scattered and reflected parts of the laser beam still can be powerful enough to cause serious harm. The state-of-the-art safety measures are passive laser <b>safety</b> <b>cabins</b> around the application. Because of the high intensities and the low beam divergence of the highly brilliant laser beam sources, they cannot guarantee a safe use of these laser applications. An option is to use active laser safety barriers that react to an impinging laser beam on its surface. A new approach to guarantee laser safety is to monitor the system and watch for incidents, {{to ensure that the}} laser spot never reaches the safety barrier. Assuming that accidents with the direct laser beam cannot occur, the passive safety measures still have to withstand the reflected laser radiation. In this paper a theoretical model is presented with which the energy distribution in a hemisphere above a deep-welding-process can be calculated. The model was calibrated and validated with intensity measurements during a welding process. The results of the measurement can be used to develop a process-tailored <b>safety</b> <b>cabin.</b> Because of the increased mobility such a system increases the flexibility of the production cell. Furthermore, the costs for laser-safety may be decreased significantly...|$|R
