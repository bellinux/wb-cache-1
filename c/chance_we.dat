5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their <b>chance.</b> <b>We</b> {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than {{we know what}} to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a <b>chance.</b> <b>We</b> don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat wintered in Florida {{but did not}} race until March 17, 1973 in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, {{where he}} went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer {{of one of his}} opponents put it, [...] "The only <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> have is if he falls down." [...] Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had {{committed}} a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually {{on the receiving end of}} a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.|$|E

500|$|Supplies {{were now}} running low. Hurley and Macklin were {{sent back to}} Ocean Camp to recover food {{that had been left}} there to lighten the {{sledging}} teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton’s orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but [...] to its east. [...] "It might have been six hundred for all the <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice", Shackleton recorded.|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of [...] "Flux", Bloc Party's style became even more diverse with the {{inclusion}} of electronic music. [...] "Mercury" [...] saw Bloc Party distance themselves even further from the traditional guitar band set-up by experimenting with dark electronic sounds and a brass section inspired by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band's third album Intimacy also features synths, processed drum beats and loops, vocal manipulation, and choral arrangements. Even though the album was influenced by electronic music, the band still had not lost their feel for guitar music. For example, in an interview, Okereke said that the band was starting to miss their more traditional sound, and confirmed {{that may have been}} the way fourth album was headed. However, Tong contradicted this, stating: [...] "There's every <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> might go back to more orthodox arrangements or things that resemble a traditional band but I don't think we'll ever write songs like we did on Silent Alarm again." [...] A 2009 Vice Records mix lists the following songs Bloc Party are influenced by: Eagle Boston's [...] "Wild Wild Ost", Pylon's [...] "Working Is No Problem", Delta 5's [...] "Mind Your Own Business", John Foxx's [...] "Underpass", Prince's [...] "I Would Die 4 U" [...] (also covered live), Sonic Youth's [...] "Youth Against Fascism", Dinosaur Jr.'s [...] "Freak Scene", La Roux's [...] "Quicksand (Nightrunners Edit)", and Bruce Springsteen's [...] "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)".|$|E

2500|$|That year he {{also had}} a chance to mentor a young future Hall-of-Famer, the 24-year-old Ralph Kiner. Said Greenberg, [...] "Ralph had a natural home run swing. All he needed was {{somebody}} to teach him the value of hard work and self-discipline. Early in the morning on off-days, every <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> got, we worked on hitting." [...] Kiner would go on to hit 51 home runs that year to lead the National League.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his bid for}} {{a second}} term, Carney faced Republican Tom Kovach, the President of New Castle County, and two minor candidates. In a debate with Kovach, Carney stated, [...] "I will {{continue}} to do in Washington what I did in Delaware: work across the aisle to get things done. I learned early on that compromise is part of life." [...] Speaking on the Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare), Carney stated that it [...] "is not perfect" [...] but that it is the [...] "only <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> have to get costs under control." [...] Carney was re-elected in a landslide, with 64% of the vote to Kovach's 33%.|$|E

At the time, the company {{was not ready to}} provide sales figures for the Android-based Priv handset which had been released only weeks earlier, and in only four countries at that time, but Chen offered this comment to analysts: [...] "Depending on how Priv does [...] [...] [...] there is a <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> could achieve or get closer to break-even operating profitability for our overall device business in the (fourth) quarter".|$|E

2500|$|The American bombing {{campaign}} was geared towards attrition, wearing down {{the will of}} the Communist North to fight. As one historian notes [...] "Knowing that the Vietnamese could replace their losses indefinitely, and were doing so, the American war planners counted on the psychological wear and tear of modern air-power upon a land-bound adversary. [...] McNamara pictured enemy soldiers under combined assault in the South, utterly devoid of flying machines for mobility or retaliation in the sky.. 'They only thing that will prevent it [...] Mr. President, is their morale breaking...' he said...

2500|$|The Charge of the Heavy Brigade {{had lasted}} {{no more than}} 10 minutes. Ryzhov's cavalry {{suffered}} 40–50 killed and over 200 wounded; the British lost 10 killed and 98 wounded. Scarlett's attack had been a remarkable success, yet {{it could have been}} a greater victory. When the Heavies attacked, the Earl of Cardigan's Light Brigade was less than 500 yards (~450 m) from Ryzhov's cavalry. The spectators on the Sapouné Heights, and the officers and men in the Light Brigade watching the Russians retreat in disorder, expected Cardigan to lead a pursuit and finish them off. Captain William Morris of the 17th Lancers urged his commander on, but Cardigan claimed he could not advance given the orders he had received from Lucan to remain in his position 'and to defend it against any attack'. Lucan later gave a different version from Cardigan's. He confirmed he had ordered Cardigan to defend his position, but maintained that his parting orders made it quite clear that he had permission to take advantage of so obvious an opportunity. Whatever the differences the Light Brigade had done nothing but look on. When Morris rode back to his regiment after confronting Cardigan, he could not hide his frustration – [...] "My God, my God, what a <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> are losing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a <b>chance,</b> <b>we</b> can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal."

And if by <b>chance</b> <b>we</b> are not able to obtain her we will give to him as wife Isabelle our younger sister within the next fifteen days following the foresaid date. Moreover we will marry Margaret and Isabelle the sisters of the King of the Scots himself, within one year from the feast of Saint Dionysius in the year from the Incarnation of Our Lord 1220, within our kingdom to the honour of ourself and the King of Scotland himself, evenso if we do not marry them within the foresaid time, we will return them to the said King of the Scots safe and free into his kingdom within the month following the said date.
