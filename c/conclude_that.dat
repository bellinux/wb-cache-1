5|$|The {{observation}} {{that all these}} Apis species engage in polyandry has led researchers to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> worker policing is plesiomorphic for the Apis genus.|$|E
5|$|For {{two centuries}} after George II's death, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper and boorishness. Since then, most {{scholars}} have reassessed his legacy and <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> he held and exercised influence {{in foreign policy}} and military appointments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commission}} <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the South Ossetian separatists {{could not}} validly invite Russia {{to support them}} militarily. It also <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Russian military activities against the Georgian military forces were not justified as collective self-defence under international law." [...] The commission also <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Russian military actions also could not be justified as a humanitarian intervention.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the early}} medieval Kharijites <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> any Muslim who sinned {{ceased to be a}} Muslim, while others <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> only major sin could cause that.|$|R

5|$|In 1997 Briggs and Nedin {{reported}} from South Australia a new specimen of Myoscolex {{that was much}} better preserved than previous specimens, leading them to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> it was a close relative of Opabinia—although this interpretation was later questioned by Dzik, who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the conduct}} by the United Kingdom and Singapore {{that led to}} the ICJ to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> Singapore had gained {{sovereignty}} over Pedra Branca applied to Middle Rocks.

5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
50|$|Where Parsons and Habermas <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{culturally}} accredited rules legitimized value-rational ends, Dewey <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} often contaminated instrumental valuations—flawed stereotypes—that should be eliminated rather than treated as moral affirmations of rational behavior.|$|R
25|$|Dodson and Farlow {{studied the}} anatomy of the ceratopsid forelimb and <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> it was {{inconsistent}} with a fully erect stance despite the tendency of artists to draw them that way. Instead they <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> ceratopsids stood with the front limbs in a semi-erect posture. They also <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Lockley and Hunt had overextended themselves by trying to infer limb posture from the Ceratopsipes footprints, which they felt was impossible.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the advertisement was a joke.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} a religious bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E
50|$|Another {{review in}} 2012 <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{metformin}} improves pregnancy rates {{in women with}} PCOS when compared with placebo, {{and in addition to}} clomiphene compared with clomiphene alone, but not when compared directly with clomiphene. Also, however, it <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> metformin does not improve live birth rates, whether used alone or in combination with clomiphene. It therefore <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the benefit of metformin in the improvement of reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS is limited.|$|R

5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the other particle had these properties already determined.

5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 {{study by}} Victoria Arbour, Philip Currie, and Demchig Badamgarav <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani is {{probably}} a junior synonym of Tarchia kielanae; a redescription of the cranial anatomy of Tarchia in 2016, however, <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Minotaurasaurus was a distinct taxon.|$|R

5|$|In 1986, Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlüter {{commissioned}} a radiological {{examination of the}} surviving workers. The Danish Institute for Clinical Epidemiology concluded 11 months later that cancer incidents were 40percent higher in Project Crested Ice workers than in workers who had visited the base {{before and after the}} operation. The Institute of Cancer Epidemiology found a 50percent higher cancer rate in the workers than in the general population, but could not <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> radiation exposure was to blame.|$|E
5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under current law, that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} {{similarities}} that lead theorists to <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during {{the migration of}} the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago. Based on the etymology, two routes have been proposed as the route for the kulintang to Mindanao: One from Sunda, through Banjermasin, Brunei and the Sulu Archipelago, a route where the word “kulintangan” is commonly used for the horizontal row of gongs; The other from Sunda, thru, Timor, Sulawesi, Moluccas and Mindanao where the word kolintang/kulintang is commonly seen.|$|E
50|$|It is {{predicted}} that a fear appeal will initiate a dominant response of either fear control or danger control processes. The extended parallel process model <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> that cognitions (attitudes, intentions, and behavior changes) result in fear appeal success via the danger control process. It also <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> fear appeals fail when the fear emotion is reduced via the fear control process.|$|R
25|$|Paul and Christiansen studied ceratopsid forelimbs and <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> in {{life the}} animal {{probably}} stood with its elbows slightly everted but with its forelimbs otherwise erect.
