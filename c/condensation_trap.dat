50|$|One type {{of solar}} {{desalination}} unit is a solar still, {{it is also}} similar to a <b>condensation</b> <b>trap.</b> A solar still is a simple way of distilling water, using {{the heat of the}} Sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.|$|E

40|$|Export of South African {{avocados}} to European markets necessitates {{cold storage}} during a sea voyage lasting {{three to four}} weeks. Internal physiological disorders such as grey pulp, pulp spot and vascular browning as well as pitting and blackening of the rind (cold damage) are associated with cold storage. Moisture loss as a possible cause of cold damage was investigated. Moisture was rapidly extracted from late season 'Fuerte' fruits by placing them in sealed jars connected to a vacuum pump and a refrigerated <b>condensation</b> <b>trap.</b> A vacuum was applied and three different levels of moisture were removed, namely 2 %, 4 % and 6 % by mass, where after the fruit was stored at 5. 5 °C for four weeks. Fruit from all three treatments developed cold damage symptoms, the severity of which increased with increasing levels of moisture loss. In some fruit, a 6 % moisture loss produced brown pits around the lenticels before fruit were placed in cold storage. The severity of the symptoms on these fruits increased once they were placed in cold storage. When the fruit was eating ripe, no internal physiological disorders were observed but anthracnose infection was high. These results suggest that cold damage {{occurs as a result}} of moisture loss during or prior to cold storage...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{analysis}} of the radio emission from the planetary nebula A 30, Dgani, Evans & White (1998) claim that the emission, located in the inner region, is probably dominated by nonthermal emission. We propose a model to explain this. We assume that the fast wind, blown by the central star of A 30 carries a very weak magnetic field. The interaction of this wind with a cluster of dense <b>condensations</b> <b>traps</b> the magnetic field lines {{for a long time}} and stretches them, leading to a strong magnetic field. If relativistic particles are formed as the fast wind is shocked, then the enhanced magnetic field will result in nonthermal radio emission. The typical nonthermal radio flux at 1 GHz can be up to several milli-Jansky. In order to detect the nonthermal emission, the emitting region should be spatially resolved from the main optical nebula. We list other planetary nebulae which may possess nonthermal radio emission.

40|$|We give a {{quantitative}} {{account of the}} ground-state properties of the dilute magnetically trapped 87 Rb gas recently cooled and Bose-Einstein condensed at nanokelvin-scale temperatures. Using simple scaling arguments, we show that at large particle number the kinetic energy is a small perturbation, and find a spatial structure of the cloud of atoms and its momentum distribution dependent in an essential way on particle interactions. We also estimate the superfluid coherence length and the critical angular velocity at which vortex lines become energetically favorable. PACS numbers: 03. 75. Fi, 05. 30. Jp, 32. 80.

For antiferromagnetic interactions, our study reveals double condensations as atoms in the $|m_F= 0 >$ state never seem to condense under the constraints of both the conservation of total atom number $N$ and magnetization $M$. For ferromagnetic interactions, however, triple condensations can occur.
