40|$|Abstract. Past {{few decades}} have {{been marked by}} {{significant}} achievements {{in the development of}} cutting tools and machining processes. End-milling operation with Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> presents a good technical solution for machining “difficult-to-cut materials”. However, the cost of each technical or technological solution is a major concern in the decision making process. It is quite common for a solution developer to encounter a question like “How much will this new method cost? ” before proceeding for implementation. PCD insert applied as a cutting tool is a recent development and evaluation of economic performance of this <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> in end-milling of a-difficult-to-cut material such as Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy can be of significant importance to the manufacturer. However, cost economy depends significantly on the correct choice of cutting conditions especially in the context of cutting parameters. To determine the economically desired levels of the cutting parameters for PCD insert to end-mill Titanium alloy we have presented a RSM-based mathematical model which would help to estimate the cost of removing unit volume of material and to find out the optimum cutting conditions leading to minimum machining cost...|$|E
40|$|Turning {{is one of}} the {{important}} machining processes in manufacturing industries. Tools wear during turning, {{is one of the}} major problems which may lead to production loss and machine down time. An effective tool wear monitoring method is therefore required to minimise the above. The work done in this thesis is related to the development of a new method for tool wear monitoring using tool-emitted sound signal in conjunction with newly reported Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). In the proposed method, the condition of the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> is monitored to classify its state into three different categories, namely, fresh, slightly worn and severely worn by analysing the tool-emitted audible sound. A trained competitive neural network is employed for this purpose. The network is trained by using the instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies extracted from the tool-emitted sound using HHT. The novelty of the present work is the use of HHT to extract the instantaneous amplitudes and the frequencies of the tool-emitted sound to determine the condition of the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> <b>insert</b> based on its flank wear. HHT is a recently developed signal processing technique more suitable for analysing nonstationary and nonlinear signals such as tool-emitted sound...|$|E
