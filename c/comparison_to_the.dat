5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also {{tested in the}} study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly {{over half of the}} total free fatty acid content.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an {{additional}} $30 million going towards marketing, though Box Office Mojo later calculated its budget as $70 million.

5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas {{were connected}} via separate {{leads to a}} motorized switch that selected {{each one of the}} inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs.

5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period.

Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape}} of the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

Bajpayee has also been vocal about the disparity in the pay he commands, in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top actors in the film industry.

5|$|Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget {{as a result of}} an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E

5|$|Following {{reconstitution}} {{into the}} Territorial Army in 1920, the Liverpool Scottish formalised {{its relationship with}} the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and transferred in 1937 to become the regiment's second territorial battalion. In <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> densely urbanised region that the King's Regiment encompassed in north-west England, the Cameron Highlanders area of recruitment in the Highlands was sparsely populated. Although it had its numerical designation omitted, the battalion's identity was preserved and headquarters at Fraser Street, Liverpool were retained. During a royal visit to Liverpool in 1938, George VI presented the battalion with new colours at Everton Football Club's Goodison Park stadium.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised.
