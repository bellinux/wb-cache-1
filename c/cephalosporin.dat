25|$|Cefobid a <b>cephalosporin</b> antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cephalosporin</b> {{compounds}} {{were first}} isolated from cultures of Cephalosporium acremonium from a sewer in Sardinia in 1948 by Italian scientist Giuseppe Brotzu. He noticed these cultures produced substances that were effective against Salmonella typhi, {{the cause of}} typhoid fever, which had β-lactamase. Guy Newton and Edward Abraham at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford isolated <b>cephalosporin</b> C. The <b>cephalosporin</b> nucleus, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), was derived from <b>cephalosporin</b> C and proved to be analogous to the penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), {{but it was not}} sufficiently potent for clinical use. Modification of the 7-ACA side chains resulted in the development of useful antibiotic agents, and the first agent, cefalotin (cephalothin), was launched by Eli Lilly and Company in 1964.|$|E
25|$|The aerobic mould which yielded <b>cephalosporin</b> {{was found}} in the sea, near a sewage outfall in Sardinia, in July 1945.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>cephalosporins,</b> cephamycins {{are based}} upon the cephem nucleus. Unlike most <b>cephalosporins,</b> cephamycins are a very {{efficient}} antibiotic against anaerobic microbes.|$|R
50|$|Cephamycins are a {{group of}} {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics. They {{are very similar to}} <b>cephalosporins,</b> and the cephamycins are sometimes classified as <b>cephalosporins.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Cephalosporins</b> {{were the}} third most {{commonly}} used agents in Estonia (16 %; 100 per 1000) but were less often prescribed in Sweden (7.5 %; 26 per 1000) (Figure  1). First generation <b>cephalosporins</b> (cefalexin, cefadroxil) were prescribed with equal frequency in both countries whereas the second-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> (cefuroxime, cefprozil) were more frequently used in Estonia compared to Sweden (68 vs. 1.4 per 1000, respectively). No third- or fourth-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> were used in Estonia but they were prescribed occasionally in Sweden.|$|R
25|$|Beta-lactamase enzymatic {{activity}} {{can be detected}} using nitrocefin, a chromogenic <b>cephalosporin</b> substrate which changes color from yellow to red upon beta-lactamase mediated hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Among the company's {{more recent}} {{pharmaceutical}} developments are <b>cephalosporin,</b> erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) {{for the treatment}} of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral <b>cephalosporin</b> antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics choices {{depend on}} {{regional}} availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation <b>cephalosporin</b> is currently recommended for cellulitis without abscess. A course of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases.|$|E
50|$|Cephalosporin: This is {{an example}} of a wide {{spectrum}} antibiotic that is relatively stable to staphylococcal penicillinase although this stability varies with different <b>cephalosporins.</b> Certain <b>cephalosporins</b> in dentistry can be administered orally while others can be given by injections. In the case of an allergy to penicillin, <b>cephalosporins</b> may be a suitable alternative.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} and {{fate of the}} 3 '-substituent {{of a series of}} <b>cephalosporins</b> on their interaction with the DD-transpeptidase/carboxypeptidase of Streptomyces R 61 were investigated. Good 3 '-leaving groups are eliminated from the acyl-enzyme before deacylation, and hence <b>cephalosporins</b> with such substituents generate a common covalent intermediate. The rate of this elimination reaction in the two cases studied in detail was much lower than from the corresponding cephalosporoates in free solution. <b>Cephalosporins</b> without good 3 '-leaving groups yield acyl-enzymes that appear to hydrolyse, leading to enzyme re-activation, faster than those from <b>cephalosporins</b> with leaving groups...|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} <b>cephalosporins</b> have greater activity against gram-negative bacteria than {{the second and}} third generation. This difference is attributed to them being dipolar ionic zwitterion compounds. The C-7 side chain is similar to third generation <b>cephalosporins</b> usually containing iminomethoxy-aminothiazole group {{or in the case of}} Cefclidine an aminothiadiazole. Because of the positively charged quaternary nitrogen in the C-3 side chain {{fourth generation}} <b>cephalosporins</b> can diffuse through the gram-negative bacterial membrane more readily than earlier <b>cephalosporins.</b> It is thought that the positive charge orients the drug molecule to the entrance of the porin channel.|$|R
25|$|Woodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his {{synthesis}} of complex organic molecules. In his Nobel lecture, {{he described the}} total {{synthesis of}} the antibiotic <b>cephalosporin,</b> and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule {{so that it would}} be completed {{around the time of the}} Nobel ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the <b>cephalosporin</b> therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation <b>cephalosporin</b> with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).|$|E
2500|$|Most first-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> were {{originally}} spelled [...] "ceph-" [...] in English-speaking countries. This {{continues to be}} the preferred spelling in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, while European countries (including the United Kingdom) have adopted the International Nonproprietary Names, which are always spelled [...] "cef-". Newer first-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> and all <b>cephalosporins</b> of later generations are spelled [...] "cef-", even in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{commonly}} used <b>cephalosporins</b> were evaluated in the hamster colitis mode. They were all found to cause hemorrhagic cecitis and death within 10 days of being given as subcutaneous or oral challenges. Necropsy findings were indistinguishable from clindamycin-induced cecitis. Bacteria-free cecal filtrate obtained from hamsters dying of cephalosporin-induced cecitis contained toxin similar or identical to hat produced by Clostridium difficile {{isolated from the}} cecum of a hamster. Daily oral administration of poorly absorbed <b>cephalosporins</b> protected hamsters from clindamycin-induced cecitis and death {{as long as the}} <b>cephalosporins</b> were continued. The absorbable <b>cephalosporins</b> were ineffective in protecting hamsters from clindamycin-induced cecitis. This difference probably relates to the lower concentrations of absorbable <b>cephalosporins</b> maintained in the ceca of the hamsters. The possible correlation of these findings to human cases of cephalosporin-induced pseudomembranous colitis is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between <b>cephalosporins</b> and penicillin, recent {{assessments}} have shown no {{increased risk for}} a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later <b>cephalosporins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Resistance to <b>cephalosporin</b> {{antibiotics}} {{can involve}} either reduced affinity of existing PBP components or {{the acquisition of}} a supplementary β-lactam-insensitive PBP. Currently, some Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli strains are resistant to cephalosporins. Some Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens strains have also developed resistance to cephalosporins to varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Woodward {{synthesized}} many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, <b>cephalosporin,</b> and colchicine. With these, Woodward {{opened up a}} new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin is {{a useful}} {{alternative}} to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but cefalexin {{may be used as}} an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering <b>cephalosporin</b> antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross sensitivity with beta-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, 25 Escherichia coli strains {{isolated}} from beef, pork, and poultry meat, and producing extendedspectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) (18 strains) or AmpC- cephalosporinases (7 strains) were tested for antimicrobial resistance using the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} method with 16 antimicrobial agents. All examined strains were resistant to ampicillin and the first-generation <b>cephalosporins.</b> Variable resistance to the third-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> (40 %- 100 % among ESBLproducing strains and 0 - 72 % among AmpC-producing strains) was noted. Less than 30 % of examined strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to the fourth-generation <b>cephalosporins,</b> <b>cephalosporins</b> connected with inhibitors of β-lactamases, carbapenems, and gentamyci...|$|R
50|$|Third-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> {{differ from}} earlier generations in the {{presence}} of a C=N-OCH3 group in their chemical structure (cefuroxime & Cefuzonam also bear this functional group but are only listed as class II). This group provides improved stability against certain beta-lactamase enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These bacterial enzymes rapidly destroy earlier-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> by breaking open the drug's beta-lactam chemical ring, leading to antibiotic resistance. Though initially active against these bacteria, with widespread use of third-generation <b>cephalosporins,</b> some Gram-negative bacteria known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are even able to inactivate the third-generation <b>cephalosporins.</b> Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.|$|R
40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{isolates}} {{with reduced}} susceptibility to <b>cephalosporins</b> 1. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) with elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral and injectable <b>cephalosporins</b> have been isolated from New York City residents. 2. Laboratories performing GC culture {{are urged to}} perform antibiotic susceptibility testing using ceftriaxone and cefixime. 3. Results of GC antibiotic susceptibility testing must be reported to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). 4. GC isolates with reduced susceptibility to <b>cephalosporins</b> must b...|$|R

M-Sport, the rally team at Dovenby Hall, and Jennings Brewery are in Cockermouth. James Cropper, Europe's leading {{manufacturer}} of coloured paper, is in Burneside, north of Kendal, on the River Kent near the A591. Pirelli have their main UK tyre plant (for prestige cars) on the B5299 in south Carlisle; {{to the south}} in Cummersdale next to the River Caldew, Stead McAlpin have a large textile site, formerly owned by John Lewis. BSW Timber, the UK's largest sawmilling company, has a large site north of Carlisle at Cargo in Kingmoor, next to Carlisle Kingmoor TMD on the WCML. BillerudKorsnäs had a paper mill at Beetham on the A6 next to the River Bela {{in the south of}} the county. Sealy UK make beds and mattresses on the B5031 next to Aspatria railway station in north Cumbria, west of Carlisle; next door First Milk make Lake District Cheddar. Further east along the A596, Innovia Films (former British Rayophane) have a large site at Wigton. GSK Ulverston, built in 1949 as Glaxo to produce penicillin with a new plant to be built, makes <b>cephalosporin</b> antibiotics including cefuroxime and ceftazidime. Oxley Developments (electronics) are at Ulverston near Conishead Priory.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>cephalosporin</b> nucleus can be {{modified}} to gain different properties. Cephalosporins are sometimes grouped into [...] "generations" [...] by their antimicrobial properties. The first cephalosporins were designated first-generation cephalosporins, whereas, later, more extended-spectrum cephalosporins were classified as second-generation cephalosporins. Each newer generation has significantly greater Gram-negative antimicrobial properties than the preceding generation, in most cases with decreased activity against Gram-positive organisms. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, have true broad-spectrum activity.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{cephalosporins}} {{are associated}} with hypoprothrombinemia and a disulfiram-like reaction with ethanol. These include latamoxef (moxalactam), cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefmetazole, and cefotetan. [...] This {{is thought to be}} due to the N-methylthiotetrazole side-chain of these cephalosporins, which blocks the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (likely causing hypothrombinemia) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (causing alcohol intolerance). Thus, consumption of alcohol after taking <b>Cephalosporin</b> orally or intravenously is contraindicated, and in severe cases can lead to death.|$|E
40|$|Outer {{membrane}} permeation of Bacteroides fragilis by <b>cephalosporins</b> {{was examined}} by a previously described method. The permeation parameters of <b>cephalosporins</b> in B. fragilis {{were close to}} 10 (- 5) cm 3 /min per microgram of cell dry weight. These values were about {{an order of magnitude}} lower than those in Escherichia coli. In B. fragilis, the permeation was not directly proportional to the hydrophilicity of <b>cephalosporins,</b> and the ion selectivity was weak...|$|R
40|$|Among 477 {{patients}} with susceptible Enterobacter spp., 49 subsequently harbored third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacter spp. Broad-spectrum <b>cephalosporins</b> were independent {{risk factors for}} resistance (relative risk [OR] = 2. 3, P = 0. 01); quinolone therapy was protective (OR = 0. 4, P = 0. 03). There were trends toward decreased risk for resistance among patients receiving broad-spectrum <b>cephalosporins</b> and either aminoglycosides or imipenem. Of the patients receiving broad-spectrum <b>cephalosporins,</b> 19 % developed resistance...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} a widely quoted cross-allergy risk of 10% between <b>cephalosporins</b> and penicillin, {{an article in the}} Journal of Family Practice has shown no {{increased}} risk for cross-allergy for cefprozil and several other second-generation or later <b>cephalosporins.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{classification}} of cephalosporins into [...] "generations" [...] is commonly practised, although the exact categorization is often imprecise. For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not recognized as such in Japan. In Japan, cefaclor is classed as a first-generation <b>cephalosporin,</b> {{though in the}} United States it is a second-generation one; and cefbuperazone, cefminox, and cefotetan are classed as second-generation cephalosporins. Cefmetazole and cefoxitin are classed as third-generation cephems. Flomoxef and latamoxef are in a new class called oxacephems.|$|E
2500|$|Cefalexin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the <b>cephalosporin</b> family. [...] It is bactericidal {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cephalexin.|$|E
2500|$|Meningitis is an {{inflammation}} of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (these membranes are known as meninges). Meningitis is most commonly caused by infections with various pathogens, examples of which are Streptococcus pneumoniae [...] and Haemophilus influenzae. When the meninges are inflamed, the blood–brain barrier may be disrupted. This disruption may increase the penetration of various substances (including either toxins or antibiotics) into the brain. Antibiotics used to treat meningitis may aggravate the inflammatory response of {{the central nervous system}} by releasing neurotoxins from the cell walls of bacteria - like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Depending on the causative pathogen, whether it is bacterial, fungal, or protozoan, treatment with third-generation or fourth-generation <b>cephalosporin</b> or amphotericin B is usually prescribed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cephalosporins</b> are {{diverse in}} their {{antibacterial}} spectrum, water solubility, acid tolerability, oral bioavailability, biological half-life and other properties. Therefore, the <b>cephalosporins</b> {{can be further}} classified into generations depending on antibacterial activity, time of invention and structural basis.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{antibiotic}} classes {{result in}} resistance more than others. Increased rates of MRSA infections are seen when using glycopeptides, <b>cephalosporins,</b> and quinolone antibiotics. <b>Cephalosporins,</b> and particularly quinolones and clindamycin, {{are more likely}} to produce colonisation with Clostridium difficile.|$|R
50|$|However, some M. morganii strains are {{resistant}} to penicillin, ampicillin/sublactam, oxacillin, first-generation and second-generation <b>cephalosporins,</b> macrolides, lincosamides, fosfomycin, colistin, and polymyxin B. The emergence of highly resistant strains of M. morganii {{have been associated with}} use of third-generation <b>cephalosporins.</b>|$|R
