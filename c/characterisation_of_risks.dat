40|$|The {{extent to}} which the money supply affects the {{aggregate}} cash balance demanded at a certain level of nominal income and interest rates is determined by the interestrate-elasticity and stability of the money demand. An actuarial approach is adopted in this paper for dealing with investors confronting liquidity constraints and maintaining different expectations about risks. Under such circumstances, a level of surplus exists which maximises expected value. Moreover, when the distorted probability principle is introduced, the optimal liquidity demand is expressed as a Value at Risk and the comonotonic dependence structure determines the amount of money demanded by the economy. As a consequence, the more unstable the economy, the greater the interestrate-elasticity of the money demand.

40|$|The Working Paper Environment and Human Health gives a {{comprehensive}} review of the related literature in order to aid understanding of the (missing) link between the environment and health. Given the exhaustive literature on the subject the paper focuses on the water&#x 0081;]related and land&#x 0081;]related diseases namely in the fast growing and poor countries. By assessing the terrain of research on the subject, the paper aims to look beyond the causal linkage between environment and health and instead emphasis the underlying question about how environmental factors, along with man&#x 0081;]made changes, influence human health. Specifically, the review examines the ability of the literature to define the incidence of environmentally&#x 0081;]related diseases as well as their distribution across social and geographical scales, understands the role of diverse factors influencing these diseases and the adaptive capacity of societies in managing these illnesses or disorders. The paper draws {{on a wide range of}} sources from a variety of disciplines to unpack the linkage between the environment and health, and identifies issues, themes and questions raised by the literature. The review reveals limited understanding of the complex relationship between the environment and health. Although these researches provide grounds for a curative approach and in recent years have called for a preventive approach, they still retain a &#x 0081;esimplistic high school model&#x 0081;f of examining the linear cause&#x 0081;]effect relationship. This nevertheless fails to take on the growing risks posed by climate change and globalisation, as well as the dynamics of pathogens (and vectors) and of society affecting human health. These risks characterise complexity, uncertainty, conflicts and change. Given this <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> the review calls for a modern approach to foresee and control the future consequences of human actions in order to live and adapt to the risks. This requires {{a comprehensive}} understanding of risk (from water pollutants) by identifying the pathways of risk assessment, understanding the impacts of pollutants and identifying a diverse set of strategies adopted by the individuals, organisations and agencies involved in bringing change to existing institutions and bio&#x 0081;]physical resources...|$|E

Logistic regression analysis indicates that risk attitudes have implications for non-compliance with fisheries regulation.

40|$|Human {{schistosomiasis}} is {{a chronic}} parasitic disease affecting around 200 million people worldwide. Infection occurs when cercariae penetrate the skin during water contact. Although there is effective treatment for schistosomiasis, individuals remain susceptible to reinfection after treatment; some individuals, however, appear {{more susceptible to}} reinfection than others.

We examine the influence of demographic factors and antibody responses on susceptibility to reinfection. While observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in Schistosoma mansoni reinfection could be explained by differences in exposure, age-related differences appeared linked to the balance of specific IgE and IgG 4 antibodies, themselves related to resistance to reinfection.

Results. The analysis shows that three risk groups (high, medium, low) can be differentiated among participants based on their driving patterns under the influence of alcohol and drugs and on the basis of the life styles, which they reflect through theirFacebookLikes, and of classical structural variables.

We aimed to develop an RA prediction model capable of generating clinically relevant predictive data and to determine if it better predicted younger onset RA (YORA). Our novel modelling approach combined odds ratios for 15 four-digit/ 10 two-digit HLA-DRB 1 alleles, 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ever-smoking status in males to determine risk using computer simulation and confidence interval based risk categorisation. Only males were evaluated in our models incorporating smoking as ever-smoking is a significant risk factor for RA in men but not women. We developed multiple models to evaluate each risk factor's impact on prediction. Each model's ability to discriminate anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) -positive RA from controls was evaluated in two cohorts: Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC: 1, 516 cases; 1, 647 controls); UK RA Genetics Group Consortium (UKRAGG: 2, 623 cases; 1, 500 controls). HLA and smoking provided strongest prediction with good discrimination evidenced by an HLA-smoking model area under the curve (AUC) value of 0. 813 in both WTCCC and UKRAGG. SNPs provided minimal prediction (AUC 0. 660 WTCCC/ 0. 617 UKRAGG). Whilst high individual risks were identified, with some cases having estimated lifetime <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> 86 %, only a minority overall had substantially increased odds for RA. High risks from the HLA model were associated with YORA (P< 0. 0001); ever-smoking associated with older onset disease. This latter finding suggests smoking's impact on RA risk manifests later in life. Our modelling demonstrates that combining risk factors provides clinically informative RA prediction; additionally HLA and smoking status {{can be used to}} predict the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> younger and older onset RA, respectively. © 2013 Scott et al...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at raising {{awareness}} on {{the theme}} of governance, especially applied to the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> complex critical infrastructures and with particular reference to the European context and its electric power infrastructure. As a consequence of the recent economic and technological changes, the potential risks menacing critical infrastructures have become more urgent and crucial for society. On the one hand, the deregulation of markets has forced the unbundling of the once vertically integrated power companies, significantly augmenting the number of actors and dispersing the responsibilities on the assessment and management <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> On the other, the increasing use of the international electricity interconnectors across countries, for satisfying the demand and the transactions in the power exchanges, hasn’t been accompanied by a parallel development of the physical systems. As a matter of fact, interconnectors are being used for operations that were not foreseen by their original design, opening serious questions about their capacity to sustain in a reliable way the new requirements. In addition, the pervasive adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs), while allowing the achievement of greater levels of efficiency, functionality and quality of service, have introduced new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attackers. In this situation, new scenarios <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> have arisen: e. g. security issues from the connectivity to open information networks, complexity of the European power grid as an extended system-of-systems interconnecting the national networks, where each single industrial or regulatory actor has only a partial view <b>of</b> the overall <b>risk</b> situation. Risks to infrastructural systems used to be a management problem for rather isolated monopolies, and a regulatory problem for single governments. Now the increased interconnectivity and number of linkages among systems involves a multiplicity of stakeholders connected to one another and affected by cascading effects. Infrastructures are generally run by a number of interrelated companies, with no one able to handle the risks by itself alone. Moreover, as infrastructures cross borders in their interconnections, the power that each government can exercise is limited. The key question for an infrastructure such as electric power concerns the responsibilities with respect to the assessment and management <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> in a multinational scenario. Current regulations {{do not appear to be}} able to provide a thorough answer to the new situation fro the risk viewpoint. Such a context requires an answer that is better described with the concept of governance, in which the approaches, interests and concerns of all stakeholders are taken into consideration in dealing with the described complexity. Risk governance thus emerges as the most proper way to deal with the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> infrastructures. The arguments that support this statement, developed in this paper, regard first the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> complex critical infrastructures (i. e. electric power infrastructures) and the reasons that lead to consider the concept of governance and its peculiarities, with particular reference to risk governance versus risk management. In such a vision, a risk governance process, exemplified in its main steps is described. In such a vision, a proposal for the constitution of a European Council for the Security of Electric Power (ECSEP), a decision-oriented and voluntary association of European Critical Electricity Infrastructure (ECEI), is formulated.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the results of}} exploratory research carried out during 2007 and 2008 within the JRC¿s Institute for Health & Consumer Protection. The research focused {{on the problem of}} ranking chemicals according to their environmental and toxicological concern, and aimed to develop {{a better understanding of how}} to apply such approaches in the implementation of chemicals legislation, such as REACH and the Water Framework Directive. A number of limitations were identified in existing approaches for the prioritisation of chemicals. For example, the traditional EU tool, EURAM, was difficult to apply in a consistent way due to the fact that many of the data inputs needed were often missing, which meant that high priority was often given to data-poor chemicals, rather than chemicals that were inherently hazardous or likely to cause a significant risk. This project aimed to address limitations such as this by encoding novel ranking methods into a new user-friendly software tool, and by investigating the applicability of the tool in a number of case studies. The tool developed in this project, called DART (Decision Analysis by Ranking Techniques), is made freely downloadable from the JRC website. The applicability of DART tool is illustrated through a set of case studies. The first case study aims to summarise and illustrate different ways in which chemometric ranking methods could be used to supplement the use of QSAR methods in the development of chemical categories. The second case study illustrates how ranking methods could be used to supplement the use of QSAR methods in the context of toxicological assessments of potential persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances. Finally, the third case study, aims to investigate the compatibility of established and novel ranking approaches with the risk assessment paradigm, in which hazard and exposure assessments are integrated into a <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> These case studies illustrate some potential applications of ranking techniques in the regulatory assessment of chemicals.

We illustrate and evaluate the approach for two pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and fluoxetine) and one personal care product ingredient (triclosan) for the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. Initially, experimental data on the uptake of the three chemicals at two pH values were fitted using a toxicokinetic model to derive uptake and depuration constants for the neutral and ionised species of each molecule. The derived constants were then used to predict uptake from water and sediment for other pH conditions. Evaluation of predictions against corresponding experimental data showed good predictions of uptake for all test chemicals from water for different pH conditions and reasonable predictions of uptake of fluoxetine and diclofenac from a sediment. Predictions demonstrated {{that the level of}} uptake of the study chemicals, across pH ranges in European streams, could differ by up to a factor of 3035. Overall, the approach could be extremely useful for assessing internal exposure of aquatic organisms across landscapes with differing pH. This could help support better <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> ionisable chemicals in the aquatic environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Benzene {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a carcinogen and recent concern has centred {{on the effects of}} continuous exposure to low concentrations of benzene both occupationally and environmentally. This paper presents an overview of the current knowledge about human exposure to benzene in the United Kingdom population based on recently published data, summarises the known human health effects, and uses this information to provide a risk evaluation for sections of the general United Kingdom population.  METHOD—Given the minor contribution that non-inhalation sources make to the overall daily intake of benzene to humans, only exposure from inhalation has been considered when estimating the daily exposure of the general population to benzene. Exposure of adults, children, and infants to benzene has been estimated for different exposure scenarios with time-activity patterns and inhalation and absorption rates in conjunction with measured benzene concentrations for a range of relevant microenvironments. Exposures during refuelling and driving, as well as the contribution of active and passive tobacco smoke, have been considered as part <b>of</b> the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the general population.  RESULTS—Infants (< 1 years old), the average child (11  years old), and non-occupationally exposed adults, receive average daily doses in the range of 15 - 26, 29 - 50, and 75 - 522 µg of benzene, respectively, which correspond to average ranges to benzene in air of 3. 40 - 5. 76 µg/m 3, 3. 37 - 5. 67 µg/m 3, and 3. 7 - 41 µg/m 3 for infants, children, and adults, respectively. Infants and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke have concentrations of exposure to benzene comparable with those of an adult passive smoker. This is a significant source of exposure as a 1995  United Kingdom survey has shown that 47 % of children aged 2 - 15 years live in households where at least one person smokes. The consequence of exposure to benzene in infants is more significant than for children or adults owing to their lower body weight, resulting in a higher daily intake for infants compared with children or non-smoking adults. A worst case scenario for exposure to benzene in the general population is that of an urban smoker who works adjacent to a busy road for 8  hours/day—for example, a maintenance worker—who can receive a mean daily exposure of about 820  µg (equal to an estimated exposure of 41  µg/m 3). The major health risk associated with low concentrations of exposure to benzene {{has been shown to be}} leukaemia, in particular acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. The lowest concentration of exposure at which an increased incidence of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia among occupationally exposed workers has been reliably detected, has been estimated to be in the range of 32 - 80 mg/m 3. Although some studies have suggested that effects may occur at lower concentrations, clear estimates <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> have not been determined, partly because of the inadequacy of exposure data and the few cases.  CONCLUSIONS—Overall the evidence from human studies suggests that any <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> leukaemia at concentrations of exposure in the general population of 3. 7 - 42 µg/m 3 —that is at concentrations three orders of magnitude less than the occupational lowest observed effect level—is likely to be exceedingly small and probably not detectable with current methods. This is also likely to be true for infants and children who may be exposed continuously to concentrations of 3. 4 - 5. 7 µg/m 3. As yet there is no evidence to suggest that continuous exposures to these environmental concentrations of benzene manifest as any other adverse health effect.    Keywords: risk assessment; benzene; environmen...|$|R
40|$|Background. Describing the frequency, severity, {{and causes}} of sports {{injuries}} and illnesses reliably {{is important for}} quantifying the risk to athletes and providing direction for prevention initiatives. Methods. Time-loss and/or medical-attention definitions have long been used in sports injury/illness epidemiology research, but the limitations to these definitions mean that some events are incorrectly classified or omitted completely, where athletes continue to train and compete at high levels but experience restrictions in their performance. Introducing a graded definition of performance-restriction may provide {{a solution to this}} issue. Results. Results from the Great Britain injury/illness performance project (IIPP) are presented using a performance-restriction adaptation of the accepted surveillance consensus methodologies. The IIPP involved 322 Olympic athletes (males: 172; female: 150) from 10 Great Britain Olympic sports between September 2009 and August 2012. Of all injuries (n= 565), 216 were classified as causing time-loss, 346 as causing performance-restriction, and 3 were unclassified. For athlete illnesses (n= 378), the majority (P< 0. 01) resulted in time-loss (270) compared with performance-restriction (101) (7 unclassified). Conclusions. Successful implementation of prevention strategies relies on the correct <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> injury/illness <b>risk</b> factors. Including a performance-restriction classification could provide a deeper understanding of injuries/illnesses and better informed prevention initiatives...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{understanding}} of HHT has greatly progressed. The two genes for most on cromosomes 9 and 12 have been discovered {{and the existence of}} a third involved gene has been predicted. Recent progress in the field of genetics has allowed the identification of many gene mutation thus facilitating the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> the at <b>risk</b> members <b>of</b> the same family. Complications from bleeding or shunting (pulmonary AVMs) may be sudden and life-threatening (hemothorax, haemoptysis, stroke and brain abscess). Catastrophic events are preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate screening programmes are mandatory and multi-specialistic cooperation is needed.

40|$|EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) {{was asked}} for a {{scientific}} opinion on an alternative method for processing Category (Cat) 2 Animal By-Products (ABP) as defined in Reg. (EC) 1069 / 20094. The material to be treated consists of dead-on-farm poultry; this implies that the animals died due to a disease, which in most cases was not properly diagnosed. The proposed method consists in a decomposition of the carcasses by a process of autolysis, putrefaction and finally digestion by insects that takes place on-farm in a proofed pit. The carcasses are taken daily from a warehouse and immediately thrown into the pit. Lime is added {{at the rate of}} 200 g/kg of carcass. Loading continues until the pit is full. The end-product obtained is intended to be used as an organic fertiliser. According to the legislation in force, before being used as an organic fertiliser, Cat. 2 material should be treated with a sterilisation process (i. e. 133 °C / 20 min / 3 bars / 50 mm particle size). The BIOHAZ Panel concluded that the identification and <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> material was not properly addressed in the application and a comprehensive list of possible hazards was not provided. No experimental validation with representative test-organisms under practical conditions was done. Because of a lack of information in the report, {{it was not possible to}} determine the degree <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> reduction <b>of</b> pathogenic bacterial, viral and parasitological agents achieved by the processes.

40|$|AIMS: Interpreting {{the results}} and {{practice}} implications of clinical studies requires accurate <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> the baseline <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the population. We evaluated the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score for STEMI {{as a tool to}} describe and compare the <b>risk</b> profile <b>of</b> populations enrolled in three clinical trials (InTIME-II, ASSENT- 2 and MAGIC) and the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The risk score was calculated for each patient (N= 121, 085) and the frequency distribution plotted for each population. The Risk Score Profiles were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Risk Score Profile demonstrated a striking concordance between the baseline <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> patients in InTIME-II and ASSENT- 2 (median scores in each= 3 [1, 4], P= 0. 11). In contrast, the distributions in MAGIC (designed to enroll high risk) and NRMI (registry) were shifted significantly toward higher risk (median scores= 4 [3, 5] for MAGIC and 4 [2, 6] in NRMI, P < 0. 0001 for each vs. InTIME-II). A graded relationship between the risk score and mortality was evident in each study (P< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency distribution <b>of</b> the TIMI <b>Risk</b> Score, or similar tools for risk assessment, may be used to quantify and readily compare the <b>risk</b> profile <b>of</b> populations enrolled in clinical studies. status: publishe...|$|R
