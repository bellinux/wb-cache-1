The letter F anywhere in the three-character string either strongly predicted the occurrence of the target letter T, in two conditions, or predicted its nonoccurrence, in a third. This manipulation of the frequency with which the familiar letter F predicted T was shown to change the function relating probability of a correct peck at the symbol "?" to the number of Fs in the string.

40|$|Field {{emission}} {{flat panel}} displays place new demands {{on the performance of}} cathodoluminescent phosphors. In particular, such phosphors must be efficient at lower voltages (ca. 100 - 1000 V), and must withstand higher current densities than are present on <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube <b>screens.</b> ZnO:Zn has been studied extensively as a low-voltage phosphor, but problems such as poor chromatic saturation and temperature sensitivity of emission remain. In this work the use of terbium-doped garnet phases such as yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) and gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) as low voltage green-emitting phosphors is evaluated. Hydrothermal synthesis yields well-faceted YAG grains with particle diameters of less than 1 {mu}m. Cathodoluminescent efficiency at a particular voltage was not affected by synthetic route, though the hydrothermally synthesized material was less susceptible to damage at high power densities. An efficiency of 3. 5 lm/W was observed for GGG:Tb at 800 V. Deposition of the phosphors onto conducting screens increased their efficiencies at very low voltages (< 200 V).

5|$|OXO or Noughts and Crosses is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts and crosses. It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube <b>screens</b> to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|R
50|$|Virtually {{all modern}} arcade games (other than the very {{traditional}} Midway-type games at county fairs) make {{extensive use of}} solid state electronics, integrated circuits and <b>Cathode</b> <b>Ray</b> Tube <b>screens.</b> In the past, coin-operated arcade video games generally used custom per-game hardware often with multiple CPUs, highly specialized sound and graphics chips, and the latest in expensive computer graphics display technology.

Arcade game hardware in the 2010s is often based on modified video game console hardware or high-end PC components. Arcade games frequently have more immersive and realistic game controls than either PC or console games, including specialized ambiance or control accessories: fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls, dedicated lightguns, rear-projection displays, reproductions of automobile or airplane cockpits, motorcycle or horse-shaped controllers, or highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods. These accessories are usually what set modern video games apart from other games, as they are usually too bulky, expensive, and specialized to be used with typical home PCs and consoles.|$|R
40|$|Hardware testing {{frequently}} {{involves the}} acquisition of waveform and instrumentation signals, which are often recorded on waveform recorders, oscillographs, and video recorders. Years ago, the waveforms were viewed as analog records, as drawn by a paper strip chart pen or electron beam on a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube <b>screen.</b> One {{of the problems in}} the past was that the analog electronics may {{not have been able to}} accurately display the full amplitude of a signal if the real-time signals exceeded the frequency response bandwidth of the recording device. The advent of digital oscilloscopes, waveform recorders, and video frame-grabbers solved many of the frequency response problems, though not all. A restriction on digital waveform acquisition is well known by people in the instrumentation field. Put simply, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the frequency of any signal to be sampled, or vice versa; the signals must be filtered so that none of the signal frequencies are higher than one-half the sample rate (the Nyquist Limit). Then, per Shannon's Sampling Theorem (1949, ref. 1), any sampled signal can be reconstructed for viewing on a display device. If any signals exceed the Nyquist frequency limit, error signals called aliases occur in the output display...|$|R

Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann constructed the game from analog electronics and filed for a patent in 1947, which was issued the following year. The gaming device was never manufactured or marketed to the public, so it had no effect on the future video game industry. Under most definitions, the device is not considered a video game, as while it had an electronic display it did not run on a computing device.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube <b>screen.</b> The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{television}} as <b>Cathode</b> <b>Ray</b> Tube (CRT) <b>screens</b> became brighter, the level of flicker caused by progressive scanning became more noticeable. This is because the human visual system is sensitive to large-area flicker. Interlaced scanning was invented in 1932 as a redeem to this difficulty. In contrast to progressive scanning, where every line is drawn in sequence, interlaced scanning alternates lines of a frame in half a frame interval, called a field. The conversion process from interlace scan to progressive scan is called deinterlacing. In this thesis, two deinterlacing methods, which use motion information from the video sequence, were used in conjunction to obtain an improved result. Thus, the process of finding the true motion on the interlaced video sequence also had to be analyzed. The analysis was done on artificially generated test sequences, as well as true video sequences. The result was measured using the Mean Square Error between a progressive input sequence and the deinterlaced output sequence. This measurement was compared to a much simpler deinterlacing algorithm and showed large improvements, primarily in sense of aliasing. However, in some cases, the deinterlacer produced severe artifacts causing picture degradation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
