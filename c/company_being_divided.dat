500|$|E.T. {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} most {{important}} titles in the industry's history. As early as January 1983, after Atari admitted that the game had sold poorly, an industry executive said that [...] "the lesson of E.T. has not been lost on the industry". Infamously, the game is also cited to be one of the main causes of the video game industry crisis of 1983. Billboard magazine Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T. games along with an increase in competition prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers. By the end of 1982, Atari had begun to lose dominance as more competitors entered the market. Poor critical reception and lack of a profitable marketing strategy made this game one of many cited decisions that led Atari to report a $536 million loss in 1983 and led to the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> and sold in 1984. GameSpy's Classic Gaming called E.T. Atari's biggest mistake, as well as the largest financial failure in the industry. Reiley commented that the game's poor quality was responsible for ending the product life of the Atari 2600. Occurring soon after Pac-Mans negative critical response on the Atari 2600, E.T.s poor reception was attributed by Kent to a negative impact on Atari's reputation and profitability. Authors Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost echoed similar comments about Pac-Man and E.T.s combined effect on the company's reputation and the industry's reaction. Buchanan also cited the game as a factor to Atari and the industry's crash. He stated that the large amount of unsold merchandise was a financial burden to Atari, which pushed the company into debt.|$|E

Despite its current importance, little is known or studied about unbundling or about how it relates to existing software engineering approaches, such as modularization. Consequently, recent cases points out {{that it has been}} performed unsystematically and arbitrarily. In this paper, our main goal is to present this novel and relevant concept and its challenges in the light of software engineering, exemplifying it with recent cases. We relate unbundling to standard software modularization, presenting the new motivations behind it, the resulting problems, and drawing perspectives for future support in the area...|$|R
25|$|When the 183rd Division {{arrived in}} Flanders became an Eingreifdivisionen for Gruppe Ypren. The divisional {{artillery}} had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments {{and the three}} battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as {{the quickest way to}} signal to the rear.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{his success}} on Raiders {{that led to}} Warshaw being chosen to design and program the ill-fated Atari 2600 {{adaptation}} of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Problems began early as he was only given five weeks to go from concept to finished product. Warshaw was assisted by Jerome Domurat, a graphics designer at Atari. Although the game was finished on time, it was poorly received and seen as being confusing and frustrating. Atari took a major financial loss on the project which, combined with other poor business decisions and conditions, led to the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> and sold within two years. During this time, Warshaw developed and almost finished another game called Saboteur. He left the company before it was completed. It was then re-adapted into a game based on the television series The A-Team but this also remained unfinished. [...] Atari was dismantled before either version could be released.|$|E

40|$|Companies can {{optimize}} {{their corporate}} structure {{by changing the}} structure itself. Since a change to the structure may adversely affect the position of creditors, statutory protection is appropriate. Too much protection can unnecessarily prevent a change to the structure being made. Too little protection can adversely affect creditors and the investment climate in general. This book is about {{the search for a}} balance between flexibility {{on the one hand and}} protection of creditors on the other hand, when implementing a legal merger, division or conversion with participation by a joint stock company. A legel merger (juridische fusie) is a legal act whereby a company acquires under universal title all the assets and liabilities of one or more other companies which cease to exist at the moment of the merger. The general rule is that the shareholders of the company or companies that cease(s) to exist become shareholders in the acquiring company. Division can take! the form of a split-up or a split-off. With a split-up, all the assets and liabilities of the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> are transferred under universal title to two or more existing or newly incorporated companies, and the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> ceases to exist. With a split-off, all or parts of the assets and liabilities are transferred to one or more existing or newly incorporated companies and the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> continues to exist. The general rule is that the shareholders of the <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>divided</b> become shareholders of the acquiring company or companies. Conversion is a less far-reaching change of structure compared to merger and division. An artificial person may be converted into another legal form. Conversion does not terminate the existence of the artificial person. Parts I to III examine the statutory regulations of the individual changes to structures in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Switzerland. As regards the protection of creditors, a distinction ! is made between the existing creditors at the moment the structure is changed (individual protection) and the potential new creditors (institutional protection). Part IV contains the main conclusions of this study and recommendations for amendments to the Dutch regulations...|$|E
