Local authorities are forced to make cuts, while discharging patients from hospital is delayed due to lack of support in the community. [...] Over 900 <b>carers</b> <b>leave</b> the profession daily and staff shortages mean vulnerable people get a lower standard of care. This applies to people receiving care in their own homes and to care home residents. High staff turnover prevents those who receive care getting to know their carers. Care workers are paid on average £7.69 per hour. The number of people over 75 years old is projected to double by 2040, according to the Office for National Statistics. Social care providers say without far-reaching change, there will be too few people to care for the aging English population. Mike Padgham of the UK Homecare Association wrote, [...] "My biggest fear is that we will soon run out of capacity to provide care to those who cannot fund themselves. I agree wholeheartedly with Age UK's warning that the social care system will begin to collapse this year, but I would go further and say that the system has already begun to collapse." ...|$|E
40|$|Home-based care {{provided}} {{by family members}} {{is the most common}} form of caring for people with disabilities in Australia. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that this model of care is generating enormous health and financial consequences for informal carers. Carers are experiencing high stress levels, low sense of wellbeing and poor health. A key contributor to this is the high level of financial stress they face. There are many factors contributing to carers and their families having low household incomes. The main reason is that taking on an informal carer role has a significant impact on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to work. Many <b>carers</b> <b>leave</b> paid employment either permanently or on a part-time basis to become carers. Spending all or a significant proportion of one 2 ̆ 7 s working years out of the workforce also means that there is limited opportunity to invest towards retirement through superannuation, and with high household expenditure levels relative to income, there is little opportunity for household savings. Without superannuation carers will have to depend on the aged pension {{provided by}} the government to support their needs in their retirement years. Because primary carers are more likely to be women than men, women are more likely to 2 ̆ 7 pay the price 2 ̆ 7 of being a carer...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of global {{population}} ageing, the reconciliation of employment and unpaid caring is becoming an important social issue. The estimation of the public expenditure costs of <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> employment is a valuable measure that is of considerable interest to policy-makers. In 2012, the Personal Social Services Research Unit estimated that the public expenditure costs of unpaid <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> employment in England were approximately £ 1. 3 billion a year, based on the costs of Carer’s Allowance and lost tax revenues on forgone incomes. However, this figure {{was known to be}} an underestimate partly because it did not include other key benefits that carers who have given up work to care may receive. This paper presents a new estimate of the public expenditure costs of <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> employment. Key sources of information are the 2009 / 10 Survey of Carers in Households, 2011 Census and 2015 / 2016 costs data. As well as Carer’s Allowance, the estimate also now includes the costs of other benefits that <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> work may receive, namely, Income Support and Housing Benefit. The results show that the estimated numbers of carers who have left employment because of caring have increased from approximately 315, 000 to 345, 000. Due mainly to the inclusion of a wider range of benefits, the public expenditure costs of <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> employment in England are now estimated at £ 2. 9 billion a year. The new estimate comprises £ 1. 7 billion in social security benefits paid to people who have left their jobs because of unpaid caring, plus another £ 1. 2 billion in taxes forgone on this group’s lost earnings. The paper concludes that, if there was greater public investment in social care, such as ‘replacement care’ to support carers in employment, and fewer carers then left employment, public spending on benefits would be lower and revenues from taxation would be higher...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of rising need for {{long-term}} care, reconciling unpaid care and carers’ employment is becoming an important social issue. In England, there is increasing policy emphasis on paid services for the person cared for, sometimes known as ‘replacement care’, to support working carers. Previous research has found an association between ‘replacement care’ and carers’ employment. However, more information is needed on potential causal connections between services and carers’ employment. This mixed methods study draws on new longitudinal data to examine service receipt and carers’ employment in England. Data were collected from carers who were employed in the public sector, using self-completion questionnaires in 2013 and 2015, and qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} a sub-sample of respondents to the 2015 questionnaire. We find that, where the person cared for did not receive at least one ‘key service’ (home care, personal assistant, day care, meals, short-term breaks), the carer was subsequently more likely to leave employment because of caring, suggesting that the absence of services contributed to the <b>carer</b> <b>leaving</b> work. In the interviews, carers identified specific ways in which services helped them to remain in employment. We conclude that, if a policy objective is {{to reduce the number of}} <b>carers</b> <b>leaving</b> employment because of caring, there needs to be greater access to publicly-funded services for disabled and older people who are looked after by unpaid carers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Weight at age 5 is a {{predictor}} for future {{health of the}} individual. This study examines risk factors for childhood obesity {{with a focus on}} ethnicity. Methods Data from the Millennium Cohort study were used. 17, 561 singleton children of White/European (n = 15, 062), Asian (n = 1, 845) or African (n = 654) background were selected. Logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests were used to examine factors associated with obesity at age 5. All participants were interviewed in their own homes. The main exposures examined included; Birth weight, sedentary lifestyle, family health behaviours, ethnicity, education and income. Results Children with a sedentary lifestyle, large at birth, with high risk family health behaviours (overweight mothers, smoking near the child, missing breakfast) and from a family with low income or low educational attainment, {{were more likely to be}} obese regardless of ethnicity. Feeding solid food before 3 months was associated with obesity in higher income White/European families. Even when controlling for socioeconomic status, ethnic background is an important independent risk factor for childhood obesity [Odds ratio of obesity; was 1. 7 (95 %CI: 1. 2 - 2. 3) for Asian and 2. 7 (95 %CI: 1. 9 - 3. 9) for African children, compared to White/European]. The final adjusted model suggests that increasing income does not have a great impact on lowering obesity levels, but that higher academic qualifications are associated with lower obesity levels [Odds of obesity: 0. 63 (95 %CI: 0. 52 - 0. 77) if primary <b>carer</b> <b>leaves</b> school after age 16 compared at age 16].

40|$|The {{emphasis}} {{placed on}} choice of social care provider {{means that there is}} an increasing need to furnish service users with reliable and up-to-date information on provider quality. In England, encouraging users and their <b>carers</b> to <b>leave</b> online feedback on providers is seen as one of the ways of improving the supply of information.

40|$|Many workers report {{difficulty}} in balancing {{work and family}} responsibilities and {{a critical factor in}} this difficulty is time demands. The workplace bargaining provisions and the minimal protection provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 were promoted by the Government as an opportunity to address work and family issues. This study investigates the manner in which work and family issues have been addressed in agreements registered in this industrial framework by considering two questions: (i) what evidence is there of changes to working time arrangements within selected agreements that purport to be family-friendly; and (ii) have these changes been consistent with the promotion of a family-friendly workplace? Eleven agreements that were reported by the Department of Industrial Relations as containing family-friendly provisions were selected for examination. The working time provisions contained in the contents of the agreements were compared with the parallel provisions in preexisting awards and agreements to establish whether changes had occurred. Changes to working time provisions were assessed according to whether they promoted family-friendliness. Two of the most important principles for workers with family responsibilities are the ability determine the amount and schedule of working hours and the ability to vary working hours. Workplaces can assist employees in the balance between work and family responsibilities by providing a diverse range of consistently family-friendly working time options within a family supportive workplace culture. Most agreements provide extensive evidence of changes to the amount, the schedule and the variability of working time. However, {{on the question of the}} direction of the changes, these agreements provide evidence of family-friendly changes as well as changes that detract from work and family balance. In particular, changes to provisions that concerned the amount of working time, such as part-time employment and access to <b>carer's</b> <b>leave,</b> were consistently family-friendly, while changes to schedule and variability of working time both enhanced and detracted from family-friendliness. Only two of the eleven agreements have addressed work and family issues by changing a diverse range of working time provisions in a consistently family-friendly direction within family supportive frameworks. The extent to which a lack of consistency, or a lack of diversity, or an absence of family-supportive environmental parameters, has limited the promotion of family friendliness in the other nine agreements requires further workplace investigation. Although family-friendliness has been enhanced in these agreements through changes to a broad range of working time provisions within family-supportive environmental parameters, the degree of enhancement has been tempered by changes that are not family-friendly...|$|R

Methodology: Participants in the project were {{selected on the basis of}} having a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of dementia; living at home and eligible for government funding for care in their own homes. All participants were assessed by an Occupational Therapist, and then based on this assessment of individual need and functional capacity, were prescribed individual items of AT. Findings: The results found a range of benefits including a significant reduction in the extent to which carers were worried about the client getting out of bed at night and falling following the implementation of AT. No difference was found in the ability of <b>carers</b> to <b>leave</b> the client alone at home as a result of the AT, nor any indication that AT made the clients feel safer. AT did not reduce their need for external support services (respite), in-home care (housework and /or meals). Contrary to expectations results also found that neither the levels of stress nor the frequency of stress reported by carers decreased significantly secondary to the introduction of AT. Finally carers had perceived that using the AT would enable the client to remain home longer, however this was not supported by the post AT survey. Summary: The disability support and aged care sectors have not to date taken full advantage of assistive and other relevant technologies; there is a massive unmet need for greater support and a significant level of issues that are not addressed. There are a range of potential benefits of Smart Assistive Technologies for people with dementia, their families and carers.

Methods : The study consisted of focus groups with child care workers and a survey, conducted as part of a larger study known as the Healthy Child Care Study, which focused on children. The study investigated carers working in formal child care [long day care (LDC) and family day care (FDC) ]. Results : Questionnaires to caregivers in centres showed that 86 % had taken sick leave in the previous year and 75 % of staff had taken leave for infectious illness. Carers in FDC reported that 24 % had taken sick leave in the previous year and 12 % of <b>carers</b> had taken <b>leave</b> for infectious illness.

There is a systematic age difference between the dated series from {{the two types of}} macrofossils, with ages obtained from Salix herbacea leaves being 900 to 1500 C- 14 years younger than those obtained from Carer seeds. The latter tend to be more in accord with dates from the total organic detritus in the lake sediment, although the bulk organic fraction invariably registered the older ages. Intact survival of the fragile Salix leaves indicates that they are unlikely to have been physically transferred within the sediment matrix and/or otherwise reworked from the surrounding catchment, Hence, these macrofossils are the more likely to be contemporaneous with the time of deposition, However, there is no significant correlation between measured C- 14 age and depth in the Salix values, which scatter over a range of 700 C- 14 years. In contrast, the age/depth relationship for Carer shows a significant reversal, possibly reflecting the redeposition of these macrofossils, and therefore giving radiocarbon ages that are anomalously old, The data have important implications for the dating of lake sediment sequences by AMS radiocarbon measurement of terrestrial plant macrofossils...|$|R
40|$|We {{all start}} life needy, {{dependent}} on adults for our survival. Many {{of us will}} rely on the care of others during {{the final stages of}} our lives. Between these two periods we may draw on intensive support to help us cope with illness, disability or tragedy. Our dependence is a core characteristic of our humanity, yet it is ignored or denied by dominant political and economic theories. In Australia, as in every other country, it is mostly women who provide the care of children as well as people who are sick, disabled or aged. Although there are often intrinsic rewards, unpaid care work is time consuming and limits the carer's ability to engage in other types of activities, including paid employment. The majority of employed carers are women, with their work attracting low levels of pay. Characterised by an uneven distribution of both care work and resources, the dynamics of work and family life in Australia raise important questions of justice. While the Australian work and family literature is rich in detail, it tends to be under theorised. My research helps fill this gap, providing theoretical depth and greater conceptual clarity to an ongoing and often heated public debate. Using philosophical inquiry I examine the nature of the problem of care, the way it is framed and the implications for social policy. Rejecting dominant choice and preference theories and aspects of care ethics, I find that Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach provides a more promising theory for thinking about care and gender equality. However, I raise a number of questions concerning care, responsibilities, the appropriate political goal and the ontology of capabilities. To address these issues I propose an extended and restructured capabilities list, which I test by evaluating three contentious policy issues: extended parental <b>leave,</b> <b>carer's</b> payment and shared care. I find that my revised capabilities approach provides a stronger support for justice in the way care is provided...|$|R

The {{researcher}} {{has worked}} in the field of foster care in social work for a few years in Ireland and England and during this time has seen that foster carers experience some kind of grief and loss when children leave their care. The researcher wanted to explore the emotional experience of foster carers when foster children leave their care. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the emotional experience of short–term foster carers when foster children leave their care. This research aim resulted in the following research question: “What is the emotional experience of short–term foster carers when foster children leave their care?” The researcher used a conceptual framework that focused on the Gestalt approach and foster care as background to the empirical study. A qualitative approach was used to address the research question. A case study strategy was used to explore and describe the experience of short–term foster carers when foster children leave their care. A non–probability purposive sampling technique was used and the population consisted of short–term foster carers in Oxfordshire, England, working with children in foster care. A total of nine participants took part in the study. Semi–structured one–to–one interviews were used to obtain accurate and reliable evidence of the emotional experience of foster carers when foster children leave their care. An interview schedule was used for the semi–structured interviews, which was derived from the literature review. The interview data was then transcribed and analysed. The six themes that were identified are (1) the general emotions of foster <b>carers</b> when children <b>leave</b> their care, (2) the difficulty foster carers experience to cope when a child leaves their care, (3) the experience of contact with a foster child when the child has moved on, (4) concerns that foster carers have when a foster child leaves their care, (5) the support experienced when a foster child moves on, and (6) the foster carers’ own children’s emotional experience when children v in care leave their care. From the data analysis sub–themes were identified under the main themes and were discussed according to the literature review. Conclusions were drawn for each of the six themes and sub–themes that were identified. The researcher concluded and recommended that more support, guidance, advice and input are needed for foster carers after a child leaves their care. The foster carer needs to have more of a voice and must be seen as an invaluable part of the multi–disciplinary fostering team. Improvements in the fostering system are needed to improve the emotional experience of the foster carers, but also to ultimately improve the retention of foster carers within the foster care system.
