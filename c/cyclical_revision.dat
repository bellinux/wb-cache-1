40|$|In {{the era of}} {{unravelling}} traditional {{business models}} in journalism (Downie and Schudson 2009) students {{must be prepared to}} develop the media products of the future. It has been argued that the future of journalism will be shaped by entrepreneurs who develop innovative business models and projects – either working on their own, with start [...] ‐ups, or within traditional media companies (Briggs 2011). To meet these changing demands, universities must adapt {{the way in which they}} prepare graduates with knowledge, skills and attributes to succeed in this rapidly changing world. This paper outlines a trial of the multi [...] ‐ disciplinary experiential entrepreneurship model (MEEM) with University of the Sunshine Coast journalism, business and design students. The MEEM centred on an industry innovation in the form of a Startup Weekend which enabled students, during one weekend, to create a start-up new media venture. Startup Weekends represent an international movement where nascent entrepreneurs meet and work on developing new ventures supported by business mentors, immersing themselves in the entrepreneurial process of moving an idea to market. During one weekend (54 hours), participants pitch ideas, form teams and ultimately launch companies. Startup Weekends have grown globally in recent years (Startup Weekend, 2013) and are used by leading universities in the US, such as Stanford, to provide experiential learning opportunities in entrepreneurship education (Pena, 2013). This project brings an international industry innovation, the Startup Weekend, to an Australian university context and embeds it within an educational experience, while empirically assessing its value. Overall, this paper will outline the use of design-based research as a method for evaluation, as it offered a systematic method of <b>cyclical</b> <b>revision,</b> analysis, design, development and implementation (Anderson and Shattuck, 2012). The concepts of design-based research are embedded in the practice of lean start-up entrepreneurship and as such formed the basis of not only the project development, but also the approach of venture development experience for students (Ries, 2011; Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011) ...|$|E

Traditional smooth indicators are obtained using univariate filtering procedures based on symmetric or asymmetric filters inducing serious revisions. Here, the smoothing is obtained by exploiting the information embedded in the crosssectional dimension which allows to use a very narrow window, reducing the need for revisions {{at the end of the}} sample. As a by-product, we also obtained a smooth composite leading indicator of the industrial sector, based on eleven selected leading sectors. dynamic factor models, multivariate filtering, <b>cyclical</b> indicators; end-of-sample <b>revisions.</b> ...|$|R
