25|$|Spiritism is a Christian {{philosophy}} codified in the 19th {{century by}} the French educator Allan Kardec. Spiritism teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. This basically distinguishes Spiritism from Spiritualism. According to the Spiritist doctrine, reincarnation explains {{the moral and}} intellectual differences among men. It also provides the path to man's moral and intellectual perfection by amending for his mistakes and increasing his knowledge in successive lives. For this reason Spiritism does not accept rebirth in animals as this would be retrogressive. Reincarnation is the natural method of the perfection process through which the Spirit faces countless different situations, problems and obstacles, and needs {{to learn how to}} deal with them. The central tenet of Spiritist doctrine is the belief in spiritual life. The spirit is eternal, and evolves through a series of incarnations in the material world. The true life is the spiritual one; life in the material world is just a short-termed stage, where the spirit has the opportunity to learn and develop its potentials. Reincarnation is the process where the spirit, once free in the spiritual world, <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world for further learning.|$|E

Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States. In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together; some songs were written in pairs or trios, while others were written in parts by different people, and then combined. According to the band, this brought a [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "fresh" [...] approach to songwriting. The band used different methods in putting the album together as [...] "it <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound the five of us can make together". Powderfinger guitarist Darren Middleton commented that as a rule they preferred not to put together an album that was just [...] "plain". As the style of writing differed, the band identified the need for piano performances in many of their songs, enlisting veteran pianist Benmont Tench to play parts throughout.|$|E

Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rectification}} theorem {{says that}} away from singular points the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. [...] The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space M the dynamical system is integrable. [...] In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. [...] There may be singular points in the vector field (where v(x)=0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original one. If {{the next time the}} orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.|$|E

When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s...

To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it."

2500|$|For Tillich, {{the existential}} {{questions}} {{of human existence}} {{are associated with the}} field of philosophy and, more specifically, ontology (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question of being, or what it means to be, to exist, to be a finite human being. [...] To be correlated with these questions are the theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation. [...] The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions. [...] However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich’s notion of faith as “ultimate concern” necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers. [...] Thus, {{on one side of the}} correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer. [...] This is because the Christian message claims, a priori, that the logos “who became flesh” is also the universal logos of the Greeks.|$|E
