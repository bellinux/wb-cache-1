40|$|Abstract. In Europe, the {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive WFD, in 2001, marks a strong standpoint. In addition to its objectives of a return to good chemical and good ecological status by the year 2015, it fixes the achievement of trends <b>over</b> space and <b>time.</b> The new requirements that arise from the WFD put considerable financial pressure on water management authorities. Because the overall decision-making process relies most of the time on acquired data, it puts considerable pressures on the display of high quality biological as well as chemical environmental measurements. However, performing measurements implies that i) the demonstration of their metrological traceability ii) the evidence of their achievement thanks to accurate and sensitive analytical methods and iii) their statement with a reliable estimate of expanded uncertainty is thoroughly addressed. Moreover, the measurement representativeness, especially in highly dynamic environment, is of prime interest in a context where <b>comparability</b> <b>over</b> space and <b>time</b> is needed. As a consequence, considerable challenges are dwelt on metrologists with great emphasis on parameters that are under regulation. This paper will discuss a panorama of the unavoidable metrological questions that have to be addressed: from the definition of the measurand to the final estimation of uncertainty; from the initial performances demonstration of methods to the final demonstration of mastery and capabilities through inter comparison laboratories and reference materials.

One mechanism that can be utilized for evaluating traceability is an inter-laboratory trial. This paper addresses an inter-laboratory trial conducted across a number of Australian and New Zealand isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) laboratories. The main objective of this trial was to determine whether IRMS laboratories in these countries would record comparable values for the distributed samples. Four carbon containing and four nitrogen containing compounds were distributed to seven laboratories in Australia and one in New Zealand. The laboratories were requested to analyze the samples using their standard procedures. The data from each laboratory was evaluated collectively using International Standard ISO 13528 (Statistical methods for use in proficiency testing by inter-laboratory comparisons). "Warning signals" were raised against one participant in this trial. "Action signals" requiring corrective action were raised against four participants. These participants reviewed the data and possible sources for the discrepancies. This inter-laboratory trial was successful in providing an initial snapshot of the potential for traceability between the participating laboratories. The statistical methods described in this article {{could be used as a}} model for others needing to evaluate stable isotope results derived from multiple laboratories, e. g., inter-laboratory trials/proficiency testing.

Please note that the first and second waves (1991 and 1995) are the only studies in the series currently held at the Data Archive. The 1995 dataset was originally deposited in 1999, and the 1991 data were added for the second edition of the dataset in March 2000. Main Topics : Both studies focused on general political attitudes and behaviour. Data were collected on political information and knowledge, perceptions of political bodies such as parties, and perceptions of problems and other issues. Other questions examine party identification, party preferences, feelings of political efficacy, and the nature and extent of political participation.

We show that Russia’s economy is highly dependent on imports of pharmaceutical goods and medical equipment, machinery and equipment (except nuclear reactors, fuel elements, engines and turbines), and electrical equipment.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{intuitive}} and easily implemented procedure to recover <b>comparability</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> of statistics computed using databases made incomparable {{by changes in}} survey design. Our methodology can be adopted whenever the statistic of interest satisfies a certain simple moment condition. The moment condition is satisfied by many interesting economic indicators, including {{a broad range of}} poverty and inequality measures. The procedure we propose requires the existence of a set of auxiliary variables whose reports are not affected by the different survey design, and whose relation with the main variable of interest is stable across the surveys. The adjusted estimates can be recovered by using a two-step method of moments framework. Root-n consistency follows easily under regularity conditions. Because most household surveys adopt a multi-stage design, we provide expressions for the asymptotic variance which are robust to the presence of clustering and stratification. We use our adjustment procedure to estimate poverty counts from the 55 th Round of the Indian National Sample Survey, a large household survey carried out in 1999 - 2000. Due to important changes in the adopted questionnaire the unadjusted figures are likely to understate poverty relative to the previous rounds. We provide evidence supporting the plausibility of the identifying assumptions and we conclude that most of the very large reduction in poverty implied by the unadjusted figures is realPoverty, India, Method of Moments, Household Surveys...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the long}} {{tradition}} of nationwide household travel surveys in Germany beginning in 1976 (KONTIV 1976, 1982, 1989; MiD 2002, 2008), a new survey will be conducted form June 2016 to June 2017 {{on behalf of the}} German Federal Ministry of Transport. Again, the main objective of this cross-sectional survey is to provide representative and reliable information on the country’s everyday mobility: Individual one-day trip diaries will be collected along with socio-demographic characteristics of private households (such as household composition in terms of age and gender or car ownership) and individual characteristics (such as driving licence holding or de facto car availability) that are likely to influence actual mobility behaviour. To a great extent, the methodological approach of the upcoming survey will correspond to its immediate predecessors of 2002 and 2008 to ensure extensive <b>comparability</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Nevertheless, several adjustments have been made to meet known challenges (e. g. difficult recruitment, decreasing response rates) and to serve emerging data needs (e. g. impact of multiple car ownership or innovative mobility services, importance of non-car modes, implications of demographic change and changing spatial structures). Methodological changes apply at different levels such as sampling design, survey instruments, topics and the integration of supplementary spatial data. The paper will discuss the rationale behind methodological changes as well as expected consequences throughout all survey processes such as data collection, data processing, weighting, projection and data analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study Nash equilibria in {{the context}} of flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Many results on static routing games have been {{obtained}} over the last ten years. In flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> (also called dynamic flows), flow travels through a network <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and, as a consequence, flow values on edges are time-dependent. This more realistic setting has not been tackled from the viewpoint of algorithmic game theory yet; but there is a rich literature on game theoretic aspects of flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> in the traffic community. We present a novel characterization of Nash equilibria for flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> It turns out that Nash flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> {{can be seen as a}} concatena-tion of special static flows. The underlying flow <b>over</b> <b>time</b> model is the so-called deterministic queuing model that is very popular in road traffic simulation and related fields. Based upon this, we prove the first known results on the price of anarchy for flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> ...|$|R
