50|$|The <b>clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> (S. clymene) is {{the only}} {{confirmed}} case of hybrid speciation in marine mammals, descending from the spinner dolphin (S. longirostris) and the striped dolphin (S. coeruleoalba).|$|E
50|$|<b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{spend most}} of their lives in waters over 100 m in depth, but {{occasionally}} move into shallower, coastal regions. They feed on squid and small schooling fish., hunting either at night, or in mesopelagic waters where there is only limited light. Predators include cookie-cutter sharks, as evidenced by bite marks seen on a number of animals.|$|R
50|$|Clymenes {{are fairly}} active dolphins. They do spin {{longitudinally}} when jumping {{clear of the}} water, but not with as much regularity and complexity as the spinner dolphin. They will also approach boats and ride bow waves. Group sizes vary from just four up to around 150 individuals, although about forty is typical. Many of these groups appear to be single-sex, and also to be segregated by the approximate age of the individuals. <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphins</b> are also highly vocal, making short whistles {{in a range of}} 6-19 kHz.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} only a few records from Gulf of Mexico waters beyond U. S. {{boundaries}} (e. g., Jefferson and Schiro 1997), <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphins</b> almost certainly occur throughout the oceanic Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson et al. 2008), which is also composed of waters belonging to Mexico and Cuba where there is currently little information on cetacean species abundance and distribution. U. S. waters only comprise about 40 % of the entire Gulf of Mexico, and 65 % of oceanic waters are south of the U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Gulf of Mexico population is provisionally being considered a separate stock for management purposes, although there is currently no information to differentiate this stock from the Atlantic Ocean stock(s). Additional morphological, genetic and/or behavioral data are needed to provide further information on stock delineation. POPULATION SIZE The best abundance estimate available for northern Gulf of Mexico <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphins</b> is 129 (CV= 1. 00; Table 1). This estimate is from a summer 2009 oceanic survey covering waters from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U. S. EEZ.

40|$|This paper reviews {{published}} and unpublished {{information on the}} mortality of cetaceans in gillnets in Mexico, Central America and the wider Caribbean. Data on this incidental mortality are provided from only nine of the 36 nations in the area (Colombia, the Dominican Republic. French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico. Panama, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela); the lack of mortality records from the other countries reflects poor or non-existent documentation. We surveyed those types of passive fishing gear which potentially or actually entrap cetaceans in this large area; these included gillnets with mesh sizes of 18 to 400 mm. At least 14 species of cetaceans have been caught in fishing nets in this area: vaquitas, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, tucuxis, Atlantic spotted <b>dolphins,</b> spinner <b>dolphins,</b> <b>clymene</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Risso's dolphins, killer whales, pygmy sperm whales, botos, gray whales, humpback whales and balaenopterids. At least another five species are potentially at risk: pantropical spotted dolphins, striped dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales. Of special concern is the endangered vaquita in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico...|$|R
50|$|The West African {{population}} of the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.|$|E
5000|$|The spinner dolphin is {{sometimes}} referred to as the long-snouted dolphin, particularly in older texts, to distinguish it from the similar <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> which is often called the short-snouted spinner dolphin. The species was described by John Gray in 1828. The four named subspecies are: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{was first}} {{formally}} described by John Edward Gray in 1846, although, unusually, {{he did not}} assign it its current name until four years later, in 1850. From then on, until a reassessment in 1981, the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{was regarded as a}} subspecies of the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). In 1981, Perrin et al. asserted the Clymene's existence as separate species. Until this time, because Clymenes are relatively remote and were regarded as very similar to the more accessible spinners, they were never heavily studied. Anatomical and behavioral traits suggested that this species is a hybrid of the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), and DNA testing has shown that it is indeed a hybrid species.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the larger}} marine mammals are {{species such as}} the {{endangered}} West Indian manatee and humpback whale, as well as sixteen other species of whales and dolphins, including the pantropical spotted dolphin, common bottlenose dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> spinner dolphin, striped dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin, Risso's dolphin, melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whale, false killer whale, and the short-finned pilot whale.|$|E
50|$|Many species inhabit {{specific}} latitudes, {{often in}} tropical or subtropical waters, such as Bryde's whale or Risso's dolphin. Others are {{found only in}} a specific body of water. The {{southern right whale dolphin}} and the hourglass dolphin live only in the Southern Ocean. The narwhal and the beluga live only in the Arctic Ocean. Sowerby's beaked whale and the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> exist only in the Atlantic and the Pacific white-sided dolphin and the northern straight dolphin live only in the North Pacific.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} bottlenose whale and the long-finned {{pilot whale}} are also common along the New England coast. Dolphins are common; species found along the entire coastline includes the Risso's dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, striped dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin and the common bottlenose dolphin. Dolphin species found in New England include white-beaked dolphin and Atlantic white-sided dolphin, while species roaming the southeastern parts of the coastline include the Fraser's dolphin, pantropical spotted dolphin, <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> spinner dolphin, and the rough-toothed dolphin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> is {{endemic to}} the Atlantic Ocean. Its full range is still poorly understood, {{particularly}} at its southern end. The species certainly prefers temperate and tropical waters. The {{northern end of}} the range runs roughly from New Jersey east-southeast to southern Morocco. The southern tip runs from somewhere around Angola to Rio de Janeiro. They appear to prefer deep water. Numerous sightings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The species has not been sighted, however, in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, {{a cross between}} a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, {{a cross between a}} female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.Among many other mammal crosses are hybrid camels, crosses between a bactrian camel and a dromedary. The first known instance of hybrid speciation in marine mammals was discovered in 2014. The <b>clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Stenella clymene) is a hybrid of two Atlantic species, the spinner and striped dolphins.|$|E
5000|$|The striped dolphin {{is one of}} five species {{traditionally}} {{included in}} the genus Stenella; however, recent genetic work by LeDuc et al. (1999) indicates Stenella, as traditionally conceived, is not a natural group. According to that study, the closest relatives of the striped dolphin are the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> the common dolphins, the Atlantic spotted dolphin, and [...] "Tursiops" [...] aduncus, which was formerly considered a subspecies of the bottlenose dolphin. The striped dolphin was described by Franz Meyen in 1833. The specific name coeruleoalba (from Latin caeruleus 'dark blue' and albus 'white') refers to the characteristic blue and white stripes on the flanks.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{color of}} the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> is [...] "cetacean neapolitan" [...] - it occurs in three shaded layers — the {{underside}} being white. Next, a strip of light grey runs from just above the beak, round {{either side of the}} eye back to the tail stock, where the band thickens. The top layer, from the forehead, along the back to the dorsal fin, and down {{to the top of the}} tail stock, is a dark grey. The beak, lips, and flippers are also dark grey in color. Clymene dolphins grow to about 2 m in length and 75 to 80 kg in weight.|$|E
50|$|Genetic studies {{conducted}} on Clymene dolphins (Stenella clymene) {{focused on their}} natural histories, and {{the results show that}} the origin of the species was actually an outcome of hybrid speciation. Hybridization between spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the North Atlantic was caused by constant habitat sharing of the two species. Relationships between these three species had been speculated according to notable resemblances between anatomies of the Clymene and the spinner dolphins, resulting in the former being regarded as subspecies of the latter until 1981, and the possibility of the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> as a hybrid between the spinner and the striped dolphins have come to question based on anatomical and behavioral similarities between these two species.|$|E
50|$|The striped dolphin has {{a similar}} size and shape to several other {{dolphins}} that inhabit the waters it does (see pantropical spotted dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin).</b> However, its colouring is very different and makes it relatively easy to notice at sea. The underside is blue, white, or pink. One or two black bands circle the eyes, and then run across the back, to the flipper. These bands widen to {{the width of the}} flipper which are the same size. Two further black stripes run from behind the ear — one is short and ends just above the flipper. The other is longer and thickens along the flanks until it curves down under the belly just prior to the tail stock. Above these stripes, the dolphin's flanks are coloured light blue or grey. All appendages are black, as well. At birth, individuals weigh about 10 kg (22 lb) and are up to a meter (3 feet) long. By adulthood, they have grown to 2.4 m (8 ft) (females) or 2.6 m (8.5 ft) (males) and weigh 150 kg (330 lb) (female) or 160 kg (352 lb) (male). Research suggested sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in Mediterranean females and in the Pacific at between seven and 9 years. Longevity is about 55-60 years. Gestation lasts about 12 months, with a three- or four-year gap between calving.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> is {{endemic to}} {{tropical}} and sub-tropical {{waters of the}} Atlantic (Jefferson and Curry 2003). Clymene dolphins have been commonly sighted in the Gulf of Mexico since 1990 (Mullin et al. 1994; Fertl et al. 2003), and a Gulf of Mexico stock has been designated since 1995. Four <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin</b> groups were sighted during summer 1998 in the western North Atlantic (Mullin and Fulling 2003), and two groups were sighted in the same general area during a 1999 bottlenose dolphin survey (NMFS unpublished). These sightings and stranding records (Fertl et al. 2003) indicate that this species routinely occurs in the western North Atlantic. The western North Atlantic population is provisionally being considered a separate stock for management purposes, although there is currently no information to differentiate this stock from the northern Gulf of Mexico stock(s). Additional morphological, genetic and/or behavioral data are needed to provide further information on stock delineation.

40|$|Surveys were {{undertaken}} to identify common dolphin species landed by local fishers {{in the coastal}} waters of Ghana between 1998 and 2000. Altogether, 14 out of the known 18 dolphin species in the West African sub-region were identified. They were predominated by the <b>clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Stenella clymene (35 %) followed by the pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuate (1 7 %), the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (1 6 %), and Risso 's dolphin, Grampus griseus (7 %). Although some coastal communities traditionally revere dolphins, pressure from rapid population growth and declining fish catches have currently made them immediate food need because their meat is consumed fresh or smoked. The main threats of concern are unregulated directed or accidental killing by drift gill-nets (DGN), purse seine {{and use of the}} meat as baits for catching sharks whose fins attract scarce foreign exchange. The increasing pressures from these artisanalfisheries call for en forcement of existing national conservation legislation (Wildlife Conservation Regulation, 1971 or Legislative Instrument, 685) and adoption of new measures to address the protection of dolphins. In support of this effort, some short-term and long-term interventions needed to protect the dolphins are discussed for their conservation because they are considered a potential source of eco-tourism "dolphin-watching"...|$|E
40|$|The Gulf of Mexico (GMx) is a {{subtropical}} {{marginal sea}} {{of the western}} North Atlantic Ocean with a diverse cetacean community. Ship-based, line-transect abundance surveys were conducted in oceanic waters (> 200 m deep) of the northern GMx within U. S. waters (380, 432 square km) during summer 2003 and spring 2004. Data from these surveys were pooled and minimum abundance estimates were based on 10, 933 km of effort and 433 sightings of at least 17 species. The most commonly sighted species (number of groups) were pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata (115); sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus (85); dwarf/pygmy sperm whale, Kogia sima/breviceps (27); Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus (26); and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (26). The most abundant species (number of individuals; coefficient of variation) were S. attenuata (34, 067; 0. 18); <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> S. clymene (6, 575; 0. 36); T. truncatus (3, 708; 0. 42); and striped dolphin, S. coeruleoalba (3, 325; 0. 48). The only large whales sighted were P. macrocephalus (1, 665; 0. 20) and Bryde’s whale, Balaenoptera edeni (15; 1. 98). Abundances for other species or genera ranged from 57 to 2, 283 animals. Cetaceanswere sighted throughout the oceanic northern GMx, and whereas many species were widely distributed, some had more regional distributions. Compared to abundance estimates for this area based on 1996 - 2001 surveys, the estimate for S. attenuata was significantly smaller (P < 0. 05) and that for the spinner dolphin, S. longirostris, appeared much smaller. Also, P. macrocephalus estimates were based on less negatively biased estimates of group-size using 90 -minute counts during 2003 and 2004...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act {{requires}} that the abundance of marine mammals in U. S. waters be assessed. Because this requirement had not been met for {{a large portion of}} the North Atlantic Ocean (U. S. waters south of Maryland), a ship-based, line-transect survey was conducted with a 68 m research ship between Maryland (38. 00 °N) and central Florida (28. 00 °N) from the 10 -m isobath to the boundary of the U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The study area (573, 000 km 2) was surveyed between 8 July and 17 August 1998. Minimum abundance estimates were based on 4163 km of effort and 217 sightings of at least 13 cetacean species and other taxonomic categories. The most commonly sighted species (number of groups) were bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (38); sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus (29); Atlantic spotted dolphins, Stenella frontalis (28); and Risso’s dolphins, Grampus griseus (22). The most abundant species (abundance; coeffi cient of variation) were Atlantic spotted dolphins (14, 438; 0. 63); bottlenose dolphins (13, 085; 0. 40); pantropical spotted dolphins, S. attenuate (12, 747; 0. 56); striped dolphins, S. coeruleoalba (10, 225; 0. 91); and Risso’s dolphins (9533; 0. 50). The abundance estimate for the <b>Clymene</b> <b>dolphin,</b> S. clymene (6086; 0. 93), is the first for the U. S. Atlantic Ocean. Sperm whales were the most abundant large whale (1181; 0. 51).
