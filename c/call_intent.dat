40|$|Abstract—In the Android {{operating}} system, each application {{consists of}} a set of components that communicate with each other via messages <b>called</b> <b>Intents.</b> The current implementation of Intent handling is such that developers can inadvertently write insecure code that allows malicious applications to intercept or inject Intents to steal sensitive information or induce undesired behavior. We prevented these exploits by modifying Android’s Intent handling behavior {{to err on the side}} of safety except where the developer seems to explicitly specify otherwise. Additonally, we confirmed the pervasiveness of Intent vulnerabilities by analyzing the 497 most popular free applications in Android’s official application market, and proved the effectiveness of our modifications by manually verifying that they closed a substantial number of the security holes we identified.

30|$|Each {{software}} application running on Android powered devices consists of application components that {{communicate with each}} other to support application’s functionality for enhanced user experience of mobile computing. Application components inside Android system {{communicate with each other}} using inter-component communication mechanism based on messages <b>called</b> <b>intents.</b> An android application crashes if it invokes an intent that can not be received by (or resolved to) any application on the device. Application crashes represent a severe fault that relates to compromised users’ experience, consequently resulting in decreased ratings, usage trends and revenues for such applications. To address this issue—by formally proving crash-safety property of Android applications—we have defined a formal model of Android inter-component communication using Coq theorem prover. The mathematical model defined in theorem prover allows one to prove the properties of inter-component communication system and check the correctness of the proof in an automated way. To demonstrate the significance of the formal model developed, we carried proof of crash-safety of Android applications using Coq tool. The proposed solution named CrashSafe supports a formal approach that enables one to (i) check the correctness of inter-component communication in Android systems and (ii) establish a formal foundation for other tools to assess Android applications’ reliability and safety.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Feature-based {{representation}} validation seeks to find means to verify feature-based representations {{in order to}} guarantee that feature's expected behaviours are met and that applications that use the representation {{can be sure of}} the correctness of the feature-related data. To achieve this, a clear definition of features and their behaviour is needed but cannot be found in the literature. Instead of proposing yet another feature definition, an attempt was made to define some basic common-sense characteristics for (prismatic) features that could be tested, analysed and manipulated. These characteristics are <b>called</b> <b>Intents</b> because features are said to be the carriers of designer's intents. Feature-based Designer's Intents (DI's) proved to be essential to the validation framework because they define the scope of the Feature-based Modelling (FBM) utilisation. Also, some DI's establish clearly the geometric-dependent behaviour of features and were found to be closely related to validation. A prototype system called FRIEND, an acronym to Feature-based Reasoning system for Intent-driven ENgineering Design, was implemented to perform feature-based representation validation. This paper details Designer's Intents (DI's) in the context of deign-by-feature representation validation, presents Morphological Functional and Volumetrical DI's, their semantics and their priority organisation inside the validation mechanism, as it was implemented within FRIEND...|$|R

30|$|Inter-component {{communication}} {{is the major}} mechanism for Android applications to share data and services with each other through messages <b>called</b> <b>intents.</b> An Android application crashes if it invokes an intent that cannot be received by any application on the phone. Application failures frustrates users and push them towards competitors, therefore, developers need to test their applications before deployment to avoid unpredictable behaviour and crashes at runtime. The official documentation for inter-component {{communication is}} not rigorous and hence can not be precisely studied, interpreted and used to reason about inter-component communication. In this paper, a formal model of the inter-component communication, dubbed as CrashSafe, was built in theorem prover Coq. The formal developments include formal definition of intents, applications (modelled as intent filters) and definitions of conditions to receive messages. The formal notations were used to encode simplified versions of an Email and a Browser application and it was proved the Email application can safely request the Browser application to open a web page in a tab. The formal model, in addition, was used in proving the correctness of the intent broadcasts. The formal model CrashSafe enables one to (i) check the correctness of inter-component communication in Android systems and (ii) establishes a formal foundation for other tools to assess Android applications’ reliability and safety, {{while at the same}} time it is simple to understand and use as formal specification. The widespread use of Android in the global market makes our formal developments useful for most of the mobile device users.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{problems}} found {{in the scientific community}} of assistive / rehabilitation robotics nowadays is that of automatically detecting what a disabled subject (for instance, a hand amputee) wants to do, exactly when she wants to do it and strictly for the time she wants to do it. This problem, commonly <b>called</b> <b>intent</b> detection, has traditionally been tackled using surface electromyography, a technique which suffers from a number of drawbacks, including the changes in the signal induced by sweat and muscle fatigue. With the advent of realistic, physically plausible augmented- and virtual-reality environments for rehabilitation, this approach does not suffice anymore. In this paper we explore a novel method to solve the problem, that we call Optical Myography (OMG). The idea is to visually inspect the human forearm (or stump) to reconstruct what fingers are moving and to what extent. In a psychophysical experiment involving ten intact subjects, we used visual fiducial markers (AprilTags) and a standard web-camera to visualize the deformations of the surface of the forearm, which then were mapped to the intended finger motions. As ground truth, a visual stimulus was used, avoiding the need for finger sensors (force/position sensors, datagloves, etc.). Two machine-learning approaches, a linear and a non-linear one, were comparatively tested in settings of increasing realism. The results indicate an average error in the range of 0. 05 to 0. 22 (root mean square error normalized over the signal range), in line with similar results obtained with more mature techniques such as electromyography. If further successfully tested in the large, this approach could lead to vision-based intent detection of amputees, with the main application of letting such disabled persons dexterously and reliably interact in an augmented- / virtual-reality setup...|$|R

40|$|Testing is {{a crucial}} stage in the {{software}} development process {{that is used to}} uncover bugs and potential security threats. If not conducted thoroughly, buggy software may cause erroneous, malicious and even harmful behavior. Unfortunately in most software systems, testing is either completely neglected or not thoroughly conducted. One such example is Google's popular mobile platform, Android OS, where inter-application communication is not properly tested. This is because of the difficulty which it possesses in the development overhead and the manual labour required by developers in setting up the testing environment. Consequently, the lack of Android application testing continues to cause Android users to experience erroneous behavior and sudden crashes, impacting user experience and potentially resulting in financial losses. When a caller application attempts to communicate with a potentially buggy application, the caller application will suffer functional errors or it may even potentially crash. Incidentally, the user will complain that the caller application is not providing the promised functionality, resulting in a devaluation of the application's user rating. Successive failures will no longer be considered as isolated events, potentially crippling developer credibility of the calling application. In this thesis we present an automated tester for inter-application communication in Android applications. The approach used for testing is <b>called</b> <b>Intent</b> based Testing. Android applications are typically divided into multiple components that communicate via intents: messages passed through Android OS to coordinate operations between the different components. Intents are also used for inter-application communication, rendering them relevant for security. In this work, we designed and built a fully automated tool called IntentFuzzer, to test the stability of inter-application communication of Android applications using intents. Firstly, it statically analyzes the application to generate intents. Next, it tests the inter-application communication by fuzzing them, that is, injecting random input values that uncover unwanted behavior. In this way, we are able to expose several new defects including potential security issues which we discuss briefly in the Evaluation section...|$|R
