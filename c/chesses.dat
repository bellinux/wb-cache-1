O desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias que possam contribuir para seu aprimoramento representa uma alternativa de inovação no mercado de produtos lácteos. Este trabalho objetivou caracterizar queijo minas frescal elaborado com leite de cabra (QMC), leite de vaca (QMV) e sua mistura (QMM) quanto aos parâmetros nutricionais, tecnológicos e sensoriais durante 21 dias de armazenamento refrigerado. Os queijos foram submetidos às análises microbiológicas, físico-químicas, proteólise, cor e textura instrumental, perfil de ácidos graxos e análise sensorial. O rendimento do processo de obtenção dos queijos e sua composição química não foram influenciados pelo tipo de leite empregado (P > 0, 05), exceto o conteúdo de lactose (P 0. 05), {{excepted}} the lactose content (P < 0. 05).

Texture analysis demonstrated a decrease in hardness values for all cheeses during the refrigerated storage. Color assay revealed the high lightness (L*) and the prevalence of the yellow component (b*) for the cheeses. The highest values (P < 0. 05) of caprylic acid (C 8 : 0), capric acid (C 10 : 0), oleic acid (C 18 : 1 n 9 cis) and linolenic acid (C 18 : 2 n 6 cis) were observed in CGM and CCGM.

40|$|In {{order to}} control the {{sanitary}} quality of raw milk cheeses, this thesis aimed to determine if and how the microbial populations of raw milks could act as a barrier against Listeria monocytogenes in a Saint-Nectaire cheese type technology. The comparison of SSCP profiles of <b>chesses</b> with and without development of L monocytogenes allowed to identify the peaks of Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus. garvieae, Enterococcus saccharominimus, Enterococcus faecium Chryseobacterium sp. and Corynebacterium flavescens only dominant in the microbial profiles of inhibitory cheeses. Lc. lactis {{appeared to be the}} most inhibitory in cheeses at the beginning of ripening by lactic acid production. The inventory of the populations of the most inhibitory raw milk allowed to reconstitute a community of 32 species divided into 4 groups: lactic bacteria, Gram positive non lactic bacteria, Gram negative bacteria and yeasts. The application of the SSCP technique, on the DNA extracted from cheeses or from the microbial communities cultivated on various media, was insufficient to evaluate the establishment of all the microbial populations and to highlight interactions between them. However, by successive omission of the microbial groups of this community, it was shown that the group of the lactic bacteria (Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc) acted in synergy with the Gram positive non lactic bacteria in L. monocytogenes inhibition. The role of the yeasts in the inhibition would be less and the Gram negative bacteria would not intervene. During the ripening, the inhibition would be rather allotted to the production of organic acids (Dlactate, acetate), of alcohols (1 -pentanol, 2 -propanol, 2 -butanol) and some esters (ethyl formate, ethyl acetate). L'objectif était de déterminer si et comment les populations microbiennes des laits crus pouvaient faire barrière à Listeria monocytogenes dans un fromage à pâte pressée non cuite. La comparaison des profils SSCP de fromages avec et sans développement de L. monocytogenes a permis d'identifier les pics de Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus saccharominimus, Enterococcus faecium, Chryseobacterium sp. et Corynebacterium flavescens dominants dans les profils des fromages inhibiteurs. Lc. lactis s'est révélée le plus inhibiteur en fromages par production d'acide lactique en début d'affinage. L'inventaire des populations du lait cru le plus inhibiteur a permis de reconstituer une communauté de 32 espèces. Par omission successive de groupes microbiens constituant cette communauté, il a été montré que les bactéries lactiques agissaient en synergie avec les bactéries à Gram positifs non lactiques dans l'inhibition. Le rôle des levures serait moindre et les bactéries à Gram négatif n'interviendraient pas. En cours d'affinage, l'inhibition serait plutôt attribuée à la production d'acides organiques, d'alcools et de certains ester...|$|E
40|$|Defects in {{commercial}} cheese {{result in a}} downgrading of the final cheese and a consequential economic loss to the cheese producer. Developments of defects in cheese are often not fully understood and therefore not controllable by the producer. This research investigated the underlying factors {{in the development of}} split and secondary fermentation defect and of pinking defects {{in commercial}} Irish cheeses. Split defect in Swiss-type cheese is a common defect associated with eye formation and manifests as slits and cracks visible in the cut cheese loaf (Reinbold, 1972; Daly et al., 2010). No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defect and possible factors which may contribute to the defect were reviewed. Models were derived to describe the relationship between moisture, pH, and salt levels and the distance from sample location to the closest external block surface during cheese ripening. Significant gradients within the cheese blocks were observed for all measured parameters in cheeses at 7 day post/after manufacture. No significant pH gradient was found within the blocks on exit from hot-room ripening and at three months post exit from the hot-room. Moisture content reached equilibrium within the blocks between exit from hot-room and 3 months after exit from hot-room while salt and salt-to-moisture levels had not reached equilibrium within the cheese blocks even at three months after exit from hot-room ripening. A characterisation of Swiss-type cheeses produced from a seasonal milk supply was undertaken. Cheeses were sampled on two days per month of the production year, at three different times during the manufacturing day, at internal and external regions of the cheese block and at four ripening time points (7 days post manufacture, post hot-room, 14 days post hot-room and 3 months in a cold room after exit from hot-room). Compositional, biochemical and microbial indices were determined, and the results were analysed as a splitplot with a factorial arrangement of treatments (season, time of day, area) on the main plot and ripening time on the sub-plot. Season (and interactions) had a significant effect on pH and salt-in-moisture levels (SM), mean viable counts of L. helveticus, propionic acid and non-starter lactic acid bacteria, levels of primary and secondary proteolysis and cheese firmness. Levels of proteolysis increased significantly during hot-room ripening but also during cold room storage, signifying continued development of cheese ripening during cold storage (> 8 °C). Rheological parameters (e. g. springiness and cohesiveness) were significantly affected by interactions between ripening and location within cheese blocks. Time of day of manufacture significantly affected mean cheese calcium levels at 7 days post manufacture and mean levels of arginine and mean viable counts of NSLAB. Cheeses produced {{during the middle of the}} production day had the best grading scores and were more consistent compared to cheeses produced early or late during day of manufacture. Cheeses with low levels of S/M and low values of resilience were associated with poor grades at 7 days post manufacture. <b>Chesses</b> which had high elastic index values and low values of springiness in the external areas after exit from hot-room ripening also obtained good commercial grades. Development of a pink colour defect is an intermittent defect in ripened cheese which may or may not contain an added colourant, e. g., annatto. Factors associated with the defect were reviewed. Attempts at extraction and identification of the pink discolouration were unsuccessful. The pink colour partitioned with the water insoluble protein fraction. No significant difference was observed between ripened control and defect cheese for oxygen levels and redox potential or for the results of elemental analysis. A possible relationship between starter activity and defect development was established in cheeses with added coulourant, as lower levels of residual galactose and lactose were observed in defective cheese compared to control cheese free of the defect. Swiss-type cheese without added colourant had significantly higher levels of arginine and significantly lower lactate levels. Flow cell cytometry indicated that levels of bacterial cell viability and metabolic state differed between control and defect cheeses (without added colourant). Pyrosequencing analysis of cheese samples with and without the defect detected the previously unreported bacteria in cheese, Deinococcus thermus (a potential carotenoid producer). Defective Swiss-type cheeses had elevated levels of Deinococcus thermus compared to control cheeses, however the direct cause of pink was not linked to this bacterium alone. Overall, research was undertaken on underlying factors associated with the development of specific defects in commercial cheese, but also characterised the dynamic changes in key microbial and physicochemical parameters during cheese ripening and storage. This will enable the development of processing technologies to enable seasonal manipulation of manufacture protocols to minimise compositional and biochemical variability and to reduce and inhibit the occurrence of specific quality defects...|$|E
