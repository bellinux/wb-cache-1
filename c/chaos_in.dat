5|$|Amid rising tensions, the {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} began staging a series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, and even a hunger strike. This led to <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.|$|E

5|$|Charles of Bavaria needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their troops into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had {{taken advantage of the}} <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.|$|E
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a {{creature}} named Chaos from a huge gem called the Master Emerald. The animals fight {{a losing battle}} to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and <b>Chaos</b> <b>in</b> the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria. An army was assembled in Susa, and marched into Cilicia, where a fleet had been gathered. Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>chaos</b> {{synchronization}} <b>in</b> complex networks with time-invariant, time-varying and switching configurations {{based on the}} matrix measure of complex matrices. To begin with, we propose an analytical condition for <b>chaos</b> synchronization. <b>in</b> complex networks with a time-invariant configuration. Secondly, we obtain some less conservative synchronization conditions for networks with a time-varying configuration. Thirdly, we consider <b>chaos</b> synchronization <b>in</b> networks with time-average and switching configurations. If complex subnetworks satisfy certain conditions, the networks with time-average and switching configurations are M-synchronizable. At last, we analyze the nonsynchronizability of complex networks. <b>Chaos</b> synchronization <b>in</b> complex networks can't be realized if the coupling configuration and the inner-coupling matrix satisfy certain conditions. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed synchronization criteria...|$|R

Walter's voice is heard on the tape, as is William Bell's. Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It becomes clear Olivia has caused this <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.|$|E

5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M.F. Bowers wired the {{governor}} and requested {{the intervention of the}} state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard). Governor Davis H. Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T.J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood assured him that union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E

Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to <b>chaos.</b> <b>In</b> practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E

5|$|Since Humphrey (VI) {{was only}} {{sixteen years old}} at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the Marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the {{meanwhile}} given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> England to extend his territory into the Marches.|$|E
5|$|The country {{fell into}} <b>chaos.</b> <b>In</b> Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king {{did not trust}} any of them, {{and he and his}} court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the {{presence}} of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma (Pegu and Martaban) was in open revolt.|$|E
5|$|Unable to trap Lafayette, the British marched from Philadelphia toward New York; the Continental Army, {{including}} Lafayette, {{followed and}} finally attacked at Monmouth Courthouse, in central New Jersey. At Monmouth, Washington appointed General Charles Lee {{to lead the}} attacking force. On 28 June, Lee moved against the British flank; however, soon after fighting began, he gave conflicting orders, causing <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> the American ranks. Lafayette {{sent a message to}} Washington to urge him to the front; upon his arrival he found Lee's men in retreat. Washington relieved Lee, took command, and rallied the American force. After suffering significant casualties at Monmouth, the British withdrew in the night, and successfully reached New York.|$|E

Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|While the WRO {{continues}} {{to fight the}} remnants of Deepground, Vincent transforms into <b>Chaos</b> <b>in</b> {{a desperate attempt to}} defeat Omega Weiss. Shelke dives inside Omega to find Lucrecia's Protomateria, and upon finding it, she gives it to Vincent, also telling him that his survival made Lucrecia happy. Vincent then takes control of Chaos and battles Omega. Omega sprouts wings and tries to ascend from the planet, but Vincent manages to destroy it, disappearing in the process. A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave.

He is then found by Shelke outside the cave, and she tells him that everyone else is waiting for him.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause <b>chaos</b> <b>in</b> the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
