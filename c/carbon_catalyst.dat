From the XPS-N 1 s analysis, the introduction of the melamine-based polymer positively contributes to the nitrogen doping content and formation of a graphitic-N and pyridinic-N, which is known to be an active site for the ORR.

Solar cracking of methane provides an excellent example of the direct effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> on the heat transfer which in turn affects the feedstock decomposition rate. In this paper, a compilation of our research results on the testing of <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> using thermogravimetry, and its impact on the heat transfer are summarized along with a thorough kinetics analysis of methane decomposition. It is seen that carbon seeding uniforms the reactor temperature and the volumetric heating caused by the suspended carbon particles substantially improves the reactor performance. 37 chemical gas-phase reactions and rate constants were considered to simulate the non-catalyzed methane cracking, whereas 8 chemical surface reactions and rate constants were considered for methane cracking with <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst.</b> As for the heat transfer analysis, thermal interaction of gas-particle flow and the thermal hydraulics between gas flow and particle were studied by two way coupled Euler-Lagrange approach.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the preparation of carbon–based catalyst produced from biochar formed via intermediate pyrolysis and post–reforming during the thermo–catalytic reforming (TCR®) process. The report is split into two sections; part one is a literature survey that details the preparation and characterisation methods for carbon–based catalysts as well as the possible industrial applications for the catalysts. The second part is the experimental section, presenting the materials and methodologies as well as the results and discussions. Initially, eight biochars were characterised using various techniques and out of them, three biochars i. e. olive stone, digestate and corn stover were selected for the preparation of the carbon–based catalysts. Digestate derived biochar showed highest BET specific surface area of 104. 31 m 2 g– 1 with the lowest pore size and total pore volume of 0. 14 µm and 0. 81 cm 3 g– 1. The corn stover derived biochar showed the lowest BET specific surface area of 1. 06 m 2 g– 1, whereas olives stones derived biochar showed BET specific surface area of 46. 42 m 2 g– 1. The Van Krevelen plot depicted that the digestate derived biochar had the highest aromatic characteristic compare to all the biochars, which was then followed by olive stones and later comes corn stover derived biochars. All three selected biochars showed good thermal stability under inert and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, several mineral components were detected and measured in the biochars by ICP–MS analysis and the presence of these elemental components was also complemented through x–ray diffraction analysis. The x–ray diffractograms displayed the amorphous phase and mineral crystals present in the biochars. Carbon–based catalysts were prepared by applying a chemical activation process, using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as activating agent. The characterisation of activated <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> showed that olives stones derived activated <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> experienced the highest growth in the BET specific surface area of 121. 17 m 2 g– 1; whereas corn stover derived biochar developed the lowest BET specific surface area of 14. 56 m 2 g– 1. The digestate derived activated <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> had the largest BET specific surface area of 146. 64 m 2 g– 1. Thermal stability of the activated <b>carbon</b> <b>catalyst</b> was found to be reduced as compared to their precursors.

30|$|Oxygen {{reduction}} reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for {{proton exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention {{because of their}} sluggish kinetic process [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. To date, platinum (Pt)-loaded carbon is considered as the most effective ORR electrocatalyst [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, Pt-based catalysts still have several shortcomings, such as poor durability, limited reserves, high cost, and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning [10, 11]. Currently, metal-free heteroatom-doped carbons are widely considered as promising catalysts to replace Pt-based <b>carbon</b> <b>catalysts</b> {{in the near future}} because of their high electrocatalytic activity toward ORR, cost effectiveness, long-term cycling stability, and excellent tolerance to methanol and CO oxidations [12, 13]. Among these materials, nitrogen (N)-doped carbons are extensively studied because the electronegativity of N (3.04) induces charge redistribution of adjacent atoms in an N-doped carbon surface layer, which greatly enhances the ORR activity of carbon electrocatalysts [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Besides N, other nonmetal atoms with different electronegativities, such as boron (B) [19, 20], sulfur (S) [21, 22], phosphorus (P) [23, 24], and fluorine (F) [25, 26, 27, 28, 29], can enhance the ORR activity of <b>carbon</b> <b>catalysts.</b>|$|R
