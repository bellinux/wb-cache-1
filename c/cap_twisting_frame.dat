What will be remembered most by viewers is the way the film jump cuts effortlessly between the seemingly primary melodrama and scenes of so-called 'social realism'. At first the cuts are employed between bourgeois and working class milieus, but later more abstract associations will be made. It’s apparent that our pair of privileged sinners lie totally outside of 'social reality': when their sports-car hits the cyclist we do not see his <b>twisted</b> <b>frame,</b> only the <b>twisted</b> <b>frame</b> of the bicycle, and the reactions of Juan and María José.

The properties of loop and frotte fancy yarns, woven and knitted fabrics are compared in this article in order to find out the optimal yarn’s and fabric’s production condition to satisfy the final user and maintain low production costs.

40|$|New {{results on}} the groundstate energy of tight, {{magnetic}} knots are presented. Magnetic knots are defined as tubular embeddings of the magnetic field in an ideal, perfectly conducting, incompressible fluid. An orthogonal, curvilinear coordinate system is introduced and the magnetic energy {{is determined by the}} poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field. Standard minimization of the magnetic energy is carried out under the usual assumptions of volume- and flux-preserving flow, with the additional constraints that the tube cross-section remains circular and that the knot length (ropelength) is independent from internal field <b>twist</b> (<b>framing).</b> Under these constraints the minimum energy is determined analytically by a new, exact expression, function of ropelength and framing. Groundstate energy levels of tight knots are determined from ropelength data obtained by the SONO tightening algorithm developed by Pieranski (Pieranski, 1998) and collaborators. Results for torus knots are compared with previous work done by Chui & Moffatt (1995), and the groundstate energy spectrum of the first prime knots (up to 10 crossings) is presented and analyzed in detail. These results demonstrate that ropelength and framing determine the spectrum of magnetic knots in tight configuration. Comment: 26 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the first non-vanishing Milnor invariants of a classical link and the intersection invariant of a twisted Whitney tower. This is a certain 2 -complex in the 4 -ball, built from immersed disks bounded by the given link in the 3 -sphere together with finitely many `layers' of Whitney disks. The intersection invariant is a higher-order generalization of the intersection number between two immersed disks in the 4 -ball, well known to give the linking number of the link on the boundary, which measures intersections among the Whitney disks and the disks bounding the given link, together with information that measures the <b>twists</b> (<b>framing</b> obstructions) of the Whitney disks. This interpretation of Milnor invariants as higher-order intersection invariants {{plays a key role in}} the classifications of both the <b>framed</b> and <b>twisted</b> Whitney tower filtrations on link concordance (as sketched in this paper). Here we show how to realize the higher-order Arf invariants, which also play a role in the classifications, and derive new geometric characterizations of links with vanishing Milnor invariants of length less than or equal to 2 k.

40|$|Decomposing {{a volume}} into {{high-quality}} hexahedral cells is a challenging task in finite element simulations and computer graphics. Inspired {{by the use}} of a spatial <b>twist</b> continuum and <b>frame</b> field in previous hexahedral mesh generation methods, we present a method of hexahedral mesh generation via constrained quadrilateralization that combines a spatial <b>twist</b> continuum and <b>frame</b> fields. Given a volume represented by a tetrahedral mesh, surface quadrilateral mesh and frame field, we first extend the loop of the surface of a solid to a layer of hexahedral elements, then divide the solid into two smaller sub-solids by the layer, and finally handle them recursively until all of the sub-solids are empty. In our hexahedral mesh generation framework, we apply constrained quadrilateralization to extend the loop to a layer of hexahedral elements. The "divide-and-conquer" strategy used in this method is suitable for parallelization. This method can potentially lead to easier and more robust implementations that are more parallelizable and less dependent on heavy numerical libraries. The testing results show that the quality of the meshes generated by this method is similar to those produced by current state-of-the-art mesh generation methods...|$|R
