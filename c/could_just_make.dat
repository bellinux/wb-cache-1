2500|$|After {{the conference}} Chauvel ordered the Australian Mounted Division to {{ride back to}} Karm in the {{afternoon}} to ease the water at Beersheba. The division's horses had had their last proper drink at Khalasa on 30 October, as the water supply at Asluj and Beersheba had been restricted. As all the tents had been pulled down the previous day {{in preparation for a}} move, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance did dressings outside during the morning. Orders were received a noon and after lunch the field ambulance, {{along with the rest of}} their brigade rode out at 14:00 back to Karm where they arrived at 22:00. It was a [...] "terrible ride in the dust ... direct through Beersheba and Buggar. The dust was so thick you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> out the camel ahead and follow on. We lost the Brigade and camped for the night at Karm." [...] The Australian Mounted Divisional Train (less the 5th Mounted Brigade's 38 Coy but with 7th Mounted Brigade Train), reached Karm at 23:00 after leaving Beersheba at 16:00.|$|E

5000|$|In a nine-month {{project as}} part of his MA course, Thwaites {{attempted}} to build a toaster from scratch. The project was inspired by a quote from Douglas Adams' 1992 novel Mostly Harmless: [...] "Left to his own devices he couldn't build a toaster. he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> about <b>make</b> a sandwich, and that was it." [...] A toaster has about 400 components: he simplified the materials list to copper, steel, plastic, mica and nickel and attempted to mine, refine, and otherwise process all the raw materials needed. He published The Toaster Project: Or a Heroic Attempt to Build a Simple Electric Appliance from Scratch (Princeton Architectural Press, 2011: [...] ), and gave a TED talk [...] "How I Built a Toaster - From Scratch".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cope {{knew him}} too well not to feel, {{as he wrote}} the ticket, that {{there were very few}} of whom he could so entirely from his heart say 'Examined and APPROVED,' as the poor lonely outcast foundling, Paul Blackthorn, who could not even tell whether he were fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen, but <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> sure that he had once been caned by old Mr. Haynes, who went away from the Union twelve years ago.|$|E
60|$|The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, {{lifted the}} latch {{of the door}} {{somewhat}} nervously.

In particular, because of the 'materiality' of the Smart Home one <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a beta version available on the web, but {{an essential part of the}} development process is also to visit the 'beta' users in their home, to build trust, to face the real world issues and provide assistance to make the Smart Home work for them.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with 60 Minutes, Soghanalian stated that top-level American officials were aware {{from the beginning of}} his deals in Iraq. These included former U.S. President Richard Nixon, former Vice-President Spiro Agnew, Nixon's chief of staff Colonel Jack Brennan and attorney general John N. Mitchell. Encouraged by other senior officials, Nixon had written a letter on his behalf to expedite the sale of the uniforms to Iraq. Soghanalian remarked that [...] "They were not only in the uniform business. They would sell their mothers if they <b>could,</b> <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> the money." [...] He also predicted that the ensuing war between Coalition troops and Iraq would turn into a lengthy and costly conflict, much like the Iran-Iraq War. This assertion ultimately proved incorrect as Coalition troops rapidly ejected the Iraqi army from Kuwait in February 1991.|$|R

60|$|They {{found the}} hollow under the cliff {{to be less}} than two yards deep and of about the same width. The rocks {{overhead}} hung down so that they touched Dave's head. In front was a small snowdrift, looking over which father and son <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> out the two bears, as they squatted on the ground between the firs.

But the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what it would have been had he been this particular hunted man. He held his breath; he clenched his teeth; he pressed a quieting hand upon his horse. Suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted. They were whispering. He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> out a dark group closely massed. What had made them halt so suspiciously? ...|$|E
60|$|An hour elapsed {{before any}} {{movement}} was visible.

The boat they were following again passed under the Ponto Maggiore, and for some distance followed the line of the Grand Canal.|$|E
40|$|It {{hardly seems}} like a year has passed since the last grain harvest and quality briefing. Last year we had very dry grain, thanks to warm dry weather after a summer of warm nights and {{accelerated}} plant development. In 2011, the weather <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> up its mind – wet, moderate, hot but humid, moderate and dry, and then rain and storms. The net result is that average exists as a mathematical term but probably not on anyone’s farm...|$|R
5000|$|The Yardbirds' {{first attempt}} to record [...] "Heart Full of Soul" [...] was on 13 April 1965 at Advision Studios in London. [...] The session began with the sitar player playing the {{distinctive}} instrumental hook or riff. [...] However, he was unfamiliar {{with the type of}} rock sound the group was trying to achieve"It just didn't have any groove to it", Beck felt. [...] McCarty added: [...] "It was fine in principle, but while the tablas sounded OK, the sitar just wasn't up front enough. It just didn't cut through." [...] Beck developed a riff on guitar to replace the sitar line. He elaborated in an interview: The sitar player couldn't get the 4/4 time signature right; it was a hopeless waste of time. So I said, 'Look, is this the figure?' I had the fuzz machine, a Toneblender, going. We did one take, it sounded outrageous. So they kept the tabla player, who <b>could</b> <b>just</b> about <b>make</b> it work. They rushed that out, and the rest was a rollercoaster ride.|$|R
2500|$|During her husband's 1992 presidential campaign, Barbara Bush {{stated that}} {{abortion}} and homosexuality are personal matters {{and argued that}} the Republican Party platform should not {{take a stand on}} it, saying that [...] "The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, platforms and conventions." [...] Her personal views on abortion were not known, although her friends reported at that time that she [...] "privately supported abortion rights." [...] She explained, [...] "I hate abortions, but I <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> that choice for someone else." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} the dam the fox stopped. Sparrer <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> him {{out through}} the tangled screen of brush. For a moment he stood motionless. It seemed to the boy like adding insult to injury. Then with a long graceful leap he landed on the snow of the swamp. A sudden hope caused Sparrer to instinctively tighten his grip on the rifle and catch his breath. Perhaps the fox would come his way! If he should, well, he would at least find a true Scout--he would be prepared.|$|E
6000|$|Midway up I {{checked and}} looked back across the wide water. The light had grown quite strong by now, and in the east there was a faint pink flush to herald the {{approaching}} sun. Away beyond the river, moving southward, I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> out the Legate's little cavalcade. And then, for the first time, a question leapt in my mind concerning the litter whose leathern curtains had remained so closely drawn. Whom did it contain? Could it be Giuliana?

60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} I was {{crouched}} in some thick underbrush looking {{up into a}} great spruce, when I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> out the leader standing by an upright branch in sharp silhouette against the glowing west. I had followed his swift flight, and now lay listening again to his searching call as it went out through the twilight, calling his little flock to the roosting tree. From the swamp and the hillside and far down by the quiet lake they answered, faintly at first, then with clearer call and the whirr of swift wings as they came in.|$|E
60|$|He moved forward. A {{few steps}} {{took him to}} the doorway. The chamber before him was darker than the corridor, so that he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> indistinctly <b>make</b> out the objects in the room. He saw a {{sleeping}} dais near the center, with a darker blotch of something lying on the marble floor beside it. He moved a step farther into the doorway and the scabbard of his sword scraped against the stone frame. To his horror he saw the sleeping silks and furs upon the central dais move. He saw a figure slowly arising to a sitting posture from the death bed of O-Mai the Cruel. His knees shook, but he gathered all his moral forces, and gripping his sword more tightly in his trembling fingers prepared to leap across the chamber upon the horrid apparition. He hesitated just a moment. He felt eyes upon him--ghoulish eyes that bored through the darkness into his withering heart--eyes that he could not see. He gathered himself for the rush--and then there broke from the thing upon the couch an awful shriek, and O-Tar sank senseless to the floor.|$|R
500|$|This was {{the first}} episode to air which was {{executive}} produced by Mike Scully. Sam Simon pitched an episode {{for one of the}} first seasons which saw Homer getting a gun and nobody wanting him to have it. The episode concluded with Homer foiling a robbery and stating that although guns bring destruction, it worked for him. However, this episode was pitched by Scully for either season seven or eight, before being used for season nine. This provided the basic outline, and John Swartzwelder wrote the script. A lot of lines in the episode put guns in a positive light, as the staff felt that they <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> <b>make</b> an episode about how bad they were. Several of the staff, including Swartzwelder, are [...] "pro gun", although others, such as Matt Groening, are completely against them. The episode was designed to be non-biased and to portray each side of the argument equally. Scully noted that if there is any message in the episode it is that a man like Homer should not own a gun. The censors were nervous about some of the episode's subject matter, such as Homer pointing the gun in Marge's face, and Bart aiming the gun at Milhouse with the apple in his mouth, but ultimately let it go.|$|R

60|$|It was a {{week after}} Mr. Kybird's visit to the alley that he went, as usual, for a stroll {{up and down the}} High Street.

It was opened, and a voice said with an oath, [...] "The old fool has forgotten to leave a candle burning;" [...] then he stepped into the kitchen.|$|E
5000|$|Piece work took on new {{importance}} {{with the}} advent of machine tools, such as the machine lathe in 1751. Machine tools made possible by the American system of manufacturing (attributed to Eli Whitney) in 1799 in which workers <b>could</b> truly <b>make</b> <b>just</b> a single part—but make many copies of it—for later assembly by others. The reality of the earlier English system had been that handcrafted pieces rarely fit together on the first try, and a single artisan was ultimately required to rework all parts of a finished good. By the early 19th century, the accuracy of machine tools meant that piecework parts were produced fully ready for final assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Reliance Steel {{also wanted}} to {{strengthen}} its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975.

We <b>just</b> <b>could</b> never <b>make</b> a deal to buy someone. So we started our own company." [...] Reliance closed the Houston center in 1984 due to a slump in the oil industry.|$|R
40|$|Fixed effects vector {{decomposition}} (FEVD) {{is simply}} an instrumental variables (IV) estimator with a particular choice of instruments and a special case of the well-known Hausman-Taylor IV procedure. Plümper and Troeger (PT) now acknowledge this point and disown the three-stage procedure that previously defined FEVD. Their old recipe for SEs, which has regrettably been used in dozens of published research papers, produces dramatic overconfidence in the estimates. Again PT concede the point and now adopt the standard IV formula for SEs. Knowing that FEVD is an application of IV also has the benefit of focusing attention on the choice of instruments. Now it seems PT claim that the FEVD instruments are always the best choice, {{on the grounds that}} one cannot know whether any potential instrument is correlated with the unit effect. One <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as readily <b>make</b> the same specious claim about other estimators, such as ordinary least squares, and support it with similar Monte Carlo assumptions and evidence. ...|$|R
