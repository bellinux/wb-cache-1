30|$|The {{result of}} the present study also showed that E. coli and S. aureus were {{isolated}} from pregnant bovine uteri. This finding is interesting considering that the uterus is thought to be sterile during pregnancy (Singh et al. 2008), when the cervix is <b>closed.</b> <b>Infections</b> of the uterus carrying life pregnancies are the common causes of repeat breeding occasioned by conception failures (Ferreira et al. 2008; Gani et al. 2008). Furthermore, the isolation of E. coli from a gravid uterus is particularly important in this study because the bacterium is most frequently associated with uterine disease in cattle (Sheldon et al. 2002; Williams et al. 2005). Infections in the pregnant female could lead to abortion, prenatal-neonatal loss and stillbirth (Tibary et al. 2006). The persistence of such infections post partum is likely to contribute to the early demise of the CL with decrease in secretion of progesterone (P 4) in the affected animal (Williams et al. 2007) which could also lead to pregnancy failures.|$|R

30|$|Recently, methods {{based on}} {{survival}} analysis {{to solve the}} network inference problem have burgeoned [4, 5, 7, 18, 19]. The fundamental idea {{of this type of}} solutions is that regarding to a specific cascade and its infected users, the probability that a user is infected by a previous one monotonically decreases with the increase in the difference of their infection time. In other words, a user {{is more likely to be}} infected by another who has a <b>closer</b> <b>infection</b> time with respect to his/her. Survival analysis-based models assume this probability follows a distribution that is governed by a parameter associated with each pair of users, which can be estimated through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The value of the parameter indicates the strength of the directed connection between two users. Since information can be passed between each pair of users in either direction, we need to estimate N^ 2 parameters, where N is the number of total users in the network. As one may imagine, the large number of parameters causes efficiency problem for survival analysis-based methods. For example, if two users stay far away from each other in the infection time lines of most cascades, survival analysis-based solutions might still end up with assigning a weak link between them. Inferring such links brings us extra computational burdens and is usually unnecessary, since they are normally viewed as noise and being discarded later.|$|R

Identification of mode of transmission is vital for developing preventive measures to interrupt its spread, but studies focused on this issue are difficult to implement. From epidemiological studies, it is known that there are great differences in the prevalence of infection in different populations and in ethnic groups originating from high prevalence regions. This is likely related to inferior hygienic conditions and sanitation. In developing countries, infection occurs at a much earlier age. In developed countries, the prevalence of infection is related to poor socioeconomic conditions, particularly density of living.

However, few studies provide a quantitative description of the aspects of social interactions that are most relevant to disease transmission.

We find that the stability of interactions depends on the intimacy of contact and social context. Casual contact encounters mostly occur in the workplace and are predominantly irregular, while close contact encounters mostly occur at home or in social situations and tend to be more stable. Simulated epidemics of casual contact transmission involve a large number of non-repeated encounters, and the social network is well captured by a random mixing model.

The exponential increase of sulfide and ammonium occurred in anoxic natural seawater incubations and to a lesser extend in artificial, sulfate free, seawater. This could be strongly decreased by antibacterial agents, which led to improved survival time by approximately two-fold. Molybdate suppressed sulfide formation also, but did not affect survival time. Exogenous sulfide showed a negative effect on survival time at pH 6. 8 and induced stronger accumulation of free glucose, (D) -lactate and (L) -alanine. This was not the case at pH 8. 2. Fifty percent (LT 50) of cockles in anoxic seawater died after 3. 5 days still with half the initial glycogen concentration present. However, in the presence of chloramphenicol (LT 50 7. 9 days), the cockles utilised their endogenous fuel almost completely. In both incubations there was initially a strong increase of (D) -lactate and (L) -alanine. The (D) -lactate levels subsequently decreased again, probably due to bacterial consumption.
