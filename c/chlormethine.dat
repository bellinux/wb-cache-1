25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and <b>chlormethine.</b> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
2500|$|Pethidine can be {{produced}} in a two-step synthesis. The first step is reaction of benzyl cyanide and <b>chlormethine</b> {{in the presence of}} sodium amide to form a piperidine ring. [...] The nitrile is then converted to an ester.|$|E

50|$|Chemotherapy poses a {{high risk}} of {{infertility}}. Chemotherapies with high risk of infertility include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and <b>chlormethine.</b> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.

50|$|Inhalation of <b>chlormethine</b> {{damages the}} upper and lower airways sequentially, with more severe {{exposures}} causing faster damage that afflicts lower parts of the respiratory tract. Early symptoms include rhinorrhea (runny nose), epistaxis (nosebleed), toneless voice, sneezing, barking cough, and dyspnea (in smokers and asthmatics). Later symptoms include pain in the nose/sinuses and inflammation of the airway. In severe cases, there may be epithelial necrosis throughout the respiratory tract, causing pseudomembrane formation, which can obstruct the airway. Pneumonia may develop and prove fatal.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{clinical}} use of <b>chlormethine</b> (mechlorethamine) resulted in {{development of the}} field of anticancer chemotherapy, led by Cornelius P. Rhoads at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The drug is a nitrogen-based analogue of mustard gas (which is sulfur-based) and was derived from chemical warfare research. Secret clinical trials of the agent for Hodgkin's disease and several other lymphomas and leukemias in humans began in December 1942. Because of wartime secrecy restrictions, it was not until 1946 that the results of these trials were published openly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlormethine</b> (INN, BAN), {{also known}} as mechlorethamine (USAN, USP), mustine, HN2, and (in post-Soviet states) Embichin (эмбихин), is a {{nitrogen}} mustard sold under the brand name Mustargen. It is the prototype of alkylating agents, a group of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs. It works by binding to DNA, crosslinking two strands and preventing cell duplication. It binds to the N7 nitrogen on the DNA base guanine. As the chemical is a blister agent, its use is strongly restricted within the Chemical Weapons Convention where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{effects of}} acute or chronic <b>chlormethine</b> {{exposure}} {{are caused by}} damage to the immune system. White blood cell counts drop, increasing the risk of infection, and red blood cell and platelet counts may also drop due to bone marrow damage. Chronic eye infections may result from exposure, but blindness is temporary. Long-term effects on the respiratory system include anosmia (inability to smell), ageusia (inability to taste), inflammation, chronic infections, fibrosis, and cancer. Skin that has been damaged by HN2 can change pigmentation or become scarred, and may eventually develop cancer.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy and {{radiation}} treatments for {{cancer and other}} serious illnesses can affect reproductive health. The regimens that threaten ovarian and testicular function are mainly radiation therapy to the pelvic area and some types of chemotherapy. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and <b>chlormethine.</b> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycinand dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluoruracil.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of resting spleen colony-forming cells in normal mouse bone marrow and of rapidly-proliferating spleen colony-forming cells in repopulating mouse spleen {{to a number}} of bis-chloro-aethyl-amines was determined. The rapidly-growing cells were more sensitive to each of the agents than the resting cells. The equal degree of sensitization to these agents by an increased rate of proliferation of the cells points to a common mechanism for all agents of this type. It is suggested that repair of damaged DNA, by excision of alkylated bases or oligonucleotides before the damage becomes irreversible during the next DNA synthetic period, is the most likely explanation of the uniform difference in sensitivity caused by the modified rate of cell proliferation. © 1971.

40|$|The {{influence}} of 13 anticancer alkylating agents on cell proliferation, cell cycle parameters, and morphonuclear characteristics was monitored in vitro on three neoplastic cell lines. This monitoring {{was carried out}} by means of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei. This computer-assisted microscope analysis of chromatin texture made it possible to assess 15 morphonuclear parameters. These 15 parameters were submitted to multivariate analyses, that is, principal-components analyses followed by the canonical transformation of the data. The 13 alkylating agents included four nitrogen mustards (<b>chlormethine,</b> chlorambucil, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide), two nitrosoureas (carmustine and lomustine), two platinum analogues (cisplatine and carboplatine), two ethyleneimine derivatives (thiotepa and investigational PE 1001), one antibiotic (mitomycin C), one alkylsulfonate (busulfan), and one triazene (dacarbazine). The mouse MXT mammary and the human J 82 and T 24 bladder tumor cell lines were used in this study. The results show that these alkylating agents induced specific modifications to the chromatin pattern according to the subclass to which they belong. In other words, the multivariate statistical analyses of the 15 parameters made it possible to identify, at least partly, distinct subclasses of alkylating agents according to their mechanisms of action. As a validation of the methodology, the results also show that most of the alkylating agents induced an increase in the percentage of cells in the G 2 phase, while some sometimes induced an increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle.
