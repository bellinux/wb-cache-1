One barrier {{is the belief that}} climate change is too uncertain, and likely to happen in distant places and times, to people unlike oneself. Related to this perceived psychological distance of climate change, studies have shown that direct experience of the effects of climate change increases climate change concern. The present study examined the relationship between physical proximity to the coastline and climate <b>change</b> <b>belief,</b> as proximity may be related to experiencing or anticipating the effects of climate change such as sea-level rise. We show, in a national probability sample of 5, 815 New Zealanders, that people living in closer proximity to the shoreline expressed greater belief that climate change is real and greater support for government regulation of carbon emissions. This proximity effect held when adjusting for height above sea level and regional poverty. The model also included individual differences in respondents' sex, age, education, political orientation, and wealth. The results indicate that physical place plays a role in the psychological acceptance of climate change, perhaps because the effects of climate change become more concrete and local...|$|E

The time course of <b>belief</b> <b>change</b> during judgment provides information about dynamic aspects of the cognitive system, cognitive responses during judgment, and the effect of distal variables on <b>belief</b> <b>change.</b> Several previous studies obtained individual belief trajectories using a computer mouse technique to observe the time course of <b>belief</b> <b>change.</b> Based on characteristics of belief trajectories, this study developed a new framework for their analysis.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{political}} as well as an environmental issue. Climate <b>change</b> <b>beliefs</b> are commonly associated with voting behaviour, but are they associated with swings in voting behaviour? The latter are arguably more important for election outcomes. This paper investigates the predictive power of these beliefs on voting swings at the 2010 Australian federal election after controlling for a range of other related factors (demographic characteristics of voters, different worldviews about nature and the role of government, and the perceived opportunity cost of addressing climate change). Drawing on data from two nationally representative surveys of voters and data from the Australian Electoral Commission, this paper investigates relationships between climate <b>change</b> <b>beliefs</b> and voting swings at both the individual and electorate levels. At an individual level, a hypothetical 10 % change in climate <b>change</b> <b>beliefs</b> was associated with a 2. 6 % swing from a conservative Coalition and a 2. 0 % swing toward Labor and 1. 7 % toward the Greens party, both left on the political spectrum. At the electorate level, this equates to a shift of 21 seats between the two main political parties (the Coalition and Labor) in Australia’s 150 seat parliament, after allocating Green preferences. Given many seats are marginal, even modest shifts in climate <b>change</b> <b>beliefs</b> can be associated with changes in electoral outcomes. Thus, climate change is expected to remain a politically contested issue in countries like Australia where political parties seek to distinguish themselves, in part, by their responses to climat...|$|R

In recent years two special cases of belief <b>change,</b> <b>belief</b> revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and {{to better understand the}} principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991 a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence.

40|$|The {{divergence}} {{of public}} opinion and climate science in the English-speaking world, particularly the United States and Australia, has attracted a variety of explanations. One {{of the more interesting}} accounts, from a psychological perspective, is the influence of ideology on climate change beliefs. Previous work suggests that ideology trumps knowledge in shaping climate change beliefs. However, these studies have typically examined the influence of proxy measures of knowledge rather than specific climate change knowledge. The goal of the present research was to provide some clarification on the different influences of knowledge and ideology on beliefs about climate change. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between specific climate change knowledge, hierarchical and individualistic ideology, and climate <b>change</b> <b>belief</b> in a national sample (N[*]=[*] 335) of the Australian public. Contrary to research involving proxy knowledge measures, we found that people who had greater knowledge of climate change causes were more willing to accept that climate change is occurring.
