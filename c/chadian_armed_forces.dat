5|$|Oueddei {{captured}} about 2,500 {{prisoners in}} 1977 and 1978; as a result, the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> lost at least 20% of its manpower. In particular, the National and Nomadic Guard (GNN) was decimated {{by the fall}} of Fada and Faya. Oueddei used these victories to strengthen his position in the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habré greatly {{strengthened}} his position thanks to western support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. From 1984 onwards, the GUNT also suffered increasing factional tensions, centered on the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over {{the leadership of the}} organization. Taking advantage of the GUNT's difficulties, Habré struck a series of accords with smaller rebel factions, which left the GUNT at the beginning of 1986 with only three of the eleven factions that had originally signed the Lagos Accord in 1979. The remaining factions were Goukouni's People's Armed Forces (FAP), Acheikh's armed branch of the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and that part of the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT) which had maintained its loyalty to Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué.|$|E
50|$|A Sara, Odingar {{was born}} in 1932. As a {{graduate}} of the French military academy he had a rapid career, and in 1965 Odingar, with the grade of Major, took the post as commander of the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT), a choice that strengthened Sara dominance of the government.|$|E
50|$|After Habré {{consolidated}} {{his authority}} and assumed {{the presidency in}} 1982, his victorious army, the <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> of the North (Forces Armées du Nord—FAN), became the nucleus of a new national army. The force was officially constituted in January 1983, when the various pro-Habré contingents were merged and renamed the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (Forces Armées Nationales Tchadiennes—FANT).|$|R
5|$|Supplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habré rapidly reorganized {{his forces}} (now called <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces,</b> or FANT). FANT marched north {{to confront the}} GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Abéché. Habré crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake in rapid {{succession}} Abéché, Biltine, Fada and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, threatening to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.|$|R
50|$|The first {{export sales}} of the AML-90 Lynx were to Burundi, which ordered 12 in 1982. Morocco {{purchased}} 20 in 1988, and another 23 were accepted by the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) as military aid during {{the final stage of}} the Chadian-Libyan conflict. Small quantities were also donated by the French government to Senegal, Togo, and Guinea. An undisclosed number of Lebanese and Kenyan AML-90s have been upgraded with Lynx turrets as well.|$|R

50|$|The Armed Forces of Chad {{have around}} 2.2 million women {{available}} {{to be drafted}} into their military as well as around 1.9 million men. People are considered fit for military service in Chad {{at the age of}} 20. People in Chad can volunteer to join the military at age 18, however if you wait until age 20 there is a 3-year service obligation. There is also no minimum age for volunteers as long as guardian consent is given. Women in Chad are subject to 1 year of compulsory military or civic service at the age of 21. The government of Chad spends around 4.2% of their GDP on their armed forces. The <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> spend about One-Hundred and One million dollars in military spending. The <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> are ranked eleventh overall recent military growth.|$|E
50|$|The Chadian coup of 1975 was in {{considerable}} part {{generated by the}} growing distrust of the President of Chad, François Tombalbaye, for the army. This distrust came {{in part from the}} <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT) incapacity to deal with the rebellion that was inflaming the Muslim north from when the rebel insurgent group FROLINAT had been formed in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|The US in turn {{encouraged}} and aided the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) by supplying satellite intelligence during the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra. The attack {{resulted in a}} devastating defeat for Gaddafi's forces, following which he had to accede to a ceasefire ending the Chadian-Libyan conflict and his dreams of African dominance. Gaddafi blamed the defeat on French and US [...] "aggression against Libya". The result was Gaddafi's lingering animosity against the two countries which led to Libyan support for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{that the}} French would protect Chad {{south of the}} 16th parallel, Habré started {{assembling}} his army, the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT), at Kalaït, a logistic deposit built by France exactly at the 16th parallel, and which it had stocked with munitions, weapons and fuel. France and the United States had equipped the FANT {{with a large number}} of Toyota pickups, and antitank and antiaircraft missile launchers, such as MILAN ATGWs. The FANT assault under the command of Hassan Djamous deployed almost 3000 soldiers for the coming battle.|$|R

50|$|In 1979 the {{national}} unity government was finished. Habré and Malloum confronted {{each other in}} the capital and in February Habré was left in control, while <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT) retired itself towards the south. Shortly before another FROLINAT group was had been formed in January 1978 as the Third Liberation Army of the FROLINAT (later called Popular Movement for the Liberation of Chad, or MPLT), led by Aboubakar Abdel Rahmane, once an ally of Goukouni; this group defeated the government's forces in the west. The First Liberation Army of the FROLINAT reassumed its autonomy, taking control of the eastern prefectures of Ouaddaï and Biltine. In the south the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces,</b> the former national army, was reorganized by the lieutenant Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, former head of Malloum's gendarmerie, who established in May 1979 the south of the country a government called Permanent Committee. Goukouni took advantage of such a chaotic situation and appeared in N'Djamena before Habré had obtained complete control, and took the capital.|$|E
5000|$|The Codos or Commandos were guerrilla groups, {{active in}} {{southern}} Chad from 1983 to 1986, that resisted domination of their region by the [...] President Hissène Habré's army. Many were {{veterans of the}} government army of the 1970s or Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué's <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT), which had collapsed in 1982 under Habré's attacks with the short-lived Republic of Logone. Totaling as many as 15,000, they operated independently.|$|E
50|$|Oueddei {{captured}} about 2,500 {{prisoners in}} 1977 and 1978; as a result, the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> lost at least 20% of its manpower.

Oueddei used these victories to strengthen his position in the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.|$|E
50|$|Libyan T-62s {{were first}} {{deployed}} against the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) in the Aouzou Strip around September 1986. The tanks also formed {{an integral part}} of a brigade-sized, combined <b>arms</b> task <b>force</b> ordered to drive Chadian troops loyal to the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) from the Tibesti Mountains the following December. During the Toyota War, a few T-62s were destroyed at medium range by MILAN anti-tank missiles mounted on Chadian technicals. According to French after-action reports released in March 1988, several were also knocked out by FANT Panhard AML-90 armoured cars with flank or rear shots.|$|R
50|$|The People's <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (Forces Armées Populaires or FAP) was a Chadian insurgent group {{composed}} of followers of Goukouni Oueddei after the schism with Hissène Habré in 1976. With an ethnic {{base in the}} Teda clan of the Toubou from the Tibesti area of northern Chad, the <b>force</b> was <b>armed</b> by Libya and formed the largest component of the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) coalition army opposing Habré. FAP troops rebelled against their Libyan allies {{in the latter part}} of 1986. Many of them were subsequently integrated into the national army, the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT), and participated in the 1987 attempt to drive Libya out of Chadian territory.|$|R
500|$|The Libyans {{had also}} {{to deal with}} the greatly {{strengthened}} <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT), which was composed of 10,000 highly motivated soldiers, led by experienced and able commanders, such as Idriss Déby, Hassan Djamous and President Hissène Habré himself. And while FANT previously had no air power, limited mobility and few anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, by 1987 it could count on the French Air Force to keep Libyan aircraft grounded and, most importantly, to provide 400 state of the art Toyota pickups equipped with MILAN anti-tank guided missiles. It is these trucks that gave the name [...] "Toyota War" [...] to this last phase of the Chadian-Libyan conflict.|$|R
5000|$|While the FROLINAT was {{originally}} composed of few members, it {{could count on}} the fact that the Chadian state was already in disarray; the southern-dominated government despised and bypassed the Muslim traditional leaders, and already in 1963 the most important Northern politicians had been arrested, and all important positions in the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> and in the local administration was kept by non-Muslim Southerners. To cite Sam Nolutschungu, [...] "everyone knew that the regime was corrupt, cruel, arbitrary, and absurd." ...|$|E
50|$|From {{independence}} {{through the}} period of the presidency of Félix Malloum (1975-79), the official national army was known as the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (Forces Armées Tchadiennes—FAT). Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. FAT lost its status as the legal state army when Malloum's civil and military administration disintegrated in 1979. Although it remained a distinct military body for several years, FAT was eventually reduced to the status of a regional army representing the south.|$|E
50|$|All the same, under Tombalbaye Djogo made a fast {{career and}} became general and Chief of Staff of the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT), {{when he was}} arrested by the President on March 23, 1975 in what was yet another of many purges in the army. He did not remain long in jail: on April 13 a {{military}} coup removed Tombalbaye. Immediately freed from jail, the coupists offered him the presidency of the new military junta, but when he declined they asked Félix Malloum, who on April 15 assumed the position of new head of state of the country.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> of the North (Forces Armées du Nord or FAN) was a Chadian rebel army active {{during the}} Chadian Civil War. Composed of FROLINAT units that {{remained}} loyal to Hissène Habré following his break from Goukouni Oueddei and the CCFAN in 1976. Consisting at first {{of only a}} few hundred Toubou and some Hajerai and Ouaddaïan fighters, FAN began its operations from bases in eastern Chad, where it received help from Sudan. Driven from N'Djamena back to its eastern refuge after the Libyan incursion of 1980, FAN scored a series of victories over Goukouni's Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces in 1982, which culminated in the recapture of N'Djamena and Habré's assumption of the presidency. FAN became the core of the new national army, <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT), in January 1983.|$|R
50|$|The rebels {{attempted}} {{to seize the}} National Assembly building, but the assault was easily repulsed by the much more heavily <b>armed</b> <b>Chadian</b> government <b>forces.</b> At least 400 people, including 370 rebels, 30 government forces and some civilians, {{were killed in the}} fighting. 271 rebels were captured and paraded through the Place d'Independance the next day.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the rebels}} advanced, with poorly {{concealed}} assistance from Libya, Habré appealed for international help. Rejecting direct intervention and downplaying the Libyan role, France {{was prepared to}} go no further than airlifting arms and fuel, with the first French arms shipments arriving on June 27. On July 3, Zaire flew in a detachment of 250 paratroopers, eventually raised to about 2,000 men. Deployed chiefly around N'Djamena, the Zaireans freed Chadian troops to fight the rebels. The United States further announced that 25 million US dollars in military and food aid would be provided. Thus assisted, and {{taking advantage of the}} GUNT's overextended supply line, Habré took personal command of the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) and drove Goukouni's army out of Abéché four days after the city's fall. [...] FANT recaptured Faya-Largeau on July 30 and went on to retake other points in the north.|$|R
5000|$|When the Chadian Civil War {{extended}} {{itself to}} the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti in 1968, the GNN found itself increasingly on the frontline against the insurgents. The final showdown between the insurgency and the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> came in 1977 - 78, when Goukouni Oueddei, leader of a FROLINAT faction, conquered all the government's strongholds in northern Chad, inflicting staggering losses to the armed forces; the GNN in particular lost heavily in early 1978 when Goukouni took Fada and {{the capital of the}} Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, Faya-Largeau. This practically brought an end to the GNN, until it was revived shortly before 1996 by the current President Idriss Déby.|$|E
50|$|Under Nigerian pressure, Lol {{was made}} {{head of the}} Transitional Government of National Unity on April 29, 1979, by the four factions present at Kano I. The GUNT {{included}} 21 ministers, of whom 11 were northerners and 10 were southerners. Goukouni Oueddei, head of the FAP, became Interior Minister, Hissène Habré became Defence Minister, and Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, leader of the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT), became vice-president. But the transitional government excluded all the pro-Libyan forces; as a result, a rival government, backed by Muammar al-Gaddafi, was formed; {{it was called the}} Democratic Revolutionary Council, and it was headed by Ahmat Acyl, an Arab.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (Forces Armées Tchadiennes or FAT) {{were the}} army of the central {{government}} of Chad from 1960 to 1979, under the southern presidents François Tombalbaye and Félix Malloum, until the downfall of the latter in 1979, when the head of the gendarmerie, Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, assumed command. Joined by gendarmerie units, FAT became a regional force representing primarily the Sara ethnic group of the five southern prefectures. It joined with the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces fighting against Hissène Habré and was a recipient of aid from Libya. FAT began to disintegrate during 1982 as a result of defeats inflicted by Habré's Armed Forces of the North (FAN). Most remaining soldiers accepted integration into FAN or resumed their insurgency as codos.|$|E
50|$|There were, in 1983, five codos groups. These {{were the}} Red Codos (Codos Rouge), {{commanded}} by Alphonse Kotiga, based in Moyen-Chari; the Coconut Codos (Codos Cocotieres), of Elie Atanga and Elea Djoack, in Mayo-Kebbi; the Green Codos (Codos Vert) of Pierre Tokino in Logone Oriental; the Hope Codos (Codos Espoir) of Kayer in Tandjile; and the Panther Codos (Codos Panthères) of Koulangar in Logone Occidental. They {{were supported by}} the Central African Republic, who offered them sanctuary in its borders. Habré at first attempted negotiations, making Defence minister a former leader of the codos; but when discussions broke down, the President resorted, in August 1984, to force and wide-scale fighting erupted {{in four of the}} five southern Prefectures, counting now on the support of the Central African President André Kolingba. The <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) acted with rare brutality, destroying many villages and making itself guilty of wide-scale massacres of civilians. But it worked: in 1985, the greatest part of the south had been subdued.|$|R
5000|$|Following this Habré, {{during the}} {{celebrations}} {{for the second}} anniversary of his rise to power, held a speech on June 7 in which he announced that the FAN, after the dissolution of the old FAN militia in the new <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces,</b> was to also be considered dissolved, and should thus evolve itself into something new. He also added that an extraordinary congress of the FAN was to be called in short time. The first congress of the FROLINAT-FAN was opened on June 20, opened by a speech of the President in which he attacked Libyan presence in northern Chad as an attempt to [...] "wipe out our traditional and ancestral values". Two days later, on June 22, the congress announced the formal dissolution of the FAN, that was replaced on June 24 by the National Union for Independence and Revolution, a movement whose aims were declared to be the establishment of democratic political life, freedom of expression and opposition to [...] "religious fanaticism".|$|R
50|$|In late 1987, the <b>Chadian</b> National <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FANT) were in {{the process}} of retaking {{northern}} Chad from Libya. The battle for the Aouzou Strip — a strip of land in northern Chad then controlled by Libya — began in late July. After suffering a string of defeats, the Libyan Army organized a counteroffensive on August 8 in an attempt to regain a foothold in the nearby Tibesti Mountains. As the 3,000-strong Libyan force drove southwards, towards the Tibesti town of Bardaï, they were intercepted by the FANT, which surrounded and attacked them on multiple sides, forcing them to retreat. The Chadians then began aggressively pursuing the Libyans northwards through the desert, towards Aouzou, inflicting numerous casualties along the way to the Libyan Army, which suffered 650 killed, 147 taken prisoner, 111 military vehicles captured, and at least 30 tanks and APCs destroyed. With the Libyans routed, the FANT troops easily moved into the town of Aouzou that same day; however, this move went against the advice of the France's president and Chadian ally François Mitterrand, who refused to provide air support for the operation.|$|R
50|$|This forced Tombalbaye to ask in 1968 {{for help}} from the French President Charles de Gaulle, {{counting}} on the military accords between the two countries; firstly, the Defence Accord signed on August 15, 1960, and secondly, the Assistance Militaire Technique (AMT) accord, signed May 19, 1964. Originally France limited itself to provide logistic support to the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> but, {{when it became clear}} the situation was not improving, De Gaulle reluctantly started on April 14, 1969, Operation Bison, sending 3,000 well equipped French soldiers against the ragtag FROLINAT forces. Among the conditions for the French help was the acceptance by Tombalbaye of an Administrative Reform Mission (MRA), that was to reform the army and the civil service and propose radical changes to the government's policies.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habré greatly {{strengthened}} his position thanks to western support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. From 1984 onwards, the GUNT also suffered increasing factional tensions, centered on the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over {{the leadership of the}} organization. Taking advantage of the GUNT's difficulties, Habré struck a series of accords with smaller rebel factions, which left the GUNT at the beginning of 1986 with only three of the eleven factions that had originally signed the Lagos Accord in 1979. The remaining factions were Goukouni's People's Armed Forces (FAP), Acheikh's armed branch of the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and that part of the <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT) which had maintained its loyalty to Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué.|$|E
50|$|The Chadian National Armed Forces (Forces Armées Nationales Tchadiennes or FANT) was {{the army}} of the central {{government}} of Chad from January 1983, when the President Hissène Habré's forces, in first place his personal Armed Forces of the North (FAN), were merged. Consisting of about 10,000 soldiers at that time, it swelled with the assimilation of former <b>Chadian</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> (FAT) and codos rebels from the south and, in 1986, with the addition of Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) soldiers who had turned against their Libyan allies. Freshly outfitted by France and the United States, FANT drove Libyan troops from their bases in northern Chad in a series of victories in 1987, during the Toyota War; but it dissolved defeated by the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) led by Idriss Déby, who conquered the capital N'Djamena on December 2, 1990.|$|E
