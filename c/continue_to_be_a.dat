5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5|$|However, {{safety issues}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{persistent}} problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system {{the reputation of}} the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E

5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E
5|$|Sectors {{vital to}} the Massachusetts economy include higher education, biotechnology, {{information}} technology, finance, health care, tourism, and defense. The Route 128 corridor and Greater Boston <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major center for venture capital investment, and high technology remains an important sector. In recent years tourism has played an ever-important role in the state's economy, with Boston and Cape Cod being the leading destinations. Other popular tourist destinations include Salem, Plymouth, and the Berkshires. Massachusetts is the sixth-most popular tourist destination for foreign travelers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> concern.|$|E

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and believed {{that it was possible to}} save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
5|$|The skins of wild {{cats and}} other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Though it {{is universally}} {{accepted}} by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira was an actual person {{who lived in}} ancient India, {{the details of his}} biography and the year of his birth are uncertain, and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subject of considerable debate among scholars. The Jain Śvētāmbara tradition believes he was born in 599BC and died in 527BC, while the Digambara tradition believes 510BC was the year he died. The scholarly controversy arises from efforts to date him and the Buddha, because both are believed to be contemporaries according to Buddhist and Jain texts, and because, unlike for Jain literature, there is extensive ancient Buddhist literature that has survived. Almost all Indologists and historians, state Dundas and others, accordingly date Mahavira's birth to about 497BC and his death to about 425BC. However, the Vira era tradition that started in 527BC and places Mahavira in the 6thcentury BC is a firmly established part of the Jain community tradition.|$|E
5|$|When the 1864 {{treaty was}} signed, the Klamath Tribes, with much less land, became short on the stream water needed for fishing. Although from the 1950s to the 1970s {{they were not}} federally recognized, the tribes never lost their water rights, and in 2001, when Klamath Basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior for more access to {{irrigation}} water, their rights were upheld. The tribes' water allotments for fishing <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> large factor in Klamath Basin water disputes in the 21stcentury. In 2013, the Tribe's water rights were enforced for the first time, in {{what is known as}} a 'Water Call'. The Klamath Tribe called upon their in-stream water right, which was enforced by the Water Master. This resulted in almost all upper-basin irrigation being denied water, except for groundwater irrigators. The Klamath Project, however, was not called upon.|$|E
