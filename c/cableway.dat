5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a <b>cableway</b> up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 the British moved some diesel {{locomotives}} and materials to Eritrea when they dismantled the Railway Mogadiscio-Villabruzzi of Italian Somalia. In 1944 the British (as a war compensation) dismantled the Italian-built Asmara-Massawa <b>Cableway</b> that supplemented the railway {{as a means}} of transportation inland; the <b>cableway</b> equipment was sent south to Britain's colony Kenya.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic efficiency of <b>cableways</b> in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italy, and relates it to sustainability and tourism issues. <b>Cableways</b> represent an environmental-friendly {{mode of transport}} that enables access to remote and environmentally delicate areas. Thus, examining <b>cableways</b> efficiency informs policies that foster regional competitiveness from a sustainable development perspective. Employing annual data from 2002 up to 2008, the pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency are computed using a panel Data Envelopment Analysis. Overall, the empirical findings reveal {{that this type of}} transport in the Italian Alps can be regarded as relatively economically inefficient and most of the <b>cableways</b> denote decreasing returns to scale. Nevertheless, some distinctive features are detected amongst <b>cableways</b> classified by district. Policy implications are drawn to help economic agents improve their efficiency scores...|$|R

25|$|The <b>cableway</b> {{was built}} by Italy in the 1930s, and {{connected}} the port of Massawa {{with the city of}} Asmara. The <b>cableway</b> was the longest {{of its kind in the}} world at the time of its inauguration. It had 13 stations with diesel engines, with 1620 little transport wagoons. The British later dismantled it during their eleven-year occupation, after defeating Italy in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Torres's {{experimentation}} in {{the area}} of cableways and cable cars began very early during his residence in the town of his birth, Molledo. There, in 1887, he constructed the first <b>cableway</b> to span a depression of some 40 metres. The <b>cableway</b> was some 200 metres across and was pulled by a pair of cows, with one log seat. This experiment was the basis for the request for his first patent, which he sought in the same year: an aerial cable car with multiple cables, with which it obtained a level of safety suitable for the transport of people, not only cargo. Later, he constructed the <b>cableway</b> of the Río León, of greater speed and already with a motor, but which continued to be used solely for the transport of materials, not of people.|$|E

50|$|While {{continuing}} {{to work on}} <b>cableways,</b> Ceretti studied the inefficiencies of cargo-handling at harbours and docks. He developed new mechanical methods for moving cargos around, and in 1903 he designed technologies to lift weights, chutes and <b>cableways</b> for the Savona harbour, to load off coal on railway trucks.|$|R

25|$|The Alpha Cement works began {{near the}} Francis works in 1910 {{as part of}} the Thames Portland Cement Company. It stood about a mile from the river and {{included}} a Goshead aerial <b>cableway,</b> which ran alongside the road constructed by the soldiers of Cliffe Fort, then disused. Alpha continued after the closure of the Francis works, which it took over in 1934. With this amalgamation an additional railway was added in 1935 to replace the <b>cableway,</b> linking the works with the quayside next to the fort.|$|E

25|$|In 1890 he {{presented}} his <b>cableway</b> in Switzerland, a country {{very interested in}} that transport owing to its geography and which was already coming to use cable cars for bulk transport, but Torres's project was dismissed, allowing certain ironic commentary from the Swiss press. In 1907, Torres constructed the first <b>cableway</b> suitable for the public transportation of people, in Monte Ulía in San Sebastián. The problem of safety was solved {{by means of an}} ingenious system of multiple support cables. The resulting design was very strong and perfectly resisted the rupture of one of the support cables. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which successfully constructed other cableways in Chamonix, Rio de Janeiro, and elsewhere. But it is doubtless the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada which has gained the greatest fame in this area of activity, although from a scientific point of view it was not the most important. The <b>cableway</b> of 580 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side, constructed between 1914 and 1916, a Spanish project from beginning to end: devised by a Spaniard, constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital (The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited); a bronze plaque, located on a monolith at the entrance of the access station recalls this fact: Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara. Leonardo Quevedo Torres (18521936). It was inaugurated in tests on 15 February 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1916, opening to the public the following day; the <b>cableway,</b> with small modifications, continues to run to this day, with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.|$|E

25|$|Engineer Frederick Richard Simms was supervising {{construction}} of an aerial <b>cableway</b> of his own design for the Bremen Exhibition in 1889 when he saw tiny railcars powered by Gottlieb Daimler's motors.

25|$|Furthermore, the Italians {{employed}} many Eritreans {{in public}} service (in particular in the police and public works departments) and oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa.
