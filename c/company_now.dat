5|$|In 1924, Bush and Marshall {{teamed up}} with {{physicist}} Charles G. Smith, who had invented a device called the S-tube. This enabled radios, which had previously required {{two different types of}} batteries, to operate from mains power. Marshall raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to market the invention, with Bush and Smith among its five directors. The venture made Bush wealthy, and the <b>company,</b> <b>now</b> known as Raytheon, ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The <b>company</b> <b>now</b> {{maintained its}} full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E

5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of {{at least some of}} the maps, notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the <b>company,</b> <b>now</b> A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide to Japan and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers. The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.|$|E
5|$|From 1908 to 1909, {{a hundred}} {{electric}} trams were manufactured by Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide {{at a cost}} of approximately £100 each. Up to its last tram purchase in 1953, the MTT commissioned over 300 electric trams, some of which have been kept in service for over seventy-five years. TransAdelaide, the publicly owned <b>company</b> <b>now</b> operating Adelaide trams, began introducing a new type of tram in January 2006 {{in the form of the}} Bombardier Flexity Classic. Another new series of trams (Alstom Citadis) started to enter service in December 2009. A further three trams are to be delivered in 2018.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Opera is {{a company}} based in central London, {{resident}} at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Along with the English National Opera, {{it is one of}} the two principal opera companies in London. Founded in 1946 as the Covent Garden Opera Company, it was known by that title until 1968. It brought a long annual season and consistent management to a house that had previously hosted short seasons under a series of impresarios. Since its inception, it has shared the Royal Opera House with the dance <b>company</b> <b>now</b> known as The Royal Ballet.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the <b>Company</b> <b>now</b> unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the <b>company,</b> <b>now</b> called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The <b>company</b> <b>now</b> focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{coverage}} of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number {{of products and}} enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The <b>company</b> <b>now</b> distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was {{the birthplace of the}} Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. established one of the country's first modern shopping plazas in the suburb of Boardman. The fast-food chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which had been established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.|$|E
5|$|Muller {{was destined}} to step into his father's {{footsteps}} and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the Hohe Real Schule in Frankfurt-am-Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At {{the end of his}} trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted <b>company,</b> <b>now</b> called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.|$|E
