25|$|In this voyage, Ming China {{would also}} {{forcibly}} settle the enmity that existed {{between it and}} Java. Java was ruled by successive Majapahit kings, who had acted defiantly towards Ming China since the Hongwu reign. During the civil war between 1401 and 1406, the King of West Java had killed 170 personnel of a Chinese embassy when they came ashore on his rival's territory at East Java. The Taizong Shilu 23 October, 1407, entry recorded that the Yongle Emperor summoned the Javanese ambassadors. It stated that he accused Java of begging for forgiveness, because Ming China was mobilizing its army to punish them. It also noted that he demanded 60,000 ounces of gold and ordered them {{to reflect on the}} situation in Annam (Vietnam), which had recently been invaded by Chinese armies.
