The detailed mechanism underlying this recombination and the genes involved in loop-out recombination remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the functions of ku 70, ligD, rad 52, rad 54, and rdh 54 in the construction of large <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> via loop-out recombination and the effect of the position of the targeted chromosomal region on the efficiency of loop-out recombination in Aspergillus oryzae. The efficiency of generation of large <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> in the near-telomeric re-gion of chromosome 3, including the aflatoxin gene cluster, was compared with that in the near-centromeric region of chromo-some 8, including the tannase gene. In theku 70 andku 70 -rdh 54 strains, only precise loop-out recombination occurred in the near-telomeric region. In contrast, in theligD,ku 70 -rad 52, andku 70 -rad 54 strains, unintended <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> by illegitimate loop-out recombination occurred in the near-telomeric region. In addition, large <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> via loop-out recombination were efficiently achieved in the near-telomeric region, but barely achieved in the near-centromeric region, in theku 70 strain.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to present the incidence, {{prenatal}} and postnatal findings, and modes of ascertainment in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> detected at amniocentesis. Materials and methods: We reviewed all the cases with <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions,</b> which were detected by amniocentesis in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, between January 1987 and December 2012. Data on the locations and types of deletion, reasons for performing amniocentesis, maternal age, gestational age at amniocentesis, fetal karyotypes, inheritance of deletions, and relative prenatal findings were collected. Results: Amniocentesis was performed in 33, 305 cases within this period of time. Among these, 31 cases of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> were considered for the study. The mean gestational age at amniocentesis was 21. 0 weeks (range from 15 weeks to 32 weeks) and the mean maternal age at amniocentesis was 32. 1 years (range from 26 years to 37 years). Nineteen cases (61. 3 %) manifested fetal structural abnormalities on ultrasound, nine (29. 0 %) presented no ultrasound abnormalities, and three had an unknown status. The main modes of ascertainment included abnormal ultrasound findings in 10 cases (32. 2 %), advanced maternal age in 11 cases (35. 5 %), abnormal maternal serum screening results in six cases (19. 6 %), and other reasons in four cases (13. 0 %). Of the 27 cases with known inheritance, the deletion was inherited in two (6. 6 %) and de novo in 25 (92. 6 %). Males accounted for 11 (35. 5 %) and females for 20 (64. 5 %) cases. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> are more often to occur in chromosomal 5 (4 cases, 12. 9 %), chromosomal 18 (4 cases, 12. 9 %), chromosomal 4 (3 cases, 9. 7 %), chromosomal 7 (3 cases, 9. 7 %), chromosomal 10 (3 cases, 9. 7 %), chromosomal 11 (3 cases, 9. 7 %), and chromosomal 1 (2 cases, 6. 5 %). There were four cases of chromosomal mosaicism: two involved chromosome 5, one involved chromosome 10, and one involved chromosome 18. Twenty-three cases (74. 2 %) had terminal deletions and the other eight cases (26. 7 %) had interstitial-type deletions. Conclusion: In summary, we have presented the results of prenatal diagnosis for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> using amniocentesis. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>deletions</b> are more likely to occur in females and more often in chromosomal 5 p and 18 q. Prenatal diagnosis at amniocentesis is frequently associated with advanced maternal age, abnormal ultrasound findings, and abnormal maternal serum screening. The frequency of ascertainment in chromosome deletion seems to be directly correlated with advanced maternal age and abnormal ultrasound findings. In cases with terminal deletions, prenatal ultrasound plays a more important role for prenatal diagnosis...|$|R

Also, other genes within the chromosome 17 contribute to the variability and severity of the clinical features.

5000|$|RNA editing is {{a process}} which results in {{sequence}} variation in the RNA molecule, and is catalyzed by enzymes. These enzymes include the Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, which convert specific adenosine residues to inosine in an mRNA molecule by hydrolytic deamination. Three ADAR enzymes have been cloned, ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3, although only the first two subtypes {{have been shown to}} have RNA editing activity. Many mRNAs are vulnerable to the effects of RNA editing, including the glutamate receptor subunits GluR2, GluR3, GluR4, GluR5 and GluR6 (which are components of the AMPA and kainate receptors), the serotonin2C receptor, the GABA-alpha3 receptor subunit, the tryptophan hydroxlase enzyme TPH2, the hepatitis delta virus and more than 16% of microRNAs. In addition to ADAR enzymes, CDAR enzymes exist and these convert cytosines in specific RNA molecules, to uracil. These enzymes are termed 'APOBEC' and have genetic loci at 22q13, a region close to the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletion</b> which occurs in velocardiofacial syndrome (22q11) and which is linked to psychosis. RNA editing is extensively studied in relation to infectious diseases, because the editing process alters viral function.|$|E

40|$|Copy number {{variants}} (CNVs) are {{pieces of}} genomic DNA of 1000 base pairs or longer which {{occur in a}} given genome at a different frequency than in a reference genome.

Based upon more than 8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fifteen inbred mouse lines which were determined in a whole genome chip based resequencing project by Perlegen Sciences, we detected 20 166 such long <b>chromosomal</b> <b>deletions.</b> They cover altogether between 4. 4 million and 8. 8 million base pairs, depending on the mouse line.

In contrast to isolated missing values, clusters are likely the consequence of missing DNA probe rather than of a failed hybridization or deficient oligos.

We analyzed 46 B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) specimens with known karyotypes for translocations of IGH-, BCL 2 -, BCL 6 - and MYC-genes. Locus-specific DNA probes were used for the detection of deletions in chromosome bands 6 q 21 and 9 p 21 in 62 follicular lymphomas (FL) and six malignant mesothelioma (MM) samples, respectively. To test for aberrant signals generated by truncation of nuclei following sectioning of FFPE tissue samples, cell line dilutions with 9 p 21 -deletions were embedded into paraffin blocks.
