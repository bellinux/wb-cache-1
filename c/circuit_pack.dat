50|$|Most {{communication}} {{within the}} GTD-5 was performed via direct memory-mapped I/O. The APC and each TPC were each connected to three common memory units. These common memory units each contained 16 megabytes of memory which were allocated to shared data structures, both dynamic structures related to dynamic call data and static (protected) data {{related to the}} office database. The APC, TPC, and TCUs all connected to a smaller shared memory, the Message Distribution Circuit (MDC). This was an 8k word 96 port memory {{that was used to}} place small packetized messages into software defined queues. The MXU, RLU, and RSU were all sufficiently far from the base unit that they could not participate in the shared memory based communication directly. A special <b>circuit</b> <b>pack,</b> the Remote Data Link Controller (RDLC) was installed in the DT-FIU of the remote unit and its host TCU. This allowed a serial communication link over a dedicated timeslot of a DS1 carrier. The host TCU was responsible for forwarding messages from the remote unit through the MDC.|$|E
50|$|The AL-FIU {{contained}} 8 simplex {{groups of}} 96 lines each, {{referred to as}} Analog Line Units (ALUs), controlled by a redundant controller, the Analog Control Unit (ACU). The 96 lines within each ALU were housed on 12 <b>circuit</b> <b>packs</b> of eight line circuits. These 12 <b>circuit</b> <b>packs</b> were electrically grouped into four groups of three cards, where each group of three cards shared a serial 24 timeslot PCM group. The timeslot assignment capabilities of the codec were used to manage timeslots within the PCM group. The ACU contained a timeslot selection circuit that could select the same timeslot from up to eight PCM groups, (i.e. network timeslot 0-7 would select PCM timeslot 0, network timeslot 8-15 would select PCM timeslot 1, etc., giving eight opportunities for PCM timeslot 0 to connect to network). Since the same timeslot could be selected only eight times out of thirty-two possible candidates, the overall concentration was four to one. A later generation expanded the number of ALUs to twelve or sixteen, as appropriate, giving larger effective concentration.|$|R

40|$|The model {{configuration}} problem (MCP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with application in the telecommunications manufacturing industry. The product is a switching cabinet, {{defined by a}} number of positions (slots) in which specific circuit packs are installed according to the customer requirements (configurations). Variety of customer requirements leads to a relatively large number of distinct configurations. In order to streamline the manufacturing process, a large number of switching cabinets with identical configurations (model cabinets) are produced in advance. A customer order is then filled by selecting a model cabinet whose configuration is relatively close to the customer configuration and performing any necessary <b>circuit</b> <b>pack</b> exchanges to make its configuration identical to the customer requirement. The manufacturing costs are proportional to the number of these <b>circuit</b> <b>pack</b> exchanges, and the q-model {{configuration problem}} is to design q different model configurations so as to minimize the total number of exchanges for a given collection of customer orders.

In {{order for}} an electronic telephone switching system to perform its functions without loss of credits and earnings from customers, accurate reliability should be predicted before system release.

A bottom-up approach was used for system reliability prediction with step-by-step methods from component or <b>circuit</b> <b>pack</b> level to board, block, subsystem, and system level. For important component or <b>circuit</b> <b>pack</b> level reliability, a suitable model selection method of failure occurrences is recommended along with its parameter estimation method using statistical analysis. For expensive board level reliability, a weak link identification method and a reliability improving method are recommended. For inexpensive block level reliability, its components or circuit packs reliability were calculated from a model that included part stress analysis. For software reliability prediction, a suitable model selection method of failure occurrences is recommended, along with maximum likelihood parameter estimation. An objective failure intensity set-up method based on system test cost and system operation cost is recommended along with a prediction method of additional testing time required before system release. It was verified that a Time Division Switching system satisfied the reliability recommended by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consult Committee. In addition, the percentages of hardware reliability and software reliability were predicted along with each subsystem reliability, unavailability, number of failures, down time, mean time to first failure, and failure intensity.

40|$|Nortel Networks, {{a leading}} global {{supplier}} of telecommunications equipment, {{is engaged in}} an increasingly competitive global market place. Within this market, Nortel Networks is positioning itself {{as the leader of}} global network transformation. The vision of the new transformed network is one in which disparate network elements are converged onto single architectural platforms serving the Client, Wireless Access, Network Services, Multi-services Packet, VoIP, Multi-services Optical and Element Management aspects of the newly transformed network architecture. This paper focuses specifically on the hardware development process associated with the CDMA wireless access element referred to as a base transceiver station (BTS) in the transformed network. The effect of part commonality on product development lead times are investigated at four levels of integration: common part (ASIC), common assembly (<b>circuit</b> <b>pack),</b> common field replaceable unit (module) and finally the common platform (BTS). At increasing levels of integration, the use of common parts leads to longer product development lead times. This observation is examined using two methodologies. The first methodology utilizes the three lenses framework focusing primarily on the impacts of organizational structure on the product development process. An evaluation of the existing barriers preventing joint gains and acceptable compromises to be achieved amongst share holders in joint development programs is discussed. Methods by which to minimize the impact of organizational structure on common product development lead time are given and comparisons are made with alternate organizational models from within the telecommunications industry. The second methodology employed utilizes task(cont.) design structure matrices (DSM) to analyze the implication of part commonality on product development lead times for projects structured in accordance with the Nortel Networks Life Cycle Management model. Effects modeled include stochastic durations, probabilistic iterations, learning effects, resource constraints, parallel tasks and overlapping tasks. An evaluation of the results indicates an increased sensitivity to extended product development lead times associated with probabilistic iterations. This is shown to be particularly evident during the requirements definition phase in which multiple stakeholder requirements must be captured comprehensively. This sensitivity is amplified by the fact that product verification takes place in multiple labs each exercising the equipment in unique and un-accounted for configurations. Based on the above analysis, a framework to ascertain the optimum level of commonality to pursue on a given product is given. by Nicholas Svensson. Thesis (S. M.)

5000|$|As {{companies}} {{began to}} deploy IP networks in their environment, companies {{began to use}} these networks to transmit voice instead of relying on traditional telephone network circuits. Some vendors such as Avaya and Nortel created <b>circuit</b> <b>packs</b> or cards for their PBX systems that could interconnect their communications systems to the IP network. Other vendors such as Cisco created equipment that could be placed in routers to transport voice calls across a company network from site to site. The termination of PBX circuits to be transported across a network and delivered to another phone system is traditionally referred to as Voice over IP (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP). This design required special hardware {{on both ends of}} the network equipment to provide the termination and delivery at each site. As time went by, Siemens, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Nortel, Avaya, Wildix and Mitel realized the potential for eliminating the traditional PBX or key system and replacing it with a solution based on IP. This IP solution is software driven only, and thereby does away with the need for [...] "switching" [...] equipment at a customer site (save the equipment necessary to connect to the outside world). This created a new technology, now called IP telephony. A system that uses IP-based telephony services only, rather than a legacy PBX or key system, is called an IP telephony solution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alcatel-Lucent is a {{major player}} in the eld of telecommunications. One of the {{products}} it o ers to network operators is wireless infrastructure such as base stations. Such equipment is delivered in cabinets. These cabinets are packed with various pieces of electronics: lters, ampli ers, <b>circuit</b> <b>packs,</b> etc. The exact con guration of a cabinet is dependent upon the circumstances it is being placed in, and some 20 product groups can be distinguished. However, the variation in cabinets is large, even within one product group. For this reason, they are built to order. In order to improve cost, yield and delivery performance, lean manufacturing concepts were applied to change the layout of the factory to one based on cells. These cells focus on improving manufacturing through standardised work, limited changeovers between product groups and better utilisation of test equipment. A key component in the implementation of these improvements is a system which schedules the cells to satisfy customer request dates in an e cient sequence. This paper describes the transformation and the tool that was built to support the new method of operations. The implementation has achieved signi cant improvements in manufacturing interval, work in process inventory, rst test yield, headcount, quality (i. e. fewer defects are found during the testing stage) and delivery performance. Although these bene ts are mainly achieved because of the change to a cell layout, the scheduling tool is crucial in realising the full potential of it. ...|$|R
