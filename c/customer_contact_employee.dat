40|$|Service firms {{increasingly}} need to rely {{on other}} attributes than traditional quality and performance of their service employees to become and stay truly competitive. Strong brands are essential for differentiation in today's marketplace and it becomes naturally important to align the customer contact employees with the company brand to ensure consistency in all communication externally. For a service firm employee to fully enact the brand and display on brand behavior outwards it is pivotal to make them truly committed to the brand and organization. Internal branding processes {{have been shown to}} be an enabler of employee commitment to the organizational brand. While internal branding is stated to have a connection to commitment, the concept as such is according to Meyer & Allen (1991) constituted by three dimensions, normative, affective and continuance commitment. The bulk of the existing research has so far focused on internal branding and commitment as a single construct and not these dimensions. Much of this research is in addition limited to a few service sectors. The aim of this study was to determine the components of internal branding in order to clarify the relationship between internal branding and brand commitment of customer contact employees. The empirical investigation was conducted in the retail sector from the perspective of the <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employee</b> by the use of a self-completion questionnaire measuring the affective commitment of the employees and the presence of the internal branding activities. The conceptual model for the study shows hypothesized positive relationships between the four internal branding activities and affective commitment. However, while all internal branding activities were significantly present, only three of these were found to have a significant positive relationship to affective commitment, excluding internal communication. The conclusions of this study gives managers of customer contact employee’s insights about how to enable affective commitment through the use of internal branding. Our results show that brand oriented training, recruitment and leadership all have a significant impact on affective commitment of customer contact employees. Although they had similar Beta values, brand oriented leadership showed a slightly higher predicting power indicating that leadership can play a greater role regarding the affective commitment of customer contact employees...|$|E

40|$|During service encounters, <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> {{often need}} to deliver bad news: {{unexpected}} information {{contrary to the}} customer’s wellbeing. For example, technicians regularly tell customers {{that none of the}} data on their computer hard drive can be retrieved, veterinarians often inform owners that a beloved pet has cancer and cannot be cured, and airline staff regularly tell travelers that their flights have been cancelled due to bad weather. For some customer-contact employees, delivering bad news is an unavoidable, delicate, and emotionally-charged task that occurs regularly. Disclosing bad news can be highly stressful and perhaps detrimental for (1) <b>customers,</b> (2) customer- <b>contact</b> <b>employees,</b> and (3) service firms in general. Accordingly, it is crucial for service organizations to better understand bad news encounters (i. e., situations during which <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> must deliver negative information) to better equip their managers and employees to deliver such news to customers. The topic of how to best deliver bad news has been broached in various disciplines, including the medical literature (e. g., Baile et al. 2000, 2002; Rosenbaum et al. 2004), the management literature (e. g., Bies 2013; Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki 2009), and the sociology literature (e. g., Clark and LaBeff 1986). These literatures have (1) examined the attitudes and emotions of the discloser of extreme bad news in very specific contexts, (2) identified the tactics used by disclosers, and (3) developed protocols for delivering extremely negative information. Surprisingly, studies of bad news delivered by <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> are scarce in service research. Service failure and service recovery have received much attention, but this literature has two major gaps when it comes to understanding the delivery of negative information. First, service recovery research generally skips over the initial part of the process where employees first communicate bad news to customers, and instead focuses primarily on the process involved to resolve the situation. Second, there are many situations in which employees must deliver negative information to customers where it is clear that a service failure has not occurred (e. g., informing a customer that his 30 -year old dishwasher is beyond repair). We use the critical incident technique (CIT) (Flanagan 1954; Gremler 2004) to analyze 200 incidents where service employees {{from a wide range of}} service sectors had to deliver bad news to a customer.

40|$|We used data {{obtained}} from <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> in the People’s Republic of China to test a moderated mediation model of the processes through which core self-evaluations (CSE) influence voice behavior. Specifically, we examined personal control and approach/avoidance motivation as psychological pathways and procedural justice perceptions as a moderator of the CSE–voice behavior relationship. As predicted, our results revealed that CSE related to employee voice behavior indirectly through personal control and approach motivation but not avoidance motivation. Furthermore, and consistent with our prediction, results showed that procedural justice perceptions moderated the mediated influence of both personal control and approach motivation on the CSE–voice behavior relationship such that this relationship is stronger when procedural justice perceptions are high but not low. We discuss {{the implications of these}} findings in terms of explanatory frameworks for understanding the documented effects of CSE on employee work outcomes...|$|R

As employee's commitment {{plays an important role}} in ensuring a high-quality service, their commitments are influenced by their personality traits, as they are also known as emotional labour. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dominant personality traits in the company based on the Big Five Personality theory, to assess the level of employees’ commitment to service quality (quality pledge) and its relationship. A structured survey was implied, and 143 <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> participated. From the data analysed, the results show that there is a very strong relationship between personality traits and employees’ quality pledge. Hence, it is recommended for future research to make a comparison between the effect of personality traits towards quality pledge on employee's perspective and also customer's perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{exhaustion}} {{is a type}} {{of burnout}} and a state of mental weariness. It is an important issue for hospitality organizations because <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> and hospitality managers function in an environment that is particularly susceptible {{to the creation of the}} antecedents of burnout. Further, emotional exhaustion itself is costly to hospitality organizations and individuals because it has been shown to result in depersonalization, detachment, decreased service quality and job performance, and increased turnover. Using a sample of 544 hotel managers from 36 hotels located throughout the United States, this study examines whether emotional exhaustion is a function of organizational and occupational characteristics, including job demands, quality orientation, pressure to produce, and need for “face time. ” In addition, this study analyzes whether personality traits of the managers themselves, including extraversion and neuroticism, are predictors of emotional exhaustion. This study found emotional exhaustion of hotel managers to be a function of not only job and organizational characteristics, but of personality characteristics, as well. Key Word...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we bring {{together}} two worlds {{that are usually}} strictly separated in re-search: leadership and customers. Until now leadership research has concentrated par-ticularly on internal organizational processes, whereas customers were analyzed pref-erably {{in the context of}} marketing and service management. Research shows that the range of roles and functions of customers as key company stakeholders has changed dramatically in the last few years. Especially in service companies, customers (and communities), thought of as prosumers (producers and consumers), are active players, which can exert significant influence particularly on <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> and on employee leadership. As only few of the established leadership concepts are open to an inclusion of customers, we choose Kerr/Jermier’s (1978) substitute for leader-ship theory to show how the relationship between boundary spanning employees and customers can be linked to the relationship between an employee (as a follower) and his supervisor (as a leader). The analysis of this interrelatedness shows that customers can actually assume some leadership functions which subsequently will not only affect the behavior of the employees but also that of leaders.

These are customer service and attitude of service personnel, cleanliness of staff and of the physical environment, price and food quality. From the study, it can be concluded that the features of a restaurant establishment are not equally important to guest when evaluating their restaurant experience but rather the product itself and how it is delivered. It can is recommended that hotel restaurants in order to improve guestsâ€Ÿ perceptions of service experience and loyalty, need to motivate and empower <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> so that a smooth service is delivered to the guests.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{explores the}} nature of {{complaint}} satisfaction with particular emphasis on the qualities and behaviors that male and female customers value during personal complaint handling service encounters. Design/Methodology/Approach – A semi-standardized qualitative technique called laddering was used to reveal the cognitive structures of complaining female and male customers. In total, 40 laddering interviews with 21 female and 19 male respondents with complaining experience were conducted. Findings – The research indicates that being taken seriously in the complaint encounter together with the employee’s competence, friendliness and active listening skills are particularly important for {{both male and female}} complainants. Females were more able than male respondents to develop strong associations on the highest level of abstraction and link desired employee behaviors with several values. Female customers tended to be more emotionally involved than male customers as they wanted employees to apologize for the problem and sometimes needed time to calm down and relax. By contrast, male complainants were mainly interested in a quick complaint solution. Research limitations/implications – Due to the exploratory nature of the study in general and the scope and size of its sample in particular, the findings are tentative in nature. As the study involved students from one university, the results cannot be generalized beyond this group even though in this case the student sample is likely to represent the general buying public. Practical implications – If companies know what female and male <b>customers</b> expect, <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> may be trained to adapt their behavior to their customers’ underlying expectations, which should {{have a positive impact on}} customer satisfaction. For this purpose, the paper gives several suggestions to managers to improve active complaint management. Originality/value – Our findings enrich the existing limited stock of knowledge on complaint management by developing a deeper understanding of the attributes that complaining male and female customers expect from <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees,</b> as well as the underlying logic for these expectations...|$|R

In order to improve satisfaction of <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> – caddies in Chinese golf clubs, this paper explores the internal service quality of caddy managers' encounters with caddies from a dyadic perspective (the view of caddy managers and of caddies). Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative multiple-case study methodology was adopted; using critical incident interviews to collect the data. In order {{to make sense of}} the data, narrative analysis is used to interpret favourable and unfavourable stories that are related by participants and why the storytellers told the stories in such a way. Findings – Nine dimensions were found to construct the internal service quality of caddy mangers in internal service encounters between caddies and caddy managers. They are reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, communication, consideration, fairness, recognition and flexibility. Practical implications – The outcome of this research can help the management team to better manage the internal service encounters between managers and caddies in order to improve caddies' satisfaction during service encounters. It can assist Chinese golf clubs in recruiting and training caddy managers. Originality/value – This research extended the service quality framework to the Chinese golf industry.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the instrumentality of Personality tests in {{ensuring}} a higher level of customer orientation in customer-contact employees. It argues for the use of personality tests in selecting customer-contact employees for customer-contact jobs in organizations with a view to ensuring a higher level of customer service. Personality types of employees are proved to be valid explanatory variable of the individual differences in work behaviour (Harell & Harell (1984), Anderson (1977), Hinrichs (1978), Rathnasiri (1998). In a customer and service-provider interface, service provider's personnel value enhances the customer's evaluation of the service consumption moment. This study used an in-depth case study method to study personality and cllstomer-orientation level of six employees. Three cases of poor performers and three cases of superior performers relating to customer service were selected based on the interviews with their superiors and peers. A standard testing instrument called Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was used to test the personality. The customer orientation level was measured by qualitative method using interviews with superiors. The study findings show that intuition-feeling and sensing -feeling type with extrovert personalities are more customer oriented in their behaviour than that of other types. The research implications are important for service-oriented organizations. As the variability in customer service level is attributed to personality type of customer-contact emplpyee; the selection criteria for <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> could include a personality testing to select appropriate personality type...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{focuses on}} {{complaint}} satisfaction {{with a particular}} emphasis on the qualities and behaviours that affect customers during personal complaint handling encounters. Following a literature review of complaint satisfaction {{and the role of}} <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> in complaint encounters, an exploratory study using both the laddering interviewing technique and Kano questionnaires is presented. Design/Methodology/Approach – A semi-standardized qualitative technique called laddering was combined with the Kano Model of Satisfaction. In total, 40 laddering in-depth interviews were conducted with mature students in a business management course. Following the laddering interviews, 35 Kano questionnaires were handed out to students in another business management course who also had complaining experience. Findings – The laddering results indicate that being taken seriously in the complaint encounter and the employee’s friendliness, listening skills and competence are particularly important. The fact that interpersonal factors are highly regarded indicates that customers want to satisfy these process needs first and their outcome expectations second. The Kano results show that employees’ active listening skills are the only must-be requirements while the two concepts “Apology” and “Respectful Treatment” are close to being must-be criteria. In addition, the employee’s feedback after the complaint handling encounter can almost be categorized as an excitement factor. Limitations/Originality/Value – By combing two research methods, the aim of this paper has been to develop an area of research that could reap considerable benefits for researchers interested in the area of customer complaint satisfaction. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and the scope and size of the chosen sample, the results outlined are tentative in nature...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this article}} is to supply {{grounded}} empirical insights into the forms of negative word-of-mouth by front-line, <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The article adopts a qualitative approach through interviews with 54 front-line employees in three retail organizations: food, clothing and electronic goods. Findings: The paper finds four different forms of negative word-of-mouth behaviours which are labelled customer-oriented, anti-management/firm, employee-oriented and anti-competitor word-of-mouth. The paper shows how each of these behaviours varied in terms of the target audience (the intended listeners), the focus of attention (the focal point of comments), the motivation (the perceived rationale for the behaviour) and the extent to which employees perceived their own comments to be truthful. Research limitations/implications: The article calls for an expansion of research horizon to incorporate a fuller understanding of the dynamics of employee (mis) behaviour in the workplace in relation to resistance, subjectivity, instrumentality and clandestine control of certain aspects of workplace dynamics. Practical implications: The findings suggest that managers should be concerned with front-line employee negative word-of-mouth especially because some of the examples which were uncovered are potentially damaging to both financial and non financial performance measures. Originality/value: The article contributes insights into the neglected area of employee negative word-of-mouth. The article argues that the identification of the forms of employee negative word-of-mouth is an important step towards developing a theory of employee negative word-of-mouth that is especially pertinent to front-line service work.

First and underpinned by RBV, I examined at the unit level, collective human capital and competitive advantage as path-ways through which the use of HPWS influences – branch market performance. Second and-, underpinned by social exchange (perceived organizational support) and intrinsic motivation (psychological empowerment) theories, I examined cross and individual level mechanisms through which experienced HPWS may influence employee performance. I tested the propositions of this study with multisource data obtained from junior and senior <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees,</b> and managers of 37 branches of two banks in Ghana. Results of the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that (i) collective human capital partially mediated the relationship between management-rated HPWS and competitive advantage, while competitive advantage completely mediated the influence of human capital on branch market performance. Consequently, management-rated HPWS influenced branch market performance indirectly through collective human capital and competitive advantage. Additionally, results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) tests of the cross-level influences on the motivational implications of HPWS revealed that (i) management-rated HPWS influenced experienced HPWS; (ii) perceived organizational support (POS) and psychological empowerment fully mediated the influence of experienced HPWS on service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), and; (iii) service-oriented OCB mediated the influence of psychological empowerment and POS on service quality and task performance. I discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Purpose: This study seeks to examine how transactional/transformational leadership and trust influence service oriented citizenship behaviours. It was undertaken within the professional services organisation of a leading, independent IT management software company that employs 14, 000 employees globally. Respondents were employed in the European geographical region. Design/Approach: Extending the SOCB literature, this study involved high <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> (IT Service Consultants, Architect and Project/Programme Managers) employed in 14 European countries. Respondents provided self-report data of perceived leadership, trust and SOCBs. Measures were administered online using Survey Monkey. A total of 101 participants provided data for analysis. Correlation analysis, regression analysis and mediation {{analyses were conducted to}} test research hypotheses. Findings: The results indicated that the effects of the transactional/transformational leadership paradigm on SOCBs are primarily direct. Trust was positively related to SOCBs and may explain some of the influence of leadership behaviours on SOCBs. The implication of these findings for future research on leader behaviours, trust and SOCBs are discussed. Practical Implications: This study demonstrates the importance of SOCBs for an IT professional services organisation and how leadership and trust may influence their application. Professional services organisations may benefit from the knowledge that these links are likely to generate favourable outcomes for customers, employees and the organisation as a whole. Originality/Value: This study represents the first attempt to empirically examine the influence of leadership and trust on SOCBs in a professional service organisation in Europe.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} has emphasized the pivotal role that salespeople play in customer satisfaction. In this regard, {{the relationship between}} salespeople's attitudes, skills, and characteristics, and customer satisfaction remains an area of interest. The paper aims to make three contributions: first, it seeks to {{examine the impact of}} salespeople's satisfaction, adaptive selling, and dominance on customer satisfaction. Second, this research aims to use dyadic data, which is a better test of the relationships between constructs since it avoids common method variance. Finally, in contrast to previous research, it aims to test all of the customers of salespeople rather than customers selected by salespeople. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs multilevel analysis {{to examine the relationship between}} salespeople's satisfaction with the firm on customer satisfaction, using a dyadic, matched business-to-business sample of a large European financial service provider that comprises 188 customers and 18 employees. Findings: The paper finds that customers' evaluation of service quality, product quality, and value influence customer satisfaction. The analysis at the selling firm's employee level shows that adaptive selling and employee satisfaction positively impact customer satisfaction, while dominance is negatively related to customer satisfaction. Practical implications: Research shows that customer-focus is a key driver in the success of service companies. Customer satisfaction is regarded as a prerequisite for establishing long-term, profitable relations between company and <b>customer,</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> are key to nurturing this relationship. The role of salespeople's attitudes, skills, and characteristics in the customer satisfaction process are highlighted in this paper. Originality/value: The use of dyadic, multilevel studies to assess the nature of the relationship between employees and customers is, to date, surprisingly limited.

Upon analyzing the current perspective of marketing control, we conclude that it is contingential. As a result, some problems were identified. We suggest that a different, institutional perspective may be more adequate. For our analysis, we assumed as scope the perspective of service encounters. This choice was due to our belief that all businesses are – in essence – service-oriented, and that service encounters bring aspects of the external environment to the internal environment, as <b>customers</b> and <b>contact</b> <b>employees</b> are from the socio-cultural environment.

The paper has hopefully opened up an area of research and methodology that could reap considerable further benefits for researchers interested in the area of customer complaint satisfaction...|$|R
30|$|There {{are five}} {{components}} of a typical service blueprint: “customer actions, onstage/visible <b>contact</b> <b>employee</b> actions, backstage/invisible <b>contact</b> <b>employee</b> actions, support processes, and physical evidence” [7]. In our case study, we used four components of the typical service blueprinting: <b>customer</b> actions, visible <b>contact</b> frontline workers, invisible contact back-office workers, and the supporting process. Customer activities include all steps of customer actions (e.g., ask for service, provide information), choice, and interactions in processes of purchase, consumption, and assessment. Employee activities can be grouped into two generic approaches: frontline workers and back-office staff.|$|R

However, it is recognised that hospitality service jobs are often associated with low pay, long and anti-social hours, unstable and seasonal employment, low job status, a lack of career opportunities and poor levels of benefits. In the light of factors such as these, which are likely to militate against high levels of motivation - and consequently to reduce the quality of customer service - addressing hospitality customer service employees’ motivation {{can be viewed as a}} priority for hospitality management. Inspirational, motivational leaders can motivate employees to ‘perform beyond expectations’ and previous studies of leadership in hospitality have demonstrated a number of positive outcomes related to the presence of inspirational leaders. No studies have been identified, however, that have measured the specific influence of motivational leadership on hospitality service employees’ job performance. To evaluate the contribution of motivational leadership to employee work motivation, work motivation was measured using both employee attitudes and job performance. Data were collected from a sample of non-supervisory waiting staff in hotel businesses in the UK. In total, two hundred and thirteen usable survey forms were returned from twenty seven UK hotels with table service restaurants. All of the participating organisations were rated as three or four stars and the mean number of non-supervisory waiting staff in these hotels was twenty three. The study finds that motivational leadership, alongside employee perceptions of empowerment and employees’ work orientations, contributes positively to both work attitudes and job performance. The research also finds that motivational leadership enhances employees’ work meaning and understanding of organisational goals (mission clarity). In addition to its empirical dimensions, the research contributes to hospitality studies theory by critically appraising the leadership-related hospitality literature and making recommendations for the future progress of hospitality leadership studies...|$|R
40|$|Service {{products}} are consumed by customers {{as soon as}} they are produced and delivered. In the service operations, <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> {{is an essential part of}} the service delivery process. Often, the mode and degree of <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> affects the service quality, and thus <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> could be an important determinant of service quality. <b>Customer</b> <b>contact</b> is an important element of service process design and management for such industries as airline, hotel, restaurant, etc. In <b>customer</b> <b>contact,</b> there are two aspects: quantity and quality of contact. In this paper, we focused on the quantity aspect of <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> and investigated its impact on service quality. This paper examines the relationships between the degree of <b>customer</b> <b>contact,</b> i. e., a quantitative measure, and the service quality, and attempts: 1) to assess the impacts of <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> on the service qualit...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to better}} understand the issues of why individualised communications should be incorporated into customised <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> service and how <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management should be implemented. The qualitative methodology of case research was used. In total nine Australian service industry case studies, involving 34 in-depth interviews, were undertaken. The analysis revealed three themes: optimisation of market factors, the process of implementation, and requirements for smooth <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management implementation. These findings showed minor implementation problems with service and organisational requirements driving <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management implementation overall. In addition, factors to assist with smooth <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management implementation are identified. Limitations, which could be addressed by future research, include application to other industries, expansion to other countries, the consumer perspective and the need for statistical generalisation. Key practical implications include the identification of the need for firms to consider <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management as an avenue for differentiation and competitive advantage as well as providing guidelines for the successful implementation of <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management. This research builds theory about <b>customer</b> <b>contact</b> management for the first time...|$|R
