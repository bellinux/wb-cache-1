40|$|The {{promise of}} {{extended}} tool life or shorter production {{times with the}} application of cryogenic coolants and high pressure emulsions during metal machining is encouraging for the widespread commercial adoption of such technologies. Many researchers have previously investigated these coolant technologies in machining and all have reported various benefits. However, until now no direct comparison of each technology has been made using consistent tooling, <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzle</b> position and cutting parameters in titanium turning. This makes industrial adoption difficult because it is still unknown which technology offers superior tool life. This work investigates the tool life and chip morphology during Ti- 6 Al- 4 V turning using each coolant with constant cutting parameters and <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzle</b> position.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the case}} of {{grinding}} mild steels using a vitrified CBN wheel, considerable wheel wear is caused because ground chips accumulate in the chip pockets of the wheel and the CBN grains fall out from the wheel surface. In this study, in order to suppress the wear of vitrified CBN wheels, the floating nozzle developed by the authors {{was applied to the}} grinding of mild steel materials and the grinding performance was investigated experimentally. It was confirmed that, when the coolant was supplied with the floating nozzle, the wheel wear was reduced in half with a quantity only 1 / 12 times of the one with a conventional <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The surface roughness and surface quality of the ground workpiece were improved by using the floating nozzle.

40|$|High-speed deep {{grinding}} (HSDG) technology was developed based on high-speed and creep-feed grinding techniques. What mainly distinguishes HSDG from creep-feed grinding is its employment of {{a significantly higher}} wheel speed. Because the higher wheel speed results in {{a decrease in the}} undeformed chip thickness, HSDG is thus capable of achieving high stock removal rates and producing a high surface quality throughout the workpiece. However, the increase in wheel speed leads to the formation of a strengthened air barrier around the grinding wheel periphery, which is a great obstacle to the impinging of coolant into the grinding zone. Additionally, the higher wheel speed will also generate greater grinding heat in the grinding zone, thus resulting in a higher temperature. 2 ̆ 7 This increases the risk of thermal damage on the workpiece, such as burns and cracks, especially when grinding metals and alloys. In order {{to take advantage of the}} full potential of HSDG technology, effective cooling must be employed. Great research efforts have been directed toward investigating effective coolant supply technologies for the HSDG process. 71 ° Previous works focused on the development of <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzles</b> for high-speed grinding, which could block the air barrier formation and help smoothly guide the coolant entering the grinding zone. There are several drawbacks regarding these nozzles. First, a gap between the wheel and the air-wiper in the nozzle still exists, which affects the coolant supply when operating at an extremely high speed. Second, the air blocking alters the coolant flow direction, thus resulting in an increase of 30 - 50...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{generation}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in grinding because high temperature can limit wheel life and also induce defects such as residual stress and micro cracks in workpieces. Coolant is therefore extensively used in order to reduce the heat effect. In order to deal with the problems associated with the existing cooling methods, an ultrasonic <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzle</b> system was designed and examined in this project. Variable ultra high frequency vibration strength can be obtained and delivered to coolant during grinding by the proposed system. Characteristic studies were carried out to find relationships between the input and output parameters. Via the preliminary tests, the effects of coolant flow rate on surface roughness of ground samples were investigated by using the proposed system. Under the normal coolant temperature of 22 °C and a cooled coolant temperature of 4 °C, experimental results show that, without use of activation, an increase in the number of nozzle nnzl leads to a reduction in surface roughness of ground samples up to approximately 8. 5 %. In addition, the effects of interaction of coolant flow rate and vibration strength on surface roughness of ground samples were examined through the tests. Based on the experimental results, it is found that an increase in coolant amount with activation leads to a reduction in surface roughness of ground samples up to approximately 13 %. Through the factorial orthogonal test, the order of importance of four input parameters in relation to surface roughness was obtained. Key input parameters were selected for further studies. With a fixed coolant flow rate, the effects of the parameters on loading current I, surface roughness Ra, Rq, Rz and Rt were obtained. The results show that the proposed cooling method can effectively improve workpiece surface quality. With a reduction in coolant temperature tc from the normal coolant temperature of 22 °C to a cooled coolant temperature of 4 °C, the surface roughness value was reduced by up to 22 %. The grinding force was increased by approximately 21 %. With an increase in activation, the surface roughness value was reduced by up to approximately 14 %. The grinding force was reduced by approximately 11 %. SEM images together with the experimental results show that the best results were obtained by using the actively cooled and activated coolant under the low coolant temperature and high activation strength conditions...|$|E

Besides of recent innovation in fracture toughness curves and reference temperatures being already in the codes, also the effect of loss of constraint had to be considered when fracture toughness values determined from deep cracks in fracture toughness specimen with high multi-axial state of stress were transferred to crack configurations in the component. Thus, the available concepts were compared for their fitness for purpose, i. e. {{for their ability to}} give a fracture toughness representative to the crack configuration or flaw postulate in the component. The results of the investigation reveal a significant lower constraint in the component resulting in increased fracture toughness and showing that the brittle failure assessment based on the high constraint fracture toughness from the standard specimens can be very conservative. For consideration of the constraint conditions in the component besides the deterministic T-stress parameter also probabilistic local approach concepts based on the Weibull model were used which have the advantage of considering both the local stress strain field and the material volume under high loading. The loss of constraint was determined for several flaw postulates in the leading situations on the RPV being the <b>coolant</b> inlet <b>nozzle</b> corner and the flange joint. A considerable loss of constraint was demonstrated for flaw postulates with broken clad in the ferritic nozzle corner. Also in the flange joint the loss of constraint is evident for small flaws.

There was an anomaly {{at the end}} of the launch in that the main engines shut down 0. 16 second early because sensors detected a low level of oxidizer in the LOX tank (actually the duct from the tank to the vehicle). This resulted in a cutoff velocity for the vehicle that was 16 ft/sec low. It should have been 25872 ft/sec. The OMS engines were subsequently used to achieve the proper orbit. An investigation was immediately initiated into the cause of this LOX tank low level cutoff. It was noticed during the launch that the turbine temperatures for Main Engine 3 (E 2019) were approximately 100 F higher than the preflight prediction. Linear Engine Model matching of the data indicated that a nozzle leak best fit the data.

The following aspects of the sub-scale coolant delivery system were analyzed with CFD: 1) a design trade study of a mechanical flow splitting device for uniform distribution of the subsonic cavity flow, 2) a design trade study of the subsonic cavity lip to achieve film integrity, and 3) an analysis of the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. All design calculations were performed with the Generalized Aerodynamic Simulation Program (GASP), a 3 -D, multi-block, generalized Navier-Stokes code capable of solving with frozen, finite-rate or equilibrium chemical kinetics. The initial design of the subsonic cavity flow used square posts to distribute the sonic orifice jets into a uniform flow. Calculations for this design indicated that an unacceptable mal-distribution of film occurred. Design modifications involving curved and slotted posts were computed in an effort to uniformly distribute the secondary coolant flow. Analysis of these configurations showed that although the flowfield improved in uniformity, it was still unacceptable, especially at higher feed pressures. Results from these studies were then incorporated into a design that resulted in the insertion of a porous metal ring into the subsonic cavity. Subsequent water flow model studies showed that this concept was successful in uniformly distributing flow exiting the cavity. In addition to the design of the subsonic cavity, CFD was also used to analyze the secondary coolant lip and the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. A series of calculations were first performed to modify the subsonic cavity lip contour.

Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized braze joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for braze joint property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser braze joint was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good braze joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser braze joint has shown that quality braze joint was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser braze joint comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser brazing. Laser braze joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality braze joints comparing to other localized braze process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized braze comparing to a full furnace braze cycle...|$|R
