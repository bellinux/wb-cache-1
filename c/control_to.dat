5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this <b>control</b> <b>to</b> specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|A liberal, Anspach {{feared the}} {{weakness}} and rigidity {{of the government}} and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task. However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the city of Brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely kept his office in 1869 by-elections.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and <b>control</b> <b>to</b> improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial <b>control.</b> <b>To</b> enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological <b>control</b> <b>to</b> protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes {{had a change of heart}} and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again. He approached Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of Australian cricket's Board of <b>Control,</b> <b>to</b> ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team. Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.|$|E
5|$|Charles R. Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built {{around the country to}} help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

5|$|Days {{before the}} election, Morrow exposed a {{contract}} {{approved by the}} state Board of <b>Control</b> <b>to</b> purchase cloth from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to the allegation by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding {{on behalf of his}} brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too little <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the player, leading to the game being boring at times.

5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to stop herself, although she has enough <b>control</b> <b>to</b> open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E

A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning <b>control</b> <b>to</b> Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord. Goldman {{continued}} to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, to convert it to a housing co-operative. The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred <b>control</b> <b>to</b> a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the {{government}} issued {{a policy to}} limit its financial support to one shrine per village. This state supported shrines that followed its specific guidelines for funding, and encouraged unfunded shrines to become partners with the larger shrines. As {{a result of this}} initiative to consolidate Shinto beliefs into state-approved practices, Japan's 200,000 shrines had been reduced to 120,000 by 1914, consolidating <b>control</b> <b>to</b> shrines favorable to the state interpretation of Shinto.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of <b>Control</b> <b>to</b> make it an official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated {{that this was the}} best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|In 886 Alfred took {{possession}} of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; {{as it had}} traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed <b>control</b> <b>to</b> Æthelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year Æthelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent {{the next three years}} fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health may have declined, and Æthelflæd may have become the effective ruler of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|In January 1962, Suharto was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar. This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's Konfrontasi, against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that Konfrontasi would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the 2 million-strong Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.|$|E
