5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the <b>capture</b> <b>plate,</b> but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} plates and continents {{on the planet}} 2 ̆ 7 s surface are a manifestation of {{long-term}} mantle convection and plate tectonics. Present-day plate velocities provide a snapshot of this ongoing process, and {{have been used to}} infer controlling factors on the speeds of plates and continents. However, present-day velocities do not <b>capture</b> <b>plate</b> behaviour over geologically representative periods of time. To address this shortcoming, we use a plate tectonic reconstruction approach to extract time-dependent plate velocities and geometries from which root mean square (RMS) velocities are computed, resulting in a median RMS plate speed of ∼ 4 cm/yr∼ 4 cm/yr over 200 Myr. Linking tectonothermal ages of continental lithosphere to the RMS plate velocity analysis, we find that the increasing portions of plate area composed of continental and/or cratonic lithosphere significantly reduces plate speeds. Plates with any cratonic portion have a median RMS velocity of ∼ 5. 8 cm/yr∼ 5. 8 cm/yr, while plates with more than 25...|$|E
40|$|The Fastener <b>Capture</b> <b>Plate</b> {{technology}} {{was developed to}} solve the problem of capturing loose hardware and small fasteners, items that were not originally intended to be disengaged in microgravity, thus preventing them from becoming space debris. This {{technology was}} incorporated into astronaut tools designed and successfully used on NASA s Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission # 4. The technology s ultimate benefit is that it allows a very time-efficient method for disengaging fasteners and removing hardware while minimizing the chances of losing parts or generating debris. The technology aims to simplify the manual labor required of the operator. It does so by optimizing visibility and access to the work site and minimizing the operator's need to be concerned with debris while performing the operations. It has a range of unique features that were developed to minimize task time, as well as maximize the ease and confidence of the astronaut operator. This paper describes the technology and the astronaut tools developed specifically for a complicated on-orbit repair, and it includes photographs of the hardware being used in outer space...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an easy and rapid detection and identification system for the diagnosis of mycobacterial diseases. The system is based on selective amplification by PCR of mycobacteria with primers based on the genes coding for 16 S rRNA. During PCR, a label (digoxigenin- 11 -dUTP) is incorporated with biotinylated species-specific oligonucleotides (oligonucleotide-specific <b>capture</b> <b>plate</b> hybridization [OSCPH]. One oligonucleotide specific for the genus Mycobacterium and seven species-specific (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. scrofulaceum, M. xenopi, M. genavense, and M. chelonae) oligonucleotides were designed as capturing probes. After specific hybridization, an enzyme immunoassay reveals the specifically bound complexes and thus permits identification of the mycobacterium. A total of 70 mycobacterial strains were tested. For 69 strains, results concordant with conventional identification were obtained. One M. chelonae strain was negative with the M. chelonae probe and was later reidentified as M. fortuitum. Moreover, for 15 clinical samples suspected of harboring nontuberculous mycobacteria, OSCPH was able to confirm all culture results and could identify one M. genavense infection for which standard culture results were negative. PCR-OSCPH is easily applicable and much faster than culture. It could become a valuable alternative approach for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of toxins A, B, and E from Clostridium botulinum {{was accomplished by}} use of a modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing labeled horse antibody and either chicken antibody or biotinylated horse antibody. The complexes formed in solution phase were captured onto solid phases coated with rabbit anti-chicken immunoglobulin G (chicken antibody) or avidin (biotinylated antibody). The assay {{was brought to the}} sensitivity of the mouse bioassay (5 to 10 pg/ml, or 0. 03 to 0. 07 pM) by employing as labeling enzyme the factor X activator of Russell's viper venom (RVV-XA) and a sensitive coagulation-based assay amplification system known as enzyme-linked coagulation assay. Complex formation was found to be a slower reaction than binding to the <b>capture</b> <b>plate,</b> and so the assay used a preincubation step to produce the solution-phase complexes before they were bound to the solid phase. Keeping the concentrations of Russell's viper venom factor X activator antibody and capture antibody constant for diluted samples and diluting complexes into buffer without keeping labeled antibody concentrations constant were equivalent in allowing the detection of low neurotoxin concentrations. This ELISA-enzyme-linked coagulation assay procedure is a convenient alternative to the mouse bioassay, which shows complete resolution of the neurotoxins in addition to the requisite sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|A DNA-binding matrix was {{immobilized on}} the surface of a 96 -well {{microplate}} and used for plasmid DNA preparation for DNA sequencing. The same DNA-binding plate was used for bacterial growth, cell lysis, DNA purification, and storage. In a single step using one buffer, bacterial cells were lysed by enzymes, and released DNA was captured on the plate simultaneously. After two wash steps, DNA was eluted and stored in the same plate. Inclusion of phosphates in the culture medium was found to enhance the yield of plasmid significantly. Purified DNA samples were used successfully in DNA sequencing with high consistency and reproducibility. Eleven vectors and nine libraries were tested using this method. In 10 l sequencing reactions using 3 l sample and 0. 25 l BigDye Terminator v 3. 1, the results from a 3730 xl sequencer gave a success rate of 90 – 95 % and read-lengths of 700 bases or more.

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a <b>capture</b> <b>plate</b> and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater).

40|$|Branched DNA (bDNA) assays to {{quantify}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) consist of three distinct steps, including sample processing, hybridization, and detection, and utilize the System 340 platform for plate incubation and washing. Sample processing differs: HIV- 1 from 1 ml of plasma is concentrated by high-speed centrifugation, whereas HCV plasma or serum samples are used without concentration. The first step of hybridization involves viral lysis at 63 °C: HIV- 1 is performed in a heat block, whereas HCV is performed in System 340. The remaining hybridization and detection steps are similar for HIV- 1 and HCV and executed on System 340. In the present study, the HIV- 1 bDNA assay was adapted for viral lysis in the System 340 platform. The adaptation, test method 2, includes a 20 -s vortex of concentrated viral pellet and lysis working solution, transfer of viral lysate to the 96 -well <b>capture</b> <b>plate,</b> and transfer to System 340 programmed for HCV assay specifications. With test method 2, specificity and quantification were within assay specifications. HCV bDNA methodology remains unchanged. Hence, an HIV- 1 and an HCV bDNA can be run simultaneously on System 340. With simultaneous testing, laboratories can run full plates, as well as combinations of full and partial plates. Also, simultaneous HIV- 1 and HCV bDNA permits labor consoli-dation and improved workflow while maintaining multitasking and rapid patient result turnaround.

Specimens from 10 patients from the area of Zangnanado (Department of Zou, Benin) with advanced, ulcerated active M. ulcerans infections were studied by direct smear, histopathology, culture, PCR, and oligonucleotide-specific <b>capture</b> <b>plate</b> hybridization (OSCPH). A total of 27 specimens, including 12 swabs of exudate collected before debridement and 15 fragments of tissue obtained during debridement, were submitted to bacteriologic and histopathologic analysis. The histopathologic evaluation of tissues from all six patients so tested revealed changes typical of those caused by M. ulcerans infection. Five specimens were contaminated, and M. ulcerans was cultivated on Löwenstein-Jensen medium from 12 of the remaining 22 (54. 5 %) specimens. Detection of mycobacteria was performed by PCR, and M. ulcerans was detected by OSCPH with a new probe (5 '-CACGGGATTCATGTCCTGT- 3 ') reacting with M. ulcerans and Mycobacterium marinum. In 10 of 22 (45. 5 %) specimens, M. ulcerans was identified by PCR-OSCPH. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the detection of M. ulcerans by culture and by PCR-OSCPH (P > 0. 05). This is the first demonstration of an amplification system (PCR-OSCPH) with a sensitivity similar to that of culture for the direct and rapid recognition of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. This system is capable of identifying M. ulcerans, even in paucibacillary lesions.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the behaviour of low-order beam and plate elements especially for their application to laminated structures. The merits and dements of the existing elements are brought out and new low-order elements with better interpolation polynomials are proposed. Two new beam elements are proposed for laminated composite beams that yield better representation of twist due to material coupling. Out of the two elements developed, one {{is based on the}} conventional formulation and the other on the coupled-field formulation, both capturing material induced coupling. The beam developed using coupled field formulation shows a novel way of obtaining a fully coupled interpolation function for field variables using the complete set of equilibrium equations for the composite beams. The element has shown a superior coarse mesh performance. These elements can practically <b>capture</b> <b>plate</b> behaviour in beam elements {{for a wide range of}} plate thickness. The locking problems in conventional 4 -node quadrilateral elements, such as shear locking and geometric locking are studied. Various techniques available in literature to remedy these problems are also studied. A suite of QUAD 4 with conventional techniques such as. Reduced Integration, Field Consistency, Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial strain Components, Assumed Natural Strain, Discrete Shear Gap, Incompatible modes Q 6 and QM 6 is developed. An effort is made to combine these techniques to develop new element that yields improved performance. The element is shown to exhibit improved performance for certain cases. Several four-node rectangular elements are developed based on the coupled-field techniques. First two new-coupled elements are formulated that employ Sabir's [101] plane bending formulation with drilling degree of freedom, and the plate bending rotations are generated using equilibrium equations. However, since Sabir's plane bending interpolation polynomials yielded inaccurate performance for composites, it led to development of elements with fully coupled field formulations. Finally, two new 4 -node rectangular elements are developed using coupled-field formulations with six and seven dof freedom per node respectively. Here the interpolation polynomials are derived using the complete equilibrium equations. The elements are extensively tested for static deflection, dynamics and buckling of isotropic and laminated plates/beams. The elements show superior coarse mesh convergence. Several problems pertaining to vibration and buckling of composite plates/beams are solved using the elements developed in this work...|$|E
