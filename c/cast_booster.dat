40|$|To {{obtain the}} melt <b>cast</b> <b>booster</b> {{explosive}} formulation with high energy and low critical detonation diameter, melt cast explosives {{were designed by}} 3, 4 -bis(3 -nitrofurazan- 4 -yl) furoxan (DNTF) / 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) /glycidyl azide polymer-energetic thermoplastic elastomer (GAP-ETPE) /nano- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetraazacyclooctane (HMX) /Aristowax. Furthermore, the impact sensitivity, small scale gap test, rheological properties, propagation reliability, and detonation velocity were measured and analyzed. The results show that when the mass ratio of DNTF/TNT/GAP-ETPE/nano-HMX/Aristowax is 34. 2 / 22. 8 / 2 / 40 / 1, {{not only does it}} indicate excellent rheological property but it has a brilliant safety performance as well. Moreover, it can propagate the detonation waves successfully in the groove at 0. 7 [*]mm × 0. 7 [*]mm. When the charge density in the groove is 1. 70 [*]g·cm− 3, its detonation velocity can reach 7890 [*]m·s− 1...|$|E

50|$|ANFO is a {{tertiary}} explosive, {{meaning that}} it cannot be set off by the small quantity of primary explosive in a typical blasting cap. A larger quantity of secondary explosive, known as a primer or a booster, must be used. One or two sticks of dynamite were historically used; current practice is to use Tovex or <b>cast</b> <b>boosters</b> of pentolite (TNT/PETN or similar compositions).|$|R
50|$|They {{provide the}} {{explosives}} used in coal and metal mining, quarry and construction {{as well as}} pipeline and seismic used {{for oil and gas}} exploration. The types of explosives manufactured includes ammonium nitrate, dynamite, electric, non electric and electronic detonators, detonating cord and <b>cast</b> <b>boosters.</b> They also produce surface and underground loading systems. In 2012 Dyno Nobel had over a million tons of ammonium nitrate capacity and over 30 manufacturing facilities on two continents.|$|R
50|$|An industrialist, engineer, and inventor, Alfred Nobel's father, Immanuel Nobel, built {{bridges and}} {{buildings}} in Stockholm. His construction work {{inspired him to}} research new methods of blasting rock. Immanuel's work with explosives later on inspired Alfred to make explosives safer and more effective. Today dynamite is mainly used in the mining, quarrying, construction, and demolition industries. Dynamite is still the product of choice for trenching applications, and as a cost-effective alternative to <b>cast</b> <b>boosters.</b> Dynamite is occasionally used as an initiator or booster for AN and ANFO explosive charges.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche hazard {{mitigation}} programs routinely use explosive {{charges to}} release ava-lanches and test slope stability, but fundamental understanding of snowpack response to explosive deto-nations is lacking. This project, conducted in southwest Montana, aimed to verify past findings and further {{develop an understanding}} of snow explosive interactions, particularly for hard slab conditions. Past re-search collected dynamic snow responses 10 - 100 m from the detonation site while the current study placed an instrumentation suite within 3 - 5 m of the detonation. Pentolite <b>cast</b> <b>boosters</b> (0. 9 kg) were deto-nated from 0. 0 m to 2. 0 m above the hard slab snow surface. An array of six orthogonally paired accel-erometers, inserted into the snowpack at three different depths at two locations from the blast, recorded snow accelerations. High pressure sensors, located at and above the snow surface, measured air over-pressures. Distances, radial and horizontal, from the explosives and charge height were scaled to TNT equivalents to aid in explosive placement comparisons. A substantial advantage was recorded in maxi-mum snow accelerations due to elevating the explosive. Vertical and radial attenuation functions within the snowpack were determined from accelerometer data. Using the attention functions, predictions for depth and range of affected snow were developed. While the depth of affected snow did not increase substantially with a raised explosive, the range did show significant increases yielding an 80 - 100 % in-crease in the volume of snow impacted by the explosive. The data also demonstrated that there was vir-tually no penalty in shockwave attenuation from raising the explosive...|$|R

40|$|A {{seismograph}} {{was used}} {{in a series of}} tests to measure the shockwaves produced in the snowpack from the detonation of explosives. Two different explosives commonly used in avalanche work were tested. Different shot placements in relation to the snow surface were compared, different types of snowpack were compared, and different size charges were compared. The results showed that a two pound <b>cast</b> Pentolite <b>booster</b> and a 3 x 8 cartridge of ammonia gelatin dynamite produced almost identical shockwaves. Air blasts were shown to produce slightly larger shockwaves than surface blasts. While buried shots produced much smaller shockwaves than air or surface blasts. A charge detonated 25 cm (10 inches) below the snow surface produced shockwaves of approximately half the amplitude of a surface or air blast. Ground waves were shown to be insignificant, even when charges were detonated on the ground surface. When comparing different snowpacks, the results show that shockwaves penetrate deeper with less attenuation into a harder snowpack, than they do into a softer less dense snowpack. When comparing different size charges, it was shown that doubling the shot size would approximately double the area that was affected by the shockwaves to the same degree...|$|R
