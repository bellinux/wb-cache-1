The bind binary operator (>>=) chains {{the results of}} one computation that <b>could</b> <b>fail,</b> into a function that chooses another computation that <b>could</b> <b>fail.</b> If the first argument is Nothing, the second argument (the function) is ignored and the entire operation simply fails. If the first argument is Just x, we pass x to the function {{to get a new}} Maybe value, {{which may or may not}} result in a Just value.|$|E

Some blamed Braddock, some blamed his officers, some blamed the British regulars or the colonial militia. George Washington, for his part, supported Braddock and found fault with the British regulars.|$|E

25|$|A leaking pipe {{was found}} at 1.00 AM. The leakage stopped {{an hour after the}} valves were closed. 12,000 liters water with high levels of {{radioactive}} strontium were lost, according to TEPCO much of this water escaped through a nearby sewer-system into the ocean. Investigations should reveal how much water was lost into the ocean, and how the joint <b>could</b> <b>fail.</b> A similar leakage in at the same facility happened on 26 March 2012.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E
25|$|Outside-out {{patching}} {{gives the}} experimenter {{the opportunity to}} examine the properties of an ion channel when it is isolated from the cell and exposed successively to different solutions on the extracellular surface of the membrane. The experimenter can perfuse the same patch {{with a variety of}} solutions in a relatively short amount of time, and if the channel is activated by a neurotransmitter or drug from the extracellular face, a dose-response curve can then be obtained. This ability to measure current through exactly the same piece of membrane in different solutions is the distinct advantage of the outside-out patch relative to the cell-attached method. On the other hand, it is more difficult to accomplish. The longer formation process involves more steps that <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> and results in a lower frequency of usable patches.|$|E

25|$|BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland {{through an}} {{underwater}} tube structure. The tube {{is composed of}} welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock overfill. Subsequent seismic analysis indicated {{the possibility that the}} overfill <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly overstressing the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by vibratory compaction of the overfill covering the tube. Additional stabilization includes the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, H. A. Jones, the {{official}} {{historian of the}} RAF wrote that the battle showed that infantry co-operation would be a permanent feature of British air operations. Recognition flares had proved effective, although there had been too few and because of infantry were reluctant to risk revealing their positions to German artillery observers. Scheduled illumination was a failure and infantry began {{to wait for a}} call from the contact aeroplane, by signal lamp or by klaxon. RFC observers reported that direct observation was the most effective method and that flying low enough to be fired on worked best, although this led to many aircraft being damaged and one lost to a British shell. Artillery-observation was hampered by bad weather but the rolling countryside led to constant demands for sorties for counter-battery fire; when the weather grounded the RFC, attacks <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> for lack of observation.|$|E
25|$|In early August, the {{seemingly}} inevitable came to pass, and Stapleton {{confirmed that the}} sponsor search had proven fruitless and the team would not continue in 2012. From the time the team first assumed the Highroad moniker in 2007 to the time its disbanding was announced, they had accumulated 484 victories among the men's and women's teams, including 54 Grand Tour stages. By the end of 2011, that number increased to 513 wins. The cycling world reacted with shock and sadness to {{the announcement of the}} team's demise. Cavendish was quick to point that HTC Corporation's sponsorship had kept the team from folding two years prior, but most reactions were based on disbelief that a team which won so frequently <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> to find a sponsor. Lewis was described as taking the announcement particularly hard, as he was still injured from his Giro d'Italia crash and unable to race at the time. All team riders eventually found new contracts.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Politburo {{arranges}} a bomb blast in the Kremlin that {{destroys the}} Council of Ministers Building and kills seven visiting Young Octobrists from Pskov. The Soviet government {{claims that the}} bombing was a terrorist attack by Gerhardt Falken, a West German spy. (Toland speculates that Falken is actually a KGB sleeper agent.) The Soviets demand {{the dissolution of the}} Federal Republic of Germany at a press conference. Despite optimism from the Politburo, the military leaders of the Soviet Armed Forces quickly realize that the plan <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> despite the Party's military doctrine of surprise. Sergetov, who has been disillusioned by the Kremlin attack, shares his concerns with General-Colonel Pavel Leonidovich Alekseyev, deputy to the commander of the Kiev Military District. Although Alekseyev refuses to share his full concerns out of a mistrust for politicians, Sergetov volunteers his son Ivan, an Arabic language specialist in the Soviet Army, to Alekseyev's command. Ivan confides that his father was not involved in the bombing to gain Alekseyev's trust.|$|E

After a visit to the area by the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. president Ronald Reagan issued the first presidential disaster area declaration for the state of Utah. The landslide eventually formed a dam that created a lake [...] long and over [...] deep. Concerned the dam <b>could</b> <b>fail,</b> the state of Utah decided to build a tunnel to re-route the flow of the Spanish Fork River. The residents of downstream Spanish Fork were told to be prepared to evacuate. Engineers estimated that if the dam failed, they would have 30 to 45 minutes notice before the water reached the city.|$|E

500|$|When Scott & Bailey was recommissioned for {{a second}} series it was {{announced}} that production on the series would commence at the end of October 2011, to be aired in 2012. In November it was reported that while filming on Hamilton Road, Whitefield—the set of DC Scott's home—that an emergency call was made after a member of the television crew, a lighting technician, became stranded atop a [...] "cherry-picker style platform" [...] 12 metres (39ft) above the ground. Fearing the mechanism <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> and cause the crew member to fall to the ground, they sought assistance from firefighters, who safely brought the technician to the ground.

500|$|The {{underwater}} {{side protection}} had numerous faults, however. It was extremely strong amidships, but weakened on {{either end of}} the citadel. The underwater protection could only stop a [...] warhead in these areas. Another significant weakness in the design was the arrangement of the torpedo bulkhead. It was connected to the lower portion of the sloped deck, at an angle of 10°; two riveted angled bars held it in place. The bars were constantly under a great deal of stress, due to normal bending forces in the hull. When combined with the explosive force of a torpedo warhead, the bars could not sustain the increased pressure and <b>could</b> <b>fail.</b> Also, the beam of 30m meant that the protection system had to be weaker around the main battery turrets, as a significant amount of the hull space was taken up by the magazines and barbettes.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{called the}} song a [...] "perfect adult {{contemporary}} confection".

500|$|Further, Liddell {{stated that}} one of Pickingill's covens was the New Forest coven, a Wiccan group which Gerald Gardner—the founder of Gardnerian Wicca—claimed had {{initiated}} him in 1939. However, Liddell did later state {{that he was not}} certain whether this was true. He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received [...] "the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own Bricket Wood coven. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the [...] "Third Rite" [...] from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing that in Gardnerian Wicca. As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that [...] "no impartial observer <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> to see that they formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca." [...] Liddell believed that while many hereditary witches despised him, Gardner represented [...] "the spiritual heir of Pickingill", because he had similarly reformed and propagated witchcraft for contemporary purposes.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{claimed the}} film's time {{constraints}} did not capture {{the depth and}} complexity of the television serials and called Wright's adaptation [...] "obviously [...] daring or revisionist" [...] as the serial. JASNA president Joan Klingel Ray preferred the young age of Knightley and Macfadyen, saying that Jennifer Ehle had formerly been [...] "a little too 'heavy' for the role." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, while praising Knightley for an outstanding performance [...] "which lifts the whole movie", considered the casting of the leads [...] "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle." [...] He does add that [...] "Only a snob, a curmudgeon, or someone with necrophiliac loyalty to the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> to enjoy [...] performance." [...] At the time, BBC film critic Stella Papamichael considered it Knightley's [...] "best performance yet." [...] Critics were divided about Macfadyen's portrayal of Darcy, expressing pleasant surprise, dislike for his lack of gradual emotional shift as in the novel, and praise for his matching the insecure and sensitive personality of the book character better than Firth.|$|E
500|$|CF6 engines {{like that}} {{containing}} the crash disk {{were used to}} power many civilian and military aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. The fan disks on at least two other engines were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. [...] Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. [...] The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, “the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. [...] It also means that any AD (Airworthiness Directive) action that is based on the serial number of a disk <b>could</b> <b>fail</b> to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.” [...] The FAA report did not explicitly address the impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk.|$|E
