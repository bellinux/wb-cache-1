40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the need to}} devise novel strategies to create smart services specifically designed to non-metropolitan areas, i. e. <b>countrysides.</b> These solutions must be viable, cheap an should {{take into consideration the}} different nature of <b>countrysides,</b> that cannot afford the deployment of services designed for smart cities. These solutions would have an important social impact for people leaving in these <b>countrysides,</b> and might slow down the constant migration of citizens towards metropolis. In this work, we focus on communication technologies and practical technological/software distributed architectures. An important aspect for the real deployment of these smart shires is their simulation. We show that priority-based broadcast schemes over ad-hoc networks can represent an effective communication substrate to be used in a software middleware promoting the creation of applications for smart shire scenarios.
