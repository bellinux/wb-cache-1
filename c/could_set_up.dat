5|$|The Soviet Union {{sought to}} {{dominate}} {{the internal affairs of}} countries that bordered it. During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties. Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> country parks, {{under the}} Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had {{stated that they}} were prepared to hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E

5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, steering components, drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic companies <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> their own production. The Finnish suppliers were unable {{to meet the requirements}} with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles. The original, calculated price per vehicle had been 765,000marks but the eventual cost was 800,000marks.|$|E

However, due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President Michael Morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.|$|E

25|$|The {{railways}} had regained {{control of}} their own finances in August 1921 and were again dependent on their own resources. However, a large number of former military lorries had come on to the second hand market and, with no system of licensing in place, anyone who wished <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as a common carrier. In August 1921, James Cowie, the NCC's manager, estimated that 50 000 tons of goods traffic was being lost annually.|$|E
500|$|Though James {{always played}} forward in her {{community}} hockey leagues, Trempe converted her to defence {{so that she}} <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the plays and incorporate her teammates into the offensive systems the team used. Despite the change in position, James still {{led the league in}} scoring in 1982–83, recording 15 goals and 10 assists in an 8 game season. She was named the OCAA's most valuable player, but Seneca settled for the silver medal after losing the OCAA finals. [...] Leading the OCAA with 30 points in 10 games in 1983–84, James carried Seneca College to its first championship. She was named an all-star on defence, and again voted the most valuable player. [...] James won both awards again the following season. Seneca repeated as champions in 1984–85 while James dominated the OCAA. [...] She again led the league in scoring, setting school and association records with 50 goals and 73 points in just 14 games. Her scoring exploits led a Toronto reporter to call James [...] "the Wayne Gretzky of women's hockey".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{dedicated}} a {{large portion}} of his analysis to Rose. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised her role in the episode as been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's, being inquisitive about several concepts: why Rose was shocked when she heard the Doctor had died, but later being knowledgeable about Donna's history and destiny; whether if Rose was travelling between universes or just time-travelling; why Rose herself didn't convince Donna to turn left instead of sending Donna on a suicide mission; why Rose didn't change her clothes between her appearances; and why Rose refused to tell anyone her name. He noted the allusion to the concept of the power of names previously referred to in [...] "The Shakespeare Code", [...] "Last of the Time Lords", and [...] "Silence in the Library", but ultimately theorised that the reason was so Davies <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the episode's cliffhanger.|$|E

Besides the standard rifle, {{there was also a}} carbine version, 962 mm (37.9 in) long, which was intended for the cavalry and other troops who needed a shorter or lighter weapon. [...] It had a visor that <b>could</b> be <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to 1500 m. The prototype was called the [...] "Type 29 rifle" [...] and, after enhancements, was redesignated as the [...] "Type 30". It went into production in 1899. This weapon could be equipped with the Type 30 bayonet.|$|R
2500|$|Armstrong {{realized}} that this was a potential solution to the [...] "short wave" [...] amplification problem, since the beat frequency still retained its original modulation, but on a lower carrier frequency. To monitor a frequency of 1500kHz for example, he <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an oscillator at, for example, 1560kHz, which would produce a heterodyne difference frequency of 60kHz, a frequency that could then be more conveniently amplified by the triodes of the day. He termed this the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] often abbreviated to [...] "IF".|$|E
2500|$|Brăileanu's writings, {{including}} his articles in teachers' magazines, shifted toward developing a Romanian [...] "elite theory" [...] {{and the role}} of state pedagogy in cultivating a fresh political establishment.

The authors acknowledged that {{an independent}} Scotland would [...] "need to come to some arrangement {{with the rest of the}} UK" [...] on intelligence-gathering, cyber-warfare and cyber-defence, that the future cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment of its forces might be higher due to smaller orders, and that recruitment and training [...] "may prove problematic" [...] in the early years.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times {{defended the}} decision, {{noting that the}} 1862 act that banned bigamy, though [...] "obviously {{directed}} at the polygamous practices of the Mormons, merely extended over the Territories the common law in relation to bigamy which exists in every State of the Union." [...] Its editorial ridiculed the Mormon defense of polygamy as a religious practice and said: [...] "Similarly, a sect which should pretend, or believe, that incest, infanticide, or murder was a divinely appointed ordinance, to be observed under certain conditions, <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> that {{the enforcement of the}} common law, as against either [...] of these practices, was an invasion of the rights of conscience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opponents, such as Henry Kissinger, who {{was himself}} {{the subject of}} war crimes charges in Spain, argue that {{universal}} jurisdiction is a breach of each state's sovereignty: all states being equal in sovereignty, as affirmed by the United Nations Charter, [...] "idespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of {{the proper role of}} international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny – that of judges." [...] According to Kissinger, as a practical matter, since any number of states <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> such universal jurisdiction tribunals, the process could quickly degenerate into politically driven show trials to attempt to place a quasi-judicial stamp on a state's enemies or opponents.|$|E
2500|$|With no timeouts, Riley impressively {{drove his}} team up to Oregon State's 12-yard line. Early in the drive, Riley barely avoided getting sacked {{in the end}} zone for a safety and then {{completed}} an 18-yard pass to Hawkins. [...] Riley also converted a 19-yard pass on 4th and 17 to Hawkins to keep the drive alive. [...] In the game's final play, with a 3rd down and 14seconds left, Riley chose to scramble towards the end zone instead of spiking the ball to set up a field goal to take the game into overtime. He was unsuccessful, tackled after a 2-yard gain. The clock ran out before Cal's field goal unit <b>could</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> on the field, giving Oregon State the victory.
