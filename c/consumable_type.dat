40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of power supply {{characteristics}} on the fume generation rate, composition and characteristics of the fume was carried out using mild steel and stainless steel wire consumables. Inductively coupled plasma elemental analysis, atomic absorption spectrometry, x-ray diffraction, particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry were used to characterise the fumes and to gain insight into what occurs in the arc region during welding. Significant decreases in fume formation rate were found for several combinations of power source and <b>consumable</b> <b>type.</b> Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition. However, the results for the stainless steel suggested that the highest hexavalent chromium (Cr^Vl) levels were achieved with more sophisticated power supplies...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} {{of the current}} Department of Navy's (DoN) method of supplying <b>consumable</b> <b>type</b> material through its retail outlet (SERVMART) in Alameda, CA. to the fleet and supporting shore facilities e. g. USS Abraham Lincoln CVN- 72 and Naval Air Station Alameda, CA.). It focuses on the initial purchase price, General Service Administration (GSA) surcharge, and labor and non-labor costs of the SBRVMART operation at FISC Oakland. The research compares the total costs of buying and managing the 212 highest selling items (top 20 %) inventoried at the SERVMART to similar items sold by commercial vendors in the Oakland area. The research results show that these items are less expensive to the customer when purchased at SERVMART. However, direct purchases of paper products and cleaning supplies from the GSA depot in Stockton {{were found to be}} cheaper than buying from the SERVMART. In addition, a customer survey indicated that the SERVMART customers are not satisfied with the selection, quality, availability, and customer service levels present at SERVMART Alameda. As a consequence, the recommendation is made to eliminate the SERVMART Alameda operation and allow the SERVMART customers to use a combination of GSA Stockton for paper products and cleaning supplies and local vendors for rest of their non-military consumable item needs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying welding {{conditions}} on multipass weld metal {{has been investigated}} in all-weld test plates produced by flux cored arc (FCA) welding. The principal welding conditions varied for the test samples in the current research program were heat input (between approximately 1 and 2. 5 kJ/mm), welding technique (stringer or weave beads), shielding gas, welding position (flat or vertical) and <b>consumable</b> <b>type.</b> Mechanical testing of weld metal included tensile testing and Charpy-vee-notch impact tests over a range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 40 °C. The tensile testing results showed that yield and tensile strength generally decreased with increasing heat input and that the changes were {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. Impact properties showed more varied behaviour depending on <b>consumable</b> <b>type.</b> The effect of varying welding conditions on some less commonly studied microstructural factors has also been investigated, such as proportions of reheated and double-reheated regions and mean free path (MFP) in various distinctive microstructural zones. Using the simplifying assumption that the structural gradient the heat affected zone (HAZ) of reheated weld metal can be characterized in terms of three regions: the grain coarsened, GC; grain refined, GR and intercritical, IC heat affected regions; a second overlapping weld bead creates double-reheated weld metal structures which can be defined in terms of 9 sub-zones: GC-GC, GC-GR, GC-IC, GRGC, GR-GR, GR-IC, IC-GC, IC-GR, IC-IC. Linear and areal measurement techniques have been used on cross-sections of seventeen test plates to determine the volume fractions of solidified weld metal (SW), GC, GR and IC sub-zones of the reheated weld metal and the double-reheated zone. The hardness variation in the sub-zones and the influence of welding conditions has also been investigated in the present research. The mean free path was determined for SW, GC, GR and IC regions and the overall average mean free path of ferrite in each weld was also calculated to provide a characteristic length of the totality of the structural microconstituents in the weld metal. Strong relationships were found between mean free path and heat input and also with the strength of the weld metal. In contrast, toughness correlated poorly with overall mean free path. Impact toughness {{is one of the most}} important mechanical properties of welds. Assessment and understanding of the impact properties of welds is central to the avoidance of catastrophic failure of welded steel structures. Neural networks analysis has been used for the purpose of assessing which factors are beneficial to the low temperature impact properties of steel welds in order to obtain practical guidance as to how impact properties might be improved in FCA welds. Four major data fields were involved in the training of the neural networks: chemical composition, microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and welding condition. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the neural network model revealed that the characteristics of the non-metallic inclusion distribution exerted only a small direct influence on toughness. In contrast, chemical composition and microstructure were indicated to be very important. In particular the toughness is predicted to increase with increasing % acicular ferrite and % reaustenitised region and these factors in turn are sensitive to the selected FCAW process and the welding conditions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this PhD research was to develop safe highly optimised welding procedures for high hardness armour (HHA) steel welded with austenitic stainless steel consumable. This involved optimisation of currently used flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) process, adjustment of the procedure for fully automated welding in combination with metal-cored consumable and finally assessment of feasibility of the advanced laser-gas metal arc welding (laser-GMAW) hybrid welding using solid consumable for potential future replacement of the current process. The aim was to significantly improve economics of welding fabrication while ensuring weldment with desired properties. The alloy design of the HHA has been altered prior to commencement of this research adopting novel low manganese approach. To develop welding procedures with optimised parameters a deep understanding of parent material properties was crucial. Hence, the initial effort focused on detailed property and weldability characterisation of the modified HHA steel. This included comprehensive metallography investigation, hardness testing and also development of continuous cooling transformation diagrams directly applicable to welding. The optimisation of preheat temperature was required as the industry recently adopted austenitic stainless steel consumable that replaced the conventional ferritic filler and because AS 1554 does not differentiate between austenitic and ferritic fillers the level of preheat employed in industry practice remained as per procedure developed for ferritic filler. Further, AS 1554 does not provide any guidelines for determination safe interpass temperature range which has {{a significant effect on}} productivity particularly for robot controlled welding thus upper interpass temperature threshold was also determined experimentally. The main concern when welding high strength Q 2 ̆ 6 T steels is hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) and heat affected zone (HAZ) softening. Preheating is carried out to eliminate the risk of HACC therefore the process of determination of lower preheat temperature threshold considered all three factors contributing to this phenomenon. The level of diffusible and residual hydrogen present in the HAZ and weld metal were measured employing collection of hydrogen over mercury and inner gas melt extraction methods for all three <b>consumable</b> <b>types</b> (flux-cored, metal-cored and solid). Magnitude of residual stresses resulting from different levels of preheat were evaluated by measuring the angular distortion. Susceptibility of HAZ microstructure formed under variety preheat conditions was assessed using hardness testing and colour etching technique to determine volume fraction of various microstructural constituents. The degree of HAZ softening resulting from different levels of interpass temperature was evaluated utilising colour etching and hardness testing. Feasibility of laser-GMAW hybrid welding was investigated employing 3. 5 kW diode laser coupled with GMAW torch in combination with solid austenitic stainless steel consumable. The procedure for typical joint of a land platform was developed significantly reducing the number of welding passes compared to weldments produced using conventional GMAW. The joint properties were assessed using the same techniques as employed for weldments produced with metal-cored arc welding (MCAW) and FCAW. The objectives of this work have been achieved resulting in optimised welding procedures for HHA steel. Additionally, from the entire family of high strength Q 2 ̆ 6 T steels HHA possesses a highest carbon content, carbon equivalent, hardenability and thus it is the most difficult to weld hence the findings of this research work can be applied to all high strength Q 2 ̆ 6 T steels. Further, the proposed approach based on the difference in transformation temperature of WM and HAZ can be used as an effective tool for future assessment of hydrogen control in steel welding. Findings of this research regarding optimised preheat and interpass temperatures for welding of high strength Q 2 ̆ 6 T steels are being reviewed by DSTO and Australian Standard Committee to be incorporated into standard AS/NZS 1554. 4 - Structural steel welding - Welding of high strength quenched and tempered steels and also relevant defence standard...|$|R
40|$|DNA-based capture-mark-recapture (CMR) {{techniques}} {{are commonly used}} to obtain population parameters of black bears (Ursus americanus) in rural and wildland landscapes; however, these techniques have not been implemented in urban clusters (i. e., 2, 500 to 50, 000 residents). Black bears can readily habituate to urban clusters, and wildlife managers need to monitor and manage these urban bear populations. We modified DNAbased CMR for black bear using hair-snares {{to take into account}} the small home ranges of urban bears, urban bear behavior, and human safety within Mammoth Lakes, California, USA. We conducted this study for 3 fi eld seasons in 2010, 2011, and 2012 from June to July. Each fi eld season, we implemented a CMR with 6 encounter occasions, each 7 days in length. We used the traditional corral hair-snare design modified for human safety and chose multiple non-consumable and minimally <b>consumable</b> lure <b>types</b> to prevent food conditioning and a trap-happy response. In 2012, we also tested 3 additional hair-snare designs more appropriate for urban areas: natural rub, haphazard-wire snare, and tennis ball snare. In 2010, we collected an insufficient number of hair samples for CMR by putting hair-snares in the periphery of the urban cluster, which we call the urban–wildland interface. However, in 2011 and 2012, when we put hair-snares in the city center as well as the surrounding urban–wildlife interface and increased hair-snare density, we obtained a sufficient number of hair samples to estimate population density using closed capture CMR models. These adjustments to hairsnaring study design in urban areas helped increase capture and recapture rates to be similar to our wildland area. To achieve high capture rates using hair-snares in the urban area, we put out hair-snares at a density approximately 4 times greater than in our wildland study area and distributed them throughout the entire urban area, and not just on the urban–wildlife interface. In addition, setting hair-snares near anthropogenic features used by bears in urban areas (e. g., culverts, utility poles, dumpsters) and adding spent cooking oil to lures also increased our capture rate. Finally, the corral hair-snare had the highest capture rates of our 4 hair-snare designs. After adapting a study design for hair-snaring wildland bears, our methods were efficient for urban areas, having high capture and recapture rates (3 ̆e 0. 30) and good precision for abundance estimates (coefficient of variatio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was to build and {{validate}} a back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) to predict the level of diffusible hydrogen (HD) based {{on a variety of}} flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) parameters such as welding current, contact-tip to work piece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type for single run, horizontal bead-on-plate steel welds using seamed and seamless rutile consumable wires (Model 1). A probabilistic artificial neural network model (PANN) was then applied to determine the likelihood of hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) in a gapped bead-on-plate (GBOP) test based on the level of HD and welding preheat temperature (Model 2). This approach could be applied to ‘real life’ situations with the availability of sufficient data. Results are also presented for a sensitivity analysis for Model 1, which identifies the key input variables and the effect they have on the output, HD. It was determined that the <b>consumable</b> <b>type</b> and the CTWD were the key variables. A seamless consumable with a H 5 classification and an increase in the CTWD, as well as increases in current led mostly to a decrease in the level of diffusible hydrogen. Additionally, Model 1 predicted that using a 25 %CO 2 – 75 %Ar shielding gas, instead of 100 %CO 2, and an increase in absolute humidity (a function of relative humidity and temperature) in the surrounding atmosphere led to an increase in diffusible hydrogen deposited into the weld metal (WM). Finally, based on the predictions of Model 2 it was established that for the given welding conditions hydrogen cracking in a GBOP test could be avoided by maintaining hydrogen levels at less than ∼ 3 mL/ 100 g or using a preheat temperature slightly higher than 100 °C. Analysis of the data also led to the conclusion that further data were required for the GBOP tests when the hydrogen levels were between 4 and 8 mL/ 100 g to correct and improve confidence {{in this part of the}} model...|$|E
40|$|Particulate fume {{generation}} {{rates and}} fume composition have been measured {{for a range}} of continuous wire arc welding consumables as a function of power supply type. Welding wires considered included gas-shielded cored wires of the rutile-flux, basic-flux and metal core types, for joining structural steels; gas-shielded solid and flux-cored wires for stainless steel; and an open-arc surfacing wire. The range of power supply types used included conventional (transformer-rectifier) DC units, conventional (transistor switched) pulsed supplies as well as both low frequency and high frequency inverter-based power supplies. The inverter type power supplies were used in both the DC and pulsed modes. In all cases fume measurements were made at average welding currents at the low and high ends of the normal operating ranges. Significant decreases in fume formation rate, compared to that from conventional DC power supplies, were found for several combinations of power source and <b>consumable</b> <b>type.</b> The magnitude of these reductions depended on the particular power source/wire combination. For the cored joining wires for structural steels the reductions in fume formation rates were generally in the range 20 to 50 % with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed and pulsed high frequency inverter supplies. Both the solid and cored wires for stainless steel also showed considerable reductions in fume generation rate with certain power supplies. Reductions of about 60 % compared to those from conventional DC power supplies were found from both stainless steel wire types with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed power supply. Fume generation rates from the open-arc surfacing wire were found to be reduced by 30 to 50 % in some instances and again the most consistent reduction was with the conventional-pulsed supply. Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition. This was certainly the case for the flux-cored wires for structural steel. However the results for the stainless steel and hardfacing wires suggested that the lowest hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) levels were achieved with the conventional DC power source...|$|E
