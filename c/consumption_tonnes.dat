40|$|Variation in wood density, {{tracheid}} length, resin content, and {{incidence of}} compression wood in radiata pine are documented and discussed {{with respect to}} their potential influence on pulp and paper manufacture. In general terms, each of the properties mentioned tends to decrease southwards within New Zealand. Tree average wood density, for instance, drops 20 % from Auckland to Canterbury Conservancies (455 to 380 kg/m 8). This decrease will result in increased handling costs and wood <b>consumption</b> per <b>tonne</b> of pulp produced, and reduced chemical pulp digester yields. For paper quality, variations in tear index as a consequence of wood property changes are predicted to be substantial. Thus regional wood resource qualities need to be matched with those paper and paperboard products which can be most effectively manufactured from them. Packaging grades of kraft pulps which require high tear strength should, therefore, be produced from the higher density wood found in parts of the Auckland, Rotorua, and Nelson Conservancies...|$|R

40|$|The {{smelting}} {{of nickel}} laterite ores to ferronickel alloy {{is unique in}} extractive metallurgy. It treats feed that is very low grade {{with respect to the}} target metal and, as a result, produces much more waste slag than valuable metal product. The energy <b>consumption</b> per <b>tonne</b> of product is therefore high and requires sustained research and design development in an effort to improve the economics of laterite smelting. In this work, the main characteristics of nickel laterite smelting are reviewed, and then a simple and transparent computational thermodynamics model of the electric furnace smelting step is developed. This model predicts the nickel grade, nickel recovery and FeO content of the slag as functions of the iron recovery to ferronickel satisfactorily. It correctly predicts that the carbon and silicon contents in ferronickel increase sharply at high iron recoveries. However, in common with more sophisticated models, it incorrectly predicts the iron recovery at which this increase is observed in practice. It is concluded that the model provides an accessible and a satisfactorily accurate vehicle for understanding the relationships between process variables and process outcomes during nickel laterite smelting...|$|R

30|$|In 2003, {{fuel and}} {{emission}} efficiency were 0.031 – 0.044  kg of oil equivalent per tonne kilometer and 91.1 – 127.5  g of CO 2 equivalent per tonne kilometer respectively. Compare to 1997 data, {{there was a}} small improvement of impact of transport operations on the environment during the studied period (Table 3). The improvement was due to technological development of new vehicles. Fuel and emission efficiency indicators were obtained relating the absolute indicators, fuel <b>consumption</b> in <b>tonnes</b> oil equivalent (toe) and tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (tCO 2 e), to transport work expressed as tonne kilometers [29]. The fuel consumption is estimated from the running kilometers considering: an average consumption value of 0.25 – 0.35  l/km in 2003 and 1997 [26, 29, 30], and using the equivalences of 41.87 petajoules per mtoe and 38.66 megajoules per liter of diesel [31]. The tCO 2 e are directly estimated from the toe using the equivalence of 0.345 toe per tCO 2 e [31]. With the range of values, uncertainties of fuel and emission efficiencies were bounded and sensitivity analysis of the estimates could be calculated. Conversion equivalences are kept constant. Therefore, the fuel and emission efficiency values given in this paper are representative of mean conditions and must be used exclusively as reference values.|$|R

They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode.

A heater with average wood <b>consumption</b> of 4 <b>tonnes</b> per year therefore emits 37.6 kg of PM2.5, i.e. particles less than 2.5 micrometers.

So one new wood heater emits as much PM2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000 km a year. A recent European study identified PM2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant, causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths. The next worst pollutant, ozone, is responsible for 21,000 premature deaths.|$|R

Numerical experiments are carried out to investigate influence of key operating and design parameters on energy consumption of kilns.

40|$|In view of {{the gradual}} global banning of {{chemicals}} used in pest control in packaging fruit, the Cook Islands have trialled and adopted a viable alternative in heat treatment which meets quarantine requirements for their exports of papaya. In a good year, the country produces, besides for domestic <b>consumption,</b> 258 <b>tonnes,</b> worth US$ 322, 000, for export mainly to New Zealand. Previously ethylene dibromide (EDB) was used to control fruit flies (Bactrocera melanotus and B. xanthodes), the quarantine pests which require control in papaya. Since 1994 however, New Zealand has banned imports of produce treated with this fumigant. The Cook Islands therefore adopted a high-temperature forced-air (HTFA) treatment, comprising basically a treatment of 47. 2 %C for 20 minutes in sealed chambers. There is one heat treatment facility in the Cook Islands, with a capacity to treat 1, 600 tonnes of fruit annually. Heat-treated mangoes have been exported and there are plans to expand exports to other produce, including aubergines (eggplants). If carried out properly, the treatment even enhances the market quality of fruit. It produces an even colour on the fruit, and slows down the rate of internal ripening. This helps to extend fruit shelf-life and the fruit flesh does not develop the bitterness which is characteristic of fruit treated with EDB. The treatment can also be adapted for controlling temperate pests in avocadoes, litchis, bell peppers, nectarines and apricots.
