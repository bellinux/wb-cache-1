25|$|The {{advocacy}} model {{takes the}} point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS. Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or <b>case</b> <b>manager)</b> and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.|$|E

25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their <b>case</b> <b>manager</b> and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition.

So when he and Amanda assist Ted Walsh (Terry Brady), a prominent doctor with similar suspicions, Morello begins to investigate - which leads him to suspect prominent cardiologist Rupert Carr (Frank Gallacher). As Morello confides in Happy, he begins attempting to stop Carr's practices, without coming out and speaking his mind, which will ultimately result in the end of both their careers. When Andrew goes up on his own charges, Happy recalls Jamie back to MDA so that Andrew can be dismissed. As everyone including MDA turns against him, news about his wife Lucy (Jane Allsop) ultimately compels Andrew to make a final decision. Meanwhile, Amanda goes up against Gabrielle Bromley (Wendy Hughes), a fierce prosecuting attorney.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore case managers’ {{perceived}} changes in their practice in the future when consumer-directed care (CDC) is widely implemented in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s community aged care system. Purposeful sampling was used and semi-structured individual and group interviews were conducted between September 2012 and March 2013. Participants were drawn from a list of all <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> who administered publicly funded community aged care packages in Victoria, Australia. Empowerment theory was used to guide the analysis and interpretation of the data. The thematic analysis revealed that <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> had mixed views about CDC. They also perceived changes in case managers’ practice in the future when CDC is widely implemented. These might specifically include: first, <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> would not directly manage clients’ budgets. While some <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> were concerned about losing power for this change, others believed that they would still have important financial roles to perform, such as setting rules, providing financial support and monitoring clients’ use of budgets. Second, <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> would focus on performing roles in providing information, and empowering, facilitating and educating clients. These would help to strengthen clients’ capacities and assist them to self-manage their care. Third, <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> would work in partnership with clients through frequent or skilful communication, mutual goal setting and goal facilitation. Fourth, <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> would manage more clients. In addition, they would provide less support to each individual client and perform less care co-ordination role. The findings suggest <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> paying attention to power balance regarding budget management in a CDC environment. Furthermore, they might frequently or skilfully communicate with, empower, facilitate and educate clients; work together with them to set up goals; and facilitate them to achieve goals.

40|$|The {{significant}} role of <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> {{in improving the}} health status of clients and in achieving cost-containment has been increasingly recognized. However, very few studies have touched on the emerging group of <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> who work exclusively with frail older adults. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the level of overall job satisfaction and some of its determinants among <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> of the Visiting Nurse Health System, Atlanta, Georgia, working primarily with older adults in two community-based programs. The objectives were to learn: (1) the level of overall job satisfaction among these case managers; (2) how these <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> perceive their role; and (3) what factors facilitate their work, what factors present barriers to their job performance, and what policy or procedural changes they feel would improve their performance. An established job satisfaction scale was employed to assess job satisfaction among the <b>case</b> <b>managers.</b> The overall job satisfaction scores ranged from 109 to 198 (out of a maximum possible score of 216), with a mean of 158. 2, which is considerably higher than the theoretical mid-point of the scale (126). Nine subscales of job satisfaction, ordered by the satisfaction level from highest to lowest were, Coworkers, Supervision, Nature of Work, Communication, Contingent Rewards, Fringe Benefits, Operating Conditions, Pay, and Promotion. <b>Case</b> <b>managers</b> in the Older Group (aged 45 and older) showed higher overall satisfaction compared to those in the Younger Group (younger than 45). Furthermore, satisfaction levels with Fringe Benefits and Operating Conditions were significantly higher in the Older Group than in the Younger Group. No significant difference was found in job satisfaction between <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> in the two programs (CCSP and CBSP). <b>Case</b> <b>managers</b> with longer experience (at least 4 years) showed a higher satisfaction level with Pay compared to those with shorter experience (less than 4 years) in their current program. No significant difference in job satisfaction was found between social worker and nurse <b>case</b> <b>managers,</b> except that nurse <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> were significantly more satisfied with Fringe Benefits than social worker <b>case</b> <b>managers.</b> Qualitative analysis of the interview found that <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> tended to describe their role in terms that were either related to program objectives or activities. They viewed their role more as providing or ensuring services to their clients than as cost-containment. At the same time, initial assessment appeared to be the most important component of their role compared to other activities, such as evaluation or contact with service providers. Nature of the work, management, and coworkers are the three major sources of facilitating factors reported. On the other hand, the majority of deterring factors, related to operating procedures, pay, promotion, supervision, funding, and management, fell in the category of organizational factors. Deterring factors related to individual factors were related to communication and coworker relationship. Long-term study is needed to learn the job satisfaction among <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> working primarily with older adults and to determine what contributes to or undermines their job satisfaction.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown assertive community treatment (ACT) <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> report less staff burnout than traditional <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> (Boyer, 1991). To help identify potential protective features of the ACT model, the current study examined ACT-relevant predictors of burnout (e. g., shared caseloads, daily team meetings) {{as well as other}} predictors which have not received much attention in the literature (geographic location, race, and personality traits). Potential consequences of burnout to both staff (turnover and absenteeism) and clients (satisfaction with services and hospital usage) also were examined. Seventy-two ACT <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> participated in this study, with longitudinal data available for 38 (53 %) of the sample. As hypothesized, several job/role characteristics relevant to ACT were predictive of burnout (i. e., caseload size, frequency of client contact, and proportion of clients with substance abuse problems were positively associated with burnout). Tentatively, fidelity to the ACT model predicted lower levels of team burnout. However, contrary to expectations, frequent team meetings were associated with increased burnout. Regarding other predictors of burnout, rural <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> reported significantly more burnout than urban <b>case</b> <b>managers.</b> In addition, Caucasian <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> and <b>case</b> <b>managers</b> who were racially incongruent with the majority of their caseload reported higher levels of burnout. Personality traits (optimism and sense of coherence) were moderate predictors of lower levels of burnout. However, staff burnout had little effect on hypothesized consequences. Burnout is a rich construct, and several areas for future research were identified. A model for future examination of ACT and burnout and a model for the conceptualization of staff burnout within a coping framework were provided. ...|$|R
