50|$|In many countries, when a {{customer}} fills out {{an application for}} credit from a bank, credit card company, or a store, their information is forwarded to a credit bureau. The credit bureau matches the name, address and other identifying information on the <b>credit</b> <b>applicant</b> with information retained by the bureau in its files. The gathered records are then used by lenders to determine an individual's credit worthiness; that is, determining an individual's ability and track record of repaying a debt. The willingness to repay a debt is indicated by how timely past payments {{have been made to}} other lenders. Lenders like to see consumer debt obligations paid regularly and on time, and therefore focus particularly on missed payments and may not, for example, consider an overpayment as an offset for a missed payment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the conditions for}} credit volume or borrower rationing in a competitive credit market in which the project characteristics are private information of the borrowers. There can only be credit volume rationing if the higher-risk <b>credit</b> <b>applicants</b> have a higher return {{in the event of}} a project success than the lower-risk <b>credit</b> <b>applicants.</b> Then the higher-risk borrowers are not rationed and obtain the social efficient credit volume. If the incentive compatibility constraint of the higher risk borrowers is binding, the lower-risk borrowers are credit volume rationed such that the constraint holds as an equation. If credit volume rationing is not sufficient to separate the borrower types, there is additionally a rationing of the low-risk borrowers. If the low-risk borrowers prefer a pooling to a separating contract, then there will not be a Cournot-Nash separating equilibrium, but a Wilson and a Grossmann pooling equilibrium...|$|R

However, some distinctions seem to emerge between large enterprises and SMEs.

30|$|The {{thesis on}} {{relative}} comparative advantage {{according to which}} banks {{do not have an}} immediate competitive advantage in terms of cost of collecting information from other lenders. This benefit derives, however, from the information gradually acquired during a stable and long-lasting relationship with the client, gaining access to confidential information. Therefore, as the length of the relationship increases, the incremental cost of additional information acquired by the bank decreases, and in this way, the bank manages to fund the firm more efficiently. According to this view, the value created by the credit relationship lies not only in quantitative information (balance sheets, financial reports) but also in qualitative information collected by the bank on the <b>credit</b> <b>applicant.</b> These relationships are called relationship lending (Hodgman 1961; Sharpe 1990; Petersen and Rajan, 1994; Boot and Thakor 1994; Berlin and Mester 19921999; Boot 2000; Ongena and Smith 2000; Corigliano 2007).|$|E

40|$|Consider a bank which {{wishes to}} decide whether a <b>credit</b> <b>{{applicant}}</b> will obtain credit or not. The bank has to assess if the applicant {{will be able to}} redeem the credit. This is done by estimating the probability that the applicant will default prior to the maturity of the credit. To estimate this probability of default it is first necessary to identify criteria which separate the "good" from the "bad" creditors, such as loan amount and age or factors concerning the income of the applicant. The question then arises of how a bank identifies a sufficient number of selective criteria that possess the necessary discriminatory power. As a solution, many traditional binary classification methods have been proposed with varying degrees of success. However, a particular problem with credit scoring is that defaults are only observed for a small subsample of applicants. An imbalance exists between the ratio of non-defaulters to defaulters. This has an adverse effect on the aforementioned binary classification method. Recently one-class classification approaches have been proposed to address the imbalance problem. The purpose of this literature review is three fold: (I) present the reader with an overview of credit scoring; (ii) review existing binary classification approaches; and (iii) introduce and examine one-class classification approaches...|$|E

However, funding a start-up company may pose a significant problem as they hold only limited historical economic data and often conduct business on strict capital budgets. It is therefore of interest to break down the central factors in the assessment and analyse the process as a whole. The purpose of this report is to describe, elaborate and analyse the credit assessment process of Swedbank and SEB and the impending challenges that may surface when dealing with different industries. The report is limited to start-up business entities in the Gothenburg Area. The report has been executed using a qualitative method and an abductive approach. The empirical data has been collected through semi-structured interviews with four respondents from the banks. The report showed that factors essential to the assessment are; the company management, the relationship between the creditor and the <b>credit</b> <b>applicant,</b> corporate and personal financial data, the business plan, past experience and securities available. When dealing with different industries, advisors are expected to have general knowledge in different industries, but there are no industry-specific advisors.

The report also showed that the assessment process is permeated by rigorous laws as well as internal framework and protocol, however, there is still a risk of subjective influences on the final decision...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]In all EU {{countries}} today, lenders {{can access}} information in databases {{to help them}} assess the creditworthiness of a <b>credit</b> <b>applicant.</b> The establishments that compile these databases are known as credit bureaus, credit registries or credit reporting agencies. Credit bureaus gather information on the payment history of borrowers and issue credit reports prior to the underwriting of a loan, whether {{for the purpose of}} buying a house, a car, opening a credit line or simply subscribing to a mobile telephone service. In the United States, data from credit bureaus on consumer borrowing, payment behaviour and other aspects of household finances have become the cornerstone of underwriting decisions on consumer loans. Credit bureaus in the United States collect and store comprehensive data for over 200 million adult residents. More than 2 million credit reports are sold by credit bureaus every day. It is widely accepted that the development of the credit bureau industry has played an essential role in the expansion of the North American credit market. The type and quantity of data available and the mechanisms by which this information is shared vary greatly across EU countries. Lenders often provide information to credit bureaus voluntarily, although in some cases, the authorities impose this disclosure via public registers. The data collected can vary over time and between countries and usually consist of past instances of default or payments having fallen in arrears (known as ‘negative’ information). The data can also be of a ‘positive’ nature, however, to include a customer’s outstanding liabilities, maturities and other details about his or her credit history...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in the retail banking sector is that of evaluating the creditworthiness of credit applicants. This problem is addressed by the methodology of credit scoring. The methodology of credit scoring involves the construction of models (i. e. credit scoring models) which classify each <b>credit</b> <b>applicant</b> into one of two classes: the class of applicants who are predicted not to default with their obligations and are granted credit and the class of applicants who are predicted to default with their obligations and are not granted credit. The goal of this thesis is to study the methodology of credit scoring and how this methodology can be implemented by means of computer software applications. In pursuing this goal, this thesis examines the theoretical background of the methodology of credit scoring and analyzes credit scoring data by means of the XLMiner software package and constructed software templates. Within the framework of credit scoring data analysis, methods used for the construction of credit scoring models are assessed. Particular emphasis is given into the method known as the Naive (Simple) Bayes Rule (NBR). Specifically, a real-world credit scoring data set from a major Greek bank is used to benchmark NBR against linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, classification trees and k-nearest neighbours. Five partitions of this data set into training and test sets are used. Predictive ability is measured by the percentage of correctly classified cases and the bad rate amongst accepts. NBR appears to have a lower predictive ability than the other methods under both the aforementioned predictive ability measures. This result may be attributed to properties inherent in the field of credit scoring, i. e. significant dependence given the class of the variables used in this field and large training set sizes. The results allow the application of NBR as a method for the construction of credit scoring models, because of the small (statistically non-significant) differences in predictive ability between the methods and the simplicity of NBR. ...|$|E

For small businesses in Sweden, banks {{are the most common}} source of financing of external capital, and to avoid credit losses, banks makes a credit assessment of the <b>credit</b> <b>applicant.</b> In the recruitment process, that could resemble the personal assessment when granting loans, social media is used; this has brought the authors interest in exploring the possibility of also using social media in the lending process. Since the use of social media in lending previously never have been studied, {{the purpose of this study}} is to understand how and why social media are taken into account in banks lending to companies, and also to describe in what parts of the lending process banks use social media. Twelve qualitative interviews with lenders and managers of social media have been done to answer the problem statement. How and why do banks use social media in lending to businesses? The results of this study show that creditors use and are willing to use social media in credit granting for companies. In the current situation, the use of social media is limited but is to some extent used to create a first impression and feeling of the borrower before the first meeting. This leads to both theoretical and practical implications regarding the use of social media in lending. Social media affects the credit granting process in varying degrees with the greatest impact at the first stage, the credit application. It also affects the follow-up of the credit as warning signals, and indirectly the credit assessment and credit decision. Social media can also form an additional network for the creditor and lead to a better assessment of the applicant, through this; the bank can avoid credit losses. The study has also developed a model that facilitates lenders understanding of how to incorporate social media in credit granting. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this PhD thesis {{is to make a}} {{contribution}} to existing knowledge in the field of critical accounting by studying credit mechanisms and their link to income/wealth inequality in Sri Lankan society and the role of accounting technology in facilitating such mechanisms. The literature review revealed that: a) Global inequality is aggravated by the disparity of economic development which is possible only through state intervention; b) Unemployment is considered as a dilemma for economic development in developing countries by most politicians/administrators/researchers; c) In any country, around 60 - 70 percent of employment is generated by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and; d) Their major problem is access to credit. This research was designed to find out how the credit system works and why certain SMEs do not have adequate access to credit to develop their businesses; to provide employment; to increase the share of national income to the lower income groups; to narrow down the gap between the rich and poor within and between countries. A case study research approach was followed to extract data on real-life experiences of the research participants. Reliability of data was ensured by using various verification techniques and maximum efforts were made to balance the two extremes of validity of the research; internal and external. The extent of representation by the cases and the bank was tested, and judged as high, with 12 - 14 characteristics common to the Sri Lankan credit culture and banking industry respectively. Marxian critical theories were used for theoretical guidance throughout the research. The three case studies provide empirical evidence for the existence of the discriminatory nature of credit decision-making where two credit applicants were successful but a third <b>credit</b> <b>applicant</b> failed in obtaining credit. It is contended that the two successful applicants were powerful enough to approach a more powerful bank Chairperson and to obtain credit outside the normal credit rules with the support of accounting technology and using masks such as patriotism and social responsibility. The other applicant, who was initially accommodated with credit at the lower level, could not convince the credit decision-makers at the higher level with expensive professionally prepared accounting reports. This applicant was not from an influential social network and could not reach the powerful credit decision-makers informally was rejected through strict application of credit rules. Deep analysis of these facts supports the Marxian claim that credit and exploitation mechanisms work towards concentration of wealth and sustaining income inequality. Credit decisions supply money to influential individuals and it is argued that such economic power enhances the social powerbase of those individuals, which in turn reinforces the propensity to make preferential credit decisions, thereby making them richer. In contrast, a lack of money translates into powerlessness, deprivation and exclusion from social activities {{for the majority of the}} poor. In this process opportunities are lost to disadvantaged social groups and this necessarily results in poor people’s economic status remaining stagnant. These power-driven, discriminatory decision-making systems not only restrict the availability of financial capital for feasible projects, but also deny credit to potential enterprises. Further, wasting resources on unfeasible projects, while ignoring the need for nurturing potentially viable projects, are a double blow to efforts towards employment generation and economic development and therefore, are detrimental to the economic well-being of the general population. These findings provide insight for policy formulators for more productive financial capital mobility systems in Sri Lanka. It is suggested that suitable State intervention in regulating SME financing could remove such credit-related obstacles to economic development, and work towards a fair distribution of economic benefits to the people in Sri Lanka and beyond...|$|E

We assume {{information to be}} asymmetric with respect to customer characteristics that directly affect bank profits. We analyze the impact of horizontal differentiation, which serves as an index for the degree of competition among banks, on loan-granting practices. We show that with more differentiation (less competition), banks may screen <b>credit</b> <b>applicants</b> less intensively in equilibrium because they compete less aggressively for the most profitable customers. As a result, welfare may actually increase as competition becomes less intense. Total profits may either increase or decrease {{with the introduction of}} asymmetric information. ...|$|R
