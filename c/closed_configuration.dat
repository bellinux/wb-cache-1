40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model for}} voltage-dependent gating of channels in which the gating charges are on the channel wall and move only a small distance. When this movement occurs across the closed gate, the charges move through the entire transmembrane potential, which is energetically equivalent to their moving across the entire membrane. The channel exists in two open states, O 1 and O 2, and two closed states, C 1 and C 2; each open and <b>closed</b> <b>configuration</b> {{is divided into two}} states because of the two possible positions of the gating charges. An unusual property of this model is that the electrical work in going from an open to a <b>closed</b> <b>configuration</b> (for example, in going from O 1 to C 2) is path dependent, and net work can result from going reversibly around a complete cycle. The model channel, like many biological channels, shows bursting activity. This flickering on and off of the channel enables the gate to sense the electric field and decide if it should be in the open or <b>closed</b> <b>configuration.</b> We prove here some general theorms concerning the electrical work associated with the movements of the walls of channels and the movements of charges on these walls...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the regrind stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open circuit configuration, over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to <b>closed</b> circuit <b>configurations</b> because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The circuit configurations studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage <b>closed</b> circuit <b>configurations.</b> The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the regrind circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open circuit configuration from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage circuit configurations and the I-stage <b>closed</b> circuit <b>configuration</b> proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage <b>closed</b> circuit <b>configuration.</b> Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the circuit configurations by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the <b>closed</b> circuit <b>configuration...</b>|$|R

Simulations are performed for <b>closed</b> aortic valve <b>configurations</b> and the open aortic valve configuration.
