50|$|King's Highway 135, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 135, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario on the southern edge of London, following Exeter Road, which it is better known as. This short highway was an important <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> during the construction of Highway 401. The road's main purpose was to link Highway 401 in London with Highway 2 in Lambeth, {{at a time when the}} London-area section of Highway 401 was only completed to the interchange with Highway 4 (Colonel Talbot Road).|$|E
50|$|From 1987 through 1989 the {{terminal}} was expanded and renovated advertising a design by Phillip Jacobson and BPLW Associates. The satellite gate building {{was replaced with}} two concourses, A and B, giving the Sunport 19 new gates, all with jetbridges. Concourse A was further expanded in 1996 with four additional gates. The new above-ground <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> to the concourses was greatly expanded in 2005 to accommodate {{the need for additional}} security screening by the TSA after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The airport gained international status and was renamed the Albuquerque International Airport on September 27, 1971. The name was changed to Albuquerque International Sunport in 1994.|$|E
50|$|The tape {{motion in}} the UNISERVO I was {{controlled}} by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. Supply and take-up reel motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to {{the invention of the}} vacuum column buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes.|$|E

50|$|The {{product was}} marketed {{as a single}} board for CD-ROM drive owners (but only of a {{particular}} CD-ROM drive model, see below) or bundled with the necessary CD-ROM drive. The software drivers allowed for DOS or Windows (3.1) based gameplay, although Windows based gaming featured real-time stretching of the game window and screenshot capturing. As graphics boards of the time (1994) were not up to par with the system's needs, a pass-through using a VGA feature <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> was used, thus reserving an area on screen {{to be used by}} the 3DO Blaster card's output (on the Windows environment - running under DOS, full-screen was the only option). Thus, there was no impact on the CPU. As with the first 3DO system from Panasonic (REAL FZ-1) an FMV daughter-card enabling Video CD playback was planned, but since the 3DO Blaster failed to achieve momentum, it was never released. Saved games were stored in NVRAM on the card, supposedly not using resources on the PC to prevent hacking.|$|E
40|$|In this Letter we {{identify}} the general rules that determine the synchronization properties of interconnected networks. We study analytically, numerically and experimentally how {{the degree of}} the nodes through which two networks are connected influences {{the ability of the}} whole system to synchronize. We show that connecting the high-degree (low-degree) nodes of each network {{turns out to be the}} most (least) effective strategy to achieve synchronization. We find the functional relation between synchronizability and size for a given network-of-networks, and report the existence of the optimal <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> weights for the different interconnection strategies. Finally, we perform an electronic experiment with two coupled star networks and conclude that the analytical results are indeed valid in the presence of noise and parameter mismatches.

40|$|No presente estudo buscou-se sugerir um modelo de gestÃo orÃamentÃria baseado no planejamento e controle financeiro para o municÃpio de Russas. A metodologia utilizada foi o estudo de caso, e os dados primÃrios foram coletados por meio de pesquisa bibliogrÃfica documental. Para efetivar a investigaÃÃo proposta, apresentou-se primeiramente a questÃo geral relacionada Ã fundamentaÃÃo teÃrica necessÃria para a explicitaÃÃo dos conteÃdos da anÃlise. Na seqÃÃncia, fez-se uma exposiÃÃo sobre a estrutura do orÃamento pÃblico no Brasil, segundo a legislaÃÃo e sua utilizaÃÃo como elo de ligaÃÃo entre os sistemas de planejamento e controle financeiro. Investigou-se tambÃm a fundamentaÃÃo legal da gestÃo orÃamentÃria e financeira como meio de dotar a administraÃÃo pÃblica {{municipal}} de mecanismos adequados. Abordou-se sugestÃes de melhoria ao modelo da gestÃo orÃamentÃria, atravÃs da implantaÃÃo de um fluxo de caixa, utilizaÃÃo do orÃamento participativo, implantaÃÃo da contabilidade prÃpria e criaÃÃo de unidade de auditoria interna. Focou-se ainda trÃs pontos principais: especificaÃÃo do modelo, testes para o modelo proposto e estimaÃÃes e resultados, mostrandose que em uma anÃlise economÃtrica do desequilÃbrio fiscal deve estar focada em um modelo estatÃstico que considere a carÃncia de dados relacionada a finanÃas pÃblicas dos municÃpios cearenses. Assim, a conclusÃo e recomendaÃÃes direcionam o trabalho no sentido de oferecer subsÃdios para a organizaÃÃo de uma estrutura orÃamentÃria que assegure a necessÃria conexÃo entre o planejamento e controle financeiro para o municÃpio pesquisado. In {{the present}} study one searched to suggest a based model of budgetary management in the planning and has controlled financier {{for the city of}} Russians. The used methodology was the case study, and the primary data had been collected by means of documentary bibliographical research. To accomplish the inquiry proposal, the related general question to the necessary theoretical recital for the explicitaÃÃo of the contents of the analysis was presented first. In the sequence, an exposition became on the structure of the public budget in Brazil, according to legislation and its use as <b>connector</b> <b>link</b> enters the systems of planning and financial control. The legal recital of the budgetary and financial management was also investigated as half to endow the municipal public administration with adequate mechanisms. One approached suggestions of improvement to the model of the budgetary management, through the implantation of a flow of box, use of the participativo budget, implantation of the proper accounting and creation of unit of internal auditorship. Focou still three main points: specification of the model, tests for the considered model and esteems and results, revealing that in a econometrical analysis of the fiscal disequilibrium it must be focada in a statistical model that considers the lack of data related the public finances of the pertaining to the state of CearÃ cities. Thus, the conclusion and recommendations direct the work in the direction to offer subsidies for the organization of a budgetary structure that assures the necessary connection between the planning and has controlled financier for the searched city...|$|E
