40|$|The {{association}} rule discovery problem consists in identifying frequent itemsets in a database and, then, forming <b>conditional</b> <b>implication</b> rules among them. The algorithmically {{most difficult part}} of this task is finding all frequent sets. There exists a wealth of algorithms both for the problem as such and for variations, particular cases, and generalizations. Except for some recent, fully different approaches, most algorithms can be seen either as a breadthfirst search or a depth-first search of the lattice of itemsets. In this paper, we propose a way of developing best-first search strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{a new class}} of hard SAT {{instances}} is proposed. These instances are built using a new graph based representation of boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). It extends the well known implication graph of binary clauses (2 -SAT) to the general case. Every clause is represented as a set of possible (<b>conditional)</b> <b>implications</b> and encoded with different arcs labeled with a set of literals, called contexts. This representation allows us to reformulate classical resolution as a transitive closure on the graph. This result combined with the underlying structure of the graph are then used to derive hard SAT instances with respect to the state-of-the-art SAT solvers. ...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we provide a {{reconstruction}} of access control logics within constructive conditional logics, by regarding the assertionA says φ, whose intended meaning is that principal A says that φ, as a <b>conditional</b> <b>implication.</b> We identify the conditional axioms needed {{to capture the}} basic properties of the “says ” operator {{and to provide a}} proper definition of boolean principals. Most of these axioms are standard axioms of conditional logics. We provide a Kripke model semantics for the logic and we prove that the axiomatization is sound and complete with respect to the semantics. Also, we define a sound, complete and cut-free labelled sequent calculus for it. ...|$|R

It is proved that congruence kernels of orthoimplication algebras are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with families of compatible p-filters on the corresponding orthomodular lattices. Finally, it is proved that the lattice of all congruence kernels of an orthoimplication algebra is relatively pseudocomplemented and a simple description of the relative pseudocomplement is given. In the literature many attempts were made in order to investigate {{properties of the}} <b>implication</b> <b>operation</b> in generalizations of Boolean algebras. These attempts led to different types of so-called implication algebras (cf. e. g. [2], [5] and [6]). It {{is interesting to note}} that these types of implication algebras are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with join-semilattices with 1 the principal filters of which are certain generalizations of Boolean algebras. Hence the question arises if there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between congruence kernels of these implication algebras on the one side and certain families of congruence kernels of the corresponding generalizations of Boolean algebras on the other side. We solve this problem for so-called orthoimplication algebras introduced in [2]. Moreover, we prove that the lattice of congruence kernels of orthoimplication algebras is relatively pseudocomplemented and we derive a simple description of the relative pseudocomplement. In [1] implication algebras were introduced as algebras reflecting properties of the <b>implication</b> <b>operation</b> in Boolean algebras: Definition 1. (cf.

40|$|The AGM {{rationality}} postulates for {{belief revision}} {{play an important}} role in the formalization of subjunctive queries over knowledge bases. However, the well known triviality results by Gardenfors in connection with the Ramsey Test make defining a query semantics corresponding to these rationality postulates a difficult task. While existing approaches avoid the triviality results by restricting the postulates in certain ways, we show that an exact translation into a query semantics is possible. The resulting semantics allows for the first time the integration of subjunctive queries evaluated according to a revision semantics corresponding to the AGM rationality postulates with an update operator corresponding to the update semantics formalized by Katsuno, Mendelzon and Grahne. Additionally, the query semantics extends usual <b>conditional</b> <b>implication</b> by defining the concepts of possibility and necessity relative to a knowledge base...|$|R

40|$|I test <b>conditional</b> <b>implications</b> {{of linear}} asset pricing models in which {{variables}} reflecting changing composition of total wealth capture time-variation in the consumption risk exposures of asset returns. I estimate conditional moments of returns and factor risk prices nonparametrically {{and show that}} while the consumption risk of value stocks does increase relative to that of growth stocks in “bad ” times, their conditional expected returns do not. Consequently, imposing the conditional moment restrictions results in large pricing errors, virtually eliminating the advantage of conditional models over the unconditional ones. Thus, exploiting conditioning information to impose joint restrictions on both the time-series and cross-sectional properties of asset returns exposes an additional challenge for the canonical CCAPM. The puzzle is less pronounced for models that rely on the long-run consumption risk encoded in the aggregate financial wealth. JEL Classification: G 120, G 100, C 140...|$|R
40|$|Stock {{returns in}} {{emerging}} markets are {{to some extent}} predictable {{on the basis of}} selected instrument variables. We show that local information is more important than global information to capture emerging stock market returns. This is an indication for at least partial segmentation of emerging stock markets. Our empirical results further demonstrate that predictability can be explained by time-variation in economic risk premiums. Instead of testing a traditional beta pricing model, we test a fully conditional asset pricing model in a stochastic discount factor framework. Scaling the vector of returns incorporates conditioning information, and scaling the economic risk factors captures time-variation in risk premiums. This technique allows testing some <b>conditional</b> <b>implications</b> of stochastic discount factor models, estimating the fixed weights of scaled factors as if the model was unconditional.

An association rule describes associations among the sets of items which occur together in transactions of databases. The Association Rule mining task consists of finding the frequent itemsets and the rules in the form of <b>conditional</b> <b>implications</b> with respect to some prespecified threshold values of support and confidence. The interestingness of Association Rules are determined by these two measures. However,other measures of interestingness like lift and conviction are also used.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{applicability}} of constructive conditional logics as a general framework to define decision procedures in access control logics. To this purpose, we formalize the assertion A says φ, whose intended meaning is that principal A says that φ, as a <b>conditional</b> <b>implication.</b> We in-troduce CondACL, which is a conservative extension of the logic ICL recently introduced by Garg and Abadi. We identify the conditional axioms needed to capture the basic properties of the “says ” operator {{and to provide a}} proper defi-nition of boolean principals.

Moreover, we define a sound, complete, cut-free and terminating se-quent calculus for CondACL, which allows us to prove that the logic is decidable. We argue for the generality of our approach by presenting canonical properties of some further well known access control axioms. The identification of canonical properties provides the possibility to craft access control logics that adopt any combination of axioms for which canonical properties exist. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a methodological approach to conditional reasoning in online asynchronous learning environments such as Virtual-U VGroups, developed by SFU, BC, Canada, {{consistent with the}} notion of meaning implication: If part of a meaning C is embedded in B and a part of a meaning B is embedded in A, then A implies C in terms of meaning [Piaget 91]. A new transcript analysis technique was developed to assess the flows of <b>conditional</b> meaning <b>implications</b> and to identify the occurrence of hypotheses and connections among them in two human science graduate mixed-mode online courses offered in the summer/spring session of 1997 by SFU. Flows of <b>conditional</b> meaning <b>implications</b> were confronted with Virtual-U VGroups threads and results of the two courses were compared. Findings suggest that Virtual-U VGroups is a knowledge-building environment although the tree-like Virtual-U VGroups threads should be transformed into neuronal-like threads. Findings also suggest that formulating hypotheses together triggers a collaboratively problem-solving process that scaffolds knowledge-building in asynchronous learning environments: A pedagogical technique and an built-in tool for formulating hypotheses together are proposed. © Springer Pub.
