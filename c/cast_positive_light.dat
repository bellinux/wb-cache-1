40|$|Ley, BarbaraThis study {{consists}} of a comparative framing analysis about how the leading news agency in China, Xinhua, covered SARS and Ebola—the infectious diseases that originated inside and outside China, respectively. As part of my study, I examined the prevalence of six frames used by Xinhua in its 250 SARS stories and 250 Ebola stories, and I compared the differences in frequencies of each frame. In terms of the popular themes that Xinhua used in the coverage of both SARS and Ebola, SARS stories covered economics, responses by domestic government(s), reassurance, and confidence more frequently than Ebola stories did, whereas Ebola stories covered health effects and responses by international governments more frequently than SARS stories did. In terms of my qualitative results, Xinhua deemphasized the severity of SARS and emphasized the severity of Ebola. Citations from the trusted or powerful sources are often used in Xinhua’s stories about SARS and Ebola. In stories about both diseases, Xinhua <b>casted</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> on the Chinese government in the descriptions about the prevention, control, {{and management of the}} government to the diseases. Results are discussed from the perspectives of the news environment, the political context in China, and China’s emerging role in the global political economy. The study also offers a deep look about how a collectivism society foster and protect the public image of the government among citizens and keep the society stable when dealing with a potential crises related to public health.

40|$|Brown’s {{legacy and}} what it says about the {{efficacy}} of litigation {{as a vehicle to}} achieve social change mean different things to different people. Although popular mythology emphasizes Brown’s critical role in securing equal educational opportunity, careful reflection reveals that the decision’s legacy is anything but clear. A narrow focus on school desegregation suggests Brown’s legacy is aptly characterized as one of unfulfilled promise. A broader focus that extends to include subsequent equal educational opportunity activity such as the school finance litigation movement, however, <b>casts</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> on Brown’s legacy. More important than completing interpretations of Brown’s legacy is what the decision implies for current and future efforts to secure greater educational equity through litigation. In this Article, I argue that Brown’s legacy does not bode well for future litigation efforts seeking to enhance the equal educational opportunity doctrine, principally due to how the doctrine has evolved during the past fifty years. Even if one concludes that Brown succeeded in the school desegregation context, the equal educational opportunity doctrine has changed during the past fifty years in ways that make it less amenable to litigation. Unlike past efforts, emerging reform efforts focus more directly on student academic achievement rather than race or school funding. Academic achievement implicates teaching and learning activities—activities located deeper inside schools and classrooms and further from litigation’s reach. If past education reformers and litigants found it difficult to penetrate factors located outside schools (school demographic profiles and funding levels), litigation efforts seeking to influence student achievement will encounter even greater difficulty. Student academic achievement’s insulation from even successful litigation underscores its inherent complexity, the salience of non-legal components and, more generally, structural limitations of law and litigation as tools to achieve desired social change. If my central claims are correct, the more complicated litigation efforts of the future will require manifestly greater effort. And greater effort alone will not insure success...|$|R
