40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{increasing}} concern over the potential environmental impact associated with the emissions of both gaseous and particulate pollutants {{has resulted in the}} promulgation of strict regulatory standards governing such emissions. In this regard, particular attention has been placed upon the control of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from major fuel burning installations. The provisions of the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act which relate to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) have made consideration of this problem of significant additional importance in the context of increased coal utilization. There exist three general methods for the control of sulfur dioxide emissions from pulverized coal-fired boiler equipment. These are: (1) coal cleaning to remove pyritic sulfur, (2) conventional wet, nonregenerable scrubbing with alkaline slurry and solution processes, and (3) dry processes which involve direct introduction of lime or limestone into the firebox, or a spray dryer operated with nonregenerable alkaline sorbents coupled with a fabric filter <b>collector.</b> <b>Equipment</b> requirements, SO 2 removal criteria, general economics, and potential applications of these latter two approaches within category (3) will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the United States Postal Services (USPS) program for environmentally benign pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) is to develop postage stamp adhesives that do not adversely affect the environment. The goal is to develop PSA stamp products that can be successfully recycled into fine paper products in a typical recycling facility. This paper describes {{the development of the}} final specification and approved product list for PSA stamp production. Environmentally benign PSAs are a form of adhesive that places no significant additional burden on plants that are using recycled fiber. As a result of an initiative by the USPS, a team has been working cooperatively to help solve the problem of PSAs not being recyclable in recovered paper. The team consists of the USPS; the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL); Springborn Testing and Research (STR); and industry representatives. Industry members include papermakers, paper recyclers, paper <b>collectors,</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers, and adhesive and chemical suppliers. The teams goal is to work with industry to develop environmentally benign PSAs for postal applications that will fulfill both USPS specifications and be compatible with the USPS environmental strategic plan and will place no additional burdens on plants that use recycled fiber.

40|$|American {{printing}} {{of the late}} nineteenth century was crude and commercial in the worst sense. The ideals and vitality that William Morris, Emery Walker, C. H. St. John Hornby, Charles Ricketts, T. J. Cobden-Sanderson and others injected into English printing during the last decades of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth were known to relatively few Americans. One of those few Americans was Frederic W. Goudy, March 8, 1865 [...] May 11, 1947. Paul Johnston in an article for the Fleuron (No. VII, 1930, p. 191 A) wrote, 2 ̆ 2 It was the part of Frederic W. Goudy to help the general printer in America to understand and to learn from the movement which began with Morris. And it is to Mr Goudy that American printing owes much of the strength and charm which may be claimed for the common, as well as the fine, work to-day. 2 ̆ 2 Goudy 2 ̆ 7 s activities in printing-related fields included type design and manufacture, writing and speaking to the public about the principles of letter forms, type design and typography, and operation with his family of a private press for thirty-odd years. Through these activities Goudy 2 ̆ 7 s influence on printing was amazingly great, yet no analytical and thorough studies of him exist. Rochester Institute of Technology received in 1975 several boxes of Goudy 2 ̆ 7 s private correspondence. Most of the approximately 1600 letters were addressed to Goudy during the years 1936 - 1946. The correspondents were printers, educators, type foundry personnel, book <b>collectors,</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers, family and friends, and their letters deal with business as well as personal activities. This thesis has involved editing the letters into a calendar. The contents of each letter has been abstracted, with important information being quoted. Background material has been added to clarify an entry or to refer to related correspondence. Indexes of personal and company names and Goudy type faces have been prepared as reference aids to the calendar. The entries have been arranged chronologically to follow Goudy s daily life in the ten year period. It was expected that a calendar form of the correspondence would allow the material therein to be fully utilized. Further, it was hoped that the information in the letters would contribute measurably to a serious study of Frederic Goudy. It will be for future Goudy researchers to test those expectations, but confirmation seems probable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolvent-based Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC), {{which can}} reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} from coal-fired power plants, {{is one of}} the most advanced mature Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies at present. Two problems limit its development. One is the output reduction of power plant due to the steam extraction from turbine. The other is a large amount of water consumption for the evaporation of the solution in the absorber and desorber. In this paper we propose an integrated system to reduce the steam extraction from turbine and to produce freshwater by using solar thermal energy. The new system produces more electricity and freshwater during the daytime, and uses the steam extraction to reduce CO 2 emissions at night. A techno-economic feasibility study is performed as a case study for a 300 MWe coal-fired power plant assisted by solar desalination. As for the potential impact parameters, the local climatic conditions and CO 2 capture rate are discussed. Low-cost <b>collectors</b> and desalting <b>equipment</b> would make the technology more cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, people {{commonly}} {{shower in}} the evening, the water being heated electrically by instantaneous water heaters. As a consequence the national power supplier "Eletrobrás" must hold high power station capacities {{ready to be}} able to cover the peak load in the early evening hours. In order to save power station capacities - and thus costs - Eletrobrás has decided to promote the use of solar thermal collectors for domestic water heating. Meanwhile more and more Brazilian households are using solar power for warm water production. The enormous market has already generated a multitude of companies in Brazil which produce solar thermal collectors. The different products are tested and certified in a laboratory at the Brazilian Center for Development of Thermal Solar Energy in Belo Horizonte. The large number of measurement orders from collector manufacturers and the Brazilian climate - the rainy season in Minas Gerais / Belo Horizonte lasts from November to April - have m otivated the planning for an indoor test stand for solar thermal <b>collectors.</b> The <b>equipment</b> for this test stand is financed by the World Bank {{as a part of the}} "Brazil Energy Efficiency Project", the United Nations Development Programme - UNDP being responsible for the project management. A substantial component of the testing facility is a solar simulator, which PSE - a spin-off company of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg / Germany - designed and manufactured in the style of the simulator used at the Fraunhofer ISE. This new solar simulator was installed in Brazil in November 2004. In our paper we present the technology and the performance characteristics of this solar simulator developed by PSE...|$|R

40|$|The most {{commonly}} employed technology for cold production is vapour compression, mainly {{due to the}} high efficiency of such devices. However, a major operating issue is the strong dependency of system efficiency and capacity on ambient temperature, which in turn leads to low yearly performance and to a low capacity factor. On the other hand, solar cooling is gaining an increasing appeal {{as a way to}} locally exploit renewable energy sources and reducing carbon footprint. Many thermally driven systems are being currently studied, among these the ejection reverse cycle is being proposed as an interesting alternative due to its simplicity, low cost and reliability. The present paper aims to analyse a complex system in which the solar powered ejection machine is used to increase the efficiency of a traditional vapour compression machine by subtracting heat from the condenser. By means of a transient analysis, performed with a reference building and with climate data corresponding to four different system locations worldwide, the year-round performance of such a system in a space cooling application is estimated in terms of energy balance and savings on power costs with respect to the traditional solutions, in order to evaluate its potential benefits and to highlight some issues related to system design and operation. A sensitivity analysis is also performed with respect to solar <b>collector</b> area and <b>equipment</b> sizing, showing how the latter is an important optimisation parameter when designing the system...|$|R
50|$|Tri-sector {{types are}} the most common in modern power {{generation}} facilities. In the tri-sector design, the largest sector (usually spanning about half the cross-section of the casing) is connected to the boiler hot gas outlet. The hot exhaust gas flows over the central element, transferring some of its heat to the element, and is then ducted away for further treatment in dust <b>collectors</b> and other <b>equipment</b> before being expelled from the flue gas stack. The second, smaller sector, is fed with ambient air by a fan, which passes over the heated element as it rotates into the sector, and is heated before being carried to the boiler furnace for combustion. The third sector is the smallest one and it heats air which is routed into the pulverizers and used to carry the coal-air mixture to coal boiler burners. Thus, the total air heated in the RAPH provides: heating air to remove the moisture from the pulverised coal dust, carrier air for transporting the pulverised coal to the boiler burners and the primary air for combustion. The rotor itself is the medium of heat transfer in this system, and is usually composed of some form of steel and/or ceramic structure. It rotates quite slowly (around 3-5 RPM) to allow optimum heat transfer first from the hot exhaust gases to the element, then as it rotates, from the element to the cooler air in the other sectors.|$|R
