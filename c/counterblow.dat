25|$|Polish {{historian}} Stefan Krakowski {{credits the}} relative {{failure of the}} Mongol invasion to two main causes. One, while at 30,000 men it was larger than the previous incursions into Poland, the rivalry between Talabuga and Nogai meant that the two columns didn't cooperate well, with the former withdrawing {{by the time the}} latter entered Poland. Two, the Poles' upgraded fortifications made their settlements much harder to take, which enabled Leszek and his nobles to put into action a simple three-stage defensive plan. The first stage stage was passive defense by garrisons (e.g. Sandomierz, Łysa Góra, Kraków, Tursko), the second was the fight against small Mongol detachments by local sallying forces, and the third stage was a <b>counterblow</b> of a large Hungarian-Polish army against the dispersed and reduced Mongols. This contrasted quite sharply with the first invasion. There the Mongols also dispersed their army into smaller units, but were able to easily take the poorly fortified settlements they attacked and smash the Polish forces sent to meet them in open field pitched battles, destroying Polish forces near-simultaneously at Sandomierz, Tursko, and Tarczek, in mid February and at Chmielnik, Krakow,, and Raciborz in late March, without much skirmishing or any protracted sieges.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} conquering of Pavia by the Viscontis {{occurred at}} the end of a complex and dramatic situation, that saw diverse actors play a role on the territorial scene of Pavia: the armies and fleets of the Viscontis, the territorial forces like the marquis from Montferrat, the élite management of the of the city and in particular the Beccaria family. The present essay scrutinises in depth the technical-military aspects as well as the political trends that were developed in the city. Under the first point of view, the interest is, therefore, focused on the ‘block’ that tightened the hold on the city, isolating the same, in the summer of 1356, on the battlefield fortifications and their dislocation, on the role of the fluvial fleets. In the second prospective, the <b>counterblows</b> that the events of the siege had on the community of Pavia, engaged in the last desperate defence for the autonomy of the city, sustained by the Augustinian friar Jacopo Bussolari as a preacher but also as a political leader: therefore, the political disagreements and contrasts emerged amongst the citizens, the mobilisation to arms but also the discharging...|$|R
50|$|Private Moon's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He {{fought with}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity when powerful Japanese <b>counterblows</b> were being struck {{in a desperate}} effort to annihilate a newly won beachhead. In a forward position, armed with a submachinegun, he met the brunt of a strong, well-supported night attack which quickly enveloped his platoon's flanks. Many men in nearby positions were killed or injured, and Pvt. Moon was wounded as his foxhole became the immediate object of a concentration of mortar and machinegun fire. Nevertheless, he maintained his stand, poured deadly fire into the enemy, daringly exposed himself to hostile fire time after time to exhort and inspire what American troops were left in the immediate area. A Japanese officer, covered by machinegun fire and hidden by an embankment, attempted to knock out his position with grenades, but Pvt. Moon, after protracted and skillful maneuvering, killed him. When the enemy advanced a light machinegun to within 20 yards of the shattered perimeter and fired with telling effects on {{the remnants of the}} platoon, he stood up to locate the gun and remained exposed while calling back range corrections to friendly mortars which knocked out the weapon. A little later he killed 2 Japanese as they charged an aid man. By dawn his position, {{the focal point of the}} attack for more than 4 hours, was virtually surrounded. In a fanatical effort to reduce it and kill its defender, an entire platoon charged with fixed bayonets. Firing from a sitting position, Pvt. Moon calmly emptied his magazine into the advancing horde, killing 18 and repulsing the attack. In a final display of bravery, he stood up to throw a grenade at a machinegun which had opened fire on the right flank. He was hit and instantly killed, falling in the position from which he had not been driven by the fiercest enemy action. Nearly 200 dead Japanese were found within 100 yards of his foxhole. The continued tenacity, combat sagacity, and magnificent heroism with which Pvt. Moon fought on against overwhelming odds contributed in a large measure to breaking up a powerful enemy threat and did much to insure our initial successes during a most important operation.|$|R
5000|$|The Fortified Regions {{were well}} sited: {{since there were}} {{a limited number of}} roads {{crossing}} the hilly, forested frontier, the Soviets could be confident that each avenue of approach was covered by prepared defenses {{that would have to be}} overcome via costly frontal attack, delaying the enemy and forcing him to pay heavily in manpower and equipment. To counter the Tochkas, the Japanese were forced to keep considerable numbers of heavy artillery near the border, ranging from more modern Type 45 240 mm howitzers and 300 mm howitzers to antiquated 28 cm Howitzer L/10 from the Russo-Japanese War. As an added precaution, in the aftermath of the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, the IJA distributed a special one-ton shell with a range of only 1,000 meters to its Type 7 30 cm Howitzers [...] meant to pulverize an enemy strongpoint in a single hit. Despite the advantages conferred on them by the border terrain and Tochka belt, the Red Army did not intend solely to hunker down and outlast a Japanese assault. By the fifth day of war, STAVKA ordered the troops of the 15th and 35th Armies (minus the 66th Rifle Division), together with the Amur Red Banner Military Flotilla and any available reserves to defeat the Japanese-Manchu units opposite them, force the Amur and Ussuri, and launch a counter-offensive coordinated against both sides of the Sungari River in Manchurian territory. The final objectives of the Sungari Front groups were designated as the cities of Fujin and Baoqing, to be reached on the 25th day of hostilities. The object of this attack was to stabilize the front and relieve pressure on the Ussuri Railway and Khabarovsk areas. Similarly, all along the front the remaining Soviet forces would also begin short <b>counterblows</b> [...] "in the tactical depth," [...] in keeping with the Soviet doctrine that defensive action cannot be successful without the coordination of position defense and counterattack. Simultaneously, on the opposite side of Manchuria, the 17th and 36th Armies of the Trans-Baikal Front (with its headquarters at Mount Shirlova in the Yablonovy Range) were ordered to hold and then counterattack after a period of three days, advancing to Lakes Buir and Hulun by the tenth day of the war. Undoubtedly as a consequence of the USSR's desperate situation at the time, in both cases, East and West, reinforcements from the hinterland were relatively small: just four tank brigades, five artillery regiments, six guards mortar regiments, and five armored train divisions were pledged to assist both Fronts together.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} thought of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. The principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind {{the machine is}} very simple, raise the hammer and then drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers is {{in the way that}} the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in the vertical position. The main reason for this is because excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.To overcome some of the shortcomings of the drop-hammer the <b>counterblow</b> machine or impactor is used. In a <b>counterblow</b> machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibrations. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for open die or closed die forging. A forging press, often just called a press, is used for press forging.|$|E

50|$|A {{steam hammer}} may {{have one or}} two {{supporting}} frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the dies more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a <b>counterblow</b> steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Tuchman is also {{careful to}} point out that {{although}} many of Joffre's actions were shameful, when he was finally pushed into action, he showed great skill in guiding the hastily improvised <b>counterblow</b> that crashed into the invader's flank. The Germans greatly contributed to their own undoing by outrunning their supply lines, pushing their infantry to the point of physical collapse and deviating from the original invasion plan, which called for the right flank to be protected from counterattack. At that stage of its offensive, the German army lacked the troops used by the siege of the fortress of Antwerp, held by the Belgian army. Both sides were plagued by poor communication and general staffs that were heavily invested with politics and sycophancy. Dire warnings from commanders in the field were ignored when they did not fit preconceived notions of quick victory at low cost, a recurring problem that still besets armies.|$|E

50|$|He {{inherited}} the kindred's possession {{from his father}} near the border of Vas and Zala County, where the Sárvíz stream flows to the Zala river. He was first mentioned by contemporary records in 1224 as a supporter of Duke Béla. Paul and the young prince were contemporaries of the same age. When Andrew II of Hungary re-installed his son Béla as the Duke of Slavonia, Béla launched a campaign against Domald of Sidraga, a rebellious Dalmatian nobleman, and captured Domald's fortress at Klis. Paul Geregye also participated in this campaign, he defeated and captured Boyzen, Domald's brother and following the recapture of Klis, he also imprisoned Domald himself and rescued twelve noblemen. In 1229, Paul also fought in the unsuccessful campaign against the Principality of Halych. Duke Frederick II of Austria invaded the western parts of Hungary in 1230, in response Béla launched a <b>counterblow</b> against the Duke. Paul participated in the recaptures of Borostyánkő and Lánzsér Castles (today Bernstein and Burgruine Landsee in Austria), and also destroyed the dams erected by the Austrians which had blocked the flow of Mur river to overflow the surrounding villages. In 1231, King Andrew II led another campaign against Halych, Paul participated in the siege of Halych too, when the king successfully restored his youngest son, Andrew, to the Galician throne.|$|E
5000|$|By early 1962, the Chinese {{leadership}} {{began to}} believe that India's intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war. In 1961, the Indian army had been sent into Goa, a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after Portugal refused to surrender the exclave colony to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it {{as an example of}} India's expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India's Home Minister declared, [...] "If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat what it did in Goa. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces", while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, [...] "India will take steps to end Chinese aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa". By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as Delhi increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines. Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi commented at one high-level meeting, [...] "Nehru's forward policy is a knife. He wants to put it in our heart. We cannot close our eyes and await death." [...] The Chinese leadership believed that their restraint on the issue was being perceived by India as weakness, leading to continued provocations, and that a major <b>counterblow</b> was needed to stop perceived Indian aggression.|$|E
