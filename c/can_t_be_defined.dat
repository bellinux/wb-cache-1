Fuzzy spaces [1, 2] have a potential for replacing the classical geometric description of space-time. They could incorporate the quantum fluctuation of space-time which is suggested by the existence of minimal length in semi-classical quantum gravity and string theory [3, 4] and another kind of arguments [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The fuzziness is roughly in the order of the Planck length, and classical geometry is expected to be effective well over the scale. Since we understand rather well space-time dynamics in terms of geometry, {{it would be useful to}} understand what is geometry of fuzzy spaces in the study of their dynamics. Since classical geometry can be obtained from trajectories of particles, the effective geometry of fuzzy spaces will be determined by low energy propagation modes of some fields well over the scale of fuzziness. This is in accordance with the spirit of [10]. A fuzzy space is often characterized by a scalar field action, which determines the propagation of the scalar field. In continuum theory, an asymptotic expansion of a heat kernel of a Laplacian has geometric quantities as its coefficients [11, 12]. For a Laplacian A = − ∆ on a space without boundaries, the asymptotic expansion for t → + 0 is given by Tr(e −tA) = ∑ t j−ν/ 2 d ν x ε 2 j(x), (1) j= 0 where ν is the dimensions of the space, and ε 0 (x) = ε 2 (x) = ε 4 (x) ...|$|R
