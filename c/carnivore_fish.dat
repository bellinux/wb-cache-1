This is similar to those reported in rohu (Labeo rohita) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (Kumar et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2012).

Herbivore and omnivore fish compared to <b>carnivore</b> <b>fish</b> are able to digest and absorb carbohydrate better (Arockiaraj et al. 2008). The ability of different fish species to use carbohydrate is dependent on their abilities to oxidize glucose, digest carbohydrate, and accumulate glucose as glycogen and lipid. High diversity in the intestinal structure and function, and different carbohydrate sources used in fish diet has led to variation in the ability of the use of dietary carbohydrates among different fish species. The growth response of our kutum juvenile was significantly affected by the dietary carbohydrate levels. An optimum dietary carbohydrate level reduced the catabolism of other resources such as protein and lipid for energy and intermediate metabolism proved biologically for synthesis of important compounds (Vielma et al. 2003; Mingchun et al. 2011).|$|E

In this paper, we evaluate Hg releases caused by mining in marine environment of Buyat Bay (BB), north Sulawesi, Indonesia, by quantifying the concentration of total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) in marine biota.

The present study describes the weight-length relationship (WLR), relative condition factor (Kn), red blood cell parameters, thrombocytes and leukocytes count of Cichla temensis Humboldt, 1821, farmed in central Amazon. Fish that underwent food training during fingerling culture received extruded ration containing 45 % of crude protein during fattening, and had Kn with values from 0. 925 - 1. 199, which indicated good health condition during the culture. The equation obtained from the WLR was W = 0. 0073 Lt 3. 1435, indicating an isometric growth, which is the desirable for fish of fish farm. Red blood cell counts, total thrombocyte and leukocyte counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), concentration of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCHC), lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils had intra-specific variation.

40|$|The {{utility of}} taxonomic and {{functional}} approaches {{in assessing the}} structure of fish communities is tested in the hypersaline estuary of the Casamance river using data from surveys of commercial fisheries conducted between April and July of 2005. Both taxonomic and functional diversity decrease from downstream to upstream regions of the estuary. In terms of species composition, marine-estuarine species (33. 3 - 46. 3 %, depending on the site) and estuarine species of marine origin (29. 3 - 41. 7 %) dominate the exploited population in the Casamance estuary. In contrast, the proportion of strictly estuarine species observed upstream is twice that observed downstream. Quantitative analysis based on biomass landed distinguishes two groups in the population: (1) a group of species that is dominant downstream, containing primarily terminal predators and secondary consumers categorised as marine species that are occasional or accessory in estuaries, estuarine marine species, and estuarine species of marine origin; and (2) a group of species characteristic of the upstream region, dominated by a few species (Sarotherodon melanotheron, Tilapia guineensis, and Mugil cephalus) mainly of strictly estuarine and/or herbivorous categories and Elops lacerta, a <b>carnivore</b> <b>fish.</b> The outcomes of the two approaches are similar, and both indicate that the fish community in this estuary is {{under the influence of}} strong environmental disturbance.

40|$|Musk {{compounds}} {{are widely}} spread environmental pollutants. Musk compounds {{were found in}} aquatic organisms from the North Sea, in rivers, lakes and estuaries in Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Two nitro musks, musk xylene (MX) and musk ketone (MK), and two polycyclic musks (HHCB and AHTN) were the major musk compounds determined and observed in freshwater {{as well as in}} marine organisms. The main source of nitro and polycyclic musk residues in aquatic organisms are effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs). The presence of synthetic musk compounds in biota can, therefore, be used as an indicator of the exposure of biota to STP effluents. Synthetic musk compounds have mainly been determined in fish, but some data are also available for mussels and shrimps. In addition, MX was found in eggs of coastal bird species, and HHCB and AHTN were identified in otters. The concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in freshwater organisms from Europe are one to two orders of magnitude higher than MX and MK, and comparable to levels of PCBs in fish. Indications were found that several fish species such as eel (Anguila anguila) could metabolise HHCB and AHTN, and that food chain transfer of these musk compounds from prey fish (e. g. roach) to <b>carnivore</b> <b>fish</b> (pike-perch) occurs. Time trend data for MX and MK in eel from the river Elbe (Germany) showed that for some locations a decline in the concentrations from 1994 to 1999 occurred, probably due to the restriction of the use of MX in Germany since 1993. Similar results were observed for MX in eel from the river Rhine. Nitro musks and polycyclic musks were found in fish samples (e. g. trout, herring, mussels, tuna and mackerel) collected at food markets. In some samples (trout and shrimp) the concentrations of MX and MK were similar to the concentrations of PCBs, while in other samples (e. g. halibut and mussels) the concentrations of MX and MK are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of PCBs.

The water, sediments, plankton and fish samples were collected on monthly basis. Five fish of each species belonging to both major carps, Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhina mrigala and <b>carnivore</b> <b>fish</b> i. e. Rita rita, Mystus sperata and Wallago attu were sampled randomly for analyses. The concentrations of aluminium, arsenic, barium, chromium, nickel and zinc in the fish body organs, gills, liver, kidney, intestine, reproductive organs, skin, muscle, fins, scales, bones and fats were determined. The water physico-chemical variables, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, total alkalinity, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total nitrates, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chlorides and total ammonia were analyzed on monthly basis and their relationships with the uptake and accumulation of metals in water, bed sediments and planktonic biomass (dry weight) were established. In the river Ravi aquatic ecosystem the relative variability of metals followed the order: aluminium>zinc>nickel>chromium>arsenic>barium. Among the three public fishing sites, Sahahdara bridge had significantly higher metallic {{toxicity of}} water, sediments and planktonic biota attributed to the bulk discharges of untreated effluents, originated from adjacent industrial areas, discharged through various small tributaries, Mahmood Booti nulla, Hudiara nulla, Shad Bagh nulla, Farrukhabad nulla, Munshi Hospital nulla and Taj Company nulla. The metallic toxicity of both sediments and plankton, in the river Ravi, followed the order: aluminium>zinc>nickel>chromium>arsenic>barium. However, the toxicity of these metals fluctuated significantly at all the three sampling stations with season. Metallic toxicity of water at all the three sites was generally low but the contamination levels in both sediments and biota were significantly higher. Among the metals, aluminium and zinc concentrations in water, sediments and plankton were significantly higher. The toxicity of aluminium, zinc, nickel, chromium and arsenic in water showed variability that was dependent upon total alkalinity and pH of water while chromium toxicity showed inverse relationship with water temperature. The elevated levels of all metals in the river bed sediments beyond the permissible limits indicated the failure of detoxification ability of sediments in the river Ravi due to continuous influx of heavy metals discharged through various tributaries. The uptake and accumulation of all metals by the sediments and plankton were dependent positively and significantly upon metallic toxicity of water. However, metallic ion uptake by the plankton showed significantly direct dependence on the metallic toxicity of sediments. The fish at Shahdara bridge had significantly higher metals in their body organs than those collected from the both Baloki headworks and Sidhnai barrage. Significantly higher accumulation of metals were observed in fish liver, followed by that of kidney, gills, intestine, reproductive organs, skin, scales, fins, bones, muscles and fats. The significant enrichment of metals in fish body organs showed direct dependence on the metallic toxicity of water, sediments and plankton. All the organs of both herbiâ€“ and carnivorous fish species showed significantly variable accumulation of metals that followed the sequence: liver > kidney > gills > intestine > reproductive organs > scale > skin > fins > bones > muscles > fats. Fish liver and kidney showed significantly higher abilities for the accumulation of all metals while the same remained significantly lowest in fish muscle and fats. The health status of river Ravi at three main public fishing sites, Shahdara bridge, Baloki headworks and Sidhnai barrage, with respect to eco-toxicity of aluminium, arsenic, barium, chromium, nickel and zinc, was above the recommended standards of EPA (USA) and Pakistan. Based on the calculated individual contamination factors, the metallic toxicity was {{in the order of}} aluminium>zinc>nickel>chromium>arsenic>barium posing highest risk to the sustainability of river ecosystem. The risks associated with the consumption of fish, irrespective of the source of fish, are higher since the levels of aluminium, arsenic, barium, chromium, nickel and zinc in fish have been found above their respective EPA (USA) permissible limits. Therefore, potential of danger may become more severe in future depending upon the extent of industrial and domestic wastewater influx into the river Ravi due to man-made activities in the adjacent areas...|$|E
40|$|Fish oil is {{the most}} {{important}} source of n- 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) for humans. With the stagnation of world marine fisheries, the role of aquaculture stocks increased rapidly as source of n- 3 HUFA (FAO, 2012), but not sufficiently. To reduce the dependence as well as find ways to use of marine sources more economically and efficiently, the use of vegetable oils (VO) have been widely investigated (Estévez et al., 2011). Vegetable oils are rich in C 18 PUFA, but devoided of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), essential fatty acids involved in maintaining cell membrane structure, among other essential functions. The capacity of fish to thrive on diets containing only the C 18 PUFA, 18 : 2 n − 6 and 18 : 3 n – 3 varies among species (Tocher, 2003; Leaver et al., 2008; Castro et al., 2012). It is well documented that teleosts have different enzyme capacity to desaturate-elongate 18 C fatty acids into 20 - 22 C LC-PUFAs (Cook & McMaster, 2004; Leaver et al., 2008). Generally, freshwater fish species can convert 18 : 2 n− 6 and 18 : 3 n− 3 to HUFA more efficiently than marine species, especially carnivorous which prey on organisms rich in HUFA (Tocher, 2003). Thus, the modulation of expression and translation of elongases and desaturases is of great importance to achieve independence of (carnivorous) marine fish aquaculture from fishmeal and fish oil. There is currently considerable interest in the HUFA biosynthetic pathway in fish aiming to determine the effectiveness of vegetable oils as a total replacement of fish oil in the aquaculture of <b>carnivore</b> <b>fish</b> species (Vagner & Santigosa, 2011). Selenium is a structural component for several enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxine (Perottoni et al., 2004). These enzymes have physiological antioxidant properties and thus, protect the tissues of lipid peroxidation products (Orun et al., 2008). The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid profile on fads 2 (fatty acyl desaturase gene) and elovl 5 (fatty acyl elongase gene) expression in liver and brain of meagre (Argyrosomus regius). The four isoproteic and isolipidic diets (50 % protein and 12 % lipid, dry matter basis) were formulated with fish oil (FO) or a blend of vegetable oils (VO, rapeseed, linseed and soybean), each with selenium (S, 1 mg/kg diet) or without selenium (NS). Fish were fed ad libitum for 60 days under a controlled rearing conditions (temperature = 20, 7 ± 0, 7 ºC; pH = 8; O 2 = > 6 ppm). Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from two tissues: liver and brain using RNAspin Mini RNAIsolation Kit (GE Healthcare), with includes a step with DNase I to remove the presence of DNA. The integrity of the extracted RNA was verified by agarose electrophoresis. The RNA concentrations were obtained by nanodrop. From the total RNA, 0. 5 µg were transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-PCR (BioRad) following the manufacturer protocol. Gene expression from fads 2 and elovl 5 were quantified by analysis of RT-PCR. The β-actine was used as a reference gene. On VO diet hepatic fads 2 expression was significantly higher, but not elovl 5 expression. In brain of VO fed fish, fads 2 and elovl 5 expression was not significantly different when compared with FO fed fish (Table 1). With selenium supplementation hepatic fads 2 expression was lower in FO (P 0. 05). The same trend was evident for hepatic elovl 5 expression (P> 0. 05) (Table 1). Recently, Monroig et al. (2013) described the first functional characterization of meagre Fads 2 and Elovl 5. This work concluded that, unlike most teleosts, the Fads 2 pocesses ∆ 6 and ∆ 8 activity. However, conversion rates of meagre Fads 2 were low when compared to Salmo salar ∆ 6 Fads_c (Monroig et al., 2011). On the other hand, meagre Elovl 5 showed high activity towards C 18 and C 20. Thus, ∆ 6 /∆ 8 activity might be ineffective in converting C 18 PUFA and therefore an increase of dietary C 18 PUFA may stimulates the expression of the fads 2. In contrast, Elovl 5 is very efficient to convert the desaturated products of ∆ 6 /∆ 8 and so Elovl 5 expression is not enhanced, since the activity of this enzyme is already higher. These findings may explain the differences in the expression of two genes, between hepatic fads 2 and elovl 5. Furthermore, increased hepatic fads 2 expression between FO-S and VO-S treatments was 114 fold. Such induction was much greater than observed in Salmo salad (Zheng et al., 2005). However, Salmo salad has separate and distinct genes for ∆ 6 and ∆ 5 desaturases (Zheng et al., 2005) and, due to genome duplication, it has two genes with ∆ 6 activity (Monroig et al., 2010). Moreover, lipid peroxidation in liver increases with the number of fatty acid (FA) double bonds (Haggag, Elsanhoty & Ramadan, 2014). D'Aquino et al. (1991) observed that rats fed diets with fish oil had increased lipid peroxidation. Our results indicate that, in FO-S, selenium may have protected FA from peroxidation, thus dietary HUFA seemed to have been sufficient to maintain the phospholipid turnover and induction of FA metabolism genes did not occur. In FO-NS diet membranes were not protected efficiently from lipid peroxidation, and therefore a higher expression of FA metabolism genes was necessary to offset the damage, consequently, biosynthesis of HUFA was more stimulated. ROS-induced oxidative stress has been associated with expression and protein levels of transcription factors (Okuno et al., 2012). A reduction of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) has been observed in fish fed VO with selenium, when compared to VO without selenium (data not presented). It is plausible to infer that a stimulation of expression and level of protein SREBP- 1 by a reduction of ROS. SREBP- 1 play a role on the regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis of HUFA, as fads 2 and elovl 5 (Jump, Tripathy & Depner, 2013). In conclusion, our results showed that vegetable oils have an effect on expression level of genes involved in HUFAs biosynthesis in meagre, mainly fads 2, which seems to be the rate limiting enzyme in this pathway. In addition, dietary selenium seems to favor the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of HUFAs, when meagre is fed on VO-based diet...|$|E

Finally, members of the parasitic guild acquire nutrition from a host species, usually another fish or large vertebrate.

[...] In the pelagic zone, herbivores graze on periphyton and macrophytes or pick phytoplankton {{out of the water}} column. [...] <b>Carnivores</b> include <b>fishes</b> that feed on zooplankton in the water column (zooplanktivores), insects at the water’s surface, on benthic structures, or in the sediment (insectivores), and those that feed on other fish (piscivores). [...] Fish that consume detritus and gain energy by processing its organic material are called detritivores. [...] Omnivores ingest a wide variety of prey, encompassing floral, faunal, and detrital material. [...] Finally, members of the parasitic guild acquire nutrition from a host species, usually another fish or large vertebrate. Fish taxa are flexible in their feeding roles, varying their diets with environmental conditions and prey availability. [...] Many species also undergo a diet shift as they develop. [...] Therefore, it is likely that any single fish occupies multiple feeding guilds within its lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Inlcudes bibliographical referencesMicronekton fauna was {{investigated}} {{as part of}} a multi-disciplinary research project carried out in two different bioregions of the South West Indian Ocean: the East African Coastal Province (EAFR) and the Indian South Subtropical Gyre (ISSG). Food web structure was addressed using stable isotopes. Since particulate organic matter had high δ 15 N values in the ISSG province, copepods were chosen as baseline in trophic level estimations. Feeding regime and size were shown to influence the trophic position of micronekon. In the ISSG, <b>carnivores</b> (<b>fishes</b> and squids) and omnivores (crustaceans) had higher δ 15 N values and trophic positions than filter feeder s (gelatinous organisms such as salps and pyrosomes) and detritivores (leptocephali larvae). Fishes and squids encompassed a wide range of overlapping isotopic niches suggesting that organisms across different trophic levels feed on the same resources. Estimated trophic levels ranged from 1. 67 to 4. 73, showing that micronekton in the ISSG can be tertiary consumers. An average enrichment value of 6. 7 ‰ was recorded between the sampled micronekton specimens and swordfish Xiphias gladius in the ISSG. Trawls, being selective in nature, were shown to sa mple smaller - sized micronekton with a lower trophic position than the micronekton being eaten by swordfish. In the EAFR, mean δ 15 N values of micronekton were higher than in the ISSG, exhibiting slightly higher trophic levels. Mesoscale dynamics in the EAFR provide mechanisms that enrich surface layers in nutrients and chlorophyll - a, therefore contributing to a higher abundance and micronekton species richness. In the ISSG, the large - scale wind - driven anticyclonic gyre pushes the nitracline, thermocline and deep chlorophyll maximum deeper in the water column, influencing the diel migration patterns of micronekton, with a significant proportion of micronekton staying in deep layers or slightly above the thermocline at dusk. Regardless of the differences in the ISSG and EAFR in δ 15 N values and trophic positions of micronekton, larger - sized swordfish sampled from these two provinces had similar mean δ 15 N values since swordfish are highly migratory and forage in different p arts of the Indian Ocean. However, smaller - sized swordfish specimens had lower mean δ 15 N values. With a combination of trawl surveys, stable isotope estimates, stomach content and acoustic analyses, this study shed new light on trophic interactions in the oligotrophic ISSG province...|$|R
40|$|There {{is large}} natural {{variation}} in light and nutrient conditions across lakes. In the boreal-subarctic region most lakes are small, shallow and nutrient poor. In such lakes {{there is often}} sufficient light to support primary production at the lake bottom. An expectation {{for the future is}} that colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) of terrestrial origin will increase in these lakes. cDOM depresses the underwater light climate but is often associated with elevated pelagic nutrient concentrations. A dynamical model of a coupled benthic-pelagic food web was explored for how lake ecosystems might respond to altered light and nutrient regimes. The model predicts that mobile <b>carnivores</b> (<b>fish)</b> control grazers and release primary producers from grazing pressure. Primary producers are therefore limited by their resources and cross-habitat interactions are dominated by spatially asymmetric competition for light and nutrients. At high light and low nutrient supply benthic algae out-compete pelagic algae for nutrients diffusing from the sediment, whereas pelagic algae shade out benthic algae at lower light and/or higher nutrient supply. Biomass patterns of benthic and pelagic consumers follow the patterns of primary production. In contrast, habitat coupling through carnivore movement has only a weak impact on biomass patterns in the model food web. Model predictions were compared with data from boreal-subarctic lakes covering a broad range of cDOM concentrations. In agreement with model expectations the following relationships with increasing light attenuation were observed: benthic primary and secondary production decreased, pelagic primary production showed a unimodal trend, and pelagic nutrient concentrations as well as the proportion of fish feeding in the pelagic habitat increased. As a consequence, both primary and fish production were negatively related to pelagic nutrient concentrations across lakes. In a comparative study of boreal-subarctic lakes covering a broad range of cDOM concentrations, a similar negative relationship was found between pelagic total nutrient concentrations and the biomass of epilithic algae. This was surprising, because epilithon cannot access nutrients from the sediment. Patterns in epilithon biomass were largely driven by nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, which in turn were positively related to light supply. The data suggest that nitrogen fixing autotrophs may have a competitive advantage over other epilithic primary producers in low-cDOM, low-nutrient, high-light environments, and that patterns in epilithic biomass, nutrient sequestration and elemental stoichiometry depend upon which functional group is dominant in the epilithic biofilm...|$|R
40|$|Food chain {{accumulation}} of organochlorines and brominated flame retardants in estuarine and marine environments {{is compared to}} model estimations and fresh water field data. The food chain consists of herbivores, detritivores and primary and secondary <b>carnivores</b> i. e. <b>fish,</b> fish-eating birds and marine mammals. Accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls is predicted well by OMEGA for herbi-detritivores and primary and secondary carnivorous fish. Ratios {{are similar to those}} found for fresh water species. Accumulation ratios for fish-eating birds and mammals are overestimated by the model, which is attributed partly to biotransformation of meta¿para unsubstituted congeners. Additionally, birds may feed in other less polluted areas. For brominated diphenylethers (BDE) accumulation patterns are highly species and congener specific. Accumulation depends on both Kow and metabolization capacities. BDE 47 is the predominant congener in lower trophic levels. For marine birds and mammals accumulation ratios of BDE 99 and 100 are similar to or higher than ratios of persistent PCB...|$|R
40|$|The histo-morphological {{study of}} the {{alimentary}} canal of two <b>carnivore</b> freshwater snakehead <b>fish</b> Channa punctata and C. striata was carried out from October 2013 to July 2014. It revealed that three major parts like oesophagus, stomach and intestine composed of short thick-walled body. The oesophagus begins with buccopharynx. Structure and arrangement of both villiform and canine teeth on jaws in C. striata are more extendable and stronger than C. punctata and thereby made the former one more successful predator. The availability and arrangement pattern of mucous pits and taste bud pores in oesophagus are also prominent in C. striata. The TS of stomach of both the species has broad GM devoid of goblet mucous cells, but surface layer CC and basal layer GG open through gastric pits. The length of intestine (16. 0 cm) and intestinal pyloric caeca (5. 5 cm) in C. striata are larger than C. punctata (7. 0 cm and 1. 5 cm, respectively). However, the TS of intestinal Sr. 0. 05 mm; MM. 0. 8 mm; Mu 0. 5 mm suggest in favour of carnivore habit of both the species...|$|R
40|$|Fish diets {{can vary}} in food quality, {{quantity}} and size. The variation {{can be caused}} by several factors, including season and the ontogenic phase of the individual (McCormick 1998). We studied the ontogenic changes in feeding habits of two freshwater fishes, Agonostomus monticola and Brycon behreae, from the Térraba River basin, South Pacific of Costa Rica. Both populations were omnivorous, but displayed ontogenic shifts in terms of quantity and quality of the food items consumed. As it grew, A. monticola modified its diet from insectivorous towards a higher consumption of vegetables, which was accompanied by an increase in relative length of the intestine. While remaining dependent on vegetation as staple food, B. behreae diversified its diet in two ways. Initially, from soft plant parts to seeds, leaves, and fruits. Secondly, prey items changed from insects into a more <b>carnivore</b> diet (<b>fish</b> and shrimp). These findings for both species stress the importance of protecting riparian vegetation in these tropical ecosystems. Las dietas de los peces varían con respecto a la calidad, la cantidad y el tamaño del alimento. Esta variación puede deberse a factores como la estacionalidad y la fase del desarrollo del individuo. Estudiamos los cambios ontogénicos en los hábitos alimentarios de dos peces dulceacuícolas, Agonostomus monticola y Brycon behreae, de la Cuenca del Río Térraba, Pacífico sur de Costa Rica. Ambas poblaciones son omnívoras, pero con cambios ontogénicos en la cantidad y calidad de los ítemes consumidos. Conforme crecía, A. monticola modificó su dieta de insectívora hacia un mayor consumo de materia vegetal, asociado con un aumento en la longitud relativa del intestino. Aunque mantuvo su dependencia de alimentos vegetales, B. behreae diversificó su dieta de dos formas. Primero, pasó de partes suaves de plantas a semillas, hojas y frutos. Luego, los ítemes cambiaron de insectos hacia una dieta más carnívora (peces y camarones). Estos hallazgos para ambas especies enfatizan la importancia de proteger la vegetación riparia de estos ecosistemas tropicales...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{defenses of}} the Brazilian gorgonian octocoral Lophogorgia violacea Pallas {{have been investigated}} using feeding preference experiments performed in situ with an ecologically relevant, natural assemblage of predatory fishes. Feeding experiments incorporating the crude extract of the animal into palatable foods showed that the organic constituents of L. violacea provide a powerful chemical deterrence toward consumption by generalist <b>fish</b> <b>carnivores.</b> Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract and evaluation of the fractions and purified compounds obtained in the same in situ assay revealed that a complex mixture of furanocembranolides {{was responsible for the}} overall feeding deterrence observed. The most potent feeding deterrent identified was lophotoxin (1), followed by two previously reported and structurally related compounds, deoxylophotoxin (2), and 13 -acetoxy- 11 beta, 12 beta-epoxypukalide (3), as well as two new furanocembranolides: 7 -acetoxy- 8 -hydroxylophotoxin (4) and 3 -methoxy- 8 -hydroxylophotoxin (5). Lophotoxin (1), a neurotoxin originally isolated from the Pacific gorgonian L. rigida, was the most potent feeding deterrent among the furanocembranolides isolated. However, the four other related furanocembranolides (2 - 5) appear to contribute, in an additive manner, to the overall deterrent effects observed. These results add to earlier studies providing further evidence that compounds of this structural class provide effective chemical defenses against fish predators in both temperate and tropical environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} raised the {{hypothesis}} that the trophic status in a tropical coastal food web from southeastern Brazil can be measured by the relation between total mercury (THg) and nitrogen isotope (delta(15) N) in their components. The analysed species were grouped into six trophic positions: primary producer (phytoplankton), primary consumer (zooplankton), consumer 1 (omnivore shrimp), consumer 2 (pelagic carnivores represented by squid and fish species), consumer 3 (demersal <b>carnivores</b> represented by <b>fish</b> species) and consumer 4 (pelagic-demersal top carnivore represented by the fish Trichiurus lepturus). The values of THg, delta(15) N, and trophic level (TLv) increased significantly from primary producer toward top carnivore. Our data regarding trophic magnification (6. 84) and biomagnification powers (0. 25 for delta(15) N and 0. 83 for TLv) indicated that Hg biomagnification throughout trophic positions is high in this tropical food web, which could be primarily related {{to the quality of the}} local water.
