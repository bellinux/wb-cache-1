These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120°C, gamma radiation, or by the ethylene oxide (EtO) method. However, scientific research indicates possible problems with biocompatibility. Dow Chemical strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications. More recently, scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center have developed aliphatic polycarbonates with improved biocompatibility and degradability for nanomedicine applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{most widely}} used grading system is the International Scale of River Difficulty, where {{whitewater}} (either an individual rapid, or the entire river) is classed in six categories from class I (the easiest and safest) to <b>class</b> <b>VI</b> (the most difficult and most dangerous). The grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid, with grade I referring to flat or slow moving water with few hazards, and grade VI referring to the hardest rapids which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers, and are rarely run. Grade-VI rapids are sometimes downgraded to grade-V or V+ {{if they have been}} run successfully. Harder rapids (for example a grade-V rapid on a mainly grade-III river) are often portaged, a French term for carrying. A portaged rapid is where the boater lands and carries the boat around the hazard.|$|E

6000|$|<b>CLASS</b> <b>VI.</b> The {{young in}} their first plumage differ from each other {{according}} to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely the adult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult females.—The cases in the present class, though occurring in various groups, are not numerous; yet, if experience had not taught us to the contrary, it seems {{the most natural thing}} that the young should at first always resemble to a certain extent, and gradually become more and more like, the adults of the same sex. The adult male blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) has a black head, that of the female being reddish-brown; and I am informed by Mr. Blyth, that the young of both sexes can be distinguished by this character even as nestlings. In the family of thrushes an unusual number of similar cases have been noticed; the male blackbird (Turdus merula) can be distinguished in the nest from the female, as the main wing-feathers, which are not moulted so soon as the body-feathers, retain a brownish tint until the second general moult.[274] The two sexes of the mocking bird (Turdus polyglottus, Linn.) differ very little from each other, yet the males can easily be distinguished {{at a very early age}} from the females by shewing more pure white.[275] The males of a forest-thrush and of a rock-thrush (viz. Orocetes erythrogastra and Petrocincla cyanea) have much of their plumage of a fine blue, whilst the females are brown; and the nestling males of both species have their main wing and tail-feathers edged with blue, whilst those of the female are edged with brown.[276] So that the very same feathers which in the young blackbird assume their mature character and become black after the others, in these two species assume this character and become blue before the others. The most probable view with reference to these cases is that the males, differently from what occurs in Class I., have transmitted their colours to their male offspring at an earlier age than that at which they themselves first acquired them; for if they had varied whilst quite young, they would probably have transmitted all their characters to their offspring of both sexes.[277] ...|$|E
