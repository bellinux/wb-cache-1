Thematic and theoretical sampling of literature were also embarked upon during the later stage of the research to add density to emergent categories and themes.

According to the Oxford dictionary (2015) <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is,</b> “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement”. In New Zealand education, the development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> given utmost importance, spanning from Early Childcare education to tertiary education. <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> termed as a lifelong skill by the Tertiary Education Commission in the Statement of Intent 2015 – 2019. <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the fundamental}} requisites expected of graduates by industry, business and employers. University brochures and websites in New Zealand assure the development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills in graduates. <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> deemed necessary for education, employment and successful life of an individual. In spite of all this, anecdotal evidence, reinforced by extant literature, indicates that understanding of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> and associated development and assessment practices are inconsistent and deserving of further research. What remains unclear at present is the quality assurance for graduates who qualify the same level qualification from different institutions in New Zealand. This current study reviews the perceptions of educators about the nature of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> and identifies the teaching strategies employed by those educators to develop <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills in students in tertiary institutions in New Zealand. The research results indicate development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> lays equal emphasis on the role of students, teachers and systems. The thesis suggests the Tertiary Education Commission may consider providing a definition of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> across the entire tertiary education sector to maintain the common understanding of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> among students and teachers. This research indicates development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> may <b>be</b> measured by mandatory introduction of a pre-critical thinking test and post-critical thinking test for all students in the tertiary educational institutions.

40|$|Preparation for {{the twenty-first}} century {{presents}} Taiwan's education with a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to reflect upon the existing value system; the opportunity is to innovate. The thesis has seven chapters. The first chapter deals with educational provision in Taiwan. The difficulties of teaching <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in Taiwan <b>are</b> located in distortions of the educational function, the instrumental role of teachers and the traditional type of teaching and learning. The second chapter looks at how education is framed by culture and society. A lack of autonomy is identified as the major crisis of education in Taiwan. In the third chapter, the characteristics of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>are</b> shown in its four modes: the supernatural mode, the empirical mode, the subject-dialectical mode and the communicative mode. In chapter four, a definition of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> given. It is suggested that the commonalities of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>are</b> autonomy, dialectical development, multi-dimensional cognition, emancipation from alienation, and reconstruction. In chapter five, a good life based on <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> sketched out, which is made up of autonomy, harmony and reconstruction. The task of chapter six is clarifying the distinction between education and indoctrination; and arguing that autonomy is an adequate criterion for distinguishing education from indoctrination. Chapter seven is devoted to working out the principles for the teaching of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> It <b>is</b> suggested that these principles are those of emancipation, autonomy and reconstruction. Overall, this thesis is aimed at developing a theoretical foundation for specifying what <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> is; assessing the specific cultural and educational obstacles to its introduction in Taiwan; and the thesis concludes with suggestions about how to put <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> into educational practice through evolutionary innovation. ...|$|R

Some skills in English such as listening, speaking, reading and writing can be successfully achieved whenever they <b>are</b> <b>critical,</b> since <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> also the ability allowing the students to express everything freely. Unfortunately, utilizing <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> not as simple as seen. Therefore, project-based learning was utilized to accommodate the use of the pre-service English teachers’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> and how their <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> raised. By conducting descriptive qualitative design, this research aims to elaborate the utilizing project based learning to raise pre-service English teachers’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The research <b>was</b> conducted in TEYL Media class for the sixth semester consisting of 35 pre-service English teachers.

The development of students' higher-order cognitive abilities, such as <b>critical</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>is</b> also well recognised in nursing and midwifery education. Measurement of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> development <b>is</b> important to demonstrate {{change over time}} and effectiveness of teaching strategies. Objective: To evaluate tools designed to measure <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in nursing and midwifery undergraduate students. Data Sources: The following six databases were searched and resulted in the retrieval of 1191 papers: CINAHL, Ovid Medline, ERIC, Informit, PsycINFO and Scopus. Review Methods: After screening for inclusion, each paper was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Tool. Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria and quality appraisal. Sixteen different tools that measure <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>were</b> reviewed for reliability and validity and {{extent to which the}} domains of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>were</b> evident. Results: Sixty percent of studies utilised one of four standardised commercially available measures of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Reliability and validity were not consistently reported and there was a variation in reliability across studies that used the same measure. Of the remaining studies using different tools, there was also limited reporting of reliability making it difficult to assess internal consistency and potential applicability of measures across settings. Conclusions: Discipline specific instruments to measure <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in nursing and midwifery are required, specifically tools that measure the application of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> to practise. Given that <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> development occurs over an extended period, measurement needs to be repeated and multiple methods of measurement used over time.
