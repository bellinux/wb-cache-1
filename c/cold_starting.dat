Due to the insufficiency of user feedbacks, sequential prediction usually suffers from the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. There {{are two kinds of}} popular approaches based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC) for item prediction. MF methods factorize the user-item matrix to learn general tastes of users. MC methods predict the next behavior based on recent behaviors. However, they have limitations.

2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for <b>cold</b> <b>starting,</b> and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising energy conversion devices for the future in automotive applications. One of the major technical challenges for the commercialization of PEMFC is the effective start-up from subzero temperatures, often referred to as “cold start”. The major problem of PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> is that the product water freezes when the temperature inside the PEMFC is lower than the freezing point. If the catalyst layer (CL) is fully occupied by ice before the cell temperature rises above the freezing point, the electrochemical reaction may stop due to the blockage of the reaction sites. However, only a few of the previous PEMFC studies paid attention to <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b> Hence, understanding the ice formation mechanisms and optimizing the design and operational strategies for PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> are critically important. In this research, an experimental setup for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> testing with simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions is designed and built; a one-dimensional (1 D) analytical model for quick estimate of purging durations before the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes is formulated; and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> model is developed. The unique feature of the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> experiment is the inclusion of the simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions. Since most of the previous numerical models are limited to either 1 D or two-dimensional (2 D) or 3 D but only considering a section of the entire cell due to computational requirement, the measured distribution data are critically important to better understand the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> characteristics. With a full set of conservation equations, the 3 D model comprehensively accounts for the various transport phenomena during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes. The unique feature of this model is the inclusion of: (i) the water freezing in the membrane electrolyte and its effects on the membrane conductivity; (ii) the non-equilibrium mass transfer between the water in the ionomer and the water (vapour, liquid and ice) in the pore region of the CL; and (iii) both the water freezing and melting in the CL and gas diffusion layer (GDL). This model therefore provides the fundamental framework for the future top-down multi-dimensional multiphase modelling of PEMFC. The experimental and numerical results elaborate the ice formation mechanisms and other important transport phenomena during the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes.

40|$|Computer-based {{multimedia}} {{learning environments}} {{support the idea}} that people learn better and more deeply when appropriate pictures (i. e., animations, video, static graphics) are added to text or narration. There are many adaptive learning systems that adapt learning materials to student properties, preferences, and activities. Adaptive learning environments mostly support only traditional concepts of learning. There is a need to design and develop an e-learning system that embodies principles of constructivist learning approach. The solution is in recommenders systems, which suggest items of interest to users based on their preferences (i. e. previous ratings). If there are no ratings for a certain user or item/object, there is a situation called a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem, which leads to unreliable recommendations. Researchers mostly avoid tackling the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> in recommender systems. The topic of presented dissertation is designing a recommender system with a novel approach to avoid <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. Approaches for solving the new user <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem can be divided into two main groups: the first group performs additional inquiries to gather more information about the users; and the second group uses dedicated algorithms for users in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. The first group of approaches aims at performing additional inquiries about the user. According to this approach, we relate combinations of different learning styles (taking into account four different learning styles models) to preferred multimedia types. We explore a decision model aimed at proposing learning material of an appropriate multimedia type. The study includes 272 student participants. The resulting decision model shows that students prefer well-structured learning texts with colour discrimination, and that the hemispheric learning style model is the most important criterion in deciding student preferences for different multimedia learning materials. To provide a more accurate and reliable model for recommending different multimedia types more learning style models must be combined. Kolb’s classification and the VAK classification allow us to learn if students prefer {{an active role in the}} learning process, and what multimedia type they prefer. The results also shows that there is an obvious need to combine learning styles model in order to get a wider view of the student’s characteristics: an approach to problem solving problems, cognitive modes, way of thinking, and a dominant mode of perceiving information. On another hand, model recommends same multimedia material regardless of the learning topic. In the second part of our research, we have designed and developed a novel approach for alleviating the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem by imputing missing values into the input matrix, thereby improving recommendation performance. Our approach has three steps: 1) finding similar users to given user in <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state; 2) selecting relevant attributes for the imputation process; 3) aggregate ratings to input matrix for a user in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. We separate our approach for solving <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem into solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem and solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. According to the results of our experiments (solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem), the results indicate that all our proposed methods improve recommending for non-negative matrix factorization with stochastic gradient descent (NG). For semi-non-negative matrix factorization with missing data (SN), combinations FR-ME (imputing attribute's mean value into the attributes that have the highest frequency of the most frequent values) and SD-MF (imputing attribute’s most frequent value into attributes that have the lowest standard deviation) improve recommendations for users in the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. For non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least squares (NS) and matrix factorization by data fusion (DF), none of variations of proposed parameters (methods) improves recommending in absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. In the next stage of our research, we evaluated our approach for solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem.

It plays a critical role {{in a wide range of}} online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> to non-cold start status.

40|$|Objectives are to: (1) Investigate novel {{engine control}} {{strategies}} targeted at rapid engine/catalyst warming {{for the purpose}} of mitigating tailpipe emissions from plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) exposed to multiple engine <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> events; and (2) Validate and optimize hybrid supervisory control techniques developed during previous and on-going research projects by integrating them into the vehicle level control system and complementing them with the modified engine control strategies in order to further reduce emissions during both <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> and engine re-starts. Approach used are: (1) Perform a literature search of engine control strategies used in conventional powertrains to reduce <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions; (2) Develop an open source engine controller providing full access to engine control strategies in order to implement new engine/catalyst warm-up behaviors; (3) Modify engine <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> control algorithms and characterize impact on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> behavior; and (4) Develop an experimental Engine-In-the-Loop test stand in order to validate control methodologies and verify transient thermal behavior and emissions of the real engine when combined with a virtual hybrid powertrain. Some major accomplishments are: (1) Commissioned a prototype engine controller on a GM Ecotec 2. 4 l direct injected gasoline engine on an engine test cell at the University of Tennessee. (2) Obtained from Bosch (with GM's approval) an open calibration engine controller for a GM Ecotec LNF 2. 0 l Gasoline Turbocharged Direct Injection engine. Bosch will support the bypass of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> strategies if calibration access proves insufficient. The LNF engine and its open controller were commissioned on an engine test cell at ORNL. (3) Completed a literature search to identify key engine <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> control parameters and characterized their impact on the real engine using the Bosch engine controller to calibrate them. (4) Ported virtual hybrid vehicle model from offline simulation environment to real-time Hardware-In-the-Loop platform...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol–gasoline blends on CO and HC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions from a four- stroke motorcycle. Nowadays, due to catalyst improvements and efficient electronic mixture control, a significant part of the total emissions during a trip takes place during the cold phase. The employ of alternative fuels could be one of means to lessen the cold-start emissions from two-wheeler engines: ethanol is known as potential alcohol alternative fuel for spark ignition engines, which can be blended with gasoline to increase oxygen content and then to decrease CO and HC emissions. From this considerations, an experimental-analytical investigation was performed on the exhaust cold extra emissions of one motorcycle belonging to the Euro- 3 legislative category. The study explains a calculation procedure to model the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> transient behavior of motorcycles in order to evaluate the impact of ethanol addition (10, 20 and 30 vol. %) on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions compared with a reference commercial gasoline. Results of the tests indicate that CO and HC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> extra emissions by using ethanol–gasoline blended fuels decrease compared to the use of unleaded gasoline. Emission factors during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> transient were quantized as a function of the ethanol percentage in the blended fuels...|$|R
