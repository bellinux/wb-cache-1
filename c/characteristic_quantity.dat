Force distributions within these networks are typically highly inhomogeneous and, although {{the importance of}} force distributions for structural properties is well recognized, they are far from being understood quantitatively. Using a combination of probabilistic and graph-theoretical techniques we derive force distributions in a model system consisting of ensembles of random linear spring networks on a circle. We show that <b>characteristic</b> <b>quantities,</b> such as mean and variance of the force supported by individual springs, can be derived explicitly in terms of only two parameters: (i) average connectivity and (ii) number of nodes.

In contrast, we demonstrate that network topology is a crucial determinant of force distributions in an elastic spring network. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures. Missing labels in Fig. 4 added.

However, the existing research mainly focuses on increasing the dynamic detection range or application fields. Calibration of the detection system, which has a great influence on the detection accuracy, has not been addressed properly. In this context, this work develops a calibration strip for ICG assay photoelectric detection systems. An image of the test strip is captured by an image acquisition device, followed by performing a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and maximin-distance algorithm for image segmentation.

Then, H, S, and V values are transferred to the RGB color space and a high-resolution printer is used to print the strip images on cellulose nitrate membranes.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{buildings}} {{takes place in}} phases representing a development from rough to precision planning. Estimates are made {{in order to test}} whether the result is still within the budget set by the client or developer. In this way, the decisions taken during the design phase can be quantified and expressed in monetary terms. To prevent blaming the wrong person when an overrun is discovered, the cost control process has to be improved. For that purpose, two new procedures have been developed: (i) a new translation activity, and (ii) ratios by which quantities can be characterized. Translation is the opposite of estimation. A monetary budget is converted -'translated'- into quantities, reflecting the desired quality of the building materials. The financial constraints of the client are thus converted into quantities - the building components used by the designers. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>quantity</b> figures {{play an important role in}} this activity. In working out an estimate, the form factor (i. e. the ratio between two characteristic values of a building component) has to be determined. The unit cost is then tested against that ratio. The introduction of the 'translation' activity and the use of <b>characteristic</b> <b>quantity</b> figures and form factors enhance existing estimation methods.
