5000|$|Crime {{analysts are}} {{employed}} {{at all levels}} of law enforcement, often as civilian professionals while other agencies appoint sworn police officers to a <b>crime</b> <b>analysis</b> position. In the United States, most crime analysts are employed by municipal or county police departments. In countries other than the United States, <b>crime</b> <b>analysis</b> is often called [...] "intelligence analysis" [...] or [...] "criminal intelligence analysis," [...] but in the U.S., this term is generally understood to apply to a different law enforcement discipline.

40|$|<b>Crime</b> pattern <b>{{analysis}}</b> {{has tended}} to focus on `hotspot’ analysis techniques; the identification of areas with higher densities of criminal activity. This paper documents a different approach to determination of hotspots and aims to present a conceptual framework for the temporal <b>analysis</b> of aoristic <b>crime</b> data. This <b>analysis</b> monitors the change in crime patterns over time and can be applied to arbitrary areas, especially those smaller than police beat boundaries, which have been traditionally the smallest resolution areal unit studied within most British police forces. It also clarifies examination of lower crime areas, which can be overlooked in other forms of <b>analysis.</b> <b>Crime</b> data often lacks temporal definition and three different methods of temporal search technique are compared. Results from a new aoristic approach highlight a weekly Monday peak in motor vehicle crime on one division of Nottinghamshire Constabulary. In another example a historically weighted temporal model helps identify rising or falling crime rates...|$|R
