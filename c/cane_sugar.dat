In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from wave action was also reported. Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103mph (166km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. <b>Cane</b> <b>sugar</b> crops sustained US$2.7million in losses. Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.|$|E

When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World. The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
