5|$|Dickov debuted for Blackburn Rovers as a half-time {{substitute}} against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2004.

5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It is {{suggested}} that this deprivation may have <b>caused</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|He had two fond {{childhood}} memories of watching {{a stretch of}} the Mille Miglia race in 1954 which <b>caused</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become captivated by Italian two-time Formula One world champion Alberto Ascari, who won the race, which got {{him to go to}} Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, where he saw Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio race against each other.|$|E
