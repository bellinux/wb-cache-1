40|$|BACKGROUND: Although Ixodes spp. are {{the most}} common ticks in North-Western Europe, recent reports {{indicated}} an expanding geographical distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus in Western Europe. Recently, the establishment of a D. reticulatus population in Belgium was described. D. reticulatus is an important vector of <b>canine</b> and equine <b>babesiosis</b> and can transmit several Rickettsia species, Coxiella burnetii and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), whilst Ixodes spp. are vectors of pathogens causing babesiosis, borreliosis, anaplasmosis, rickettsiosis and TBEV. METHODS: A survey was conducted in 2008 - 2009 to investigate the presence of different tick species and associated pathogens on dogs and cats in Belgium. Ticks were collected from dogs and cats in 75 veterinary practices, selected by stratified randomization. All collected ticks were morphologically determined and analysed for the presence of Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia DNA. RESULTS: In total 2373 ticks were collected from 647 dogs and 506 cats. Ixodes ricinus (76. 4 %) and I. hexagonus (22. 6 %) were the predominant species. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0. 3 %) and D. reticulatus (0. 8 %) were found in low numbers on dogs only. All dogs infested with R. sanguineus had a recent travel history, but D. reticulatus were collected from a dog without a history of travelling abroad. Of the collected Ixodes ticks, 19. 5 % were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 10. 1 % for Borrelia spp. (B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi s. s., B. lusitaniae, B. valaisiana and B. spielmanii). Rickettsia helvetica was found in 14. 1 % of Ixodes ticks. All Dermacentor ticks were negative for all the investigated pathogens, but one R. sanguineus tick was positive for Rickettsia massiliae. CONCLUSION: D. reticulatus was confirmed to be present as an indigenous parasite in Belgium. B. lusitaniae and R. helvetica were detected in ticks in Belgium for the first time. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Pigmented serum, usually due to free {{haemoglobin}} and/or bilirubin, is {{a common}} finding in dogs with babesiosis, resulting in interference with all biochemical tests that rely on photochemistry. This is particularly true of urea and creatinine determinations, complicating the diagnosis of acute renal failure, which is a serious complication of babesiosis. A disproportionately raised serum urea concentration of unknown origin occurs in severely anaemic <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> patients and gives rise to an increased serum urea:creatinine ratio. The assay for cystatin-C, an excellent measure of glomerular filtration rate, is unaffected by free serum haemoglobin, and due to its different intrinsic origins, is free of influence by the metabolic derangements and organ pathology, other than renal disease, encountered in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Serum cystatin-C {{was used to compare}} the concentrations of serum urea and serum creatinine in dogs with the severely anaemic form of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> as well as a canine babesiosis-free reference group.

40|$|Abnormal {{carbohydrate}} metabolism is a commonly encountered feature of malaria in people, and similar derangements {{have been detected}} in veterinary patients with <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Glucose, the major metabolic fuel source, is a key resource in critically ill patients as they mount an immunological response to infection and inflammation. The ability {{of the individual to}} effectively mobilise, distribute and utilise glucose is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Hypoglycaemia has been identified as a life threatening metabolic complication in almost 20 % of severely ill dogs suffering from babesiosis due to Babesia rossi infection. Insulin and glucagon are the primary hormones involved in glucose homeostasis. Insulin lowers blood glucose concentration by facilitating cellular uptake and utilisation of glucose. Hyperinsulinaemia as a result of inappropriate insulin secretion may precipitate hypoglycaemia, and has been identif ed as a cause of hypoglycaemia in human and murine malaria. A similar phenomenon may exist in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study, including 94 dogs with naturally acquired virulent babesiosis, sought to investigate and characterise the relationship between blood glucose concentrations and insulin concentrations in cases of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Pre-treatment jugular blood samples were collected for simultaneous determination of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Animals were retrospectively divided into three groups: hypoglycaemic (plasma glucose concentration 5. 5 mmol/L; n= 16). The median plasma insulin concentrations (IQR in parentheses) for the hypoglycaemic, normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic groups were 10. 7 pmol/L (10. 7 - 18. 8 pmol/L), 10. 7 pmol/L (10. 7 - 29. 53 pmol/L; i. e below the detection limit of the assay), and 21. 7 pmol/L (10. 7 - 45. 74 pmol/L), respectively.

Results: The study was conducted with a sample of 40 dogs suffering from babesiosis (further divided into uncomplicated, one complication and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome - MODS group) and 30 healthy dogs (control group). Additionally, the babesiosis group was divided according to the anaemia into non-anaemic, mildly anaemic, moderately anaemic and severely anaemic dogs. The results of our study showed significantly decreased SOD, catalase and TAS values in diseased dogs compared to controls, while there were no significant differences in GPx between these groups. Dogs that developed MODS showed lower activities of SOD and GPx and higher MDA values compared to dogs with uncomplicated babesiosis as well as with dogs that developed one complication. Superoxide dismutase, catalase and GPx were negatively correlated whereas MDA was positively correlated with the lethal outcome of the disease.

Only two dogs had inappropriately elevated insulin concentrations. One of these dogs was hypoglycaemic. We conclude that hyperinsulinaemia is an infrequent cause of hypoglycaemia in virulent <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Other causes of hypoglycaemia, such as increased glucose consumption, depletion of hepatic glycogen stores, and hepatic dysfunction with impaired gluconeogenesis, are speculated to play more important roles in the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Jowett fund, University of Cambridge & Department of Companion Animal Clinical Studies, University of Pretori...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{outbreaks}} of clinical <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> {{were observed in}} 2 areas of the Swiss Midlands that had no history of this disease so far. In one area, cases of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> occurred over 2 consecutive tick seasons. The outbreaks involved 29 dogs, 4 of which died. All dogs were infected with large Babesia sp. as diagnosed in Giemsa-stained blood smears and/or PCR. These were identified as B. canis (formerly known as B. canis canis) by subsequent partial sequencing of the 18 S rRNA gene of Babesia sp. Interestingly, the sequence indicated either a genotype with heterogeneity in the ssrRNA gene copies or double infection with different B. canis isolates. None of the dogs had a recent travel history, but one had frequently travelled to Hungary and had suffered twice from clinical babesiosis 18 and 24 {{months prior to the}} outbreak in autumn 2011. Retrospective sequencing of a stored blood DNA sample of this dog revealed B. canis, with an identical sequence to the Babesia involved in the outbreaks. For the first time in Switzerland, the partial 18 S rRNA gene of B. canis could be amplified from DNA isolated from 19 out of 23 adult Dermacentor reticulatus ticks flagged in the same area. The sequence was identical to that found in the dogs. Furthermore, one affected dog carried a female D. reticulatus tick harbouring B. canis DNA. Our findings illustrate that, under favourable biogeographic and climatic conditions, the life-cycle of B. canis can relatively rapidly establish itself in previously non-endemic areas. <b>Canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> should therefore always be a differential diagnosis when dogs with typical clinical signs are presented, regardless of known endemic areas.

40|$|Babesia gibsoni is a haemoprotozoan {{parasite}} {{of emerging}} global importance. The clinical presentation of babesial infections is diverse and the systemic inflammatory response induced by infection {{is considered to}} be a major feature of the pathophysiology of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> An experimental case-controlled longitudinal study was conducted to assess the clinical, haematological, cytokine and acute phase protein changes that occur during experimental B. gibsoni infection of beagle puppies. Infected dogs became transiently pyrexic and anaemic, intermittently neutropenic and transiently, but profoundly, thrombocytopenic, although this had no apparent adverse clinical effect. Experimental B. gibsoni infection also induced an acute phase response, characterised by a marked increase in the concentration of C-reactive protein, which was delayed in onset following infection but preceded the detection of peripheral parasitaemia. Experimental B. gibsoni infection was also associated with marked increases in the concentration of multiple cytokines which were also delayed in onset following infection and occurred subsequent to the detection of peripheral parasitaemia and the acute phase response. This study furthers our understanding of the immune response that occurs during babesial infections and the role that systemic inflammation plays in the pathophysiology of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceCanine babesiosis, {{caused by}} intraerythrocytic Babesia spp., is a tick-borne disease of {{worldwide}} importance. No information on <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> {{has been documented}} in Slovenia. Therefore, 238 dogs admitted to the Small animal clinic in Ljubljana from the years 2000 to 2002 were tested {{for the presence of}} babesial parasites in the blood. Based on clinical, microscopic and molecular investigations, 14 dogs (5. 9 %) were determined as being infected with babesiae. Clinical signs relating to acute haemolysis, fever, anorexia, depression and haematological abnormalities such as anaemia and thrombocytopenia were noticed in most of the 14 infected dogs. The morphology of the parasites was indicative of Babesia canis infection. Two subspecies were detected, namely B. canis canis (11 dogs, 4. 6 %) and B. canis vogeli (3 dogs, 1. 3 %) using PCR and subsequent sequence analysis of portions of nns rRNA gene. In addition, based on nucleotide sequence analysis, the 11 isolates of B. c. canis could be subdivided into three groups, whereas the three B. c. vogeli isolates were genetically identical.

A number of Babesia sp. can infect dogs and the spectrum is increasing as molecular methods are developed to differentiate organisms.

40|$|This thesis {{showed that}} dogs with natural {{infection}} with B. canis had both renal and cardiac dysfunction, {{both of which}} can be classified as complications of babesiosis and would thus necessitate supportive therapy. This thesis demonstrated that RTE celluria, proteinuria, and variable enzymuria and azotaemia occur in dogs with babesiosis. However, these were all minimal changes and all could be consistent with hypoxia, reduced GFR, or reduced cardiac output This thesis showed that dogs with naturally occurring babesiosis had significant urine met-haemoglobin with no evidence of blood met-haemoglobin. The possibility would be that the urinary methaemoglobin was either produced in the kidney or possibly by oxidation of haemoglobin to met-haemoglobin in the bladder. It has been shown experimentally that met-haemoglobin can be toxic. The combination of reduced GFR, anaemic hypoxia, and met-haemoglobin can all act synergistically to cause renal damage. Renal haemodynamics are also {{much more likely to be}} abnormal when cardiac dysfunction is present Reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are evidence of redistribution of blood flow that commonly occurs in early heart failure. An important finding in this thesis was that dogs with babesiosis had lower serum sodium than control dogs but there was no difference between mild, severe, or complicated cases of babesiosis. In addition, dogs with babesiosis had a lower fractional clearance of sodium than Clinically healthy control dogs, which can be interpreted as sodium retention by the kidneys. This sodium retention would also result in water retention, which will result in an expansion of the plasma volume. In the past heart lesions in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> were regarded as rare complications, with the majority of lesions being reported as incidental findings at post-mortem examination of complicated babesiosis cases. This thesis has demonstrated that cardiac lesions to be common in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> This thesis showed that that ECG changes in babesiosis were similar to the pattern described for myocarditis and myocardial ischaemia, and together with the histopathological findings indicated that the heart suffers from the same pathological processes described in other organs in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis,</b> namely inflammation and hypoxia. As the clinical application of the ECG changes found in this thesis was limited, cardiovascular assessment should be based on functional monitoring rather than ECG. Using cardiac troponin as a marker of myocardial injury, this thesis showed that myocardial cell injury occurs with <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Cardiac troponins, especially troponin I, are sensitive markers of myocardial injury in <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis,</b> and the magnitude of elevation of plasma troponin I concentrations appears to be proportional to the severity of the disease. ECG changes and serum cardiac troponin were correlated with histopathology. On cardiac histopathology from dogs that succumbed to babesiosis, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation and fibrin microthrombi in the myocardium were documented, all of which would have resulted in ECG changes and elevations in cardiac troponin. Myocardial infarction causes left ventricular failure, which will result in hypotension and an expansion of the plasma volume due to homeostatic mechanisms. This thesis showed that dogs with babesiosis had hypoalbuminaemia, which may be because of intravascular volume dilution due to fluid retention. In disease hypoalbuminaemia can occur as a negative acute-phase protein. In the light of the cardiac changes, hyponatraemia, and hypotension, a probable cause would be fluid retention due to myocardial disease. This thesis showed that dogs with babesiosis had left ventricular lesions, which can result in systolic heart failure. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Abstract Background Protozoa and {{bacteria}} transmitted by arthropods, including ticks and phlebotomine sand flies, may cause {{a wide range}} of canine vector-borne diseases. Dogs can be simultaneously or sequentially infected with multiple pathogens. <b>Canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> caused by Babesia canis canis and Babesia canis vogeli is known to occur in Portugal. This study assessed, by means of blood smear examination, PCR and DNA nucleotide sequencing, the presence of Babesia spp. and co-infecting agents Leishmania, Anaplasma / Ehrlichia and Hepatozoon in 45 dogs from northern Portugal clinically suspected of babesiosis. Results Forty-four dogs (98 %) had infection with B. canis canis and one with B. canis vogeli. Co-infections were detected in nine animals (20 %). Eight dogs were found infected with two vector-borne agents: six with B. canis canis and Leishmania infantum; one with B. canis canis and Ehrlichia canis; and one with B. canis canis and Hepatozoon canis. Another dog was infected with three vector-borne pathogens: B. canis vogeli, E. canis and L. infantum. Overall, L. infantum was found in seven (16 %), E. canis in two (4 %), and H. canis in one (2 %) out of the 45 dogs with babesiosis. Almost 90 % of the 45 cases of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> were diagnosed in the colder months of October (18 %), November (27 %), December (20 %), February (13 %) and March (9 %). Co-infections were detected in February, March, April, May, October and November. Twenty-two (50 %) out of 44 dogs infected with B. canis were found infested by ticks including Dermacentor spp., Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Mortality (9 %) included two co-infected dogs that died spontaneously and two with single infections that were euthanized. Conclusions Babesia canis canis is the main etiological agent of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> in northern Portugal. A higher sensitivity of Babesia spp. detection was obtained with PCR assays, compared to the observation of blood smears. Twenty percent of the dogs were co-infected with L. infantum, E. canis or H. canis. Furthermore, this is the first molecular identification of H. canis in dogs from northern Portugal. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> is a {{clinically}} important hemoprotozoan parasite affecting dogs. The goal of {{this present}} {{study was to determine the}} clinical symptoms and to establish its hematological and microscopic detection and compare it with the PCR findings attained from dogs infected with Babesia canis vogeli. Methodology/Principal Findings. 13 -PCR confirmed Babesia-infected dogs were examined; seminested PCR was used to discover the precise type of Babesia and Babesia canis vogeli was the only subspecies detected. The most consistent clinical signs were elevated rectal temperature and a pale mucous membrane. Thrombocytopenia, monocytosis, and lymphocytosis, along with a significant reduction in red cell parameters, were the most commonly recorded hematologic alterations. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of typical large merozoites and trophozoites of B. canis in the ratio 76. 92 %. Conclusions/Significance. The presumptive diagnosis of <b>canine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> should be based on a fever and anemia, while thrombocytopenia is considered the hallmark of the disease; microscopic examination may not be very revealing in the detection at low parasitemia, but it remains the most rapid confirmatory method. Seminested PCR turned out to be a sensitive and accurate method for diagnosis; during the process of differentiation between Babesia subspecies, only B. canis subsp. vogeli was detected...|$|E
