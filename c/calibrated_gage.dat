Strains measured during a laboratory load calibration of a wing structure are compared with calculations obtained from a simplified NASA structural analysis (NASTRAN) model. Calculated and measured influence coefficient plots that show the shear, bending, and torsion characteristics of typical strain-gage bridges are presented. Typical influence coefficient plots are given for several load equations to illustrate the derivation of the equations from the component strain-gage bridges.

40|$|During several Active Aeroelastic Wing {{research}} flights, {{the shadow}} of the over-wing shock could be observed because of natural lighting conditions. As the plane accelerated, the shock location moved aft, and as the shadow passed the aileron and trailing-edge flap hinge lines, their associated hinge moments were substantially affected. The observation of the dominant effect of shock location on aft control surface hinge moments led to this investigation. This report investigates the effect of over-wing shock location on wing loads through flight-measured data and analytical predictions. Wing-root and wing-fold bending moment and torque and leading- and trailing-edge hinge moments have been measured in flight using <b>calibrated</b> strain <b>gages.</b> These same loads have been predicted using a computational fluid dynamics code called the Euler Navier-Stokes Three Dimensional Aeroelastic Code.

During level transonic flight, the shock location dominated the wing trailing-edge control surface hinge moments.

40|$|The Moore M- 48 Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) {{is used to}} <b>calibrate</b> step <b>gages,</b> ball {{bars and}} hole plates. The {{expanded}} uncertainty (2 sigma) of the M- 48 CMM {{was determined to be}} {+-} 0. 3 + 0. 4 L microns (L is length in meters), using the decomposition method. The problem statement becomes, how does one monitor and control the calibration process to ensure that one maintains this level of reliability? Traditional methods of statistical process control, such as X-bar and R charts assume large lot production and are designed to detect changes in the process being monitored. Since calibrations are performed one at a time, with sometimes years between calibrations, standard control charting methodology falls a bit short of what is needed to maintain process capability. Upon examination of the process uncertainty for the M- 48 CMM the author finds the following parameters play an important roll in process capability. Since the M- 48 uses laser scales, the Edlen equation is used to convert pressure, temperature and humidity to wavelength correction. The largest source of uncertainty comes from temperature effects based on gradients, accuracy of the thermistors and the actual coefficient of thermal expansion of the artifact. The probe calibration, which is performed for each calibration, is another important variable. Since the M- 48 CMM`s movement is very slow, drift is also an important parameter to monitor.

Decelerating through the transition region in level flight was found to result in higher vibratory moments than accelerating through this region.

40|$|Direct thrust {{measurement}} using strain gages offers advantages over analytically-based thrust calculation methods. For flight test applications, the {{direct measurement method}} typically uses a simpler sensor arrangement and minimal data processing compared to analytical techniques, which normally require costly engine modeling and multisensor arrangements throughout the engine. Conversely, direct {{thrust measurement}} has historically produced less than desirable accuracy because of difficulty in mounting and <b>calibrating</b> the strain <b>gages</b> and the inability to account for secondary forces that influence the thrust reading at the engine mounts. Consequently, the strain-gage technique has normally been used for simple engine arrangements and primarily in the subsonic speed range.

40|$|The TELSTAR 4 {{communication}} satellites being manufactured by Martin Marietta Astro Space (Astro Space) for AT&T are three axis stabilized spacecraft {{scheduled to be}} launched on expendable vehicles such as the Atlas or Ariane rockets. Typically, these spacecraft consist of a box that holds the electronics and supports the antenna reflectors and the solar array wings. The wings and reflectors are folded against {{the sides of the}} box during launch and the spacecraft is spun for attitude control in that phase; they are then deployed after achieving the final orbit. The launch phase and transfer orbits required to achieve the final geosynchronous orbit typically take 4 to 5 days during which time the power required for command, telemetry, attitude control, heaters, etc., is provided by two 50 AH nickel hydrogen batteries augmented by the exposed outboard solar panels. In the past, this situation has presented no problem since there was a considerable excess of power available from the array. In the case of large high powered spacecraft such as TELSTAR 4, however, the design power levels in transfer orbit approach the time-averaged power available from the exposed surface area of the solar arrays, resulting in a very tight power margin. To compound the difficulty, the array output of the spinning spacecraft in transfer orbit is shaped like a full wave rectified sine function and provides very low charging rates to the batteries during portions of the rotation. In view of the typically low charging efficiency of alkaline nickel batteries at low rates, it was decided to measure the efficiency during a simulation of the TELSTAR 4 conditions at the expected power levels and temperatures on three nickel hydrogen cells of similar design. The unique feature of nickel hydrogen cells that makes the continuous measurement of efficiency possible is that hydrogen is one of the active materials and thus, cell pressure is a direct measure of the state of charge or available capacity.

At this site, H-type piles were driven to a weathered bedrock layer and soil surcharging was used to reduce the anticipated settlement of a 15 m (50 ft) thick layer of clayey sand overburden. Evaluating the load in the bridge piling for this case study and subsequent sensitivity modelling provides a comprehensive case study for use as background to the Minnesota Department of Transportation's revised dragload design guidance.

40|$|The {{environmental}} aspect of elevated temperature {{and its relationship}} to the science of strain gage calibrations of aircraft structures are addressed. A section of a wing designed for a high-speed aircraft structure was used to study this problem. This structure was instrumented with strain <b>gages</b> <b>calibrated</b> at both elevated and room temperatures. Load equations derived from a high-temperature load calibration were compared with equations derived from an identical load calibration at room temperature. The implications of the high temperature load calibration were studied from the viewpoint of applicability and necessity. Load equations derived from the room temperature load calibration resulted in generally lower equation standard errors than equations derived from the elevated temperature load calibration. A distributed load was applied to the structure at elevated temperature and strain gage outputs were measured. This applied load was then calculated using equations derived from both the room temperature and elevated temperature calibration data. It was found that {{no significant differences between the}} two equation systems existed in terms of computing this applied distributed load, as long as the thermal shifts resulting from thermal stresses could be identified.

Characterization of the vegetation resource over large landscapes can be time consuming, expensive and almost impossible to do on a near real-time basis. The overarching goal {{of this study was to}} examine available technologies for implementing near real-time systems to monitor forage biomass available to livestock on a given landscape. The primary objectives were to examine the ability of the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Product (CMORPH) and Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) rainfall products to detect and estimate rainfall at semi-arid sites in West Texas, to verify the ability of a simulation model (PHYGROW) to predict herbaceous biomass at selected sites (patches) in a semi-arid landscape using NEXRAD rainfall, and to examine the feasibility of using cokriging for integrating simulation model output and satellite greenness imagery (NDVI) for producing landscape maps of forage biomass in Mongolia?s Gobi region. The comparison of the NEXRAD and CMORPH rainfall products to gage collected rainfall revealed that NEXRAD outperformed the CMORPH rainfall with lower estimation bias, lower variability, and higher estimation efficiency. When NEXRAD was used as a driving variable in PHYGROW simulations that were <b>calibrated</b> using <b>gage</b> measured rainfall, model performance for estimating forage biomass was generally poor when compared to biomass measurements at the sites. However, when model simulations were calibrated using NEXRAD rainfall, performance in estimating biomass was substantially better. A suggested reason for the improved performance was that calibration with NEXRAD adjusted the model for the general over or underestimation of rainfall by the NEXRAD product. In the Gobi region of Mongolia, the PHYGROW model performed well in predicting forage biomass except for overestimations in the Forest Steppe zone. Cross-validation revealed that cokriging of PHYGROW output with NDVI as a covariate performed well during the majority of the growing season. Cokriging of simulation model output and NDVI appears to hold promise for producing landscape maps of forage biomass as part of near real-time forage monitoring systems...|$|R

However, the technical complexity of many spatially explicit erosion models precludes their use by practitioners. To address this critical gap, we demonstrate a contemporary use of applied geomorphometry through a straightforward GIS analysis of sediment sources in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, USA, designed to support erosion reduction strategies. Using 2  m lidar digital elevation models, we delineated the entire river network in the Arroyo Mocho watershed (573  km 2) at the scale of [*]∼[*]  30  m segments and identified incised landforms {{using a combination of}} hillslope gradient and planform curvature. Chronic erosion to the channel network was estimated based on these topographic attributes and the size of vegetation, and <b>calibrated</b> to sediment <b>gage</b> data, providing a spatially explicit estimate of sediment yield from incised channels across the basin. Rates of erosion were summarized downstream through the channel network, revealing patterns of sediment supply at the reach scale. Erosion and sediment supply were also aggregated to subbasins, allowing comparative analyses at the scale of tributaries. The erosion patterns delineated using this approach provide land use planners with a robust framework to design erosion reduction strategies. More broadly, the study demonstrates a modern analysis of important geomorphic processes affected by land use that is easily applied by agencies to solve common problems in watersheds, improving the integration between science and environmental management...|$|R

One blade of the helicopter was equipped at 14 percent and 40 percent of the blade radius with strain <b>gages</b> <b>calibrated</b> to measure moments rather than stresses. The results indicate that the maximum moments encountered in partial-power descents with forward speed tend to be generally reduced from the maximum moments encountered during partid-power descents at zero forward speed. High-speed level turns and pull-outs from auto-rotation caused retreating-blade stall which produced torsional moments (values up to 2, 400 inch-pounds). at the 14 -percent-radius station that were as large as those encountered during the previous investigations of retreating-blade stall (values up t o 2, 500 inch-pounds). High-forward- speed high-rotor-speed autorotation produced flapwise bending moments (values up to 7, 200 inch-pounds) at the 40 -percent-radius station which were as large as the flapwise bending moments (values up to 7, 800 inch-pounds) a t the 14 -percent-radius station encountered during partial - power vertical descents. The results of the present investigation (tip-speed ratios up to 0. 325 and an unaccelerated level-flight mean lift coefficient of about 0. 6), in combination with the related results of at zero forward speed produce the largest rotor-blade vibratory moments. However, inasmuch as these large moments occur only during 1 percent of the cycles and 88 percent of the cycles are at moment values less than 70 percent of these maximum values in partial-power descents, other conditions, such as high-speed flight where the large moments are combined with large percentages of time spent,must not be neglected in any rotor-blade service-life assessment...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center have {{developed}} a unique strain gage and adhesive system for measuring the mechanical properties of polymers and polymer composites at elevated temperatures. This system overcomes {{some of the problems}} encountered in using commercial strain gages and adhesives. For example, typical commercial strain gage adhesives require a postcure at temperatures substantially higher than the maximum test temperature. The exposure of the specimen to this temperature may affect subsequent results, and in some cases may be higher than the glass-transition temperature of the polymer. In addition, although typical commercial strain gages can be used for short times at temperatures up to 370 C, their long-term use is limited to 230 C. This precludes their use for testing some high-temperature polyimides near their maximum temperature capability. Lewis' strain gage and adhesive system consists of a nonencapsulated, unbacked gage grid that is bonded directly to the polymer after the specimen has been cured but prior to the normal postcure cycle. The gage is applied with an adhesive specially formulated to cure under the specimen postcure conditions. Special handling, mounting, and electrical connection procedures were developed, and a fixture was designed to <b>calibrate</b> each strain <b>gage</b> after it was applied to a specimen. A variety of tests was conducted to determine the performance characteristics of the gages at elevated temperatures on PMR- 15 neat resin and titanium specimens. For these tests, which included static tension, thermal exposure, and creep tests, the gage and adhesive system performed within normal strain gage specifications at 315 C.

40|$|During {{hypersonic}} flight, {{high temperatures}} and high heat fluxes are generated on {{the surfaces of}} vehicles. The Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL) at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) {{is equipped with a}} calibration furnace, capable of <b>calibrating</b> heat flux <b>gages</b> up to 1100 kW per square meters, and temperature sensors up to 2600 C. One heating configuration of the calibration furnace is a cylindrical blackbody cavity. Throughout the blackbody there are temperature gradients due to various boundary conditions. These boundary conditions include resistance heating, radiant heat transfer, and conduction to water-cooled electrodes. Also, an inert gas is purged through the graphite blackbody to prevent it from oxidizing. Consequently, the various modes of heat transfer present during operation of the blackbody cavity must be well understood in order to produce accurate heat flux gage and temperature sensor calibrations for use in ground testing or flight testing of hypersonic vehicles. The first step towards understanding the heat transfer in the blackbody cavity was to perform experiments at 1100 C, with and without outer surface insulation, while taking detailed temperature measurements inside the blackbody cavity. Steady state thermal models of the blackbody cavity were then developed. These models included detailed thermal analysis using commercial thermal analysis software. Conduction, radiation, and convection were considered in the thermal models for two cases: one with the outside of the blackbody cavity insulated and the second without insulation. This paper describes the experimental and numerical efforts used to characterize the steady state operation of the blackbody cavity. It describes the analysis of the test measurements, the boundary conditions used in the numerical models, and how the models were calibrated to fit the experimental data. Effects of various uncertainties, such as material properties, and convection are discussed. Initial thermal models predicted temperatures in the deepest part of the blackbody cavity within 7 C of the measured value and produced trends comparable to the experimental data, throughout the models. Adjustment of the boundary conditions, which were included in the thermal models, produced good agreement with measured temperatures. Free and forced convection of the purge gas inside the blackbody was found to be insignificant...|$|R
