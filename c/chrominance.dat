The compromise can improve text appearance when luminance detail {{is more important than}} <b>chrominance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another use of {{weighting}} is in television, {{where the}} red, {{green and blue}} components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers, and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and <b>chrominance</b> signals for transmission.|$|E
25|$|HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than {{traditional}} images—to represent many more colors over {{a much wider}} dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12bits for luminance and 8bits for <b>chrominance</b> without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{algorithm}} for {{detection of}} synthesis errors due do object shading under directed illumination for object [...] based analysis [...] synthesis coding (OBASC) is presented. The idea of OBASC is to transmit luminances and <b>chrominances</b> only in image regions of model failure. In these regions, synthesis errors are visible between a real {{image of an}} image sequence and the decoded image synthesized from formerly transmitted parameters describing object shape, object motion, object colour, and scene illumination. In this contribution, synthesis errors due to object shading are detected by a local analysis of the luminance ratio between real anddecodedimage based {{on the model of}} diffuse reflection. The detected errors are assessed as "non disturbing", thus transmission of luminancesand <b>chrominances</b> is avoided for them. This modified OBASC scheme was applied to the test sequence "Claire" (CIF, 10 Hz, 50 images). Without degradations in subjective image quality, the data rate is reduc [...] ...|$|R

We introduce nonlocal discrete differential operators and a family of weighted p-Laplace operators. Then, p-Laplace regularization on weighted graphs problem is presented and the associated filter family. Image colorization is then considered as a graph regularization problem for a function mapping vertices to <b>chrominances.</b> Several results illustrate our framework and demonstrate the benefits of nonlocal graph regularization for image colorization...|$|R
30|$|Many {{methods are}} focused on using prior {{information}} delivered by a user in a form of manually added color scribbles. Levin et al. [10] formulated an optimization problem based on an assumption that neighboring pixels of similar intensity should have similar color values under the limitation that the colors indicated in the scribbles remain the same. Yatziv and Sapiro [3] proposed a method for determining propagation paths in the image by minimizing geodesic distances from every scribble. Based on the distances from each scribble, pixel color is obtained by blending scribble <b>chrominances.</b> In other works, the color is also propagated from scribbles with probabilistic distance transform [11], using cellular automaton [12] or by random walks with restart [13].|$|R
25|$|Photographic {{digital cameras}} that use a CMOS or CCD image sensor often operate with some {{variation}} of the RGB model. In a Bayer filter arrangement, green is given twice as many detectors as red and blue (ratio 1:2:1) {{in order to achieve}} higher luminance resolution than <b>chrominance</b> resolution. The sensor has a grid of red, green, and blue detectors arranged so that the first row is RGRGRGRG, the next is GBGBGBGB, and that sequence is repeated in subsequent rows. For every channel, missing pixels are obtained by interpolation in the demosaicing process to build up the complete image. Also, other processes used to be applied in order to map the camera RGB measurements into a standard RGB color space as sRGB.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{commonly}} used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 {{which is based}} on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and <b>chrominance</b> adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{transmission}} {{consists of}} horizontal lines, scanned {{from left to}} right. The color components are sent separately one line after another. The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an RGB color model; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of luminance (Y) and <b>chrominance</b> (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1500 and 2300Hz, corresponding to the intensity (brightness) of the color component. The modulation is analog, so even though the horizontal resolution is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The image aspect ratio is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1200Hz horizontal synchronization pulse of 5 milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the synchronization pulse lies {{in the middle of}} the line.|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{effective}} color image denoising method that exploits ltering in highly sparse local 3 D transform domain in each channel of a luminance-chrominance color space. For each image block in each channel, a 3 D array is formed by stacking together blocks similar to it, {{a process that}} we call “grouping”. The high similarity between grouped blocks in each 3 D array enables a highly sparse representation of the true signal in a 3 D transform domain and thus a subsequent shrinkage of the transform spectra results in effective noise attenuation. The peculiarity of the proposed method is {{the application of a}} “grouping constraint ” on the <b>chrominances</b> by reusing exactly the same grouping as for the luminance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed grouping constraint and show that the developed denoising algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the {{application}} of two-dimensional (2 -D) finiteprecision infinite impulse response (IIR) filters to enhanced NTSC coding. It is wellknown that suitable two- or three-dimensional digital filtering greatly improves the quality of NTSC pictures by suppressing the interference between the luminance Y and the <b>chrominances</b> I, Q. Thus far, 2 -D and 3 -D finite impulse response (FIR) filters have been used to reduce or eliminate these cross effects. To achieve good performance, however, they require many coefficients. Since, in general, IIR filters need fewer coefficients to approximate a given magnitude response, we investigate here the possibility of applying 2 -D IIR filters to the NTSC encoding/decoding. We also study the feasibility of using digital filters for NTSC channel filtering; this would permit a digital-only encoder. To design suitable filters, we use a recently proposed method based on multiple constraint optimization and simulated annealing. We [...] ...|$|R
25|$|FM is {{also used}} at {{intermediate}} frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the <b>chrominance</b> component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance ("black and white") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.|$|E

With more backlight, a higher <b>chrominance</b> is available and a color image display is seen. As ambient light levels, such as sunlight, exceed the backlight, a grayscale display is seen; {{this can be}} useful when reading e-books for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight. The backlight brightness can also be adjusted to vary the level of color seen in the display and to conserve battery power.|$|E
2500|$|For all serial digital {{interfaces}} (excluding the obsolete composite encodings), {{the native}} color encoding is [...] YCbCr format. The luminance channel (Y) is encoded at full bandwidth (13.5MHz in 270Mbit/s SD, ~75MHz in HD), {{and the two}} <b>chrominance</b> channels (Cb and Cr) are subsampled horizontally, and encoded at half bandwidth (6.75MHz or 37.5MHz). The Y, Cr, and Cb samples are co-sited (acquired at the same instance in time), and the Y' sample is acquired at the time halfway between two adjacent Y samples.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 Georges Valensi {{demonstrated}} an encoding scheme {{that would allow}} color broadcasts to be encoded {{so they could be}} picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well. In his system the output of the three camera tubes were re-combined to produce a single [...] "luminance" [...] value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate [...] "chrominance" [...] signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B'–Y'), and red-luma (R'–Y'). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and <b>chrominance</b> on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.|$|E
2500|$|First, {{the image}} should be {{converted}} from RGB {{into a different}} color space called [...] (or, informally, YCbCr). It has three components Y', CB and CR: the Y' component represents the brightness of a pixel, and the CB and CR components represent the <b>chrominance</b> (split into blue and red components). This is basically the same color space as used by digital color television as well as digital video including video DVDs, and {{is similar to the}} way color is represented in analog PAL video and MAC (but not by analog NTSC, which uses the YIQ color space). The [...] color space conversion allows greater compression without a significant effect on perceptual image quality (or greater perceptual image quality for the same compression). The compression is more efficient because the brightness information, which is more important to the eventual perceptual quality of the image, is confined to a single channel. This more closely corresponds to the perception of color in the human visual system. The color transformation also improves compression by statistical decorrelation.|$|E

The chroma/chrominance of video engineering is formed from weighted tristimulus components, not linear components. In video engineering practice, the terms chroma, <b>chrominance,</b> and saturation are often used interchangeably to refer to <b>chrominance.</b>|$|E
50|$|At certain times, the <b>chrominance</b> signal {{represents}} only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the <b>chrominance</b> signal {{represents only}} the V signal.

50|$|In {{composite}} video signals, the U and V signals modulate a color subcarrier signal, and {{the result}} {{is referred to as the}} <b>chrominance</b> signal; the phase and amplitude of this modulated <b>chrominance</b> signal correspond approximately to the hue and saturation of the color. In digital-video and still-image color spaces such as Y′CbCr, the luma and <b>chrominance</b> components are digital sample values.|$|E
50|$|In analog television, <b>chrominance</b> is encoded into a {{video signal}} using a {{subcarrier}} frequency. Depending {{on the video}} standard, the <b>chrominance</b> subcarrier may be either quadrature-amplitude-modulated (NTSC and PAL) or frequency-modulated (SECAM).|$|E
50|$|Analogue color video signals {{comprise}} two components: <b>chrominance</b> and luminance. The {{luminance component}} describes {{the brightness of}} {{each part of the}} picture, while the <b>chrominance</b> component describes the color tone. When displayed on a black-and-white monitor, the luminance signal produces a normal black-and-white image, while the <b>chrominance</b> signal manifests as a fine pattern of dots of varying size and intensity overlaid over the black-and-white picture. A related phenomenon is dot crawl, which can produce visual artifacts in color pictures.|$|E

50|$|Separating RGB color signals into luma and <b>chrominance</b> {{allows the}} {{bandwidth}} of each {{to be determined}} separately.

50|$|In NTSC, the <b>chrominance</b> {{sine wave}} {{has the same}} average {{frequency}} as the subcarrier frequency.
