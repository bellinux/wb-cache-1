40|$|Activists {{around the}} world have {{developed}} practices and are taking distinct measures to resist <b>cyber-surveillance.</b> These range from using code words and taking out mobile phone batteries during meetings to the use of privacy enhancing technologies. This article discusses such measures by providing interviews with activists from a variety of countries, as well as by analyzing documents from German law enforcement agencies in a recent case against activists. These documents reveal that the meta-data produced via mobile telephony is at least as important for law enforcement as the content of the calls. Furthermore, if there is not enough meta-data, law enforcement will produce it {{to get to know the}} whereabouts of activists. This article thus argues that a mutual relationship between resistance and surveillance unfolds as one side reacts to the practices of the other: as soon as activists advance in the protection of their contents of telecommunication, the surveilling parties concentrate on meta-data to explore the whereabouts of their targets. To counter this threat only the discontinuation of mobile phone use has been articulated...|$|E

Central to this is determining how much secrecy they should enjoy and what mechanisms should be employed to detect and prevent future abuse. This is not a call for complete transparency, however, as secret intelligence does play an important and ethical role in society. Rather, that existing systems built on a prioritisation of democratic assumptions are fundamentally ill-equipped {{for dealing with the}} particular challenge of intelligence secrecy. That, as the necessary circle of secrecy is extended around the political actors they are insulated from the very public gaze that ensures they are working in-line with the political community’s best interests. Therefore, a new framework needs to be developed, one this paper will argue should be based on the just war tradition, where the principles of just cause, legitimate authority, last resort, proportionality and discrimination are able to balance the need to protect people while placing limits in terms of who can be harmed and to what degree...|$|E
