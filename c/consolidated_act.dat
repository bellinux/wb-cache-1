40|$|The {{corporate}} governance of investment funds was hardly studied in Italy before {{the reform of}} 1998, when the Financial Markets <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> (TUF) entered into force, amending the rules on management companies (SGRs) and introducing new {{corporate governance}} rules for listed companies. Following this reform, {{it is now clear}} that the management of SGRs is an extremely delicate and sensitive matter, especially when the legislator assigns a central role in the governance of listed companies to these intermediaries. From 1998 onwards, commentators have gradually started to pay more attention to this topic, and the quantity and quality of the measures taken by the supervisory authorities and the Professional Association of Fund Managers (Assogestioni) have also increased. Consequently, there has been a very lively and rich debate in recent years. The present article intends to address this debate and attempts to examine the issue from a double point of view: that of the unit holders (conflict of interests risk) and that of the companies in which the stakes are held (funds as minority shareholders). These aspects may become intertwined in cases in which, for example, a manager buys shares in a company for purposes of control or, at any rate, for purposes other than maximizing the profits of the unit holders' investment...|$|E
40|$|Through {{legislative}} decree 81 / 2008, the legislature reformed {{the role of}} qualified physicians as regards their activity, which views them as leaders in {{the protection of the}} health of workers exposed to occupational risks. This paper analyses the aspects of the new legislation introduced by corrective decree 106 / 2009, in an attempt to legally outline the role of qualified physicians and their liability, since their actions may compromise the health of workers exposed to special risks. The legislature considerably changed this professional role, by adding the new role of consultant to their traditional functions of health supervision, with a view to a necessary collaboration of the employer on matters of evaluating the risk at the company, to which workers may be exposed. It is in this new role of consultant that the regulatory provision of a penalty, ex art. 58 of the <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Act,</b> seems to fit in; it sanctions qualified physicians for violation of the obligation to collaborate, which extends to the constructive and informative function physicians are to carry out with reference to their professional sphere. Through this new regulation, the legislature has seemingly unified the two roles, i. e. advisory and operative, for purposes of liability, of which qualified physicians are the recipients and that results in criminal liability for their work as physicians and consultants for company employers...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} situation, the {{structural}} {{effects of the}} Italian Domestic Stability "Pact" must be carefully considered. Such effects are "pro-cyclical": they worsen deflation that, after 2008 depression, is nowadays markedly ongoing. The statistical analysis already carried out shows a clear differentiation of effects on territories. In the Centre-North of Italy, a trend to the reduction of municipalities' expenditure and to the alleviation of tax burden prevail structurally. In the South of Italy, on the contrary, it appears to prevail an opposite trend. This causes a considerable reduction of the gap between available resources (such a gap, in 1999, was equal to 30 % and, in the long run, it has been gradually reducing up to 10 %); this reduction, {{both in terms of}} accrual basis accounting and of cash basis accounting, is the effect of a worsening of life conditions of employees, due to considerably higher taxes; such an increase of tax burden has caused a trend increase of revenue, which since 1999 has been equal to 25. 4 %, in terms of accrual basis accounting, in the South of Italy, compared to 16. 9 % in the Centre-North of Italy. Secondly, the serious risks that such a current situation entails for the financial sustainability of the Municipalities are shown. Both in the Centre-North and in the South of Italy, in terms of accrual basis accounting, a trend to deficit creation appears - actually, in absolute value, very low. But the worrying phenomenon is the failure to cover loan amortization charges, which should be covered by the system of the <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> for Local Governments (TUEL; see, in particular, article 162, paragraph 6), in the current account of budgets...|$|E
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMPrivate equity is a {{critical}} vehicle of entrepreneurship development that is essential in reducing unemployment and boosting the economic growth of South Africa. There has, however, been a decline in private equity investment (PEI) activity in South Africa compared to the 2006 - 2007 peak and seed capital by venture capitalists has been affected the most. This {{has been attributed to}} a number of factors mainly related to financial and tax regulation. This study critically reviews the financial regulation of the PEIs in South Africa with a view to elucidating potential pitfalls that may be affecting the competitiveness of the industry. A comparison with the regulation of PEIs in the United Kingdom (which is generally regarded as functioning well) is also made in order to provide a basis for recommendations to improve private equity activity in South Africa. The main legal structures for PEIs in South Africa are the en commandite partnerships and the bewind trusts, of which en commandite partnerships are the most common legal structure. The private equity industry is mainly regulated by common law. However, there are various, separate sections of legislation that regulate private equity transactions as well as public companies. These fragmented pieces of legislation and regulations include the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act and the Black Economic Empowerment policy framework, the Companies Act, the Pension Funds Act, the Financial Markets Act, the Exchange Control Regulations 1961, the Competition Act, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Listing Requirements and the King Reports on Corporate Governance. Of these, the most influential is the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act which regulates financial service providers or fund managers. A comparison with the PEIs regulatory framework in the UK showed that the UK, apart from having a consolidated legislation regulating the legal structure of PEIs, generally, has a more comprehensive scope of regulation that includes self-regulation, co-regulation, and regional regulations, in addition to the traditional, conservative common law. This integration of regional requirements through EU’s Directive 2011 / 61 /EU and the Walker Guidelines has probably helped the UK to open up new markets in the region. Although there are some positives in the regulation of PEIs in South Africa, notably the regulation of financial markets to prevent market abuse and insider trading, it appears financial regulation may benefit from drawing lessons from the law and regulatory framework of the UK. It is therefore recommended that the South African private equity industry develops a consolidated and facilitative regulatory framework. This can be based on co-regulation {{along the lines of the}} Walker Guidelines (which encourages more disclosure and transparency) as well as a <b>consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> to control all PEIs activities...|$|E

40|$|The {{project is}} a follow up to earlier UNDP/FAO assistance, namely UGA/ 80 / 016 "Assistance to Anti-poaching Activities" and UGA/ 83 / 003 "Rehabilitating and Strengthening of National Parks" and its overall {{objective}} was to strengthen national capabilities {{in the management of}} national parks and wildlife protected areas. A major problem confronting the Government of Uganda {{at the onset of the}} project was the lack of strong policy/legislation and strategy framework for the wildlife and national parks sectors. The need to review and revise the existing outdated legislation was therefore considered a priority area of activity by the project. A policy document and draft legislation on wildlife and national parks were submitted to Government for consideration. Information on wildlife resources in Uganda was soon recognized as an important pre-requisite in the process of drawing up policy, detailed legislation and strategies pertaining to the management of the resource. Wildlife surveys were successfully carried out in several game reserves and ranches allowing determination of the current viability of wildlife populations in the areas covered. The shortage of trained manpower was also perceived as a major constraint in the subsequent implementation of strategies and the enforcement of legislation. Training through refresher courses, fellowships and study tours was conducted and covered different levels in both the Wildlife Department and National Parks. Improved management skills have had a visible impact on the field staff responsible for ensuring the security of wildlife and wildlife sites and for the control of poaching. The effectiveness of the anti-poaching strike forces was enhanced through the provision of transportation, communication and other logistical equipment and materials. However, encroachment into wildlife areas by human settlements and cultivation remained a serious problem which underscored the need for greater involvement of local populations in wildlife and park management. The activities of the project have sought to halt the decline of Uganda's valuable wildlife resources and to restore a firm basis for continued successful management. In several respects, mainly in the policy and legislation and the wildlife protection activities, the results have been very positive, but will need to be sustained in order to preserve the gains. It is therefore recommended that every effort be made to complete the wildlife surveys of the remaining areas and to evict the encroachers from the wildlife protected areas. Successful implementation of the developed strategies is going to depend on a strong support from the law as well as on the extent to which rural communities are involved in the management of the resource. It is therefore, recommended that Government enacts the proposed <b>consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> on wildlife and a national parks management and implements the strategies for the involvement of rural communities living inside and adjacent to these resources. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, in Italy, in {{the public}} sector, an ambitious path for change of the methods and tools of {{accounting}} of local governments was started in order {{to respond to a}} crisis situation of the classical forms of democracy. This path was developed substantially in two directions: on the one hand, laws (see Laws No. 131 / 2003 and Nos. 42 and 196 of 2009) and acts ranked as laws (see Legislative Decrees Nos. 170 / 2006, 118 / 2011 and 126 / 2014) have changed internally the criteria and the traditional accounting logics, to make the public accounting systems more uniform and comparable with each other, on the other hand, voluntarily and through an evolution which be occurred by “topics integration”, additional accounting forms (such as the social budget and the participatory budget) have been introduced to inform the community and groups of stakeholders in the social effects of the collective choices and to extend as much as possible the participation of private entities to public decision-making processes. The paper analyses the financial situation of some Italian municipalities which have recently proposed multi-year financial recovery procedures, as provided by article 243 -bis of the <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> of the rules on the Italian local governments (Legislative Decree No. 267 / 2000), in order to show, {{in the light of the}} results of their annual financial statements, as these new tools of accounting, borrowed from the business world and the third sector, can now offer to public bodies, and especially to municipalities, an important opportunity to restore a correct relationship with stakeholders (businesses, households and, in general, all recipients of municipal services) and to strengthen the economic and social resilience of municipalities. Moreover, the paper shows how the Public Sector (especially Regional and City Authorities) can support the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the framework of Europe 2020 Strategy. In particular, we want compare the global perspective in the World Bank studies with the EU frameworks for CSR and the Europe 2020 Strategy. Already in 2008 the European Economic and Social Committee declared the need of «development of “socially responsible regions”, flanking the objectives of grassroots democracy with plans to make administrations and all public and private operators shoulder their responsibilities, working towards an integrated strategy of making the best use of local resources to increase competitiveness» (Industrial change, territorial development and responsibility of companies, 2009 /C 175 / 11). Finally, we analyse the implementation of duties of transparency and Social Audit (SA) in: 1) local authorities offices and agencies; 2) the company structures for public service delivery (“in house” companies) which operates in holdings and networks with local authorithies; 3) the Public Procurement; 4) regional and local state-aids recipient companies...|$|E
40|$|The violent quakes {{that hit}} Italy – {{particularly}} the Emilia Romagna region – in May and June 2012 {{shed light on}} an innovative aspect in the management and preparation of natural disasters. What was striking about this tragedy was {{that most of the}} fatalities were workers who survived the earthquake, but soon afterwards were being recalled to duty to resume their working activity and commence post-disaster reconstruction. More than likely, a more effective dialogue between employers and trade unions would have avoided these fatalities. This proposition draws on past experience, more notably the earthquake which took place in the Umbria region between 1997 and 1998, and highlights the major role played by the industrial relations system in preparing for and dealing with natural and environmental disasters. On that occasion, the Single Insurance Contribution Payment Certificate (“Documento unico di regolarità contributiva” – DURC) was issued to ensure that only employers who comply with anti-seismic regulations were involved in rebuilding. DURC was intended as a tool to single out compliant employers to be engaged in the reconstruction work and safeguard, albeit indirectly, workers and individuals operating in the areas hit by the disaster. Originally an industrial relations practice, DURC was implemented through national legislation and emerged as a major tool against irregular work, especially in those sectors where contracting and subcontracting were widespread phenomena. Drawing on DURC, Italian legislation made provision to include within the <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Act</b> on Occupational Health and Safety of 2008 (“Testo Unico della salute e sicurezza sul lavoro”) a state-of-the-art procedure to single out the market operators and, albeit indirectly, safeguard workers and people. In effect, this selection procedure is based on a system of qualification according to which only qualified employers with technical and professional expertise specified in the collective agreement are allowed to operate in certain industries. To this end, suitable employers need to meet some criteria concerning contractual requirements – especially in contracting out tasks and activities – related for instance to aspects of health and safety at work. The qualification system addressed the most dangerous sectors and activities and at the moment applies to confined spaces, although it can be considered in the event of other types of natural disasters (mine collapses, marine oil spills, industrial pollution and land contamination). On the basis of these considerations, this paper investigates social dialogue and the industrial relations system, considering their role in the event of natural disasters (earthquakes and floods), also making reference to similar – albeit different – phenomena falling within the rubric of “environmental disasters”. After providing a cursory overview of the problem at a European and international level, the focus will move on to the Italian case. In this sense, an attempt will be made to shed light on attitudes and codes of conduct implemented in emergency situations which have now become common practice in industrial relations, thus providing an innovative contribution to social dialogue at company and sectorial level...|$|E
