40|$|The {{support for}} a {{substrate}} to be coated in a gas-tight closable chamber incorporates at least one first support unit contacting parts of the substrate during coating. The support {{is characterized by the}} presence of a further support unit which is movable relative to the first support unit and contacts the substrate {{in such a way that}} the latter can be lifted from the first support unit. The contact regions between the substrate and the first support unit differ from those between the substrate and the second support unit. Also claimed is a method for using such a support for complete coating of a substrate in which the substrate lying on the first support unit is coated. During the coating process the substrate is contacted by the second support unit at points already coated, and is lifted from the first support unit.

40|$|There {{are many}} and good reasons why powder coating {{is a popular}} coating process {{for a lot of}} {{industrial}} products: the wide range of design possibilities; robust surface finish; and the total avoidance of polluting solvents, to name but three. In conventional powder <b>coating</b> <b>installations</b> spray guns are used for powder application on the workpieces. This requires voluminous spray booths and powder recovery systems. Thus conventional powder coating technique causes high consumption of compressed air and of energy for the exhaust air as well as high costs for maintenance. In view of this, the Fraunhofer IPA has designed the "TransApp"-powder coating technique, which operates without spray guns and therefore is very compact, highly energy-efficient, and has low operating costs. The new technique makes use of the well-known electrostatic fluidized bed principle. Its previous process limitations such as poor application uniformity and poor decorative surface quality have been overcome by using computer simulation as well as by adopting innovative technologies to regulate the electric field. In this connection, using pulsed corona charging has been a very successful approach. The periodical interruption of the electric field and of the generation of ions {{turned out to be an}} effective method to minimize the unwanted parasitic electrostatic effects like insufficient coating of edge zones and Faraday cages...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of different crystalline coating materials concerning of chloride ions penetration. The concrete ages at the <b>coating</b> <b>installation</b> and its moisture conditions were addressed; where, these two factors may play a dominant role for the effectiveness of the used materials. Rapid chloride ions penetration test (RCPT) was conducted at different ages and moisture conditions according to the relevant standard. In addition, the contaminated area and the penetration depth of the chloride ions were investigated immediately after the RCPT test using chemical identifier, 0. 1 M silver nitrate AgNO 3 solution. Results have shown that, the very low chloride ions penetrability, for the studied crystallization materials, were investigated only with the old age concrete (G 1). The significant reduction in chloride ions’ penetrability was illustrated after 7 days of installing the crystalline coating layers. Using imageJ is more reliable to describe the contaminated area of chloride ions, where the distribution of aggregate and heterogeneous of cement mortar was considered in the images analysis...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The study included assessment {{of the impact of}} diameter reduction degree, drawing die angle, temperature, introductory pipe diameter, and introductory pipe wall thickness on the viscoelastic return.

40|$|The US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) {{supports}} {{efforts to}} reduce energy use and associated expenses in the federal sector. One such effort, the New Technology Demonstration Program (NTDP), seeks to evaluate new energy-saving US technologies and secure their more timely adoption by the US government. Through a partnership with a federal site, the utility serving the site, a manufacturer of an energy-related technology, and other organizations associated with these interests, DOE can evaluate a new technology. The results of the program give federal agency decision makers more hands-on information with which to validate a decision to utilize a new technology in their facilities. The partnership of these interests is secured through a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA), in this case between Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation, {{the manager of the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and ThermShield International, Ltd., the manufacturer of the technology. This is the first volume of a two-volume report that describes the effects of radiation control coatings installed on federal buildings at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida by ThermShield International.

40|$|Abstract: Failures in oil or gas {{pipelines}} can have severe {{environmental and economic}} consequences. Large investments {{have been made in}} studies on corrosion prevention for buried and submerged metallic structures and pipes. Important research is being conducted to determine and predict corrosion mechanisms and to develop effective protection techniques. Protective coatings offer a first barrier against corrosion. However, damage of the <b>coating</b> during <b>installation</b> and <b>coating</b> degradation result in severe corrosion and necessitate the installation of properly designed cathodic protection (CP) systems. When designing a cathodic protection system, the aim is to obtain a pipe-to-soil potential along {{the entire length of the}} pipeline network that is more negative than a well defined minimum protection level. Based upon many-years of fundamental and applied research, Elsyca has now established a set of knowledge-based products and services that improve operational quality and performance, increase productivity and efficiency, assure confidence and reliability in the CP design and services. These ultimately safeguard the environment, all while, reducing costs and constitute a breakthrough innovation that will revolutionize existing processes in the corrosion protection engineering industry. In this paper it will be demonstrated how this technology can be used to study the cathodic protection of an existing pipeline or to optimize the design of the cathodic protection of pipeline networks...|$|R
