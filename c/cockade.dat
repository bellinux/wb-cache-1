5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was no consensus {{as to what the}} colors of the national <b>cockade</b> should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{previously}} employed several deceptions against the region (for example Operation Hardboiled in 1942 and Operation <b>Cockade</b> in 1943). As a result, John Bevan, {{head of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and charged with overall organisation of Bodyguard, was concerned that visual/wireless deception {{would not be enough}} to create a believable threat.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Cockade</b> Act of 1831 did {{not specify}} the shade of red, {{for which it was}} criticized by Joachim Lelewel, nor did the Coat of Arms and National Colors Act of 1919. In 1921, the Ministry of Military Affairs issued a {{pamphlet}} with illustrations of the Polish flag and other national symbols which used the crimson shade of red.|$|E
50|$|Hungarian {{revolution}}aries wore <b>cockades</b> {{during the}} Hungarian revolution of 1848 {{and during the}} 1956 revolution. Because of this, Hungarians traditionally wear <b>cockades</b> on 15 March.|$|R
50|$|From the 15th century various European monarchy realms used <b>cockades</b> {{to denote}} the nationalities of their military. Their origin reverts to the {{distinctive}} colored band or ribbon worn by late medieval armies or jousting knights on their arms or headgear to distinguish friend from foe {{in the field}} of battle. Ribbon-style <b>cockades</b> were worn later on helmets and brimmed hats or tricornes and bicornes just as the French did, and also on cocked hats and shakoes; metal <b>cockades</b> were worn at the right side of helmets; small button-type <b>cockades</b> were worn at the front of kepis and peaked caps.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{coloured}} <b>cockades</b> {{were used}} in Europe to show the allegiance of their wearers to some political faction, their rank, {{or as part of}} a servant's livery. Military uniforms would use <b>cockades</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|The {{colors of}} the flag are {{included}} in other Tunisian symbols, such as the coat of arms, which contains a crescent and star enclosed in a disk with red border. In addition, equipment belonging to the Tunisian army are visually recognized {{by the presence of}} a <b>cockade.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the uprising, the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national <b>cockade</b> of Poland. The white-and-red <b>cockade</b> was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Ops (B) was a {{deception}} planning department {{within the}} Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) during the Second World War. Established in the United Kingdom in April 1943, the section {{was in charge}} of operational deception planning for the Western Front. Their major contribution was to Operations <b>Cockade</b> and Bodyguard, the latter being the cover plan for their Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944.|$|E

5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation <b>Cockade,</b> a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white <b>cockade</b> of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{patriotic}} and staunchly Catholic {{members of}} the Bar Confederation of 1768–1772 adopted crimson – the symbol of Polish szlachta, or nobility – and blue – symbolizing Virgin Mary – as their colors. These, as well as white-and-red, were considered national colors during the Great Sejm of 1788–1792. White and red were first publicly used as national colors by civilians on May 3, 1792 in Warsaw, during {{a celebration of the}} first anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of 1791. Meanwhile, the political left wore the blue-white-red cockades of the French Revolution. Polish Legions created in 1797 in French-controlled republics in Italy, used either national cockades of the particular Italian republics in which they served or the French tricolor <b>cockade.</b> In the latter case, the red and blue colors were replaced with crimson and navy blue respectively, hues considered to be traditionally Polish. The General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, which sought to revive the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, adopted red-and-blue cockades, symbolizing the unity of Poland (red) and Lithuania (blue). The military of the French-controlled Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815) and the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom of Poland (1815–1831) used the white <b>cockade,</b> which was also worn by the cadets who started the November Uprising against Russian rule on November 29, 1830.|$|E

25|$|Cockades {{were widely}} worn by revolutionaries {{beginning}} in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red <b>cockade</b> of Paris onto the white <b>cockade</b> of the Ancien Régime – thus producing the original Tricolore <b>cockade.</b> Later, distinctive colours and styles of <b>cockade</b> would indicate the wearer's faction—although {{the meanings of}} the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.|$|E
25|$|Operation <b>Cockade</b> was {{a series}} of {{deception}} operations designed to alleviate German pressure on Allied operations in Sicily and on the Soviets on the Eastern Front by feinting various attacks into Western Europe during World War II. The Allies hoped to use <b>Cockade</b> to force the Luftwaffe into a massive air battle with the Royal Air Force and U.S. Eighth Air Force that would give the Allies air superiority over Western Europe. <b>Cockade</b> involved three deception operations: Operation Starkey, Operation Wadham, and Operation Tindall. Operation Starkey was set to occur in early September, followed by Operation Tindall in mid September, and lastly Operation Wadham in late September 1943.|$|E

50|$|The Second German Empire (1870-1918) {{used two}} <b>cockades</b> on each army headgear: one (black-white-red) for the empire; {{the other for}} one of the monarchies the empire was {{composed}} of, which had used their own colors long before. The only exceptions were the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Württemberg, having preserved the right to keep their own armed forces which were not integrated in the Imperial Army. Their only <b>cockades</b> were either white and blue (Bavaria) or black and yellow (Württemberg).|$|R

25|$|The first {{standard}} uniforms {{used by the}} National Guard was khaki colored, worn with long pants, with metal buttons running down the front and emblems of the neck. The shoes, leggings and equipment belts were all brown. A felt hat was worn until 1918, when it was changed to straw, which was worn until 1924. These hats were worn with the left wing brim bent upward which carryed a fabric <b>Cockade</b> in {{the colors of the}} Flag of El Salvador, the <b>Cockade</b> was changed to metal. The issued weapon was the 7mm Spanish Mauser rifle which was used until 1924. This dress was an early idea of Colonel Garrido.|$|E

25|$|Allied {{military}} deception at {{that time}} revolved around constructing a story to sell to the enemy. For 1943 Ops (B) and the LCS, under direction from Morgan, created three plans (Tindall, Starkey and Wadham) which received the overall codename <b>Cockade.</b> The plans were submitted for approval by the Chiefs of Staff on June 3 and approved twenty days later.|$|E
25|$|Operation <b>Cockade</b> {{failed to}} achieve its objectives, mostly because German {{leadership}} {{did not believe the}} Allies were going to invade western Europe in 1943 and <b>Cockade</b> did not trigger the air battle the Allies desired. The main exception to German High Command was Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Western Command, who believed the Allies were going to invade at Boulogne and was angry at the German High Command for removing ten divisions from France. The invasion stories, particularly Starkey and Wadham, were implausible and so were not believed. There were no significant German reactions to these deception operations. The most notable of these non-reactions is the lack of air reconnaissance and naval or Luftwaffe response to the Starkey amphibious feint. That Germans moved ten divisions out of northern France to other theaters indicated that Starkey and Wadham were complete failures.|$|E
25|$|Lafayette's tricolour <b>cockade</b> {{was adopted}} in July 1789, {{a moment of}} {{national}} unity that soon faded. Royalists began wearing white cockades and flying white flags, while the Jacobins, and later the Socialists, flew the red flag. The tricolour, which combines royalist white with republican red, {{came to be seen}} as a symbol of moderation and of a nationalism that transcended factionalism.|$|E
5000|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army {{initially}} wore ribbons, <b>cockades</b> and epaulettes {{of various}} colors as {{an ad hoc}} form of rank insignia, as General George Washington wrote in 1775: [...] "As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from {{not being able to}} distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored <b>cockades</b> in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the subalterns green." ...|$|R
