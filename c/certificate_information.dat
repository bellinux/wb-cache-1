40|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are associated with increased mortality. The authors obtained death <b>certificate</b> <b>information</b> in a cohort of 260 patients who presented with PNES between 1999 and 2004. The follow-up period averaged 7. 92  years, during which 17 patients died, 12 / 17 were {{under the age of}} 75  years, giving a premature (&# 60; 75  years) mortality rate of 0. 58 %, compared with a Scottish mortality rate for the 40 – 75 years age group of 0. 41 % per year. The main predictor of death was the patient age at presentation of PNES.

40|$|BackgroundIn {{order to}} ensure {{accurate}} survival estimates, population-based cancer registries must ascertain all, or nearly all, patients diagnosed with cancer in their catchment area, and obtain complete follow-up information on all deaths that occurred among registered cancer patients. In the US, linkage with state death records may {{not be sufficient to}} ascertain all deaths. Since 1979, all state vital statistics offices have reported their death <b>certificate</b> <b>information</b> to the National Death Index (NDI). ObjectiveThis study was designed to measure the impact of linkage with the NDI on population-based relative and cancer cause-specific survival rates in the US. MethodsCentral cancer registry records for patients diagnosed 199322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1995 from California, Colorado, and Idaho were linked with death <b>certificate</b> <b>information</b> (deaths 199322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2004) from their individual state vital statistics offices and with the NDI.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a total of 890 Cause of Death Certificates were {{examined}} Retrospectively from Eight different Centers during the period 2008 - 2013,of which 258 were retrieved from Hospital records and 632 from the Autopsy records,were examined for appropriateness of completion {{and the ability to}} construct a logical cause of death cascade. None of the Autopsy reports had a provision for the Standard Cause of Death recordings. Though Medico Legal Autopsy Contributed to only 15 % of the minimal standards and rest 75 % deviated from the accepted Standards and concluded with Mechanism or Mode of Death. Similarly in Hospital death cases 30. 4 % satisfied minimal Standards and 69. 8 % of it were inappropriate in its completion and deviated from the Standards.
