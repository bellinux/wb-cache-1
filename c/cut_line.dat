2500|$|Fujikawa {{made his}} second PGA Tour start (2006 U.S. Open was the first) at the 2007 Sony Open in Hawaii, having gained entry by {{shooting}} 67 in the Open Qualifier (...) [...] In {{the second round}} of the Sony Open itself, Fujikawa became the youngest player in nearly 50 years to make a PGA Tour cut. A birdie on the 16th hole put him within the <b>cut</b> <b>line,</b> but it was his 15-foot eagle on the 18th hole that was his most memorable shot of the day. With that shot, Fujikawa secured a 4-under-par 66 and made the cut by three shots.|$|E

40|$|The method {{comprises}} producing multiple first cuts {{simultaneously in}} a workpiece along first cutting lines using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second cutting lines using multiple second separating tools. The {{first and second}} <b>cut</b> <b>lines</b> define a plane on which the cutting lines intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the first cuts is performed simultaneously with {{the production of the}} second cuts. The method comprises producing multiple first cuts simultaneously in a workpiece along first cutting lines using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second cutting lines using multiple second separating tools. The first and second <b>cut</b> <b>lines</b> define a plane on which the cutting lines intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the first cuts is performed simultaneously with the production of the second cuts. The steps of the producing the cuts along the first and second cutting lines are matched to one another such that each cut is separated by the first and second <b>cut</b> <b>lines.</b> The first and second cutting tools are arranged along a first axis and a second axis respectively, where the two axes are aligned parallel to each other during the production of the cuts and are formed by support elements. The support elements are moved relative to the production of the cuts to one another along the first and second axes to guide the separating tools along the <b>cut</b> <b>lines.</b> The first and/or second separating tools are energetic beams, which are directed on the workpiece via the support elements or a beam deflector. The support elements are partially guided to optical scanning devices along the <b>cut</b> <b>lines.</b> The first and second cutting tools are introduced in a cutting direction. An independent claim is included for a device for separating a workpiece into multiple segments...|$|R
2500|$|In {{technical}} penetration diving, {{there are}} broadly two approaches. [...] The conventional approach {{involves the use}} of continuous guidelines laid from a wreck reel, tied just outside the entrance point, just inside the entrance point, and at regular intervals inside (to mitigate the risk of a <b>cut</b> <b>line,</b> or a [...] "line trap"). [...] In deeper penetrations, two reels are used, so that {{in the event of a}} total loss of visibility where the diver loses contact with the primary line or the primary line gets cut, the secondary line can be anchored and then used as a reference point to sweep for the primary line.|$|E

5000|$|Felling - After {{clearing}} the tree's base undergrowth for the retreat path and the felling direction; felling is properly done with three main cuts. To control the fall, the directional <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> should run 1/4 {{of the tree}} diameter to make a 45-degree wedge, which should be 90 degrees to the felling direction and perfectly horizontal. Make the top cut first then, the bottom cut is made to form the directional <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> at the wedge point. A narrow or nonexistent hinge lessens felling direction control. From {{the opposite side of}} the wedge, plan to finish the final felling cut 1/10 of the tree diameter from the direction <b>cut</b> <b>line.</b> The felling cut is made horizontally and slightly (1.5-2 inches; [...] ) above the bottom cut. When the hinge is properly set, the felling cut will begin the fall in the desired direction. A sitback is when a tree moves back opposite the intended direction. Placing a wedge in the felling cut can prevent a sitback from pinching the saw.|$|E

50|$|To {{obtain the}} maximum number of pieces, the nth <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> should cross all the other {{previous}} cut lines inside the circle, but not cross any intersection of previous cut lines. Thus, the nth line itself is cut in n &minus; 1 places, and into n line segments. Each segment divides one piece of the (n &minus; 1)-cut pancake into 2 parts, adding exactly n to the number of pieces. The new line can't have any more segments since it can only cross each previous line once. A <b>cut</b> <b>line</b> can always cross over all previous cut lines, as rotating the knife at a small angle around a point that is not an existing intersection will, if the angle is small enough, intersect all the previous lines including the last one added.|$|E

5000|$|Multipatterning for {{advanced}} nodes is already underway. There are two styles being used. Pitch splitting such as LELELE triple patterning is preferred for bidirectional layouts, but {{is harder to}} scale. Spacer-based patterning makes use of 1D-type layouts, but requires additional masks for cutting. <b>Cutting</b> <b>lines</b> to form irregular patterns uses {{the maximum number of}} masks. However, minimum pitch <b>lines</b> with dense <b>cut</b> locations contribute to higher capacitance by adding more locations and more area of minimum spacing. 2D patterning is generally preferred, but requires sufficient exposed feature pitch, followed by sufficient splitting or division of the pitch. On the other hand, LELE, LELELE, and SADP (SID) can avoid <b>line</b> <b>cuts,</b> while SATP or SAQP with grid routing can minimize <b>line</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} cutting a convex polygon P {{out of a}} piece of planar {{material}} Q with minimum total cutting length is a well studied problem in computational geometry. Researchers studied several variations of the problem, such as P and Q are convex or non-convex polygons and the <b>cuts</b> are <b>line</b> <b>cuts</b> or ray cuts. In this paper we consider yet another variation of the problem where Q is a circle and P is a convex polygon such that P is bounded by a half circle of Q and all the <b>cuts</b> are <b>line</b> <b>cuts.</b> We give two algorithms for solving this problem. Our first algorithm is an O(log n) -approximation algorithm with O(n) running time, where n is the number of edges of P. The second algorithm is a constant factor approximation algorithm with approximation ratio 6. 48 and running time O(n 3).
