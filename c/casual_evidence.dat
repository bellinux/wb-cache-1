40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{researching the}} employment {{of different types of}} agricultural labourer in the ending phase of the middle ages. The purpose is to question the method of using <b>casual</b> wage <b>evidence</b> to interpret changes in the labourer’s income in the current study of late medieval economic history. My criticism of the traditional method is that, since <b>casual</b> wage <b>evidence</b> is composed of the price of finishing a piece of work, it is inappropriate to use that evidence to interpret incomes without the information of how many pieces of work done by the labourer. The said information is, indeed, mostly unavailable. My proposition to solve this problem is to use the salaries paid to the permanent farm worker, who was hired by year. The approach of this research is, firstly, to demonstrate the limitations of the traditional method and, secondly, to demonstrate that the salary paid to the permanent worker is a useful tool for understanding the changes in the labourer’s income. In particular, the discussion is separated into five chapters. At first, I intend to illustrate that <b>casual</b> wage <b>evidence</b> illustrates only one aspect of the fifteenth-century agricultural labour market and that from the same source material more information apart from wage data is available and allows us to examine other aspects of wage labour. With the information, I shall argue that job opportunities in the casual sector were limited by farming seasons; and that, except for a few villagers, casual employment only accounted for a minor part of the yearly income. It shall be illustrated that apart from casual labourers, the manorial demesne employed the other two types of labourers, who were potentially more important than casual labourers in terms of the cost and the labour input. Between the two, labour services were persistently employed, but their important were dwindling, whilst the permanent workers were the main labour force purposely maintained on the demesne. This finding proves that {{the employment of}} casual labour was relatively insignificant. It also illustrates that the permanent posts were a more secure source of income than casual hire. In this context, casual hire was paid higher daily wages, but its availability was limited; the permanent contract was poorly paid, but it guaranteed a secure livelihood across the year. This explains why, when job opportunities were relatively expanded in the casual sector during labour shortage, labourers would turn down permanent contracts for casual hire, in the hope for a better income. Following this context, we would expect to see that during our period, when depopulation was continued, the employer of permanent workers was forced to improve the job offer to match the potential income a labourer could earn in the casual sector. The trend {{in the value of the}} permanent labourer’s salary, therefore, should reflect the changes in the agricultural labourer’s income in general. An index of the permanent labourer’s salary will be presented to illustrate this rising trend. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|<b>Casual</b> {{empirical}} <b>evidence</b> {{suggests that}} infrastructure provision {{is higher in}} economies that are open to world trade. We develop a model of imperfect competition to show that governments are likely to provide more infrastructure when the country is open to trade. Infrastructure provision is higher when the country trades with a less productive country or one bigger in size. The effects are more pronounced {{in the presence of}} producer lobbies, i. e., lobbying leads to greater infrastructure provision than under a social planner. These results suggest that the stock of infrastructure in a country may depend on its openness and the size and productivity of its trading partners. A simple cross-country regression provides support for our hypothesis that more openness leads to higher infrastructure provision. This connection between openness and infrastructure provision has largely been overlooked in the literature, but is important especially for developing countries, which have poor infrastructure but are in the beginning stages of trade and liberalization. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{intriguing}} {{alternative to}} traditional methods for regulating externalities is {{the provision of}} information about firms' environmental attributes. An increasingly important example {{of this approach is}} "eco-labeling," where a third party certifies firms' products. This sort of approach can also be used in similar circumstances, for example providing consumers with information on the techniques used to produce the good in question (e. g., shade-grown coffee) or the nature of rent-sharing arrangements that govern the transaction (e. g., fair trade coffee). I present a model of this phenomenon. An important aspect of this scheme is that the product in question is typically a credence good (buyers cannot infer product quality from search or consumption), and hence must rely on a third-party for information about the product. But the very fact that consumers cannot infer quality from consumption implies they cannot infer accuracy about the signal; indeed, the certifying agency {{may not be able to}} perfectly determine quality at a reasonable cost. As such, the certification process is potentially noisy, albeit with green firms more likely to pass than brown firms. While it is likely to increase the fraction of green units in the market, the introduction of eco-labeling can either increase or decrease welfare. In addition, expected profits earned by green sellers are likely to be more variable in an equilibrium with certification.

40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years, {{one of the most}} popular {{research}} topics in international trade has been the non-equivalence among policy instruments such as specific and ad valorem import tariffs, voluntary export restraints and import quotas. The non-equivalence principle was shown to hold under revenue/rent seeking behavior (Vousden, 1990), under uncertainty (Young and Anderson, 1982), and in the presence of retaliation (Melvin, 1986; Syropoulos, 1994). Furthermore, it has been shown that different policy instruments have different effects on the stability of world prices (Zwart and Blandford, 1989) in addition to having different effects on the quality/composition of imports (Falvey, 1979; Das and Donnefeld, 1987). Perhaps the best known case of non-equivalence is the one described by Bhagwati (1965, 1969) where domestic production is controlled by a monopolist. For a given volume of imports, an import tariff generates a lower domestic price and less deadweight loss than an import quota. <b>Casual</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> from developing and developed countries alike indicates that highly distorted prices, resulting from trade and domestic taxes, provide consumers and firms the necessary incentives to engage in various types of illegal activities usually referred to as smuggling.

Recent theories of rational voting behavior—Buchanan and Tullock 1 or Riker and Ordeshook 2 are examples—treat votes and voting as the outcome of a rational calculation of marginal costs and benefits.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the left}} hemisphere of the brain is specialised and dominant for language comprehension and production and that those with left hemisphere damage often display profound language disruption (Geschwind, 1965). The importance of the left hemisphere is shown by communication problems or extreme difficulty in producing speech following damage to this brain region. In contrast, following right hemisphere damage, disruption to language is less perceptible to the <b>casual</b> observer. The <b>evidence</b> base currently available acknowledges a critical role for the right hemisphere in processing inferred or implied information by maintaining relevant facts and/or suppressing irrelevant ones but the exact role of the right hemisphere and its coordination with the left is open for debate (Johns, Tooley and Traxler, 2008). Two theories have been proposed to explain communication/language difficulties in individuals with right hemisphere damage: (i) the “coarse semantic coding” hypothesis and (ii) the “suppression deficit” hypothesis. The “coarse semantic coding” hypothesis proposes that damage to the right hemisphere causes an over reliance on fine coding assumed to be undertaken by the left hemisphere in the comprehension of language, implying the recall of most literal interpretations. The “suppression deficit” hypothesis proposes that damage in the right hemisphere means multiple activations of meanings of words are not attenuated leading to ineffective suppression of inappropriate interpretations. This project investigated competing evidence {{for each of these}} hypotheses by studying the processing abilities of individuals with depressed unilateral brain function caused by stroke or innovatively produced by transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS), on semantic judgement tasks using metaphorical language. The results demonstrated the strongest of evidence for the coarse semantic coding hypothesis when the data from participants with damage to the right hemisphere, both caused by stroke and simulated by tDCS was considered. Overall, the study has furthered the understanding {{of the role of the}} right hemisphere in language comprehension and demonstrated the contribution of the tDCS methodology in the field.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on the strategic interaction between the central bank (CB) and unions assumes that firms face perfect competition on product markets and that inflation is chosen directly by the monetary authority. Although these simplifications have the virtue of making complex strategic interactions more tractable, they abstract from the fact that, in reality, prices are set by firms and that the monetary authority affects the price level and inflation by determining the money supply. This paper makes {{a step in the}} direction of realism by recognizing that prices are set by monopolistically competitive firms and that the monetary authority affects the price level and inflation indirectly through its choice of money supply. This is done in a three stage game, in the first stage of which unions contractually set nominal wages, in the second stage the CB chooses the money supply, and in the third stage each firm chooses its individually optimal price. A sample of the paper's results follows: 1. In spite of full price flexibility, changes in the degree of conservativeness of the CB affect employment and output even when inflation is fully anticipated by labour unions and even when unions are indifferent to inflation. 2. When the CB is sufficiently conservative it reduces the money supply in response to wage increases. Both <b>casual</b> and econometric <b>evidence</b> suggests that such a mechanism has been operating in Germany where the Bundesbank often tightened monetary policy in response to 'excessive' wage settlements. 3. Recent results concerning the optimality of a populist or 'ultra-liberal' CB are shown to be {{the exception rather than the}} rule. In particular, in many circumstances, an ultra conservative CB reduces both inflation and unemployment sufficiently to make the appointment of such a bank socially optimal. Intuitively, when the CB is more conservative each union correctly anticipates a stronger contractionary reaction to an increase in its wage and, therefore, a stronger increase in unemployment among its members. As a consequence, the deterring effect of unions' fear from unemployment on their wage demands is stronger and employment higher when the CB is more conservative.

40|$|Hoey's {{theory of}} Lexical Priming (LP) {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} theoretical framework to explain the long-established phenomena of collocation (cf. Firth 1957; Sinclair 1991; Stubbs 1996), colligation (cf. Firth 1957; Sinclair 2004, Hunston 2001), and several kinds of semantic relationships (cf. Sinclair 1991, 2004; Hunston 2001; Louw 1993; Partington 2004). The framework generates a number of hypotheses which call for closer examination. One of them concerns the phenomenon of polysemy. According to LP, the collocations, semantic associations and colligations that a polysemous word is characteristically primed for will systematically differentiate its various senses (Hoey 2005 : 81). The claim is further that the different senses avoid use of each other's collocations, colligations and semantic associations. The formulation of the claims of LP regarding polysemy was based on polysemous nouns with two or more abstract senses each (i. e. consequence, reason, immunity) on the one hand, and on the word dry looked at mainly in its use as an adjective, on the other. The present study aims to explore whether the claims of LP with respect to polysemy are equally applicable when other types of polysemous words are investigated. Research consisted in two case studies based on data drawn from a subcorpus of the British National Corpus (BNC) comprising fiction texts. The corpus consists of 432 texts amounting to some 15, 000, 000 words. The first case study concerned the two most frequent senses -both concrete- of the noun drive (viz. "journey" and "private road"). Findings from this case study confirm the claims of LP. The second case study focused on the senses of the polysemous verb face. Face was chosen for having senses that can be classified along the cline concrete - abstract. There were two main reasons behind this choice: the first {{was that it was}} deemed necessary to examine whether the formulation of the claims of LP with respect to polysemy may have somehow been affected by the grammatical category of the polysernous words examined so far; verb meaning relies considerably on a verb's participants and this might generate new insights -and possible challenges- regarding the claims of LP with respect to polysemy. The second reason related to the classifiability of a word's senses along the concrete-abstract cline, and to the question of in how far the claims of LP -as currently formulated- fully account for such cases of polysemy as well. The verb face has a concrete use and an abstract use, illustrated by I do not like coasts that face north and I had to face al/ my problems alone, respectively, and it has uses that appear to merge the two to varying degrees, as seen in the examples below: (1) of little consequence. " He turned her to face him. "If I gave that impression then I ea (2) This was yet another of his children to face him in defiance in this very kitchen. Jon (3) not realise then that Rioja had stayed to face the killers. From the hut behind them the Given the claims of LP regarding polysemy, we would expect (i) that face will have primings that clearly distinguish not only between its concrete and abstract uses, but also (ii) that there will be primings that make a distinction among the sub-senses of the concrete, or "directional" use. While the analysis in part yielded results in support of LP claims, it also showed that collocation, colligation and semantic association are not always sufficient for the disambiguation of meaning. Indeed, the nature of the data, very often involving dialogue, called for an application of Burton's (1980) framework for the analysis of <b>casual</b> conversation. <b>Evidence</b> suggests that, beyond the phenomena of collocation, colligation and semantic association, categories from the analysis of casual conversation -specifically, Challenging Moves- can be instrumental in a systematic differentiation between the senses of polysemous words.

40|$|The great {{majority}} of Austrian banks operate on a regional or local basis {{and only a few}} banks provide their services on a national or even international scale. Obviously, the market environments regional or local banks face are different from that of nationwide operating banks. <b>Casual</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that local markets condition is a very important external determinant of banking efficiency. Thus, not controlling for market conditions may substantially bias the measurement of managerial efficiency particularly of locally operating banks. In this paper we assess the internal technical efficiency (or X-efficiency) of the Austrian banking sector with the focus on environmental and non-controllable factors critical to banking markets. Analytically, we apply a multiple-stage approach based on a slacks-based DEA model (SBM) and a censored regression model, respectively. In order to cope with the inherent dependency problem of DEA-based efficiency analysis when incorporated into regression analysis we apply a Bootstrap estimator. In so doing we attempt to overcome the dependency problem which plagues the power of standard regression analysis based on DEA processed data. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of data covering more than 800 Austrian banks ranging over 1995 to 2002...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{synthesized}} literature concerning <b>casual</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of effects}} of various physical activity programs on motor skills and cognitive development in typically developed preschool children. Methods. Electronic databases were searched through July 2017. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining {{the effectiveness of}} physical activity on motor skills and cognitive development in healthy young children (4 – 6 years) were screened. Results. A total of 15 RCTs were included. Of the 10 studies assessing the effects of physical activity on motor skills, eight (80 %) reported significant improvements in motor performance and one observed mixed findings, but one failed to promote any beneficial outcomes. Of the five studies investigating the influence of physical activity on cognitive development, four (80 %) showed significant and positive changes in language learning, academic achievement, attention, and working memory. Notably, one indicated no significant improvements were observed after the intervention. Conclusions. Findings support causal evidence of effects of physical activity on both motor skills and cognitive development in preschool children. Given the shortage of available studies, future research with large representative samples is warranted to explore the relationships between physical activity and cognitive domains as well as strengthen and confirm the dose-response evidence in early childhood...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 23 June 1997 Examining board: Prof. Giorgio Brunello, University of Udine; Prof. Alan Manning, London School of Economics; Prof. John Micklewright, EUI and UNICEF, Florence, Supervisor; Prof. Robert Waldmann, EUIFirst made {{available}} online on 8 June 2017 Several empirical {{studies of the}} inter-industry wage structure tend to show results which do not seem consistent with the competitive model of the labour market. Pieces of <b>casual</b> <b>evidence</b> like the one just quoted are confirmed {{by a number of}} more detailed investigations. These suggest that some industries might pay higher wages than others, even when differences in (observable) labour quality are taken into proper account. In other words, equal employees may not be paid equal wages across industries. Inter-industry wage differentials also seem a very stable phenomenon over time, across countries and across occupations. According to existing work, today’s high- and low-wage industries tend to be the same as those {{at the beginning of this}} century and, moreover, have remained in these relative positions during the whole intervening period; high- and low-wage industries appear to be the same in several countries, especially developed capitalist economies; and, wage differentials seem to be stable with respect to different occupations within the same industry...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a simultaneous discrete public good provision game with incomplete information. To use the terminology of Admati and Perry (1991), we consider both contribution and subscription games. In the former, contributions are not refunded if {{the project is}} not completed, while in the latter they are. In the presence of complete information about individuals' valuations for the public good, {{the difference between the}} equilibrium outcomes of a subscription game and a contribution game is not significant. However, there is both <b>casual</b> <b>evidence</b> from the fund-raising literature and experimental evidence that subscription games are ``superior '', i. e., a refund increases the chance of providing the good given that it is efficient to do so. Our analysis shows that this is indeed the case in the presence of incomplete information. We compute a symmetric equilibrium for the subscription game and show that it is not necessarily efficient. This inefficiency stems from the difficulties arising in coordinating to overcome the free-rider problem in the presence of incomplete information. Although {{it is well known that}} informational disparities impose limits on the efficiency of outcomes, the novel feature of our analysis is to explicitly model the resulting trade-off [...] - when deciding how much to contribute towards the public good [...] - between increasing the likelihood of provision and creating incentives for free-riding by the other player. Moreover, we show that for the contribution game, ``contributing zero'' is the only equilibrium for a given range of the fixed cost of provision and for a family of distributions. public goods; incomplete information; continuous distribution...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores, {{in a case}} study, the {{interests}} served by the UK Financial Services Act of 1986. The Act {{put in place a}} revolutionary new regulatory framework for controlling the sale of investment products such as pensions and insurance. The stated objectives of the new regime were to protect the ordinary investor, `Aunt Agatha', from mis-selling and bad advice. However, there is <b>casual</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest that the regime has failed in this objective. Moreover, there exists, in public choice theory, an explanation for why regulation might fail in this way. The study investigates whether regulation did fail to achieve its official objectives, and if it did, what were the reasons for this failure? Does public choice provide an explanation for the failure of the FSA? The study explores {{the interests}} served by the FSA. Specifically, it contributes to knowledge on three fronts: (i) related to the application of a sophisticated public choice analytical framework to a case study of British government regulation; (ii) related to the comparing of the practical adequacy of the public interest and public choice theories of regulation; and (iii) related to the case study itself, which develops a greater understanding of the origins, development, effects, and interests served by the FSA. The thesis concludes that the regulators, in large part, failed to enforce the rules and moreover that the cause of this failure, as public choice theory suggests, was the influence of the industry. In short, the thesis finds that the regulators were captured by the industry. </p...|$|E
40|$|Various recent developments, eg the 'new {{economic}} geography' {{as exemplified}} by say, Krugman, P. (1991) or work originating in the business literature (Porter 1998), point to industrial and intellectual capital clusters as key factors associated with economic development. Indeed recent evidence suggests that multiple clustering leads to higher regional economic development. This leads {{to the idea that}} clusters should be encouraged as for example in the Latvian context in Phare (2001), an idea that is explicitly supported by theoretical argument in Norman and Venables (2001). In this paper we explore and describe the geographic concentration of production and human resources in the three Baltic States and attempt to identify its determinants. In particular, we address the issues of industrial and human resource base restructuring in the Baltic States. For the investigation of the regions or districts of the Baltic countries and their industries a variety of statistical methods and measures are used, including cluster analysis and the location quotient method, which may be used to measure the concentration and importance of an economic activity in cluster regions relative to other selected territories. Work is in progress but the aim is to reveal the pattern and dynamics of industrial and intellectual clusters in the Baltic states since independence. <b>Casual</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that economic activity is less concentrated in Lithuania than in either Latvia or Estonia. The paper seeks to establish more formally whether there are indeed significant differences between the three Baltic countries with respect to i) the extent of cluster formation in general, ii) differences in the extent to which clusters have emerged in particular industries, and iii) how these have changed over time. The territorial units of analysis employed in the research are counties in Lithuania and Estonia (10 and 15 respectively) and in Latvia districts (26 of them). The descriptive part of the paper develops the work of Francis (2000) and Rivza and Stokmane (2000). Having calculated the descriptive statistics the paper combines several theoretical approaches to measure and evaluate clusters. In particular we modify Davis and Weinstein (1998) model to apply it to the case of the Baltic States. Davis, D. R. and D. E.
