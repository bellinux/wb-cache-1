5|$|Near the Ellipse, {{and within}} sight of the White House, the hearse halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn <b>caisson</b> for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met with a warm greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the <b>caisson</b> as it made its way to the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the <b>caisson</b> was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups. The <b>caisson</b> paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E
5|$|The docking-pit is a drydock-like port {{isolated}} from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps. When the wheel stops with its arms in the vertical position {{it is possible for}} boats to enter and exit the lower <b>caisson</b> when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the <b>caisson</b> is empty.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge {{would be the}} only Louisville bridge with serious {{accidents}} during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a <b>caisson</b> that was supposed to hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier <b>caisson.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{pull-out}} {{performance of}} conventional suction <b>caissons</b> (with upright walls) {{has been previously}} investigated {{by a number of}} researchers. However, less attention has been formerly paid to tapered suction <b>caissons.</b> This paper reports some results from an experimental investigation into the pull-out performance of tapered suction <b>caissons.</b> The 1 g experiments have been carried out on eight small scale suction <b>caissons.</b> Four specimens have had upright walls while the other four had a positive wall slope of 10 %. The <b>caissons</b> have been installed in a soil tank containing very fine saturated silty sand. The <b>caissons</b> have then been subjected to vertical pull-out loads with different speeds. The effects of variations in soil density and pull-out rate on the pull-out capacities have also been investigated. In general, tapered <b>caissons</b> have been noticed to present enhanced pull-out capacities as compared to those from their equivalent upright <b>caissons.</b> The enhancement rate {{has been found to be}} more significant in suction <b>caissons</b> with higher aspect ratios. With both upright and tapered <b>caissons</b> the pull-out capacity increases by an increase in the pull-out rate. The pull-out rate effects are more significant with upright <b>caissons</b> in comparison to the corresponding tapered <b>caissons.</b> The density effects, however, are more significant with tapered <b>caissons</b> as compared to their equivalent upright <b>caissons...</b>|$|R
50|$|The basic {{elements}} of a barrage are <b>caissons,</b> embankments, sluices, turbines, and ship locks. Sluices, turbines, and ship locks are housed in <b>caissons</b> (very large concrete blocks). Embankments seal a basin where it is not sealed by <b>caissons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or <b>caisson</b> disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a <b>caisson,</b> flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1889 the <b>caisson</b> was floated {{and taken}} into the basin by a tug, and the tide could flow freely through the entrance.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of <b>caisson</b> locks and when this failed an inclined plane trackway and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E
50|$|Cereal quay (with a 100,000 ton silo, {{which was}} the subject of another project) <b>Caissons</b> are used in this quay for {{supporting}} the conveyor of the silo. These 12 <b>caissons</b> were the largest <b>caissons</b> used in Turkey up to the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The lock has two {{identical}} bathtub-like ship <b>caissons</b> {{in which}} vessels ascend and descend. Both <b>caissons</b> are enclosed {{at each end}} by pivoting gates, and there are pivoting gates at {{the upper and lower}} reaches of the canal at the junctions with the <b>caissons.</b> The gates on the <b>caissons</b> fit into slots on the gates on the reaches, so that they open in unison.|$|R
40|$|Suction <b>caissons</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{anchoring}} systems used in offshore foundations. With increasing exploration in offshore energy, it becomes important to do research on suction <b>caissons.</b> The purpose of this study is to investigate the elastic behavior of suction <b>caissons.</b> A 3 D finite element simulation is used for this purpose and performed in ABAQUS. In order to enhance accuracy of simulation elastic deformation of <b>caissons,</b> calibration factors are calculated by comparing displacements from simulations and the theoretical solution. The parametric study is conducted for three parameters, which are thickness, load attachment location, and soil strength profile. The surrounding soils is transformed into springs by extracting nodal forces and displacement of <b>caissons.</b> The spring properties are compared with these from previous research, which obtains spring properties from a 2 D model. Results show that the effect of <b>caissons?</b> elastic behavior on capacity is different with that of <b>caisson?s</b> rigid behavior. Also, the spring properties in this study are different from those in other research...|$|R
5|$|Later, when {{technological}} advances allowed {{the use of}} pressurization of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as <b>caisson</b> disease, compressed air illness, the bends, and decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower <b>caisson</b> would {{make it more difficult to}} turn the wheel.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, {{and at first}} two technical methods for constructing the pontoon bridge were considered: a continuous concrete floating <b>caisson</b> between the abutments, and a steel version incorporating a truss bridge carrying concrete pontoons. However, they were both rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge {{rests on}} 11 huge, hollow, {{concrete}} <b>caissons</b> {{sunk into the}} river bed. The <b>caissons</b> are 17 metres across the top (measured parallel to the stream) and vary in width from 5.5 to 7.6 metres. The <b>caissons</b> were sunk into the river bed {{to a depth of}} about 30 metres. Add to that the approximately 20 metres that the <b>caissons</b> rise above the bed and the end result is some very massive pieces of concrete. Each weighs about 4,000 tons. The <b>caissons</b> were fitted with steel [...] "cutting edges" [...] to help them sink. The steel used in the cutting edges weighed 238 tons.|$|R
5000|$|Dam {{construction}} methods. This {{could be}} achieved by modular floating <b>caissons</b> (concrete building blocks). These <b>caissons</b> would be manufactured on shore and subsequently floated to the dam location.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of May, 2017, of the 553 <b>caissons</b> required, 460 had been prefabricated and 400 had been installed. The <b>caissons</b> weigh between 500 and 1,700 tons each.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the city}} approval, it was {{announced}} that construction of the Chicago Spire was to begin in summer 2007, with <b>caisson</b> work scheduled to begin as early as June 2007. DuSable Park was designated as a staging area for the construction of the tower. The sales center for the Chicago Spire opened on January 14, 2008.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness, or DCS, also known as divers' disease, the bends or <b>caisson</b> disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Triet's 1,200-strong {{regiment}} {{was joined}} by 200 soldiers from the C1 Company of Rear Service Group 83—under the command of Captain Nguyen Van Lam—and {{they set up a}} three-sided ambush and waited for the arrival of a reported U.S. battalion. At around 8:00am on the morning of October 17, the 2nd Battalion departed from their night defensive position with Alpha Company in the lead followed by the Battalion Command Group, and the tail of the formation was covered by Delta Company. Bravo Company stayed behind to protect the battalion's base, along with the mortar sections of Alpha and Delta Companies. In accordance with the 1st Brigade's policy, Allen personally led his unit out as part of the Battalion Command Group, although he preferred to supervise actions from a helicopter. For artillery support, Alpha Company was authorized to call upon the 105mm and 155mm howitzers located at Fire Support Bases <b>Caisson</b> V, <b>Caisson</b> III-S and Lorraine III.|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "The <b>Caissons</b> Go Rolling Along" [...] {{refers to}} these; the version adopted as the U.S. Army's {{official}} song has, among other changes, replaced the word <b>caissons</b> with Army.|$|R
50|$|On Hainan's mainland, on {{the east}} side of the mouth of the Nandu River, a port has been built to store <b>caissons</b> for the bridge. Barges then {{transport}} and place the <b>caissons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides the <b>caissons</b> for the Southern gap, the Brouwershavense Gat, a {{cableway}} was used. From the cableway, large {{blocks of}} concrete were {{dropped in the}} trench, on top of which sand was sprayed. This constructed two large sandbars. The local channel was too deep and the water flowed too fast for the <b>caissons</b> method. After all the <b>caissons</b> were lowered, all the gaps were plugged.|$|R
5|$|Railroad {{connections}} with the southwest and Texas were improved during the 1870s, {{with the formation of}} the Cotton Belt Railroad. In addition to connecting St. Louis with the West, the railroads began to demand {{connections with}} the east across the Mississippi. Between 1867 and 1874, work on the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi continued despite setbacks such as <b>caisson</b> disease. The bridge formally opened on July 4, 1874.|$|E
5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} <b>caisson</b> or a {{mine that}} has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called <b>caisson</b> disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundation}} {{used for}} the pylons is of the [...] "Hang-dug Caisson" [...] type. Each pylon is founded on four <b>Caissons</b> measuring 1.2 metres in diameter, which are socketed down to bedrock. The average depth of the <b>Caissons</b> is about 40 m (135 feet) and each group of four <b>Caissons</b> piles can take a vertical load of 4,000 tonnes against the maximum vertical load of 150 tonnes from the cable car system. The <b>Caissons</b> method is about the safest and strongest foundation in existence, designed specifically for hilly terrain. Each pylon is accessible via rescue tracks on the ground, whilst each gondola is equipped with radio communication equipment from the stations.|$|R
50|$|A large {{system of}} {{interconnected}} docks may sometimes require individual docks to be drained for maintenance. If {{the connections between}} docks are made to a standard size, these may be closed off by <b>caissons.</b> As this need is rare, only a few mobile <b>caissons</b> are needed to support an entire dock system. When not in use, the spare <b>caissons</b> are stored floating, {{out of the way}} in some other part of the dock.|$|R
50|$|The Phoenix <b>caissons</b> were {{designed}} by the British in the Second World War to form Phoenix breakwaters {{as part of the}} artificial Mulberry harbours that were assembled as part of the follow-up to the Normandy landings, but these four reinforced concrete <b>caissons</b> were not used in the war. Instead they were used to close the last gap in the dike at Ouwerkerk in November 1953; these are the <b>caissons</b> that house the museum.|$|R
5|$|HNTB, of Kansas City, Missouri, was the {{designer}} and consulting engineer {{for both the}} new bridge {{as well as the}} original Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. The federal government provided $110 million to begin building {{the main part of the}} bridge consisting long spans supported by cables. The main superstructure construction began in December 2001. Massman Construction Company in a joint venture with Traylor Brothers, Inc. received the contract to construct two large piers in the river; these were built using both floating caissons and open <b>caisson</b> construction. The construction on the last main span section of the bridge was finished in April 2006.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first <b>caisson</b> for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the <b>caisson</b> and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated proscenium arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E
5000|$|The pier {{is notable}} for being {{underpinned}} by three separate submerged buoyant concrete <b>caissons,</b> which are spanned by long steel girders supporting the building above. Designer Emil Praeger {{of the firm}} Madigan-Hyland had created similar structures {{as part of the}} American military effort in World War II, including temporary breakwaters that were used as part of the D-Day invasion. The <b>caissons</b> were constructed in 1951 and 1952 inside a diked and drained pond in Grassy Point near Haverstraw, New York, and after completion were floated down the Hudson to the site. The two largest (in terms of volume) concrete <b>caissons</b> are 360 ft long, 82 ft wide and 33 ft high. The third is 375 ft long, 25 ft high, and of similar width to the other two <b>caissons.</b> The <b>caissons</b> weigh as much as , but float because they weigh less than the [...] of water that they displace. Their buoyancy supports 90% of the pier's weight, with the riverbed supporting the rest. The <b>caissons,</b> often referred to as concrete boxes and dubbed [...] "Cheeseboxes" [...] during construction, are laid out in a T-shape, with the two <b>caissons</b> of equal dimensions laid out from west-to-east, and the third from north-to-south. The <b>caissons</b> were placed on top of the wooden pilings of the original wooden pier, which were filled with sand and gravel. Dubbed [...] "The World's Most Modern Pier" [...] and the [...] "Superpier", it was hailed as an innovative structure, being fireproof, extremely durable and immune to many of the problems that had historically plagued wooden waterfront construction.|$|R
50|$|There {{are great}} {{differences}} between the first small suction <b>caissons</b> that were installed for Shell at the Gorm field in the North Sea in 1981 and the large suction <b>caissons</b> that were installed for the Diana platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 1999. The twelve suction <b>caissons</b> on the Gorm field were intended to secure a simple loading buoy device {{at a depth of}} 40 metres, while the installation of suction anchors for the Diana platform was a world record in itself at that time, concerning water depth and size of anchors. The height of the Diana suction <b>caissons</b> is 30 metres, their diameter 6.5 metres, and they were installed at a depth of about 1500 m on soft clay deposits. Since then, suction <b>caissons</b> have been installed at even larger depths, but the Diana installation was a technology breakthrough for the 20th century.|$|R
30|$|The {{ultimate}} load capacity {{was the most}} evaluated output parameter among both ANN and GP. The uplift capacity of suction <b>caissons</b> was another variable considered in GP; however, it was not evaluated in ANN studies. The comparison of the output variables in ANN and GP showed that uplift capacity of suction <b>caissons</b> and ultimate capacity of suction <b>caissons</b> were only considered in GP. Hence, future ANN studies may consider these variables for characterization of soil–pile interactions.|$|R
