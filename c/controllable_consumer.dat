40|$|Engineer–to-order (ETO) firms produce complex – {{one of a}} kind – {{products}} and desire shorter lead time as a key component to cost competitiveness. In ETO firms, the engineering process is the largest <b>controllable</b> <b>consumer</b> of lead time. Given that lead time is a function of completion rate and scheduling policy, one critical process is to accurately sequence jobs in front of the engineering function. However, unlike other manufacturing models, such as make–to-stock or make-to-order models, the design for an ETO product is not realized until after the engineering process has been completed. Hence, the only information available does not include data normally required by most sequencing algorithms. Therefore, the problem becomes the determination of an accurate schedule within a complex transactional process for jobs which have not even been designed yet. This paper investigates this topic {{in the context of the}} engineering process within the ETO model. Based on research conducted in conjunction with multiple firms, common factors are identified which drive complexity, and a new framework and algorithm are presented for using these factors to sequence jobs. Using discrete event simulation, the performance of this new algorithm is found to be a significant improvement over current industry and published methods...|$|E
40|$|The UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, {{with its}} key topics {{of global warming}} and deteriorating air quality, will speed up the advance of {{electric}} mobility. CO 2 -neutral and zero-emission mobility require electricity to be generated from regenerative sources of energy. Power generation from wind and solar energy, however {{is dependent on the}} weather and is therefore not stable. The irregularities that occur in nature can result in unacceptable voltage fluctuations in the power grid. For that reason, the availability of highly flexible loads and storage systems is becoming particularly important. Electric vehicles, with their grid-relevant properties as <b>controllable</b> power <b>consumers</b> and electricity storage systems, could help to stabilize future power grids.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} state estimation for low voltage networks {{is the core}} stone for flexible operation and control in the current transaction from passive conventional to active smart grids. The development in the energy supply has revealed a rapid increase of <b>controllable</b> distributed generators, <b>consumer's</b> installation, stationary storage systems and electric vehicles. This development leads to a significantly different kind of system behavior which must be understood first, and then to make suggestions for operational network improvements {{in order to increase}} the security and efficiency of the distribution system operation. For this, a high chronological and topological resolution of information for the system state estimation in the low voltage level is necessary. However, measurement data are necessary for state estimation, these measurements can be obtained either from the distribution system measurement infrastructure or from the smart meters at the connection p oints of the customer. The focus {{of this paper is to}} obtain the technical feasibility of using smart meter and their measurements for low voltage network observability and controllability through state estimation techniques. Also to analyse the impact of high accuracy measurement data provided from smart meters on the state estimation output accuracy for both voltage and it's phase angle...|$|R
