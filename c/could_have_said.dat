25|$|In 1803, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{judicial review}} of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision. At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.|$|E

Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan, Austin and the Rock was [...] "meaningless, surreal and a lot of fun". Tucker concluded by saying that the event was [...] "easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years" [...] and that [...] "the future certainly does look bright.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by another former TNG actor, LeVar Burton, who described the story as something akin {{to the search for}} the Holy Grail in Klingon mythology. Hans Beimler, who converted Danus' story into a teleplay, was aware of the mythology of the Grail as he wrote the script and wanted to avoid giving the sword any mystical or magical powers. He said that [...] "It's the concept of the sword that has the power. We <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that some technology or magic gave the Klingons the feeling of power, but {{that would have been a}} cheap way to go." [...] The writing staff was disappointed in the reaction of many fans, who wanted a technological explanation for the effects of the sword.|$|E

500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

[...] The exchange led most papers the next day, {{with most of}} them paraphrasing Mulroney's counterattack as [...] "You had an option, sir—you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 'no.'"

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> the same. In the case that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner}} as Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E

2500|$|A {{day after}} O'Neal was traded, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers {{for seven years}} and $136 million. Bryant said he enjoyed playing with both Jackson and O'Neal, {{and he said he}} did not {{influence}} the Lakers' decisions regarding the two. Regardless, newspapers the next day criticized Bryant for his alleged manipulation of the team. O'Neal added, [...] "When it came to my leaving, [...] could have spoken up. He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> something. He didn't say anything." [...] Winter said, [...] " [...] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise.

It is another information provocation by the Georgian authorities. Under physical or psychological pressure or threats, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> anything," [...] said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Drobyshevsky. The soldier's mother was quoted as saying: [...] "We periodically talk on the phone and I have an impression that he cannot speak freely as somebody is next to him".

2500|$|Rabbi Berekiah {{taught in}} the name of Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman that the term [...] "and he went down" [...] ( [...] , vayered), which appears in [...] implies excommunication.

They said that had Judah only told them not to sell Joseph, they would have obeyed. But Judah told them that they should sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites (as reported in [...] ). As a result, the brothers excommunicated Judah (when they saw the grief that they had caused Jacob), for [...] says, [...] "And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down ( [...] , vayered) from his brethren." [...] The Midrash argued that [...] <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "and he went" [...] ( [...] , vayelekh) instead of [...] "and he went down" [...] ( [...] , vayered). Thus the Midrash deduced that Judah suffered a descent and was excommunicated by his brothers.|$|E
2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s.

[...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, Colored People: A Memoir.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year. The coalition leadership sent a letter to Jean—who, at the time, was abroad conducting state visits to various European countries—informing her of the events, upon the receipt of which, Jean announced that she would cut her trip short and return to Ottawa [...] "in light of the current political situation in Canada." [...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and for people to understand that this warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> no...

2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treadle. This nonsense may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|E
