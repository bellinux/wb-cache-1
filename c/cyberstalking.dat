25|$|Retaliation has {{occurred}} when {{a sexual harassment}} victim suffers a negative action {{as a result of}} the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects sabotaged, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be fired from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and <b>cyberstalking</b> of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E

25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and <b>cyberstalking.</b> In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E

On Being Stalked. The book is Lasdun’s account of his experience of being <b>cyberstalked</b> by his former female student.

Landow in his Hypertext 3. 0) – of two very different (co-) authors: a more traditional author who is a digital “alien” and a disembodied and viral cyberstalker (a self-proclaimed “verbal terrorist”) who is a native-like digital immigrant. The article examines the book’s hypertextual qualities, proposing that it takes a step further in comparison to the protohypertextuality of experi-mental authors such as Sterne, Joyce, Borges and Calvino by actually including electronic text within its paper borders – which, in fact, become opened up as a result...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} by experts and legislators to define <b>cyberstalking.</b> It is generally understood to be the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, a group, or an organization. <b>Cyberstalking</b> is a form of cyberbullying, and the terms are often used interchangeably in the media. Both may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. <b>Cyberstalking</b> may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten or harass. <b>Cyberstalking</b> is often accompanied by real-time or offline stalking.
