5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the temperature and day length.|$|E

5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} triggering a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The resulting merger is called a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. In such a case, the total mass would not be <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Alton Towers {{added the}} Thunder Looper roller coaster; the {{addition}} was only temporary due to planning restrictions imposed on its installation.

5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> {{the requirement for}} both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

30|$|Thus, a {{variation}} is observed between LC and width of road, {{primarily due to}} the effect of <b>constraining</b> <b>by</b> road edges or median. Due to this constraining, vehicles may not choose to overtake on narrow roads, and thus maintain larger LC at particular speeds. However, on very wide roads (> 4 lanes), lack of any constrain from road edges may motivate the drivers to travel at higher speeds taking higher risks, due to which LC again reduces at particular average speeds.|$|R
40|$|Weighted random {{patterns}} (WRP) {{and transition}} density patterns (TDP) can be effectively deployed to optimize test length with higher fault coverage in scan-BIST circuits. New test pattern generators (TPG) are proposed to generate weighted random patterns and controlled transition density patterns to facilitate efficient scan-BIST implementations. We achieve reduction in test application time without sacrificing fault coverage while maintaining any given test power <b>constrain</b> <b>by</b> dynamically adapting the scan clock, accomplished by a built-in hardware monitor of transition density in the scan register. ...|$|R

The {{western side of the}} Peak District is drained by the Etherow, Goyt, and Tame which are tributaries of the River Mersey. The north east is drained by tributaries of the River Don. Of the tributaries of the River Trent, that drain the south and east, the River Derwent is the most prominent. It rises on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley where it is <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. The River Noe and the River Wye are its tributaries. The River Manifold and River Dove, in the south west whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor flow into the Trent, while the River Dane flows into the River Weaver.|$|E
5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> Vorontsov's wish to use the {{footings}} and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his first}} term, Rosas was {{generally}} credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.|$|E

AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt <b>constrained</b> <b>by</b> his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

30|$|Image {{deblurring}} {{problem is}} often formulated as an ill-posed problem, which is solved via <b>constraining</b> <b>by</b> assuming of latent prior. A relevant method {{is based on}} statistical prior (i.e., heavy-tail distribution). Fergus et al. [1] adopt a mixture of Gaussian to model the statistical prior of the image. Furthermore, Shan et al. [2] and Levin et al. [7] propose to describe the gradient distribution as Hyper Laplacian prior and a piecewise function for image deblurring respectively. To solve the problem, here the maximum a posteriori (MAP) method utilizes the sparse statistical priors to constrain the model.|$|R
