40|$|Growth and {{characterisation}} {{of single}} crystals constitute a major field of materials science. In this feature article we overview {{the characteristics of}} organic single-crystal light-emitting field-effect transistors (OSCLEFETs). The contents include the single crystal growth of organic semiconductors and their application to transistor devices. First, we describe various single crystal growth methods that produce different morphologies and geometries of crystals. Using these single crystals we highlight construction and performance of the devices. The single crystal approach not only allows us to study the device performance that reflects the intrinsic nature of the organic semiconductors but also is advantageous to enhancement in the <b>steady</b> <b>device</b> operation. A current-injected laser oscillation in an electronic device configuration remains as a big challenge to be achieved. In this context we briefly mention the spectrally narrowed emissions {{as well as the}} possibility of light amplification in the OSCLEFETs...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to control the amplitude of shock unsteadiness associated with a 24 deg compression-ramp-induced interaction in a Mach 2 flow. Two control configurations {{in the form of}} an array of 1) 16 90 -deg-pitched <b>steady</b> micro-air-jet vortex-generating <b>devices</b> (AJVG 1), and 2) eight pairs of 45 -deg-pitched <b>steady</b> micro-air-jet vortex-generating <b>devices</b> (AJVG 2) were studied. EachAJVGdevice was placed upstream of the interaction region at 12 : 5 � from the compression corner. Both micro-AJVG configurations show a reduction in separation shock strength and help considerably reduce the height of the lambda-wave triple point with increase in Poj. Pitching the microjets at 45 deg, as in the AJVG 2 configuration, prevents a stronger control-generated bow shock to form ahead of the injectors and, hence, reduces the obstruction component of the interaction significantly. A well defined separation line for no control is seen to get replaced by a highly corrugated separation line with control. Significant reduction (up to 67...|$|R

50|$|Pole {{position}} {{was held by}} Bob Flock, who led {{for the first five}} laps before his engine malfunctioned, and Bill Blair took the lead, which he held for 145 laps until Jim Roper took the lead on lap 151. In the end, Glenn Dunaway won, but officials had expressed suspicion over Dunnaway's <b>car</b> remaining <b>steady</b> while entering the rugged turns, and it was eventually discovered that car owner Hubert Westmoreland had spread the car's rear springs, a method commonly used by bootleggers to improve handling. Roper, who had finished three laps down, was given the victory, while Dunnaway was scored as finishing last. Fonty Flock, Red Byron, Sam Rice and Tim Flock closed out the top five, while the top ten consisted of Archie Smith, Sterling Long, Slick Smith, Curtis Turner and Jimmy Thompson.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} for three-level explosion-proof inverters to have high thermal stability and good output characteristics avoiding problems caused by power devices, such as IGBT, so it becomes a hot and difficult research point using only one control algorithm to guarantee both output characteristics and high thermal stability. Firstly, the simplified SVPWM (Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation) algorithm was illustrated based on the NPC (neutral-point-clamped) three-level inverter, and then the quasi-square wave control was brought in and made into a novel holographic equivalent dual-mode modulation algorithm together with the simplified SVPWM. The holographic equivalent model was established to analyze the relative advantages comparing with the two single algorithms. Finally, the dynamic output and <b>steady</b> power <b>device</b> losses were analyzed, based on which the power loss calculation and system simulation were conducted as well. The experiment proved that the high-power three-level explosion-proof inverter has good output characteristics and thermal stability...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{observations}} are presented here concerning {{the occurrence of}} • mutations in steady state populations of bacteria {{as a function of}} the growth rate of the bacteria and the nutritional conditions of the culture. These observations are made possible by the use of two different <b>steady</b> state <b>devices</b> operated under a variety of defined nutritional conditions. These devices maintain exponentially growing populations of bacteria at constant cell density (steady state) by different control mechanisms. One, the breeder, which is described elsewhere (1), permits observation of mutation rates at a maximum growth rate, and the other, the chemostat (2), permits observation of mutation rates at various controlled growth rates. In the breeder, a photocell-activated circuit, responding to bacterial turbidity in the growth tube, controls the rate of addition of fresh nutrient solution to the culture in the growth tube. Increases in turbidity result in the addition of fresh nutrient and simultaneous removal of culture v/a an overflow siphon, the culture volume remaining constant. Operating at turbiditie...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} analysis it {{is important}} to choose the proper model that fits the problem that needs to be solved. This paper discusses three pragmatic simulation models for longitudinal behaviour of a passenger <b>car</b> tyre (<b>Steady</b> State, Transient and Rigid Ring) that may be used in e. g. an ABS simulation. The characteristics of the simulation models are evaluated using some simple simulations. Simulations with a quarter vehicle model that includes load transfer effects are carried out to determine the deviation in results between the mentioned tyre models for an ABS application. The results show that the Steady State model may only be used below 10 Hz and that the Transient model is valid up to about 30 Hz. The results from the ABS simulation with the Rigid Ring model are most reliable and are clearly different from the Steady State and Transient model, which indicates that ABS simulations should be carried out with the Rigid Ring model. Additionally it is demonstrated that for tyre behaviour on uneven roads the influence of the tyre belt cannot be neglected...|$|R

FDF is a steady state copper, water-cooled coil machine with a primary goal to test multiple blanket configurations in its lifetime. For efficient remote exchange of the breeding blankets, it is planned to exchange them through vertical motions in large segments. Two principal remote handling approaches are under study, one exchanging large rings and the second poloidal wedge sections.

Two approaches to making the joint are under study along with the respective structural models for reacting the magnetic loads.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of micro engines have documented {{the problem of}} low efficiency of <b>steady</b> compression <b>devices</b> [2]. As a solution, the application of un-steady processes has been proposed [1, 6, 17 - 20]. Closer investigations have shown the applicability of pure unsteady devices for gas compression, {{but it is also}} shown that they are practically not applicable for torque generation [21]. A new concept of the wave engine has to be developed. This paper presents such a new concept and numerical investigation of the hybrid wave engine. A hybrid wave engine combines in a single machine components realizing unsteady compression, steady expansion, and mixed unsteady and steady scavenging due to the centrifugal force action. MEMS technology requires or prefers a flat geometry. Therefore, the use of a radial type of wave compression device for air compression is proposed. A numerical, two-dimensional complete model of this device was built, and several numerical simulations of engine operations were performed. The numerical model includes the simplified model of the combustion chamber closing the flow loop between the high-pressure compressed air port and the high-pressure hot exhaust gas port. The model represents the complete flow scheme of the hybrid wave engine. A special type of turbine in radial configuration with serial flow layout is used for torque generation. 1...|$|R

25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system.

When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of torque to the front wheels. When the <b>car's</b> speed becomes <b>steady</b> again, the drivetrain will return torque to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction.

40|$|A fully {{discrete}} formalism {{is introduced}} to perform stability {{analysis of a}} turbulent compressible flow whom dynamics is modeled with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The discrete equations are linearized using finite differences and the Jacobian is computed using repeated evaluation of the residuals. Stability of the flow is assessed solving an eigenvalue problem. The sensitivity gradients which indicate regions of the flow where a passive control device could stabilize the unstable eigenvalues are defined within this fully discrete framework. Second order finite differences are applied to the discrete residual to compute the gradients. In particular, the sensitivity gradients are shown {{to be linked to}} the Hessian of the RANS equations. The introduced formalism and linearization method are generic: the code used to evaluate the residual of the RANS equations {{can be used in a}} black box manner, and the complex linearization of the Hessian is avoided. The method is tested on a two dimensional deep cavity case, the flow is turbulent with a Reynolds number equal to 860 000 and compressible with a Mach number of 0. 8. Several turbulence models and numerical schemes are used to validate the method. Physical features of the flow are recovered, such as the fundamental frequency of the natural flow as well as acoustic mechanisms, suggesting the validity of the method. The sensitivity gradients are then computed and validated, the error in predicting the eigenvalue variation being found less than 3 %. Control maps using a small <b>steady</b> control <b>device</b> are finally obtained, indicating that the control area should be chosen in the vicinity of the leading edge of the cavity...|$|R
