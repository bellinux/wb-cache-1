40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} education Conditional Cash Transfer programs (CCTs) on teenage pregnancy. Our main concern is with how the size and sign of the effect may depend {{on the design of}} the program. Using a simple model we show that an education CCT that conditions renewal on school performance reduces teenage pregnancy; the program can increase teenage pregnancy if it does not condition on school performance. Then, using an original data base, we estimate the causal impact on teenage pregnancy of two education CCTs implemented in Bogot 1 (Subsidio Educativo, SE, and Familias en Acci 3 n, FA); both programs differ particularly on whether school success is a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> or not. We show that SE has negative average effect on teenage pregnancy while FA has a null average effect. We also find that SE has either null or no effect for adolescents in all age and grade groups while FA has positive, null or negative effects for adolescents in different age and grade groups. Since SE conditions renewal on school success and FA does not, we can argue that the empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our model and that conditioning renewal of the subsidy on school success crucially determines the effect of the subsidy on teenage pregnancy...|$|R

Abstract. The {{experience}} of the survivor has two distinct and correlated phases: the initial trauma with its devastating, destructive effects on the personality on the one hand, and the possibly lifelong consequences on the other, which require a unique investment of resources to avoid succumbing to circumstances. In extreme situations we can allow ourselves to be destroyed by an experience, or we can repress it and deny it has any lasting consequences. But {{it is also possible}} to engage a lifelong battle to preserve awareness of it and integrate it in the memory. The most destructive of solutions is to conclude that reintegration of the personality is out of the question, or that there is no point, or both. In these cases the survivor perceives his life to be fragmented. The preliminary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> of integration is first to recognize the seriousness of the trauma and its nature.

In view of this situation, Government introduced a number of alternative methods of renewal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{democratic}} potential of New Community Schools (NCS) as developed by the Scottish Executive in one of its first major educational initiatives. It traces the background to the initiative, locates it within the particular circumstances of the historical, political and cultural contexts of Scotland, and defines its particular ambivalence with regard to deliberative democracy. This ambivalence, it is argued, results from the mediation of state policy. Policy, we argue, does not so much ‘migrate’ as become culturally ‘mediated’ in generative local contexts. It has to accommodate itself to, and be assimilated by, different national cultures - even, perhaps especially, across the national boundaries of an increasingly devolved UK, framed simultaneously by a global context. The paper evaluates NCS in terms of the ends and purposes of deliberative democracy under such conditions of possibility. Finally, it infers from the early NCS experience a number of <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> democratic <b>renewal...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{evidence}} <b>for</b> trade union <b>renewal</b> in the UK fire service. Its aim is to consider two main questions: "How have union-management relations and the industrial relations climate been affected by management reforms?" and "To the extent that there is deterioration in the IR climate, has this had an effect on union leadership style and also on union commitment and participation amongst ordinary members?" Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on interviews with managers and union representatives and a survey of firefighters in the north of England. Findings: The research finds that a marked deterioration in the industrial relations climate led to changes in union leadership and to an increase in union commitment and participation amongst ordinary members. The poor climate created the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> union <b>renewal</b> by bringing forward union activists with more inclusive styles and by raising membership awareness of the need to vigorously defend their existing terms and conditions.

40|$|Background: The {{primary purpose}} of public policy {{requiring}} vision testing <b>for</b> driver license <b>renewal</b> is to identify individuals with functional vision impairments and, when necessary, to restrict their driving. This {{is based on the}} p resumption that poor vision is causally related to poor driving and traffic crashes. Methods: The AOA Environmental and Occupational Vision Committee perf o rmed a synthesis of relevant empirical literature on policy-based research and developed potential options for enhancing traffic safety. Results: P re s e n t l y, some states re q u i re vision testing <b>for</b> driver’s license <b>renewal</b> and some do not. Regional and nationwide studies re p o rt that vision-related license renewal policies are associated with enhanced traffic safety. However, contemp o r a ry vision screening tests may be of limited value in identifying individuals with functional vision impairments.

40|$|Background: In June 2010 the Australian Health Practitioner Agency unified the {{national}} registration of health professionals in Australia and introduced a separate register for midwives. Standard registration renewal requirements aimed to provide safe, competent practitioners. These new conditions created {{the impetus for}} practitioners to consider how they meet the re-registration standards for either their nurse or midwifery register/s. Question: How are midwives responding to the changed re-registration <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> registration <b>renewal?</b> Methods: Longitudinal case study design. A purposive sample of 24 midwives from five states was recruited. 20 took part in individual interviews over two re-registration periods. 4 midwives were interviewed in a focus group to verify the findings. Findings: Three themes captured issues and tensions about registration and midwifery practice. They are Rotation, Restriction and Extension. Conclusion:This paper has shown how the re-registration conditions and standards post 2010 have generated discourse around registration renewal. The simultaneous introduction of regulatory and legislative changes {{has resulted in the}} construction of categories within contemporary midwifery practice that do not necessarily align with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) requirements for re-registration.

40|$|The {{past three}} decades have been a period of {{exceptional}} change for women. The face of the professions and much of middle management in Scotland is increasingly female. The gender profile of politics has changed significantly. But the face of poverty is also {{most likely to be}} a woman's face while the top jobs are still predominantly male. These changes have been accompanied by demographic developments with significant implications for Scottish society. It is a tempting story to present the positive developments in women's role as the product of feminist activism. That activism has played a part but we need to look to the structural changes in the economy for the primary causal factors. Economic change presented new opportunities in the labour market. Women grasped them and employers used them. But these opportunities also presented a new set of dilemmas for men and women that are unlikely to be resolved positively without substantial intervention in the labour market. The challenge for Scotland is to continue the progress in women's educational and occupational achievements while creating the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> population <b>renewal</b> and also tackling the two extremes of under-representation in the top jobs and over-representation {{in some of the most}} poorly paid.
