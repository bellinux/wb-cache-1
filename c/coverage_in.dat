30|$|The {{vegetation}} <b>coverage</b> rates <b>in</b> Panjin and its {{districts and}} counties were summarized on ArcGIS. The average vegetation <b>coverage</b> rate <b>in</b> the whole urban areas of Panjin on 18 June 2016 was 0.71 and rose by 0.02 to 0.73 in 16 August.

5|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{concluded}} that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to}} the period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Adi Da abusing {{his power}} as a spiritual leader {{attracted}} international attention in 1985. Adi Da and Adidam (then known as Da Free John and The Johannine Daist Communion) were subjects of almost daily <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, Mill Valley Record, other newspapers, and regional television news and talk shows over several weeks early in the year. The story gained national attention with a two-part exposé on The Today Show that aired May 9 and 10.|$|E
5|$|After the work-in had finished, the {{boarding}} {{of the stone}} floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council.

5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of radar <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{recognition}} {{as an artist}} increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.|$|E
50|$|Gaps <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> {{are common}} <b>in</b> E&O <b>coverage.</b> A modest survey {{suggested}} that most professionals {{are unaware of}} what a gap <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> really is or its harsh consequences. Several professionals agreed that they incorrectly believed since they were not writing business during specific months, they did not need continuous coverage.|$|R

5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Communities in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek include Central and Elk Grove. Lumbering was an industry in {{the watershed}} in the late 1800s.

There is significant benthic algae <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coverage</b> <b>in</b> {{rural areas}} is unusually low, given {{the level of}} {{economic}} development and sector development. Using a broad definition of access, based on the WHO definition of an improved water source, access in rural areas in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} news <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> both {{white and}} black newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.|$|E
5|$|Health-care <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the United States is a {{combination}} of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
