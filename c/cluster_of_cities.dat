40|$|The spatial {{dynamics}} of criminal activities has been recently studied through statistical physics methods; however, models and {{results have been}} focused on local scales (city level) and much less is known about these patterns at larger scales such as at a country level. Here we report on a characterization of the {{spatial dynamics}} of the homicide crimes along the Brazilian territory using data from all cities (~ 5000) {{in a period of}} more than thirty years. Our results show that the spatial correlation function in the per capita homicides decays exponentially with the distance between cities and that the characteristic correlation length displays an acute increasing trend in the latest years. We also investigate the formation <b>of</b> spatial <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> via a percolation-like analysis, where <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> and a phase transition-like behavior describing the size <b>of</b> the largest <b>cluster</b> as a function of a homicide threshold are observed. This transition-like behavior presents evolutive features characterized by an increasing in the homicide threshold (where the transitions occur) and by a decreasing in the transition magnitudes (length of the jumps in the cluster size). We believe that our work sheds new lights on the spatial patterns of criminal activities at large scales, which may contribute for better political decisions and resources allocation as well as opens new possibilities for modeling criminal activities by setting up fundamental empirical patterns at large scales.

5000|$|Numerous massacres of Jews {{occurred}} throughout Europe {{during the}} Christian Crusades. Inspired by the preaching of a First Crusade, crusader mobs in France and Germany perpetrated the Rhineland massacres of 1096, devastating Jewish communities along the Rhine river, including the SHuM cities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz. The <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> contain the earliest Jewish settlements {{north of the}} Alps, and {{played a major role}} in the formation of Ashkenazi Jewish religious tradition, along with Troyes and Sens in France. Nonetheless Jewish life in Germany persisted, while some Ashkenazi Jews joined Sephardic Jewry in Spain. Expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), gradually pushed Ashkenazi Jewry eastward, to Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as [...] "usurious" [...] loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.|$|E

40|$|Local {{problems}} often {{spill over}} {{the borders of}} one jurisdiction into the next, creating a need for cities to cooperate on the planning and delivery of local public services. Networks of interlocal agreements (ILAs) provide a way for cities in a fragmented metropolis to cooperate on services, and these networks may be especially likely to form when local government officials are linked through interpersonal networks. Drawing on Williams ’ Lifestyle Model of Metropolitan Politics and Frederickson’s theory of administrative conjunctions, this paper uses network analytic methods to examine the structure of ILA networks, and {{to assess the impact}} of governing officials ’ interpersonal networks on the probability of ILAs forming between cities. The Detroit metropolitan area provides the context for this study. Results suggest that cities cooperate more extensively across the metro area for systems-maintenance functions, such as public works and public safety. More importantly, we find that any given <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> has an increased probability of cooperating through ILAs when their city managers ’ participate in the same local professional network. The same effects hold true for mayors ’ networking with counterparts, and for some function, serve as an even stronger predictor of ILAs forming...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the hypothesis, that {{patterns}} of spatial centralization and decentralization vary between single-centered urban regions and regions characterized by clusters of cities, is examined. The hypothesis is tested {{by comparing the}} dispersion of growth of employment in retail trade in the Philadelphia urban field with that in the area covered by the North Carolina Piedmont dispersed city. The results obtained by using a distance - temporal regression model {{support the hypothesis that}} the dispersion of growth in the surrounding area of <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> is wider, and more equitably spread, in comparison with the situation {{in the case of a}} single-centered region. This finding suggests that the multiplicity of urban centers in a given region, traditionally viewed as a drawback to a successful application of the growth-center policy, has certain advantages in the long run. Therefore when growth-center policy is applied, it should not be carried out too fiercely to the detriment of other surrounding urban communities. On the contrary, policies geared toward the survival of non-growth-center urban places may yield rewards in the future in the form of wider and more equitable spread of growth throughout the entire region. ...|$|E
