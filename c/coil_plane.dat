Postprocessing techniques have been previ-ously shown to improve the signal uniformity in surface-coil images [1, 2].

40|$|A novel {{method to}} perform 3 D vector {{measurement}} of intense and static magnetic fields is presented. The technique {{is based on}} the recently introduced distributed magnetic-field fiber optic sensor, which exploits Faraday rotation of polarization in standard single-mode fibers. In the present case, the fiber is arranged in several concatenated short coils, and the component of the magnetic field parallel to the fiber axis is measured by the distributed sensor. We show that by analyzing amplitude and spatial phase of the Faraday rotation measured along a coil, the 2 D vector component of the magnetic field parallel to the <b>coil</b> <b>plane</b> can be calculated. By arranging two close coils on orthogonal planes, a 3 D reconstruction of the magnetic field is achieved. Measurement uncertainty of few percents has been experimentally demonstrated over coils of just two loops; better accuracy can be obtained by increasing the number of fiber loops...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} detectors {{based on}} the balanced coil system are widely used in the food industry. In the balanced coil system, an excitation coil and two identical pickup coils are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup coils to the excitation coil is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the excitation coil and the pickup coil are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no metallic contaminant. Such strong magnetic coupling makes balancing procedure tedious. In this paper, we introduce a new coil system in which pickup coils are set orthogonal to the excitation coil, making the magnetic coupling much small compared to conventional counterpart. Pickup coils are equipped with thin magnetic cores and placed inside the excitation coil being parallel to the excitation <b>coil</b> <b>plane.</b> The balancing method consists of two steps; the one is geometrical and the other is digital processing including down conversion.

In magnesium alloys this question has been investigated less until now. The metadynamic recrystallization behavior of twin-roll-cast and annealed AZ 31 strip after hot deformation was investigated under conditions corresponding to hot strip rolling process of twin-roll-cast Mg <b>coils.</b> <b>Plane</b> strain compression tests were performed using double hit compression tests at temperatures of 250 - 400 oC, strain rates of 0. 1 - 5 s- 1 and interpass time of 0. 5 – 10 s.

Results show the effects of deformation parameters, including forming temperature and strain rate, on metadynamic recrystallization softening fractions and grain size in the two-pass hot deformed AZ 31 alloy.

40|$|Based on the target-field {{method of}} solving Fredholm {{integral}} equations {{of the first}} kind, a new approach {{is presented in the}} paper for designing gradient coils {{that can be used in}} a permanent-magnet magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system with biplanar poles. To restrict the current distribution on the <b>coil</b> <b>plane</b> within a finite radius, the current density is pre-expanded into Fourier series by orthogonal basis functions. By setting the target-field points and Bz values over the imaging region of interest, corresponding integral equations are derived from the Biot–Savart law to calculate the current densities. They form a matrix equation, in which the unknown elements of the column vector are the Fourier coefficients for the unknown current density. As long as these target-field points are well chosen, the Fourier coefficients can be solved by inverse matrix calculation instead of the regularization method for Fredholm integral equations of the first kind. Then the current density is discretized using the stream-function method to generate the winding patterns. To verify the feasibility of this approach, the gradient magnetic field generated by the current density is calculated via the Biot–Savart law. Optimized parameters are obtained through computer simulations for some shielded and unshielded transverse gradient coils. The performance of this approach has been demonstrated as well. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel inductive link for wireless transmission {{of power and}} data to biomedical implantable micro-electronic devices using multiple carrier signals. Achieving higher data bandwidth without compromising the power efficiency {{is the driving force}} behind using multiple separate carriers. Two sepa-rate pairs of coils have been utilized for inductive power and for-ward data transmission, plus a pair of miniature antennas for back telemetry. One major challenge, however, is to minimize the inter-ference among these carriers especially on the implantable side, where size and power are highly limited. Planar power coils with spiral shape are optimized in geometry to provide maximum cou-pling coefficient. The data coils are designed rectangular in shape and wound across the power coils diameter to be oriented per-pendicular to the power <b>coil</b> <b>planes.</b> The goal is to maximize data coils direct coupling, while minimize their cross-coupling with the power coils. The effects of coils geometry, orientation, relative dis-tance, and misalignments on the coupling coefficients have been modeled and experimentally evaluated.

There is a constraint on the total angular momentum to keep it at a constant level, at around 1200 in-lb-sec +/- 10 percent. On the previous AE satellites, the attitude and momentum were controlled separately, with dipoles mounted parallel to the spin axis for pure attitude control, and with coils in the spin plane to desaturate the momentum wheel. Due to the near-equatorial orbit of the AE-E spacecraft, spin axis coils would be inefficient, because the dipoles would have been closely aligned with the geomagnetic field vector.
