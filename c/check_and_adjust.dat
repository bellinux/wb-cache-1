40|$|Indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) is the {{transparent}} electrode {{of choice for}} organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Replacing ITO for cost and performance reasons is a major drive across optoelectronics. In this work, we show that changing the transparent electrode on red, blue, and yellow OLEDs from ITO to a multilayer buffered aluminium zinc oxide/silver/aluminium zinc oxide (AZO/Ag/AZO) substantially enhances total output intensity, with better control of colour, its constancy, and intensity over the full exit hemisphere. The thin Ag containing layer induces a resonant cavity optical response of the complete device. This is tuned to the emission spectra of the emissive material while minimizing internally trapped light. A complete set of spectral intensity data is presented across the full exit hemisphere for each electrode type and each OLED colour. Emission zone modelling of output spectra at {{a wide range of}} exit angles to the normal was in excellent agreement with the experimental data and hence could, in principle, be used to <b>check</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> production settings.

Numerical simulations were performed for a 50 -element linear array. Single elements are half-wavelength dipoles spaced 0. 75 lambda. The measuring distance is 5 lambda and the frequency 10 GHz. The current distribution is a Taylor (one parameter) of 35 dB, with a Gaussian distributed error of sigma = 1 dB and a uniformly distributed error of +or- 10 degrees in phase. Three cases have been considered: no filtering of the spectrum, filtering with a Hamming window, and low-pass filtering with a cutoff frequency k'= pi /d. It is shown that from a near-field measurement {{it is possible to}} reconstruct the current distribution of a linear array with an error smaller than 0. 2 dB in amplitude and 2. 5 degrees in phase when filtering is performed according to element spacing.

Based on the long time experience of Wave Field Synthesis, the “SpatialSound Wave” was used in a large auditorium to reproduce directional orchestra sounds and to recreate an acoustic environment with a compact number of loudspeakers without being limited to a small sweet-spot. To arrange 150 musicians over an 18 meters wide stage, eight 2 -way loudspeakers were situated over 8 subwoofers placed in front of the stage and separated 2. 4 meters from each other. In addition, six line arrays hanged 9 meters above the six middle front fields. These loudspeaker arrangements were aligned in time and level to create a unified frontal impression.

40|$|Time {{transfer}} between atomic clocks operated {{at different}} locations usually is {{performed with the}} well known GNSS Common View technique. This technique is based on time receivers measuring the time differences between the connected atomic clock and the GNSS satellite clocks. The obtained results are used for time scale generation such as UTC or TAI. In order to produce a reliable and accurate time scale from all provided time difference measurements with various GNSS time receivers the accurate calibration of them is absolute essential. In the last years two main methods for time receiver calibration were proposed. One is to compare the obtained time differences of the “test receiver” relative to a calibrated receiver, the “golden receiver”. This method is actually used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) for the periodically calibration of the time receivers at the different UTC laboratories. Following the second method one performs an absolute calibration of time receivers using a GPS HW simulator. In this paper the absolute calibration of time receivers with a GPS/Galileo HW simulator is performed. An analysis and description in detail is provided. The primary step is to <b>check</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the calibration of the simulator itself. Therefore the GNSS signals and the 1 PPS signal of DLR’s GNSS hardware simulator “Multi-output Advanced Signal Test Environment for Receivers (MASTER) ” are recorded in parallel with a fast acquisition oscilloscope. The time offset between the GNSS spread code and the 1 PPS signal is calculated which represents a measure for the calibration of the signal simulator itself. After the calibration of the simulator the time receiver used for UTC measurements is fed with the satellite signals generated by the simulator to determine the absolute offset of the receiver (internal delay) compared to the simulator output. Additionally data is recorded by a combined GPS/Galileo receiver connected to the simulator. The precision of the Galileo and GPS frequency transfer is determined and further investigated...|$|E

Traditionally, the backlash is measured manually either by the transmission manufacturer or the robot manufacturer. Before the robot can be delivered to the end-customer, the backlash must be within specified tolerances. For robots with motor measurements only, backlash {{is an example of}} an uncontrollable behaviour which directly affects the absolute accuracy of the robot’s tool-centrepoint. Even if we do not attempt to bring backlash under real-time control in this paper, we will describe a method to automatically identify/estimate the backlash in the robot transmissions from torque and position measurements. Hence, only the transmissions that do not meet the backlash requirements in the automatic tests need to be <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjusted</b> manually...|$|R

In most state-of-the-art 2 D tracking approaches, the issue of scale variation is rarely discussed. However in reality, videos often contain human motion with dynamically changed scales.
