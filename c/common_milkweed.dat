2500|$|While {{there are}} few {{scientific}} studies on the subject, the practice of butterfly gardening and creating [...] "Monarch Waystations" [...] is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies. [...] Efforts to increase monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and waystations require {{particular attention to the}} butterfly's food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate milkweed. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on <b>common</b> <b>milkweed</b> (Asclepias syriaca), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, A. syriaca needs to be cut back at least by half in June to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. In addition, milkweed seed may need a period of cold treatment before it will germinate.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to Asclepias syriaca, the <b>common</b> <b>milkweed,</b> and the two easily hybridize. <b>Common</b> <b>milkweed</b> can be {{distinguished}} by several characters.

50|$|Purple {{milkweed}} (Asclepias purpurascens) is a {{herbaceous plant}} species. It {{is in the}} genus Asclepias, making it a type of milkweed. It is native to the Eastern, Southern and Midwestern United States similar to {{the range of the}} <b>common</b> <b>milkweed</b> (Asclepias syriaca). The plant gets its name from the flowers that first develop a pink color but then turn darker purple as they mature. Unlike <b>common</b> <b>milkweed,</b> purple milkweed prefers some shade and is considered a plant of partial shade. It is also considered an indicator of oak savanna, especially in Wisconsin. The species rarely produces seed pods which are smooth instead of the rough warty ones produced by <b>common</b> <b>milkweed.</b> Purple milkweed is declining in some areas and listed as endangered in Wisconsin and threatened in Massachusetts.|$|E

This species is native to southern Canada and {{of much of the}} conterminous eastern U.S., east of the Rocky Mountains, excluding the drier parts of the prairies. It grows in sandy soils and other kinds of soils in sunny areas. It was one of the earliest North American species described in Cornut's 1635 work Canadensium Plantarum Historia. The specific name was reused by Linnaeus due to Cornut's confusion with a species from Asia Minor.|$|E
