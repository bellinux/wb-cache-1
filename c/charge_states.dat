5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Ralph Pearson {{proposed}} a qualitative concept {{known as the}} Hard and Soft Acids and Bases principle. later made quantitative with help of Robert Parr in 1984. 'Hard' applies to species that are small, have high <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> and are weakly polarizable. 'Soft' applies to species that are large, have low <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard–hard and soft–soft. This theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.|$|E
25|$|In {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics, isospin (isotopic spin, isobaric spin) is a quantum number {{related to the}} strong interaction. Particles that are affected equally by the strong force but have different charges (e.g. protons and neutrons) can be treated as being different states of the same particle with isospin values related {{to the number of}} <b>charge</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E

Conventional <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> assignment techniques fall short of reliably and unambiguously predicting the correct <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> for many supramolecular complexes.

30|$|Therefore, we {{conclude}} that the electronic <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of the doped transition metal ion affects the enhancement of the catalytic activity. In particular, doping rGO with Cr, Fe, or Co with a + 3 <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> yields a higher increase in the catalytic oxidation activity than doping with + 2 <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> transition metals.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of cation interstitials in II-VI semiconductors is studied using ab initio methods. We find that interstitials in the neutral <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> are more stable in the tetrahedral interstitial site near the cation, {{whereas in the}} (2 +) <b>charge</b> <b>state,</b> they are more stable near the anion. The diffusion energy barrier changes when the defect <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> changes. Therefore, if electrons/holes are taken from the defect level by light, changing its <b>charge</b> <b>state,</b> the interstitial atom {{will be able to}} diffuse almost spontaneously due to a reduced diffusion barrier...|$|R
25|$|In {{many cases}} of {{practical}} interest, the motion in a magnetic field of an electrically charged particle (such as an electron or ion in a plasma) can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center and a relatively slow drift of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.|$|E
25|$|Neutral atoms or {{condensed}} matter cannot emit EUV radiation. Ionization must precede EUV emission in matter. The thermal {{production of}} multicharged positive ions is only {{possible in a}} hot dense plasma, which itself strongly absorbs EUV. As of 2016, the established EUV light source is a laser-pulsed Sn plasma. The ions absorb the EUV light they emit, and are easily neutralized by electrons in the plasma to lower <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> which produce light mainly at other, unusable wavelengths, which results in a much reduced efficiency of light generation for lithography at higher plasma power density.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of this defect, neutral N-V0 and {{negative}} N-V−, are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which {{can be viewed as}} a hybrid of PL and EPR; most details of the structure originate from EPR. A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Three of them covalently bond to the carbon atoms and two remain non-bonded and are called a lone pair. The vacancy has three unpaired electrons. Two of them make a quasi covalent bond and one remains unpaired. The overall symmetry, however, is axial (trigonal C3V); one can visualize this by imagining the three unpaired vacancy electrons continuously exchanging their roles.|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> composition of energetic heavy ions in the diffuse component are presented for the first time. Spectral characteristics and <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> measurements for 12 diffuse ion events observed upstream of the earth's bow shock are reported. One event is analyzed in order to illustrate the basic assumptions and general techniques involved in the determination of <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> composition from the data. The probable solar wind origin of the seed population of the diffuse component is used together with the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> composition of these heavy ions to estimate the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> composition in the concurrent solar wind, and hence to infer the equilibrium coronal temperatures associated {{with a variety of}} solar wind flows. The results are compared with predicted solar wind values...|$|R
40|$|The {{near-infrared}} (NIR) optical pumped photophysics {{of nitrogen}} vacancy (NV) center in diamond was experimentally studied by considering both the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> conversion and stimulated emission. We {{found that the}} NIR laser can help to highly enhance the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> conversion rate, which {{can be applied to}} improve the performance of <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> depletion nanoscopy. Using a doughnut-shaped visible laser beam and a Gaussian-shaped NIR laser beam for <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> manipulation, we developed a low power <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> depletion nanoscopy for NV center. A spatial resolution of 14 nm was achieved with the depletion laser intensity approximately three orders lower than that used for the stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy with NV center. With high spatial resolution and low laser power, the nanoscopy can be used for nanoscale quantum sensing with NV center. And our study on the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> conversion can help to further optimize the NV center spin state initialization and detection. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> {{of uranium}} ions traveling through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma has been theoretically studied and compared {{with one of}} the first energy loss experiments in plasmas, carried out at GSI-Darmstadt by Hoffmann et al. in the 90 's. For this purpose, two different methods to estimate the instantaneous <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of the projectile have been employed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections, and (2) equilibrium <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> formulas for plasmas. Also, the equilibrium <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross sections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly on the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium or an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the target, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an energy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence on the projectile <b>charge</b> <b>state.</b> The dielectric formalism has been used to calculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to describe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge distribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the equilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical predictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the instantaneous <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy loss estimation. The results also show that the initial <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> has a strong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions. Comment: 27 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

When field evaporation is triggered by laser-induced electronic excitations the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> also increases with increasing intensity of the laser pulse. At the evaporation threshold, the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of the evaporating ion does not depend on the electrostatic field due to the strong contribution of laser excitations to the ionization process both at low and high laser energies.

Did Mr. Hastings endeavor to make his strength equal to the task imposed on him? No: the direct contrary. In proportion as he augmented the burdens of this man, in just that proportion he took away his strength and power of supporting these burdens. There was not one of the external marks of honor which attended the government of Cheyt Sing that he did not take away from the new Rajah; and still, when this new man came to his new authority, deprived of all external marks of consequence, and degraded in the opinion of his subjects, he was to extort from his people an additional revenue, payable to the Company, of fifteen lacs of rupees more than was paid by the late Rajah in all the plenitude of undivided authority. To increase this difficulty still more, the father and guardian of this inexperienced youth was a man who had no credit or reputation in the country. This circumstance alone was a sufficient drawback from the weight of his authority; but Mr. Hastings took care that he should be divested of it altogether; for, as our <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> he placed him under the immediate direction of Mr. Markham, and consequently Mr. Markham was the governor of the country.

In the year 1783, when I was actually in want of a sum of money for my private expenses, owing to the Company not having at that time sufficient cash in their treasury to pay my salary, I borrowed three lacs of rupees of Rajah Nobkissin, an inhabitant of Calcutta, whom I desired to call upon me with a bond properly filled up. He did so; but at the time I was going to execute it he entreated I would rather accept the money than execute the bond. I neither accepted the offer nor refused it; and my determination upon it remained suspended between the alternative of keeping the money, as a loan to be repaid, and of taking it, and applying it, as I had done other sums, to the Company's use. And there the matter rested till I undertook my journey to Lucknow, when I determined to accept the money for the Company's use; and these were my motives. Having made disbursements from my own cash for services, which, though required to enable me to execute the duties of my station, I had hitherto omitted to enter into my public accounts, I resolved to reimburse myself in a mode most suitable to the situation of the Company's affairs, by charging these disbursements in my durbar accounts of the present year, and crediting them by a sum privately received, which was this of Nobkissin's. If my claim on the Company were not founded in justice, and bonâ fide due, my acceptance of three lacs of rupees from Nobkissin by no means precludes them from recovering that sum from me. No member of this Honorable House suspects me, I hope, of the meanness and guilt of presenting false accounts." ...|$|E

Neither the apomyoglobin nor holomyoglobin ions show any sign of fragmentation associated with <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> reduction to the 1 + <b>charge</b> <b>state.</b> This is particularly noteworthy for the holomyoglobin ions, which retain the noncovalently bound heme group.
