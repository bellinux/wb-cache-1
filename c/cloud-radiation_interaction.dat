40|$|A minimal {{model of}} a moist {{equatorial}} atmosphere is presented in which the precipitation rate is assumed to depend on just the vertically averaged saturation deficit and the convective available potential energy. When wind induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) and <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interactions</b> are turned off, there are no growing modes. Gravity waves with wavenumbers smaller than a certain limit respond to a reduced static stability due to latent heat release, and therefore propagate more slowly than dry modes, while those with larger wavenumbers respond to the normal dry static sta-bility. In addition, there exists a stationary mode which decays slowly with time. For realistic parameter values, the effect of reduced static stability on gravity waves is limited to wavelengths greater than the circumference of the earth.

However, this does not completely describe the physical situations when a stochastic approach to modeling <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interactions</b> is appropriate.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> in simulating the tropical intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) is examined using an aqua planet general circulation model (GCM). Two types of simulation are conducted: one with prescribed zonal mean radiation {{and the other}} with fully interactive clouds and radiation. In contrast to the fixed radiation case, where the ISO is simulated reasonably well, the <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> significantly contaminates the eastward propagation of the ISO by producing small-scale disturbances moving westward with the easterly basic winds. The small-scale disturbances are persistently excited by a strong positive feedback through interaction between cumulus-anvil clouds and radiation. The longwave interaction is shown to play a bigger role in contaminating the ISO than the shortwave interaction does. The anvil clouds reduce the longwave cooling significantly in the lower troposphere while releasing latent heating in the upper troposphere. To moderate the strong cloud-radiation feedback, the large-scale condensation scheme in the GCM is modified by reducing the autoconversion timescale, needed for cloud condensates to grow up to rain drops. In addition, upper air ice cloud contents are reduced to change the cloud albedo. These modifications make a more realistic simulation of the ISO similar to the observed. close 554...|$|E
40|$|CLOUDS is {{a project}} co-funded by the EC under FP- 4 (Environment and Climate), {{conducted}} by 12 European partners (7 scientific institutes and 5 industrial companies), also cooperating with NOAA/ETL. It is the mission study of a monitoring satellite to perform measurements necessary to describe <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> in operational models for climate and long-term weather prediction. Complementary to missions for process study (Picasso-Cena, CloudSat, [...] .), CLOUDS addresses the monitoring aspect. As such, it has to comply with requirements of sufficiently frequent observing cycle, and operational sustainability. This prevents using active systems (radar and lidar) and leads to consider passive radiometry only, however exploiting {{as much as possible}} of the e. m, spectrum, with more polarisations and more viewing geometries. The paper reports on the effort to demonstrate that, by these means, the main ingredients of the <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> mechanism may be observed with sufficient accuracy. The optimal channels (central wavelength or frequency, bandwidth, radiometric accuracy, absolute calibration, IFOV, polarisations, viewing geometry) are determined. Clouds, aerosol radiation and precipitation are observed under identical geometry (conical scanning with fore- and aft- viewing) within a range of the e. m. spectrum spanning from 340 nm to 4. 3 cm, i. e. over five orders of magnitudes, for a true multi-spectral approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> in the {{simulation}} of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is investigated. A special {{focus is on the}} enhancement of column-integrated diabatic heating due to the greenhouse effects of clouds and moisture in the region of anomalous convection. The degree of this enhancement, the greenhouse enhancement factor (GEF), is measured at different precipitation anomaly regimes as the negative ratio of anomalous outgoing longwave radiation to anomalous precipitation. Observations show that the GEF varies significantly with precipitation anomaly and with the MJO cycle. The greenhouse enhancement is greater in weak precipitation anomaly regimes and its effectiveness decreases monotonically with increasing precipitation anomaly. The GEF also amplifies locally when convection is strengthened in association with the MJO, especially in the weak precipitation anomaly regime (less than 5 mm day(exp - 1)). A robust statistical relationship is found among CMIP 5 climate model simulations between the GEF and the MJO simulation fidelity. Models that simulate a stronger MJO also simulate a greater GEF, especially in the weak precipitation anomaly regime (less than 5 mm day(exp - 1)). Models with a greater GEF in the strong precipitation anomaly regime (greater than 30 mm day(- 1)) represent a slightly slower MJO propagation speed. Many models that lack the MJO underestimate the GEF in general and in particular in the weak precipitation anomaly regime. The results herein highlight that the <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> is a crucial process for climate models to correctly represent the MJO...|$|E

Previously proposed mechanisms have been found either to be too slow (e. g., clear sky upwelling) to provide agreement with in situ tracer measurements, or to be insufficient in mass flux to act as a major supply for the Brewer-Dobson circulation (e. g., convective overshooting). In this study we evaluate whether the lofting of air via cirrus <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> might offer an alternative path for TST, which is responsible for a significant fraction of the observed air mass transport. We find that a combination of deep convection and subsequent upwelling associated with cirrus clouds and clear sky can explain the supply of air for the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Thus, upwelling associated with cirrus clouds offers a mechanism for the missing second stage, which links the first stage of TST, deep convection, to the third stage, the Brewer-Dobson circulation...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has led to}} a greatly increased understanding of the uncertainties in today's climate models. In attempting to predict the climate of the 21 st century, we must confront not only computer limitations on the affordable resolution of global models, but also a lack of physical realism in attempting to model key processes. Until we are able to incorporate adequate treatments of critical elements of the entire biogeophysical climate system, our models will remain subject to these uncertainties, and our scenarios of future climate change, both anthropogenic and natural, will not fully meet the requirements of either policymakers or the public. The areas of most-needed model improvements are thought to include air-sea exchanges, land surface processes, ice and snow physics, hydrologic cycle elements, and especially the role of aerosols and <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interactions.</b> Of these areas, <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interactions</b> are known to be responsible for much of the inter-model differences in sensitivity to greenhouse gases. Recently, we have diagnostically evaluated several current and proposed model cloud-radiation treatments against extensive field observations. Satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable component of the observational resources. Cloud-radiation parameterizations display a strong sensitivity to vertical resolution, and we find that vertical resolutions typically used in global models are far from convergence. We also find that newly developed advanced parameterization schemes with explicit cloud water budgets and interactive cloud radiative properties are potentially capable of matching observational data closely. However, it is difficult to evaluate the realism of model-produced fields of cloud extinction, cloud emittance, cloud liquid water content and effective cloud droplet radius until high-quality measurements of these quantities become more widely available.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} methods to test the representation of cloud processes used in climate models is to use observations together with Cloud Resolving Models (CRMs). The CRMs use more sophisticated and realistic representations of cloud microphysical processes, and they can reasonably well resolve the time evolution, structure, and life cycles of clouds and cloud systems (size about 2 - 200 km). The CRMs also allow explicit interaction between out-going longwave (cooling) and incoming solar (heating) radiation with clouds.

We uncover the non-Poissonian {{spatial distribution of}} cloud droplets at submeter scales and confirm scale-invariant behavior for large scales. Based on these structural characteristics, we generate simple fractal cloud models that reproduce statistical scaling properties of real clouds. These stochastic models represent a link between nonlinear science, in general, and <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction,</b> in particular. Next we run three-dimensional radiative transfer computations on these synthetic fractal clouds and compare {{the structure of the}} resulting radiation fields with the known structure of the cloud model and with satellite images of real clouds. The different behaviors observed for small and large-scale variabilities will be discussed in detail. We find that while the large-scale fluctuations of the resulting radiation fields resemble those in the original scale-invariant cloud structure, the radiation at small scales is much smoother than its cloud liquid water counterpart. This violates scale-invariance and produces a scale-break at 0. 2 - 0. 5 km that is clearly observed in high-resolution satellite data such as from Landsat.

Daily climatological seasonal cycles of i) surface latent heat flux, ii) net radiative heating rate, and iii) surface wind stress are obtained from a control simulation and prescribed {{in place of the}} normal interactive computations of these fields in order to turn off the i) wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE), ii) <b>cloud-radiation</b> <b>interaction</b> (CRI), and iii) frictional wave-CISK (FWC) mechanisms, respectively. Dual and triple mechanism denial experiments are also conducted by switching off multiple mechanisms together. The influence of each mechanism is assessed by comparing experiments with that mechanism turned off to those in which it is not. CRI and WISHE are both found to be important to the simulated MJO amplitude and propagation speed, while FWC has weaker and less systematic effects. The MJO is weakened when CRI is turned off, but strengthened when WISHE is turned off, indicating that CRI amplifies the MJO in the control simulation while WISHE weakens it. The negative influence of WISHE is shown to result from simulated phase relationships between surface winds, surface fluxes and convection which differ significantly from those found in observations, and thus is not interpreted as evidence against a positive role for WISHE in the development and maintenance of the observed MJO. The positive influence of CRI in the model is consistent with a strong simulated relationship between daily grid-point column-integrated radiative and convective heating; the mean ratio of the latter to the former exceeds 0. 2 for rain rates less than 14 mm d- 1.
