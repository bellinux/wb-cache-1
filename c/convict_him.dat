5|$|John Rowan (July 12, 1773July 13, 1843) was a 19th-century {{politician}} and jurist from the U.S. state of Kentucky. Rowan's family moved from Pennsylvania to the Kentucky frontier {{when he was}} young. From there, they moved to Bardstown, Kentucky, where Rowan studied law with former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was a representative to the state constitutional convention of 1799, but his promising political career was almost derailed when he killed {{a man in a}} duel stemming from a drunken dispute during a game of cards. Although public sentiment was against him, a judge found insufficient evidence against him to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of murder. In 1804, Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State, and he went on to serve in the Kentucky House of Representatives and the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially <b>convict</b> <b>him.</b> Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E
5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Focusing {{on the subject of}} convictions by circumstantial evidence, the plot has a French baron and an American businessman vie for the affections of an heiress. She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The circumstantial evidence was enough to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> and he is sent to prison. Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a critical failure for its improbable plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

50|$|The jury deliberated for 41 {{hours over}} a period of six days, acquitting Nichols on December 24, 1997, of {{actually}} detonating the bomb, but <b>convicting</b> <b>him</b> of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction, a capital offense. They acquitted Nichols on the charges of first degree (premeditated) murder, but <b>convicted</b> <b>him</b> on the lesser charge of involuntary (unintentional) manslaughter in the deaths of the federal law enforcement officers.|$|R
25|$|James Rebhorn as Bill Norwalk. Norwalk is the District Attorney {{involved}} with Carlito's conviction case. He shadows Carlito throughout the film trying to <b>convict</b> <b>him,</b> but eventually turns his {{attention away from}} Carlito and towards the corrupt Kleinfeld.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{advocates for}} Sacco and Vanzetti charged {{that this case}} was brought first because a {{conviction}} for the Bridgewater crimes would help <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> for the Braintree crimes, where evidence against him was weak. The prosecution countered that the timing was driven by the schedules of different courts that handled the cases.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his biggest}} prizes was gangster Dutch Schultz, whom he had battled as both a federal and state prosecutor. Schultz's first trial ended in a deadlock; prior to his second trial, Schultz had the venue moved to Malone, New York, then moved there and {{garnered}} the sympathy of the townspeople through charitable acts so that {{when it came time}} for his trial, the jury found him innocent, liking him too much to <b>convict</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|The death {{sentence}} of Socrates was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, from which resulted the two accusations of moral corruption and of impiety. At trial, {{the majority of}} the dikasts (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates’s drinking a poisonous beverage of hemlock.|$|E
25|$|The then 15-year-old {{girl has}} {{repeatedly}} {{stated that the}} act of oral sex was consensual, though she legally could not consent. The jury acquitted Wilson of the rape charge, but as the age of consent in Georgia is 16, they voted to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of aggravated child molestation for the oral sex incident. Some jury members later complained they had not understood the verdict would result in a 10-year minimum sentence, plus one year on probation.|$|E
25|$|Wisam Radi, a Palestinian policeman, {{was arrested}} by Israeli {{security}} forces and indicted before a military court in 2005 for killing Yosef Avrahami and abusing the body of Vadim Nurzhitz. In 2010, he was acquitted of Avrahami's murder on grounds that a critical piece of evidence was inadmissible in court. He was, however, convicted of mutilating Nurzhitz's body and sentenced to seven years in prison. An appellate court later overturned {{the decision not to}} <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of murder following an appeal by the military prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the evidence {{should not have been}} enough to <b>convict</b> <b>him,</b> and that the summing up of the judge, John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, was prejudicial. On 20 May 1946, The Sentinel published a final piece of evidence not included in the trial, found by Mrs E. Smith, widow of the former coroner for South West London; it was a prescription for opium written in Palmer's handwriting, on the reverse of which was a chemist's bill for 10d worth of strychnine and opium.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the Senate failed to <b>convict</b> <b>him,</b> President Clinton was held in civil {{contempt}} of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems, but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright's earlier definition of sexual relations. In 2001, his license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas {{for five years and}} later by the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|When {{it became}} clear that the women's remains would never be found without Robinson's cooperation, a {{compromise}} of sorts was reached: In a carefully scripted plea in October 2003, Robinson acknowledged that Koster had enough evidence to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of capital murder for the deaths of Godfrey, Clampitt, Bonner and the Faiths. Though his statement was technically a guilty plea, and was accepted as such by the Missouri court, observers remarked that it was notably devoid of any contrition or specific acceptance of responsibility. He received a life sentence without possibility of parole for each of the five murders.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a {{court in}} Stuttgart sentenced Coolio to six months' {{probation}} and fined <b>him</b> $17,000 after <b>convicting</b> <b>him</b> {{of being an}} accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury.|$|R

25|$|On June 25, 2008 the Court for the Trial of a Bishop {{unanimously}} convicted Bennison on {{the first}} count (that he knowingly did nothing while his brother John, also a cleric, engaged in sexual relations with a minor) and six of the members voted to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> on the second count (that he covered up his brother's sexual misconduct). Both the Most Reverend Katherine Jefferts Schori, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and the standing committee of the diocese asked for his permanent deposition from holy orders and a ban against him having any ministerial function in the Episcopal Church.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} begun when Schmuck was prosecuted for having rolled back odometers {{for years on}} cars he sold to used-car dealers. He had been indicted for 12 counts of mail fraud, based on the vehicle title {{applications}} the dealers had then mailed to the state's Department of Transportation in order to resell the cars. Before his trial in the Western District of Wisconsin, he had been denied a motion to have the jury instructed that they could vote to <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> of tampering with the odometer, {{at the time a}} less serious offense, if they did not find him guilty of mail fraud.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain {{impeachment}} when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to <b>convict</b> <b>him,</b> and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.|$|E

25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{was arrested}} on 1 September 1939, {{the first day of}} World War II. Before then, the {{governor}} and his legal advisers were attempting {{to find a way to}} arrest and <b>convict</b> <b>him</b> for criminal libel, despite the lack of conclusive evidence favouring the prosecution. A series of six acts was passed by the Legislative Council, heavily restricting civil liberties. Added to the wartime emergency provisions, Wallace-Johnson could be arrested without justification. A trial was held without a jury (most of the jurors were WAYL supporters and probably would not vote for a conviction), and Wallace-Johnson was sentenced to 12 months in prison, eventually arriving at Sherbro Island. He was released in 1944. He returned to political activism, but found the WAYL in a state of disarray where tribal and regional issues, rather than the cause of unity that he championed, flourished. nevertheless he was the representative of the WAYL at the foundation of the Pan-African Federation, held in Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1944.|$|E
25|$|After {{media and}} {{industry}} pressure forced the FCC to act, MacDougall was charged after surrendering to the authorities. FCC investigators spoke to MacDougall in July (he {{lost his job}} at Central Florida Teleport beforehand due to the closure of People's Choice), asking him questions {{that led him to}} believe that the commission was aware of the incident. Two FCC agents visited MacDougall's house two weeks later along with U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear in Jacksonville's U.S. District Court. In their meeting, MacDougall claimed not to have committed any crime. According to MacDougall, Gentile tried to make an agreement that if MacDougall discussed the incident, Gentile would be willing to recommend a small fine and probation to the judge. At that time, MacDougall stated that he started to feel that there was not enough evidence to <b>convict</b> <b>him,</b> and despite continuing to protest his innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would attend court.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and <b>convict</b> <b>him.</b> As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
