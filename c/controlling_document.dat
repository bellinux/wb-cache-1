The threat of losing his job, which he loved, was real, and he had to tread very carefully as long as the Catholic Church forbade artificial contraception and as long as Turnhout remained monolithically catholic, i.e., throughout his active life.|$|E

In the Confucian world view, rule of law is applied only to those who have fallen beyond the bounds of civilised behaviour. Civilised people are expected to observe proper rites. Only social outcasts are expected to have their actions controlled by law. Thus the rule of law is considered a state of barbaric primitiveness, prior to achieving the civilised state of voluntary observation of proper rites. What is legal is not necessarily moral or just.|$|E

In this paper various methods of adaptation to a small display size are introduced with focus on adaptation of document images. Compared to photographic images, document images pose an even greater challenge to represent on small size displays. If a typical down-sampling of image data is performed, we not only loose some high-resolution data, but also semantic information, such as readability, recognizability, and distinguishability of features. We explore various ways of <b>controlling</b> <b>document</b> information such as readable text or distinguishable layout features in different visualizations applying specific content-dependent scaling methods. Readability is preserved in "SmartNails" via automatic content-dependent cropping, scaling and pasting. Content-dependent iconification is proposed to provide distinguishability between layout features of document images. In the case of multi-page document content a rendering in form of a video clip is proposed that performs content-dependent navigation through the image data given display size and time constraints...|$|E

Based on the experiment standard of new production and strengthened project, fatigue strength performance is studied on type zhuan 8 G (zhuan 8 AG) side frame used for some years when speed increases to 120 km/h. The static stress examination shows that the static strength of side frame is related to its structural design while {{has nothing to do}} with its using life. The fatigue test research indicates that the total state of used side frame is comparatively good, and the foreground used for 120 km/h is optimistic; and find that the corner of pile cap lower part(C position) is the weak site of side frame fatigue failure, the reason is closely related to the surface defect of this site. The recommendation is improving the quality requirements of this part of the side frame manufacturing technology and quality <b>controlling</b> <b>document</b> to eliminate the hidden dangers of fatigue source.

This plan will {{be integrated into the}} 324 / 327 Buildings Stabilization/Deactivation Project, Project Management Plan, (HNF-IP- 1289, Rev. 1) and shall comply with the base requirements established in that document. This PIP establishes the baseline and defines the scope, schedule, budget, organizational responsibilities, reporting requirements, deliverables, and end points for the implementation of new technology into B-Cell. This shall include procurement, safety, quality assurance, training, documentation, record management, and facility modifications applicable to this project. Specifically this plan controls and executes the procurement and acceptance, qualification, and turnover of a remote/robotic work platform for 324 Building B-Cell. This includes the development of functional parameters, performance requirements, evaluation criteria, procurement specifications, acceptance and qualification test procedures, training requirements, and turnover responsibilities. The 324 / 237 Buildings Stabilization/Deactivation Project is currently in its second year of a nine-year project to complete deactivation and closure of the facility for long-term surveillance and maintenance. A major obstacles for the project is the inability to effectively perform deactivation tasks within high radioactively contaminated hot cells. The current strategies utilize inefficient and resource intensive technologies that significantly impact the cost and schedule for stabilization and deactivation. The ASTD Remote Deployment Project shall identify, procure, and turnover, to the B-Cell project, a remote/robot work platform to improve B-Cell cleanup productivity and enhance worker safety and health...|$|E
