The modes of this structure are potentially harmful within the operation range of the grinding wheel in a standard machine configuration, since {{the rotation of the}} wheel can enter into resonance, thus avoiding a correct determination of the on-line measurement. The resoncance problem can be succesfully dealt {{with the use of a}} variable stiffness vibration absorber which autonomously adapts its stiffness to tune according to the mode to be damped, increasing the dynamic stiffness along the whole operation range of the wheel. In this work, a variable stiffness self-tunable vibration absorber prototype has been built and a new tuning function has been derived in order to minimize the response at the frequency coincident with the rotating speed of the wheel. Finally, validation tests have been performed in a scale supporting structure and the vibration reduction improvement comparison with respect to a standard fixed tuning strategy has been evaluated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing {{conventional}} grinding wheels, wheel-sided chatter vibration {{is one of}} {{the limiting}} factors in terms of productivity and surface fin-ish. Initial vibration related to the dynamic behavior of the machine tool copy on the grinding wheel and its amplitude amplifies by abra-sion. To ensure high workpiece quality many expensive truing cycles are needed. In this context, we suggest a new set-up for the auto-matic chatter detection and elimination for <b>external</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machines,</b> reducing not only the high amount of true running cycles, but also improving the efficiency. In order to suppress the generation of the waviness on the grinding wheel the effect has to be identified during an early stage of its development. Therefore, a <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is equipped with different types of sensors, i. e., eddy current, force, acoustic emission, acceleration sensors, and a tactile probe. Experimental results show, that exclusively measuring the displacement at the workpiece is sufficient for online computing wheel's waviness. Based on a model of the grinding process the other redundant sensors are used for validation. In addition, a robust online chatter detector based on the wavelet transformation is developed recognizing an instable grinding process. This model-based detection and estimation of waviness delivers solid results, it should be used for suppression of chatter in further work...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{compensate}} the elastic deformations of the technological system in order to achieve maximum cross sectional accuracy and productivity of turning operation with minimum cost. This study was based on developing of mechanical adaptive system (MAS) for accuracy control by dynamic adjustment of the tool position during processing. The dynamic characteristic of components of the engine lathe technological system supplied with the proposed MAS was studied, and a mathematical model was obtained and presented as a system with one degree of freedom in the direction of Z-axis. The stable zones of operating were defined using Leonarion graphic method. The optimal cutting parameters correspond to stationary positions of equilibrium were obtained when processing heat resistant steel under the following conditions: feed rate, S, ranges from 0. 07 to 0. 39 mm/rev; depth of cut, t, ranges from 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm; and turning speed, υ, ranges from 0. 55 to 1. 45 m/sec. Experimental examination of the proposed system showed that the use of adaptive control may overcome the error appeared due to the elastic deformation of the technological system. The maximum circularity deviation of the processed, using the developed MAS, cylindrical surfaces did not exceed 40 microns, whereas 98 microns of maximum deviation was reached using usual cutter. The developed MAS can, in number of cases, replace the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>external</b> <b>grinding</b> processing by usual cutting on lathe machine tools, providing thus the rigid requirements on dimensional and form accuracy in cross sections...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{localized}} wear on {{grinding wheel}} edges {{is a common}} phenomenon on profile grinding since the abrasive grains are less attached to the bond. The grinding wheel wear depends heavily on the process parameters, workpiece and wheel composition, causing changes on the process and profile deviation behaviors. In order to cope with these uncertainties, many natural and synthetic materials {{have been used in}} different grinding processes. However, the influence of mixed compositions of different types of abrasive grains on <b>external</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> is not well known. In order to assess this relation, a methodology procedure was developed providing an overview of the cinematic edges behavior on a progressive wheel wear. The methodology procedure is based on the acoustic emission technology, using a transducer with a 50 µm radius diamond tip. The tip, when in contact with a rotating grinding wheel, enables the evaluation of the cinematic cutting edges. The abrasive grain density was evaluated for different grinding wheel compositions and specific wear removal values. Furthermore, these results were compared to the profile deviation observed on the same tool, allowing the assessment of the influence of different microcrystalline corundum grains on the overall grinding wheel wear behavior...|$|R
