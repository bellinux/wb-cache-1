The settlement, {{in an area that}} was home to many Miwok Indians, was named after the gulch where William and Dan Carsner found large nuggets of gold embedded in the coarse sands. Water for mining was brought from the middle fork of the Mokelumne River through Sandy Gulch and Kadish Ditches. Quartz mining began in the early 1850s, and the first <b>custom</b> <b>stamp</b> mill in the district was located at the head of Sandy Gulch. School and election precincts were established early, and one of California's many Hangman's Trees stood near the center of town.|$|E

At the end of 2008 Kosovo changed its <b>customs</b> <b>stamps</b> replacing UNMIK with Kosovo. This resulted in a trade blockade from Serbia and Bosnia that do not recognise the Republic of Kosovo.

The <b>custom</b> <b>stamping</b> dies and assemblies needed for this work were expensive and uneconomical in small quantities. Hansen preferred to use standard steel shapes that were already widely available from the steel mills at economical cost.

40|$|Since 1999, Serbia {{inhibited}} Kosovo’s {{independence in}} many ways: it issued Serbian passports for Serbs from the North; it deprived Prishtina from access to local land registers {{and other documents}} removed to Belgrade; it limited telecommunication services and electricity to Kosovo. Finally, following Kosovo’s independence in 2008, Serbia banned entrance to goods from Kosovo. All these acts had political consequences, for between daily technical issues and politics there is often only a moot distinction.

Other values were prepared but none were issued, since later that year a new set with values from ½d to 5s was issued. A year later 10s and £1 values were added to this series (by surcharging 5s stamps). In 1890 postage due stamps were overprinted FEE as well, but these are extremely rare. The 1s and 5s values of the 1887 Fee set also exist further overprinted FREE for use as Free Fee stamps. In 1890 postage stamps with the same face values were overprinted FREE FEE at once and replaced the 1887 issue.

50|$|A unique (in New Zealand) {{feature of}} the Government Life office was its use of <b>custom</b> postage <b>stamps,</b> first issues in 1891. This {{was the result of}} a dispute between the office and the New Zealand Post and Telegraph Department over the correct {{calculation}} of postage costs. All issues featured lighthouses, either in abstract designs or specific lighthouses from around New Zealand. New designs were issued in 1905, 1947 (surcharged at the time of decimalisation in 1967), 1969, and 1981. Use of these stamps was finally withdrawn in 1989.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian <b>customs</b> <b>stamps</b> to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|R
50|$|As {{a support}} to the great {{divisions}} of income-tax, death duties, excise and <b>customs,</b> the <b>stamps,</b> fees and miscellaneous taxes are of decided service. A return of £9,000,000 was secured by stamp duties. So-called non-tax revenue largely increased, owing to {{the extension of the}} postal and telegraphic services. The real gain was not so great, as out of gross receipts of £22,000,000 over £17,500,000 is absorbed in expenses, while the carriage of ordinary letters seems to be the only profitable part of these services. Crown lands and rights (such as vintage charges) were of even less financial value.|$|R
50|$|To {{consolidate}} (Latin consolidare, from con-, together, and solidus, firm) is {{to press}} compactly together, {{put on a}} firm basis, and especially bring together into one strong whole. The practice of legislating for small portions of a subject only at a time, which is characteristic of the English parliament, produces as a necessary consequence great confusion in the statute law. The Acts relating to any subject of importance or difficulty will be found to be scattered over many years, and through the operation of clauses partially repealing or amending former Acts, the final sense of the legislature becomes enveloped in unintelligible or contradictory expressions. Where opportunity offers, the law thus expressed in many statutes is sometimes recast in a single statute, called a consolidation Act. By 1911 there were, among such, Acts dealing with the <b>customs,</b> <b>stamps</b> and stamp duties, public health, weights and measures, sheriffs, coroners, county courts, housing, municipal corporations, libraries, trustees, copyhold, diseases of animals, merchant shipping, friendly societies, &c. These observations apply to the public general Acts of the legislature. On the other hand, in settling private Acts, such as those relating to railway and canal enterprise, the legislature always inserted certain clauses founded on reasons of public policy applicable to the business in question. To avoid the necessity of constantly re-enacting the same principles in private Acts, their common clauses were embodied in separate statutes, and their provisions are ordered to be incorporated in any private Act of the description mentioned therein. Such are the Lands Clauses Acts, the Companies Clauses Acts and the Railways Clauses Acts.|$|R

Also still alive is the custom of raising the Maypole on the eve of May Day, which is also, of course, Walpurgis Night, and “witchcraft” is keenly practised. Another custom that has been revived is the Gemarkungsumgang (“walking round the municipal area”) in which a great number of the local population takes part.

40|$|Includes bibliographyExecutive Summary This paper reviews {{trade policy}} regimes in CARICOM {{countries}} during the 1980 s and 1990 s. CARICOM trade policy regimes have undergone substantial {{changes in the}} 1990 s reflecting {{the desire of the}} grouP's member countries to move away from inwardlooking to more outward-oriented growth and development. The growing recognition of the importance of export promotion policies led to the adoption of a programme for the Harmonization of Fiscal Incentives to Industry in 1993. All the CARICOM countries have introduced a series of export promotion measures, including fiscal incentive regimes and export financing schemes. Despite the policy of trade liberalization adopted by many countries and which, in general, has resulted in the reduction of tariffs, many CARICOM countries continue to apply additional trade charges, such as <b>customs</b> surcharges, <b>stamp</b> duty and discriminatory rates of consumption taxes. These taxes affect imports of non-CARICOM and CARICOM countries. Non-tariff barriers are also widely used in CARICOM countries. While some countries, notably Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, have removed non-tariff barriers on imports from CARICOM countries, others, such as Barbados and the OECS countries, still maintain an array of such measures. The number of policy measures of a restrictive nature still in operation in CARICOM point to the need for further trade liberalization. Indeed, it is argued that international and regional negotiations particularly those for the establishment of the FTAA, present a golden opportunity for the Caribbean countries to further liberalize their trade...|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} {{aspect of}} the English financial system is its relation to {{the organization of the}} finance of territories connected with the English crown. The Exchequer may be plausibly held to have been derived from Normandy, and wherever territory came under English rule the methods familiar at home seem to have been adopted. With the loss of the French possessions the older cases of the kind disappeared. Ireland, however, had its own exchequer, and Scotland remained a distinct kingdom. The 18th century introduced a remarkable change. One of the aims of the union with Scotland was to secure freedom of commerce throughout Great Britain, and the two revenue systems were amalgamated. Scotland was assigned a very moderate share of the land tax (under one-fortieth), and was exempted from certain stamp duties. The attempt to apply selected forms of taxation <b>custom</b> duties (1764), <b>stamp</b> duties (1765), and finally the effort to collect the tea duty (1773) to the American colonies are indications of a movement towards what would now be called imperialist finance.|$|R
60|$|Insensibly Mr. Brumley {{moved with}} his times. It is the {{necessary}} first {{phase in the}} break-up of any system of unsound assumptions {{that a number of}} its votaries should presently set about padding its cutting corners and relieving the harsh pressure of its injustices by exuberances of humour and sentimentality. Mr. Brumley became charitable and romantic,--orthodox still but charitable and romantic. He was all for smashing with the generalization, but now in the particular instance he was more and more for forgiveness. One finds creeping into the later Euphemia books a Bret-Harte-like doctrine that a great number of bad women are really good and a persuasion in the 'Raffles' key that a large proportion of criminals are really very picturesque and admirable fellows. One wonders how far Mr. Brumley's less ostensible life was softening in harmony with this exterior change, this tender twilight of principle. He wouldn't as yet face the sterner fact that most people who are condemned by society, whether they are condemned justly or not, are by the very gregariousness of man's nature debased, and that a law or <b>custom</b> that <b>stamps</b> you as bad makes you bad. A great state should have high and humane and considerate laws nobly planned, nobly administered and needing none of these shabby little qualifications sotto voce. To find goodness in the sinner and justification in the outcast is to condemn the law, but as yet Mr. Brumley's heart failed where his intelligence pointed towards that conclusion. He hadn't the courage to revise his assumptions about right and wrong to that extent; he just allowed them to get soft and sloppy. He waded, where there should be firm ground. He waded toward wallowing. This is a perilous way of living and the sad little end of Euphemia, flushed and coughing, left him no doubt in many ways still more exposed to the temptations of the sentimental byway and the emotional gloss. Happily this is a book about Lady Harman and not an exhaustive monograph upon Mr. Brumley. We will at least leave him the refuge of a few shadows.|$|R
6000|$|The finance of 1854 offered {{nothing more}} {{original}} or ingenious than bluntly doubling {{the income tax}} (from seven pence to fourteen pence), and raising the duties on spirits, sugar, and malt. The draught was administered in two doses, first in a provisional budget for half a year (March 6), next in a completed scheme two months later. During the interval the chancellor of the exchequer was exposed to much criticism alike from city experts and plain men. The plans of 1853 had, in the main, proved a remarkable success, {{but they were not}} without weak points. Reductions in the duties of <b>customs,</b> excise, and <b>stamps</b> had all been followed by increase in their proceeds. But the succession duty brought in no more than a fraction of the estimated sum--the only time, Mr. Gladstone observes, in which he knew the excellent department concerned to have fallen into such an error. The proposal for conversion proved, under circumstances already described, to have no attraction for the fundholder. The operation on the South Sea stock was worse than a failure, for it made the exchequer, in order to pay off eight millions at par, raise a larger sum at three and a half per cent., and at three per cent. in a stock standing at 87.[331] All this brought loudish complaints from the money market. The men at the clubs talked of the discredit into which Gladstone had fallen as a financier, and even persons not unfriendly to him spoke of him as rash, obstinate, and injudicious. He was declared to have destroyed his prestige and overthrown his authority.[332] ...|$|R
