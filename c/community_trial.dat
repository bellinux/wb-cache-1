5000|$|Conclusions: CTC's {{theory of}} change hypothesizes {{that it takes}} from 2 to 5 years to observe community-level effects on risk factors, and 5 or more years to observe effects on {{adolescent}} delinquency or substance use CTC timeline graphic. These early findings from the first randomized <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> of CTC are promising, suggesting that CTC is slowing the usual developmental increase in adolescents' risk exposure. Longer follow-up measurements are needed to determine if CTC can significantly reduce community levels of delinquency and drug use as hypothesized. The Community Youth Development Study will collect additional data from these students in 2007 and 2008. These data will allow tests of CTC's effects on community rates of delinquency and substance use initiation among young people through the spring of grade 9, almost 5 years after CTC {{was introduced in the}} intervention communities and approximately [...] years after communities began implementing tested and effective prevention programs chosen through the CTC system.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the stage of readiness for changes in food consumption variation among adolescents participating in school-based <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> in Duque de Caxias (RJ), Brazil. METHODS: It is a secondary analysis of a one-year randomized <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> to prevent excessive weight gain in students attending the 5 th grade in 20 public schools in the municipality of Duque de Caxias. The activities conducted discouraged the consumption of sweetened beverages and cookies and encouraged the consumption of fruits and beans. A food frequency questionnaire was applied at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study. The stages of readiness for behavioral change vary in a scale from (1) "I don't think of changing diet" to (5) "I'm already changing my diet successfully". For the longitudinal analyses, we used generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: There was a greater change in the consumption of fruit and soft drinks among participants in the intervention group who were in the action stage, compared to participants who did not think about changing their diet.

Methods: Generalized linear mixed models were used to allow for repeated measures in a reanalysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> conducted in a cohort of children in northeastern Brazil during 1 year. The response variable was weekly number of days with diarrhea for each child, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate model parameters.

The authors ’ aim in conducting {{this study was}} to overcome this methodological concern. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Oman on 1939 pregnancies among 479 parous female participants with available pregnancy records in a <b>community</b> <b>trial.</b> We collected information from participants, the <b>community</b> <b>trial,</b> and health records of each pregnancy. Throughout the follow-up period, we enumerated 684 AIP cases of which 289 (42. 2 %) were incident cases. High parity (HP, ≥ 5 pregnancies) accounted for 48. 7 % of total pregnancies. Two sets of regression analyses were conducted: the first restricted to incident cases only, and the second inclusive of all cases. The relation with parity as a dichotomy and as multiple categories was examined for each set; multi-level logistic regression (MLLR) was employed to produce adjusted models. Results: In the fully adjusted MLLR models that were restricted to incident cases, women with HP pregnancies had a higher risk of AIP compared to those who had had fewer pregnancies (Risk Ratio, RR = 2. 92; 95 % CI 2. 02, 4. 59); the AIP risk increased in a dose-response fashion over multiple categories of parity.

This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} a healthy lifestyle community-based trial on salt intake and blood pressure among a representative sample of normotensive Iranian adults. Materials and Methods: We compared the data for salt intake, urinary sodium levels and blood pressure from three cross-sectional surveys in time points of 1999, 2001 - 2002 (beginning of the community interventions), and 2007 (after the <b>community</b> <b>trial)</b> for normotensive adult population of Isfahan, Iran in the framework of Isfahan Healthy Heart Program. Using multi-stage cluster sampling method, one of the family members at each household was randomly selected with Iranian adult population as a target. Dietary salt intake was estimated based on 24 hour urinary sodium levels. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured according to standard methods. Results: Dietary sodium intake and urinary sodium levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly decreased during the 9 -year study period. Unlike systolic and diastolic blood pressures that had a consistent decrement between 1999 and 2007, dietary sodium intake and urinary sodium levels were slightly raised from 1999 to 2000 - 2001 and then reduced between 2001 - 2 and 2007 evaluations. The same findings were reached when data were analyzed separately by gender or weight status. Conclusions: A lifestyle <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> was effective in controlling the escalating trend of blood pressure and salt intake in Iranian population.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the oral health practices, status and {{treatment}} needs of the rural elderly in national capital territory of Delhi. An effort was also made to identify patterns of utilization of dental services and test alternate strategies for service provision. A total of 96 elderly subjects (47 males and 49 females) in 5 rural areas were interviewed and clinically examined using Basic Oral Health Survey criteria of W. H. O. This was followed by a <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> in which the 5 villages were divided into control and test groups. Results of the survey found that both traditional as well as modern oral health practices co-exist in the rural community. Dental services were available to a majority (mostly through private sector), and edentulousness was a condition of primary concern among the elderly as a result of unmet treatment needs for dental caries and periodontal diseases. Age was a variable that was statistically significantly associated with edentulousness (p= 0. 005). Results of the <b>community</b> <b>trial</b> showed that higher utilization of care can be achieved by providing on-site dental care as compared to referring cases to tertiary care centers. Nevertheless provision of treatment alone is not a suitable policy recommendation since many elderly did not avail care even at on-site community dental health programmes that were operated free of cost. This emphasizes the need of health education over treatment in order to empower the elderly, especially the non-ambulatory patients, to practice prevention and develop favourable attitudes towards accepting prompt treatment at primary health care level...|$|E

Main Outcomes: Comparing serum lipids levels, blood pressure, blood glucose and obesity indices changes between IA and RA based on sex and living areas during the study. Results: In IA, while the prevalence of hypertension declined in urban and rural females (P < 0. 05). In IA, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia decreased in both females and males of urban and rural areas except for hypercholesterolemia in rural males (P < 0. 01).
