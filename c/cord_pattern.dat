50|$|The {{settlement}} {{that we see}} today was a development of the architectural form that emerged at Great Zimbabwe in the 13th century AD and a local Leopard's Kopje culture that built platforms of rough walling on which houses would be constructed. Khami marks an innovation that recognised {{the environment in which}} was built. The area around Khami, being riverine, is hot and had problems with malaria. The stone found at Khami (laminar granite) was different from that found in other areas of Zimbabwe (biotite). With a mixture of dolerite, this stone was harder to quarry and produced shapeless building stone. It can be estimated that over 60% of the stone produced at these quarries would not be of building quality. The building blocks thus needed to be shaped, but even then the stones were not suitable for building free-standing dry stone walls. The builders thus made an innovation and produced retaining walls instead. Secondly, building platforms made the houses cooler than those in the open areas below. It also eliminated the problem of malaria for the lucky royals who stayed in the built-up areas. The walls are gravity retaining walls built without mortar. Unlike at Great Zimbabwe, some of the walls at Khami have foundations built with huge blocks which would have been lifted by at least 4 people. Excavations have revealed well-planned buildings especially at the Hill Complex, which was occupied by the king. The complex was first built up by creating terraces of rough walling. These rough walls, which are very stable, were then covered up by quality walling of dressed stone blocks. Each terrace was highly decorated with either a checkboard pattern, herringbone, or a <b>cord</b> <b>pattern.</b> The terraces leaned inwards so that gravity would not cause collapses. The terraces that were created by leaning inwards had wooden poles probably for the guards to hold on to as they walked along the high and steep walls.|$|E

Nephrectomy was performed most frequently in the patients in their sixties. Possible relationships between the prognosis {{of the disease and}} each of the following items were examined: Five-year survival rate and stage of the carcinoma, and atypia of cell nuclei; i. e., grade, growth pattern, and cell type of the carcinoma. The results obtained revealed that the stage reflected the prognosis most distinctly. The five-year survival rate was 81 % for stages I and II, 0 % for stage III, and 16 % for stage IV. It was 100 %, 21 %, 12. 5 %, and 20 % for grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The five-year survival rate calculated according to growth pattern was 74 % for the papillary pattern, 46. 1 % for the tubular survival rate pattern, 62 % for the <b>cord</b> <b>pattern,</b> and 24 % for the sheet pattern. The five-year survival rate calculated according to cell type was 54 % for the clear cell type, 49 % for the granular cell type, and 32 % for the spindle cell type.

40|$|We review {{investigations}} that have {{lead to a}} model of how the ventral spinal cord of higher vertebrate embryos is patterned during development. Central to this model is the secreted morphogen protein, Sonic hedgehog. There is now considerable evidence that this molecule acts in a concentration-dependent manner to direct {{the development of the}} spinal cord. Recent studies have suggested that two classes of homeodomain proteins are induced by threshold concentrations of Sonic hedgehog. Reciprocal inhibition between the two classes acts to convert the continuous gradient of Sonic hedgehog into defined domains of transcription factor expression. However, a number of aspects of ventral spinal <b>cord</b> <b>patterning</b> remain to be elucidated.

40|$|AbstractCanonical Wnt {{signaling}} can regulate {{proliferation and}} patterning {{in the developing}} spinal cord, but {{the relationship between these}} functions has remained elusive. It has been difficult to separate the distinct activities of Wnts because localized changes in proliferation could conceivably alter patterning, and gain and loss of function experiments have resulted in both types of defects. To resolve this issue we have investigated canonical Wnt signaling in the zebrafish spinal cord using multiple approaches. We demonstrate that Wnt signaling is required initially for proliferation throughout the entire spinal cord, and later for patterning dorsal progenitor domains. Furthermore, we find that spinal <b>cord</b> <b>patterning</b> is normal in embryos after cell division has been pharmacologically blocked. Finally, we determine the transcriptional mediators of Wnt signaling that are responsible for patterning and proliferation. We show that tcf 7 gene knockdown results in dorsal patterning defects without decreasing the mitotic index in dorsal domains. In contrast, tcf 3 gene knockdown results in a reduced mitotic index without affecting dorsal patterning. Together, our work demonstrates that proliferation and patterning in the developing spinal cord are separable events that are regulated independently by Wnt signaling...|$|R

40|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} {{is required}} for many aspects of development in vertebrates and invertebrates. Misregulation of the Hedgehog pathway causes developmental abnormalities and has been implicated in certain types of cancer. Large-scale genetic screens in zebrafish have identified a group of mutations, termed you- class mutations, that share common defects in somite shape {{and in most cases}} disrupt Hedgehog signaling. These mutant embryos exhibit U-shaped somites characteristic of defects in slow muscle development. In addition, Hedgehog pathway mutations disrupt spinal <b>cord</b> <b>patterning.</b> We report the positional cloning of you, one of the original you -class mutations, and show that it {{is required for}} Hedgehog signaling in the development of slow muscle and in the specification of ventral fates in the spinal cord. The you gene encodes a novel protein with conserved EGF and CUB domains and a secretory pathway signal sequence. Epistasis experiments support an extracellular role for You upstream of the Hedgehog response mechanism. Analysis of chimeras indicates that you mutant cells can appropriately respond to Hedgehog signaling in a wild-type environment. Additional chimera analysis indicates that wild-type you gene function is not required in axial Hedgehog-producing cells, suggesting that You is essential for transport or stability of Hedgehog signals in the extracellular environment. Our positional cloning and functional studies demonstrate that You is a novel extracellular component of the Hedgehog pathway in vertebrates. </p...|$|R

This culture is defined by pottery decorated with <b>cord</b> <b>patterns.</b> In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers. Hemp fibers were also discovered in the Torihama shell mound, Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the Jōmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the Jōmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers, funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. It {{is interesting to note that}} the pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vertebrate neural {{development}} requires precise {{coordination of}} cell proliferation and cell specification to guide orderly transition of mitotically active precursor cells into {{different types of}} post-mitotic neurons and glia. Lateral inhibition, mediated by the Delta-Notch signaling pathway, may provide a mechanism to regulate proliferation and specification in the vertebrate nervous system. We examined delta and notch gene expression in zebrafish embryos and tested the role of lateral inhibition in spinal <b>cord</b> <b>patterning</b> by ablating cells and genetically disrupting Delta-Notch signaling. Results Zebrafish embryos express multiple delta and notch genes throughout the developing nervous system. All or most proliferative precursors appeared to express notch genes whereas subsets of precursors and post-mitotic neurons expressed delta genes. When we ablated identified primary motor neurons soon after they were born, they were replaced, indicating that specified neurons laterally inhibit neighboring precursors. Mutation of a delta gene caused precursor cells of the trunk neural tube to cease dividing prematurely and develop as neurons. Additionally, mutant embryos had excess early specified neurons, with fates appropriate for their normal positions within the neural tube, and a concomitant deficit of late specified cells. Conclusions Our {{results are consistent with}} the idea that zebrafish Delta proteins, expressed by newly specified neurons, promote Notch activity in neighboring precursors. This signaling is required to maintain a proliferative precursor population and generate late-born neurons and glia. Thus, Delta-Notch signaling may diversify vertebrate neural cell fates by coordinating cell cycle control and cell specification. </p...|$|R

Moreover, a development process of a numerical model of a terrain vehicle suspension system is presented. Experimental tests were carried out on the machine Instron 8802 with an assistance of the high-speed camera Phantom v 12. Obtained stress-strain curves were applied into the FE model to estimate material constants for Mooney-Rivlin constitutive rubber model and for numerical failure criterion. Geometry of the tire and other suspension elements were achieved using reverse engineering technology. Due to the fact that a tire is such a complex structure to be represented with numerical methods, it was important to develop a discrete model of tire as much similar to the real one as possible. Consequently, an exact tire <b>cords</b> <b>pattern</b> was implemented into the FE model of the tire, which was obtained by the assistance of a microscope and X-ray device.

40|$|Background: Forging a {{relationship}} between progenitors with dynamically changing gene expression and their terminal fate is instructive for understanding the logic of how cell-type diversity is established. The mouse spinal cord is an ideal system to study these mechanisms {{in the context of}} developmental genetics and nervous system development. Here we focus on the Gastrulation homeobox 2 (Gbx 2) transcription factor, which has not been explored in spinal cord development. Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined the molecular identity of Gbx 2 -expressing spinal cord progenitors. We also utilized genetic inducible fate mapping to mark the Gbx 2 lineage at different embryonic stages in vivo in mouse. Collectively, we uncover cell behaviors, cytoarchitectonic organization, and the terminal cell fate of the Gbx 2 lineage. Notably, both ventral motor neurons and interneurons are derived from the Gbx 2 lineage, but only during a short developmental period. Short-term fate mapping during mouse spinal cord development shows that Gbx 2 expression is transient and is extinguished ventrally in a rostral to caudal gradient. Concomitantly, a permanent lineage restriction boundary ensures that spinal cord neurons derived from the Gbx 2 lineage are confined to a dorsal compartment that is maintained in the adult and that this lineage generates inhibitory interneurons of the spinal cord. Using lineage tracing and molecular markers to follow Gbx 2 -mutant cells, we show that the loss of Gbx 2 globally affects spinal <b>cord</b> <b>patterning</b> including the organization of interneuron progenitors. Finally, long-term lineage analysis reveals that the presence an...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{the various}} {{mathematical}} ideas we’ve been exploring briefly, how might these differ in textiles from ancient Peru? In the ancient textiles that I study, Andean {{people seem to}} have made conscious use of the math embedded in textile processes for generating several kinds of graphic codes. You may have heard about a device called the khipu: it {{is a bunch of}} colored and knotted cords that looks like a string mop, but it is really an ancient record-keeping device. The knots stand for numbers in the base 10 system. Long knots were used for numbers from 2 to 9, while clusters of single knots stood for the 10 ’s, 100 ’s, and 1000 ’s. The colors of cords were likely used for categories of things, and the direction of the twist for another kind of distinction. Although no one can read a khipu, we {{have a pretty good idea}} of how the fiber qualities and structures mathematically encoded information such as census figures or quantities of goods collected through taxation during the Inka period, c. 1500 A. D. Two thousand years ago, people on the South Coast of Peru were embroidering mantles that look something like khipus. Some Linear-style mantles from the site of Paracas Necropolis have many parallel bands with reverse-curve snakes repeated within them. The snake-like patterns usually alternate three colors, and look like three-ply cords. In an example from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1972. 353), all of the band patterns twist in the same direction, except for one. The number of colors and bands, and the twist direction, are no doubt significant, as they vary from mantle to mantle in this style. It is fairly clear that fiber structures were used as a model for some visual codes that we see on Andean textiles in different periods – particularly those patterns that have a geometric appearance. Headbands from the mummy bundles excavated at the site of Paracas Necropolis sometimes look like cords made of five plied elements.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Sufu in Hh pathway activation and spinal <b>cord</b> D/V <b>patterning</b> remain controversial, particularly in light of recent findings that Sufu protects Gli 2 and Gli 3 proteins from proteasomal degradation. In the current study, we show that Hh pathway activation and dorsal expansion of ventral spinal cord cell types in the absence of Sufu depend on the activator activities of all three Gli family proteins. We also show that Sufu plays a positive role in the maximal activation of Hh signaling that defines the ventral-most cell fate in the mammalian spinal cord, likely through protecting Gli 2 and Gli 3 proteins from degradation. Finally, by altering the level of Gli 3 repressor on a background of reduced Gli activator activities, we reveal an important contribution of Gli 3 repressor activity to the Hh pathway activation and the D/V patterning of the spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{fundamental}} question in biology is how animal segmentation arose during evolution. One particular {{challenge is to}} clarify whether segmental ganglia {{of the nervous system}} evolved once, twice, or several times within the Bilateria. As close relatives of arthropods, Onychophora {{play an important role in}} this debate since their nervous system displays a mixture of both segmental and non-segmental features. We present evidence that the onychophoran “ventral organs,” previously interpreted as segmental anlagen of the nervous system, do not contribute to nerve cord formation and therefore cannot be regarded as vestiges of segmental ganglia. The early axonal pathways in the central nervous system arise by an anterior-to-posterior cascade of axonogenesis from neuronal cell bodies, which are distributed irregularly along each presumptive ventral <b>cord.</b> This <b>pattern</b> contrasts with the strictly segmental neuromeres present in arthropod embryos and makes the assumption of a secondary loss of segmentation in the nervous system during the evolution of the Onychophora less plausible. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of neural segmentation in the Panarthropoda (Arthropoda+Onychophora+Tardigrada).

Results of investigations to {{study the effects of}} microwaves on isolated nerves, synaptic function, transmission of neural impulses, electroencephalographic recordings, behavior, and on chemical, cytochemical and immunological properties of the blood are presented. Specifically, the effects of microwave exposure on chick brain and cat spinal <b>cords,</b> on EEG <b>patterns</b> of rats, on behavior of neonatal rats exposed during development, on behavior of adult rats, on behavior of rhesus monkeys and on the pathology, hematology, and immunology of rabbits will be reported in a summary format. Much of the information is new and has not been published previously...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequential}} {{distribution of}} lymph-borne, i. v. injected particles of tantalum in hepatic hilar lymph nodes was studied in rats {{in an attempt}} to determine which structural compartments of a node are responsible for mechanical filtration. The injected particles reached these nodes via liver lymph but the i. v. route of administration eliminated any possibility of disturbing either lymph flow or pressure. Particles began to enter hepatic hilar nodes only after an interval of 7 - 8 h. They were subsequently redistributed from marginal, trabecular and medullary sinuses to the paracortex and finally to medullary cords. Particles accumulated predominantly in the paracortex at 12 - 24 h and thereafter in medullary <b>cords.</b> This sequential <b>pattern</b> of distribution differed significantly from that observed previously in other lymph nodes after either intralymphatic or intratissue injection...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{restricted}} precursors (NRPs) (Mayer-Proschel et al., 1997) {{can generate}} multiple neurotransmitter phenotypes during maturation in culture. Undifferentiated E-NCAM � (embryonic neural cell adhesion molecule) immunoreactive NRPs are mitotically active and electrically immature, and they express only {{a subset of}} neuronal markers. Fully mature cells are postmitotic, process-bearing cells that are neurofilament-M and synaptophysin immunoreactive, and they synthesize and respond to different subsets of neurotransmitter molecules. Mature neurons that synthesize and respond to glycine, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine can be identified by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and calcium imaging in mass cultures. Individual NRPs also generate heterogeneous progeny as assessed by neurotransmitter response and synthesis, demonstrating the multipotent nature of the precursor cells. Differentiation can be modulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 2 / 4 molecules. Shh acts as a mitogen and inhibits differentiation (including cholinergic differentiation). BMP- 2 and BMP- 4, in contrast, inhibit cell division and promote differentiation (including cholinergic differentiation). Thus, a single neuronal precursor cell can differentiate into multiple classes of neurons, and this differentiation can be modulated by environmental signals. Key words: E-NCAM; spinal cord development; neuroblasts; stem cells; Shh; BMP Initially homogeneous neuroepithelial (NEP) stem cells (Kalyani et al., 1997) of the embryonic spinal <b>cord</b> are <b>patterned</b> in vivo to generate mature neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes in a characteristic spatial and temporal profile (Hamburger, 1948...|$|R
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} a novel secreted {{protein in}} mice and humans was identified, and named Neucrin. Mouse Neucrin consists of 343 amino acids with a cysteine-rich domain in its carboxyl terminal region. The positions of 10 cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich domain {{are similar to}} those of Dickkopfs (Dkks), secreted Wnt antagonists. However, whereas Dkks have two cysteine-rich domains, Neucrin has only one. Neucrin as well as Dkks bound to LDL receptor-related protein 6 and inhibited the stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin, indicating that Neucrin is an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling. Mouse Neucrin expression was not detected in any major tissues in the adult, but was detected in developing neural tissues, including the brain and spinal <b>cord.</b> The expression <b>pattern</b> of Neucrin is distinct from that of any Dkk. Neucrin is a unique secreted Wnt antagonist that is predominantly expressed in developing neural tissues...|$|R
40|$|Isolated, unstimulated {{abdominal}} ventral nerve <b>cords</b> ofLimulus display <b>patterns</b> {{of motor}} output characteristic of rhythmic gill ventilation and of gill cleaning (Fig. 2). The motor output may occur as long-term patterns of alternate gill cleaning and ventilation (Fig. 3), or alternate gill cleaning and tonic activity (Fig. 4). Two patterns of gill cleaning motor output, apparently {{corresponding to the}} left-leading and right-leading patterns observed in intact animals, persist in the isolated ventral cord (Fig. 4). These two patterns occur with the same rough alternation as in intact animals. Thus all the patterns of gill-plate movement in intact animals, except those involving swimming, have underlying motor programs that are expressed in isolated nerve cords {{in the absence of}} stimulation or of sensory feedback. These findings extend the concept of central pattern generators to include complex and long-duration patterns of stereotyped behavior such as those underlying the movements of theLimulus abdominal appendages...|$|R
40|$|Sclerosing {{epithelioid}} fibrosarcoma (SEF) is {{an uncommon}} tumor originally de-scribed in soft tissues. We repor {{a case of}} SEF primary of the left iliac bone in a 42 -year-old woman. The tumor was grossly well circumscribed. The histologic examina-tion disclosed a hypocellular neoplasm with densely hyalinized stroma. It was composed predominantly of small-to-moderate-sized round-to-ovoid cells, relatively uniform, often with clear cytoplasm, and arranged in nest, <b>cord,</b> and strand <b>patterns.</b> Because the distinctive morphologic patterns and the immunohistochemical profile of this entity may be mistaken for many different tumors, we here emphasize the dif-ferential diagnostic problems of this variant of fibrosarcoma. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} tumor of this kind described in the bone. Int J Surg Pathol 10 (3). 227 - 230, 2002 Key words: sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, bone, fibrosarcoma, immunohisto-chemistry.
