40|$|Through the {{expanding}} {{of the above}} ground network of high-tension power lines the occurrence of avian mortalities due to collisions increases. The aim {{of this research was}} to make predictions on the <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities</b> with high-tension power lines of the different protected avian species under the Natura- 2000 laws, in order to evaluate the impact of a new power line construction by TenneT. If the impact of power line collisions has a significant effect on the species conservations targets under the Natura- 2000 laws of the E. U., it is prohibited by law to construct the new power line corridor in this area. To realize our aim it was necessary to gain more insight in the different factors (weather conditions, species behaviour, visibility) influencing the occurrence of avian collision victims near power line constructions for different species. 9 protected avian target species where chosen to test the impact of the new high-tension power line corridor on Natura- 2000 species. Behavioural observations and avian collision victim searches were conducted to study the influence of different factors on avian <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities.</b> 	Shore birds, gulls and water birds are the taxonomic groups that experience the most difficulties when crossing a power line construction while the cormorants experience the least difficulties. These findings could partially be explained by differences in behaviour when crossing a power line construction and partially by differences in morphology. Avian species that cross a power line construction by flying under the wires, like the cormorants and raptors, have the least amount of difficulties, while species that mostly cross a power line construction by flying just over the wires, like the water birds, experience the most difficulties. Similar species in morphology, like the purple and grey heron, are proofed to having similar <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities</b> based on behavioural equalities and collision victim data.

40|$|Understanding {{asteroid}} collisional and dynamical evolution necessitates the use {{of statistical}} methods, since an asteroid's physical and orbital characteristics are modified throughout its lifetime by collisions and planetary perturbations. Thus, my thesis investigates evolutionary trends for asteroids by calculating and applying parameters such as <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities,</b> impact velocities, and collisional and dynamical lifetimes. I found that previous calculations of <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities</b> between pairs of asteroids on independent Keplerian orbits often yielded inconsistent results. By correcting and improving the formalism, I obtained results which should be accurate for all cases. Applying this formalism, I calculated <b>collision</b> <b>probabilities</b> and impact velocity distributions for single asteroids (e. g. Gaspra, Ida), asteroid populations, and the terrestrial planets with other asteroid populations. These results allowed me to determine asteroid comminution and planetary impact rates. I also examined the dynamical evolution of asteroids, using a modified Monte-Carlo code. The accuracy of these codes are frequently questioned since, for some planetary encounters on tangential orbits, the two-body scattering approximation is inconsistent with numerical integration results. Thus, to verify the validity of Monte-Carlo results in general, I tracked particle-planetary encounters using a new mapping technique to determine the role of distant perturbations. My results show that Monte-Carlo results yield statistically similar results to numerical integration {{for all but the}} most pathological cases, and my model shows why. Finally, I used this Monte-Carlo model, modified to include impact disruption, asteroid fragmentation after disruption, and observational selection effects to determine the most likely source for a population of small asteroids near the Earth. My results show that main-belt asteroids (via the 3 : 1 or v₆ resonances) are an unlikely source for these objects, as are small bodies ejected from Mars after a large cratering event. However, planetary ejecta from either the Earth-Moon system or Venus is dynamically consistent with these orbits. Of these three, the Moon is the most likely source since its escape velocity is significantly lower than either Earth or Venus...|$|R
