5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
25|$|In The Book of the Heavenly Cow, {{the results}} of the {{destruction}} of mankind seem to mark the end of the direct reign of the gods and of the linear time of myth. The beginning of Ra's journey {{is the beginning of the}} cyclical time of the present. Yet in other sources, mythic time <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> change. Egyptian accounts give sequences of divine rulers who take the place of the sun god as king on earth, each reigning for many thousands of years. Although accounts differ as to which gods reigned and in what order, the succession from Ra-Atum to his descendants Shu and Geb—in which the kingship passes to the male in each generation of the Ennead—is common. Both of them face revolts that parallel those in the reign of the sun god, but the revolt that receives the most attention in Egyptian sources is the one in the reign of Geb's heir Osiris.|$|E
50|$|Cooking {{times for}} normal cooking are {{determined}} by when {{the center of the}} cooked item reaches a few degrees below the targeted temperature. Then heating should be stopped immediately; while resting the food, residual heat will continue to cook it for a while. If the heating continues, the food will be overcooked. Sous-vide cooking continues until the center of the food has reached its target temperature; if it <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this,</b> the food will not be overcooked, and it will not cook more after it stops being heated. The time taken for the center of food to reach the target temperature depends on the initial temperature, the thickness and shape of the food, and the temperature of the bath.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Road description== The {{expressway}} {{begins on}} the west side of Owensboro at a junction with the original alignment of US 60. Immediately after its start, it has a junction with the Audubon Parkway. After the exit for the Audubon, there are interchanges with Kentucky Route 81 (KY 81), US 431, and US 231. US 231 joins the road at the exit for New Hartford Road, and it then intersects the William H. Natcher Parkway at that parkway’s northern terminus. After the interchange with KY 54 (Leitchfield Road), the road then has additional interchanges with KY 603 and KY 144. The expressway ends at an at-grade intersection with KY 2830, which is part of the original US 60 alignment on the east side of town. US 60/US 231 <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> point as a regular four-lane highway before the two routes split again. US 231 enters Spencer County, Indiana, while US 60 continues on to Hancock County, Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|Bossiney Haven {{is part of}} the Tintagel Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{designated}} for its geological and wildlife interests. The cove is at the northern point of the Tintagel Geological Conservation Review site, chosen because it {{is a good example of}} a longitudinal coast, and for its hard rock coastal landforms. The cove is open to northerly winds off the Atlantic and is flanked by the Iron Age cliff castle of Willapark to the north. At low tide it is linked to Benoath Cove. An unusual part of the cliff is known as the Elephant Rock, where a high vertical arch has formed almost separating a ″narrow trunk of rock from the mainland″. This feature shows the relationship of vertical jointing to cliff features. The cove has a sandy beach which is completely covered by the tide at high water. At the right hand side of the cove there is a cave that is about 60 feet in height at the entrance but only 15-20 wide. It opens up into a large cavern with two more caverns which become very dark. The cave <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> point but the floor becomes rock and very uneven. It has been said there is a waterfall in the cave. Access to the beach is by steep steps, a route which is not suitable for wheelchairs or push chairs. There is no lifeguard coverage.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that cell elongation is regulated by cortical microtubules, which guide {{the movement of}} cellulose synthase complexes as they secrete cellulose microfibrils into the periplasmic space. Transversely oriented microtubules are predicted to direct the deposition of a parallel array of microfibrils, thus generating a mechanically anisotropic cell wall that will favor elongation and prevent radial swelling. Thus far, support for this model has been most convincingly demonstrated in filamentous algae. We found that in etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls, microtubules and cellulose synthase trajectories are transversely oriented on the outer surface of the epidermis for only a short period during growth and that anisotropic growth <b>continues</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> transverse organization is lost. Our data support previous findings that the outer epidermal wall is polylamellate in structure, {{with little or no}} anisotropy. By contrast, we observed perfectly transverse microtubules and microfibrils at the inner face of the epidermis during all stages of cell expansion. Experimental perturbation of cortical microtubule organization preferentially at the inner face led to increased radial swelling. Our study highlights the previously underestimated complexity of cortical microtubule organization in the shoot epidermis and underscores a role for the inner tissues in the regulation of growth anisotropy...|$|E
