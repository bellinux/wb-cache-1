40|$|Effects of the C 2 H 2 /(C 2 H 2 + NH 3) ratio on the {{properties}} of thermal chemical vapor deposition (<b>CVD)</b> <b>carbon</b> films are investigated. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} deposition rate of carbon films increases with increase of the C 2 H 2 /(C 2 H 2 + NH 3) ratio. Ten NH 3 molecules will suppress about one C 2 H 2 molecule to form carbon films, and the deposition rate of carbon films is proportional to the partial pressure of acetylene with a power of fourth order. A model description of the kinetics of this thermal CVD process is proposed. Moreover, the ordering degree, nano-crystallite size, and the number of sp 2 carbon sites decrease with increase of the C 2 H 2 /(C 2 H 2 + NH 3) ratio, while the electrical resistivity increases. Few nitrogen atoms and no hydrogen are incorporated in the carbon films. When the carbon films are very thin, the carbon atoms would be uniformly deposited on a silica glass plate which results in surface smoothening. Nevertheless, when the carbon films are getting thicker, the surface roughness increases. As the C 2 H 2 /(C 2 H 2 + NH 3) ratio increases, the decrease of the water contact angle on a carbon film surface is mainly resulting from the decrease of the number of sp 2 carbon sites in the carbon films. The deposition temperature and working pressure of thermal <b>CVD</b> <b>carbon</b> films using the C 2 H 2 /N 2 or C 2 H 2 /NH 3 mixtures are smaller in comparison to those using a CH 4 /NH 3 mixture. Usually, when the deposition temperature is above 1073 K, NH 3 is decomposed into NH 2, which would suppress the growth of carbon films. However, as the deposition temperature is below 1073 K, NH 3 serves as the dilute gas in the described processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis has been to {{determine}} the usable voltage range of carbon-based supercapacitors (SC). Supercapacitors are a relatively new type of capacitors with a vast increase in capacitance compared to capacitors which utilize a dielectric as charge separator. A SC consists of two electrodes and an electrolyte separating the electrodes. The charges are stored by electrostatic forces in the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, forming the so called electrochemical double-layer (EDL). With porous electrodes the effective surface area of the interfacial zone can be made very large, giving SCs a large storage capacity. The limiting factors of a SC is the decomposition potential of the electrolyte and the decomposition of the electrodes. For commercially manufactured SCs the electrolyte is usually an organic solvent, which has a decomposition potential of up to 2. 7 - 2. 8 V. Compared to aqueous electrolytes with a thermodynamic limit of 1. 23 V. The drawback of using non-aqueous electrolytes {{is that they are}} not environmentally friendly, and they increase the production cost. It is claimed that the voltage range can be up to 1. 9 V using aqueous electrolytes. Some researchers have focused on aqueous electrolytes for these reasons. In this thesis two different electrolytes were tested to determine if the voltage range could be extended. The experiments were conducted using a three electrode cell and performing cyclic voltammogram measurements (<b>CV).</b> The <b>carbon</b> electrodes were made of  two different sources of grahite, battery graphite or exfoliated graphite, and nano fibrilated cellulose was added to increase the mechanical stability. The results show that the oxidation potential of the carbon electrode was the positive limit. A usable potential of about 1 V was shown. However, when cycling the electrodes to potentials below the decomposition limit, for hydrogen evolution, interesting effects were seen. A decrease in reaction kinetics, indicating a type of conditioning of the electrode was observed. An increase in charge storage capacitance was also observed when comparing the initial measurements with the final, probably corresponding to an increase in porosity.

The C-MoS 2 nanorods are prepared using MoO 3 nanorods as the precursor via a sulfidation and subsequent {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) of an amorphous carbon layer. When evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the C-MoS 2 nanorods exhibit improved reversibility and cycling performance compared with the bare MoS 2 nanorods.

In this paper, we hypothise the fabrication of a MEMS based Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) -Field Effect Transistor(FET) which will act as a gas sensor having almost threefold sensitivity and efficiency than the other metal oxide gas sensors such as Tin oxide (SnO 2) sensors, which are available in the market. The Field effect transistor of (CNTs) are of great interest for various application including chemical and biological sensing. CNTs can be designed to have specific properties by changing the ratio of the diameters of linearly joined CNTs, which in turn can be used in the fabrication of FETs. The fabricated devices exhibit good lectrical characteristics showing high Transconductance even at low levels of Gate voltage. With the increasing demand of CNTs in many applications due to its unusual properties, we propose that the fabrication of these CNT- FETs will also be quite economical.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in scientific understanding of high-temperature materials processing using novel experimental methodologies have {{shed light on}} the complex role of surface and interface phenomena. New in-situ studies on molten metal/solid ceramic interactions using a unique experimental complex at the Foundry Research Institute, Krakow, have revealed a number of unusual observations in materials processing at high temperatures. We present some such unusual observations and their explanation with reference to liquid metal processing of Al, Ni, and Ti, and their alloys in contact with oxide ceramics. In particular, we focus on the following aspects: primary oxidation of Al from residual water vapor or oxygen, capillary purification to remove surface oxide, substrate protection by <b>CVD</b> <b>carbon,</b> roughening due to spinel whisker formation, inclusions in castings due to mechanical detachment, floatation due to buoyancy forces, and segregation due to directional solidification, modification of the solid surface morphology by metal vapor ahead of the liquid, and the complication due to multi-component alloys melted in crucibles made from complex oxide-based ceramics. In the case of Ti, rapid reactions with oxides result in undesirable volumetric changes that create difficulty in casting high-quality Ti parts, particularly by investment casting. Nanoscale (e. g., colloidal) coatings based on Y 2 O 3 protect crucibles and hold ladles against such attack. Practical insights and recommendations for materials processing emerging from the fundamental studies on high-temperature interfacial phenomena have been described...|$|E
40|$|Bolivia's forests {{contribute}} to the global carbon and water cycle, {{as well as to}} global biodiversity. The survival of these forests may be at risk due to climate change. To explore the associated mechanisms and uncertainties, a regionally adapted dynamic vegetation model was implemented for the Bolivian case, and forced with two contrasting climate change projections. Changes in carbon stocks and fluxes were evaluated, factoring out the individual contributions of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO 2]), temperature, and precipitation. Impacts ranged from a strong increase to a severe loss of vegetation <b>carbon</b> (<b>cv),</b> depending on differences in climate projections, as well as the physiological response to rising [CO 2]. The loss of cv simulated for an extremely dry projection was primarily driven by a reduction in gross primary productivity, and secondarily by enhanced emissions from fires and autotrophic respiration. In the wet forest, less precipitation and higher temperatures equally reduced cv, while in the dry forest, the impact of precipitation was dominating. The temperature-related reduction of cv was mainly due to a decrease in photosynthesis and only to lesser extent because of more autotrophic respiration and less stomatal conductance as a response to an increasing atmospheric evaporative demand. Under an extremely dry projection, tropical dry forests were simulated to virtually disappear, regardless of the potential fertilizing effect of rising [CO 2]. This suggests a higher risk for forest loss along the drier southern fringe of the Amazon if annual precipitation will decrease substantially...|$|R
40|$|Highly aligned multi-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNT) were synthesized in {{the shape}} of towers and used to fabricate chemical sensor electrodes. The towers were fabricated on an Fe/Al₂O₃/SiO₂/Si substrate with the Fe catalyst patterned in 1 mm × 1 mm blocks with 100 µm spacing between the blocks. Thermally driven chemical vapor deposition was used for the nanotube synthesis process. Patterned MWCNT towers up to 4 mm high were grown and easily peeled off the silicon substrate. The synthesized MWCNT towers were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. A sensor electrode was then formed by casting epoxy into the tower under pressure and polishing both ends of the tower. One end of the tower served as an electrical connection and the other as a nanoscale array electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the reduction of 6. 0 mM K₃Fe(CN) ₆ and Ru(NH₃) ₆Cl₃ (in a 1. 0 M KNO₃ supporting electrolyte) was used to examine the surface properties of the nanotube tower electrode. The CV results showed a steady-state response up to 2 V/s attributable to radial diffusion with a high steady-state current density. Cyclic voltammetry testing of these two redox systems showed a sigmoidal shape indicating radial diffusion and high sensitivity at the electrode.

Urban and suburban developments have grown at unprecedented rates with unknown consequences for ecosystem functions. In particular, {{the effect of}} rapid urbanization on the storage of soil carbon has not been studied extensively. In this study, we compared the soil carbon stocks of different land use types in Beijing Municipality. We collected 490 top-soil samples (top 20 cm) from urban and suburban sites within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing, which cover approximately 2400 km(2), and the densities of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total carbon (TC) were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of urban and suburban soil carbon characteristics across seven land use types. The results revealed significant differences in soil carbon densities among land use types. Additionally, urban soil had significantly higher SOC and SIC densities than suburban soil did, and suburban shelterbelts and productive plantations had lower SIC densities than the other land use types. The comparison of coefficients of variance (<b>CVs)</b> showed that <b>carbon</b> content of urban topsoil had a lower variability than that of suburban topsoil. Further findings revealed that soil carbon storage increased with built-up age. Urban soil built up for more than 20 years had higher densities of SOC, SIC and TC than both urban soil with less than 10 years and suburban soil. Correlation analyses indicated {{the existence of a}} significantly negative correlation between the SOC, SIC, and TC densities of urban soil and the distance to the urban core, and the distance variable alone explained 23. 3 % of the variation of SIC density and 13. 8 % of the variation of TC density.

The dual-layer film includes a sub-layer of CDC and a top layer of CVD, which are prepared by chlorination of SiC and pyrolysis of CCl 4 at high temperature respectively. The CDC and CVD layers are mainly amorphous. And similar dispersion effects are observed in the Raman spectra, although the D-band position of the CVD layer shifts to higher wavenumber (~ 1354 cm− 1) {{than that of the}} CDC layer (~ 1337 cm− 1).
