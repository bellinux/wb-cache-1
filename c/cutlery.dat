5|$|By 1600 Sheffield was {{the main}} centre of <b>cutlery</b> {{production}} in England outside London, and in 1624 The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was formed to oversee the trade. Examples of water-powered blade and <b>cutlery</b> workshops from around this time {{can be seen at}} the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Shepherd Wheel museums in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Jim Bowie was {{inducted}} posthumously into the Blade Magazine <b>Cutlery</b> Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, {{in recognition of}} the impact that his eponymous design made upon generations of knife makers and <b>cutlery</b> companies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the knife was true to Emerson's {{original}} design, {{and even though}} it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of <b>cutlery</b> it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making <b>cutlery,</b> and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Bewick (c. 11 August 1753 – 8 November 1828) was an English {{engraver}} {{and natural}} history author. Early {{in his career}} he took {{on all kinds of}} work such as engraving <b>cutlery,</b> making the wood blocks for advertisements, and illustrating children's books. He gradually turned to illustrating, writing and publishing his own books, gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in A History of Quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many {{of their}} Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western <b>cutlery.</b> However, {{possibly}} due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity {{of a large number}} of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{restaurants}} at Terminal 5, Plane Food cannot use gas equipment due to safety reasons and so electric ovens and hobs are used instead {{as well as}} a single microwave. The <b>cutlery</b> is also a standard airport size so that the knives cannot be used as weapons. Ramsay requires that staff who are working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without <b>cutlery.</b> In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although {{he had been}} making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established <b>cutlery</b> companies.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for <b>cutlery</b> handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or <b>cutlery</b> from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, no larger than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of <b>cutlery</b> production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London. The restaurant cost £2.5 {{million to build}} and due to its location within the airside area of the airport, there are restrictions {{on the use of}} gas and the types of <b>cutlery</b> which may be used. It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5, and with several other Ramsay-related openings that year. Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces, and menus are also offered for quick dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal to be eaten on a plane.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 {{a lawsuit}} was filed against Sheindlin by Patric Jones, the estranged wife of Judge Judy {{executive}} producer Randy Douthit. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley <b>cutlery</b> owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive {{her of her}} valuables, and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was {{settled out of court}} after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit, and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her.|$|E
5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for <b>cutlery,</b> for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, <b>cutlery</b> and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{published}} his findings in 1946. He noted that, {{for the local}} fishermen of the village, the antiquities were strange—as they consisted of lamps, glass items, gemstones, <b>cutlery</b> and crockery, wine containers, etc. He also observed that traders traveled from west coast and from Ceylon, Kolchoi (Colchi) and the Ganges area to trade goods such as gems, pearls and spices, and silk. He carried out excavations carefully, so {{that none of the}} antiquities were damaged. This was followed by investigations after the war, from 1947–1950 by Jean-Marie Casal. His report of excavations was not as fully published as Wheeler's. His report was not well known in India, as it was not written in English. However, his important conclusion was that the site belonged to an early megalithic period, as he had located megalithic burials marked by stones, locally known in Tamil as Pandukal close to the site.|$|E
5|$|Another side {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, <b>cutlery,</b> alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E
5|$|More than 30,000 {{artifacts}} from Kronan have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons {{of up to}} four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, <b>cutlery</b> and writing utensils, which most likely belonged {{to one of the}} officers. As a flagship, Kronan carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a war chest was required for large, unforeseen expenses. In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them ducats. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 öre-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.|$|E
25|$|Manufacture include bells, {{mathematical}} instruments, electrical goods, cotton textiles, <b>cutlery,</b> chemicals, shoes, {{and other}} products. Aarau {{is famous for}} the quality of their instruments, <b>cutlery</b> and their bells.|$|E
25|$|W. R. Case & Sons <b>Cutlery</b> Co. {{manufactured}} a post-war version from 1989 until 1993.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Tux {{was used}} by the German <b>cutlery</b> {{producer}} WMF in the Sealion set for children.|$|E
25|$|Lahore and Gujranwala Divisions {{have the}} largest {{concentration}} of small light engineering units. The district of Sialkot excels in sports goods, surgical instruments and <b>cutlery</b> goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuing}} {{interest in}} Miss Cranston is {{also reflected in}} the prices realised for items associated with her tearooms; for example ₤940 for six pieces of <b>cutlery</b> stamped Miss Cranston's.|$|E
25|$|To commemorate her World Championship victory, Sheffield City Council held a {{reception}} for Ennis in the city’s Peace Gardens, at {{which she was}} presented with a Mulberry designer handbag and a canteen of Sheffield <b>cutlery.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wood {{has always}} been used {{extensively}} for furniture, such as chairs and beds. It is also used for tool handles and <b>cutlery,</b> such as chopsticks, toothpicks, and other utensils, like the wooden spoon and pencil.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutlery</b> {{sets were}} often {{accompanied}} by tea sets, hot water pots, chocolate pots, trays and salvers, goblets, demitasse cups and saucers, liqueur cups, bouillon cups, egg cups, plates, napkin rings, water and wine pitchers and coasters, candelabra and even elaborate centerpieces.|$|E
25|$|A hechsher is {{typically}} issued for food products and is issued on non-food {{items such as}} cleaning agents and disposable <b>cutlery</b> which {{come in contact with}} foods certifying its ingredients as not containing any animal extracts or other halakhically prohibited substances.|$|E
25|$|Warp {{was also}} used as a {{commercial}} product, after being collected from the river banks at low tide, it was transported along the Chesterfield Canal to Walkeringham where it was dried out and refined to be eventually sold as a silver polish for <b>cutlery</b> manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th century, Cutler's Green (now a camp site, and {{formerly}} {{the site of}} Kinder Printworks Mill) was known for <b>cutlery</b> trade, before nearby Sheffield became dominant in that area. Hayfield and surrounding areas were also home to several paper mills.|$|E
25|$|In France, <b>cutlery</b> {{is used in}} the {{continental}} manner (with the fork in the left hand, prongs facing down and the knife in the right hand). French etiquette prohibits the placing of hands below the table and the placing of elbows on it.|$|E
25|$|In {{their early}} years, {{the club was}} nicknamed The Blades, a term used for any {{sporting}} team {{from the city of}} Sheffield, famous the world over for its <b>cutlery</b> and knives. That nickname has been retained by Wednesday's crosstown rivals, Sheffield United.|$|E
25|$|It {{was once}} {{noted for its}} <b>cutlery,</b> shoe and bonnet workshops, and there were iron and coal mines in the neighbourhood. A hanger {{is a type of}} hunting sword, the only {{remaining}} Scottish example of which was made in Kilmaurs; it is in the keeping of the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. The hanger sword is marked 'Kilmares' and is marked 'DB' for the maker or cutler, David Biggart, who also made knives and forks. This sword is highly ornate with the grip made of tortoiseshell with floral patterns in extremely fine twisted silver wire. Fork over fork, is part of the kilmaurs coat of arms, relating to the history of the village <b>cutlery</b> heritage and for forking out prisoners and those hiding in hay to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Polishing {{knives and}} <b>cutlery</b> {{is known as}} fine glazing or blue glazing. Sand buffing, when used on German silver, white metal, etc., is {{technically}} a buffing operation because it uses a loose abrasive, but removes {{a significant amount of}} material, like polishing.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} shaping {{technique}} is injection molding, {{which is used}} for parts such as cups, <b>cutlery,</b> vials, caps, containers, housewares, and automotive parts such as batteries. The related techniques of blow molding and injection-stretch blow molding are also used, which involve both extrusion and molding.|$|E
25|$|Still lifes {{were a great}} {{opportunity}} to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver <b>cutlery,</b> intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.|$|E
