5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E

While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro {{and replaced it with}} a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to [...] "not <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> again on the final mix".

On 7–10March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19March; while returning home after the conclusion of the exercises, Neptune was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarine [...] While manoeuvering for another attack, the submarine was spotted by Dreadnought which rammed and <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> There were no survivors. On 11April, the Grand Fleet made a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetland Islands on 20–21April.|$|E
50|$|Tom {{tries to}} hit the real golf ball, but Jerry <b>cuts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> causing <b>it</b> to be unable to shot. Jerry laughs at this but Tom places the shell {{on his head and}} swings at the ball-mouse, which lands right next to the hole. Jerry, with the ball still on his head, prances around the hole, and Tom blows him to the hole but Jerry does not fall in so he pokes him in after making sure that nobody is looking. Tom then takes out his {{scorecard}} and tries to figure out his score for the hole. He writes down 3 in his card, as if for Jerry, but Jerry scolds him so Tom writes 33 instead.|$|R
5000|$|Lindsey is sent in dive gear to {{retrieve}} some oxygen bottles from a damaged {{portion of the}} rig to give the crew enough time {{to wait out the}} storm. While working, she's accosted by a small, maneuverable pink/purple device, followed by a much larger one. Before she can take a picture as proof, the large craft zooms downward into the trench, leaving her to take fuzzy, smeared pictures of the smaller one following it. She coins the term [...] "non-terrestrial intelligence," [...] or [...] "NTI." [...] As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed a living column of water and is exploring the base.

50|$|The Molawin River, also {{referred}} to as the Molawin Creek, {{is one of the many}} low volume flowing rocky streams crisscrossing the campus of the University of the Philippines Los Baños and some areas of the town of Los Baños. Molawin Creek crosses the whole of the UPLB campus and essentially <b>cuts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> making <b>it</b> necessary to construct several bridges throughout the University's history to improve the campus' integrity and general accessibility. Volume of flow depends on the average rainfall of the season and develops into a raging river during typhoons or heavy rainfall. It is a minor tributary of Laguna Lake, one among many small creeks that empty into Laguna de Bay. The origins of Molawin Creek and the other creeks in Los Baños have not been pinpointed but are generally accepted to have their origins high up in Mount Makiling. The name Molawin is a local variation of the name of the Molave tree (Vitex parviflora).|$|R

50|$|The lake {{is divided}} by Route 143 which <b>cuts</b> <b>it</b> {{approximately}} <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> There is access {{between the two}} sides via an aqueduct that is approximately 6 feet in width with a depth of water of about 3 ft. The easiest way to access the lake is by taking Massachusetts State Highway 143 north from U.S. Route 8 in Hinsdale, MA, from which you can take exits to access vacation and permanent homes on the lake. There is only one public access which is on the extreme south corner of the lake.|$|R
25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by <b>it</b> and <b>cuts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|R
60|$|Lord Worthington {{laughed and}} said yes; but it {{presently}} appeared that by a sheep was meant a lean carcass of mutton. A stalwart sergeant <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> as a climax to slicing lemons, bars of lead, and silk handkerchiefs; and the audience, accustomed to see much more disgusting sights in butchers' shops, liberally applauded him.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} fresh meat {{was brought to}} the boys, {{together}} with raw yams and other vegetables. There were now other marvels to be shown. Ned had learned, when with the negroes, how to cook in calabashes; and he now got a gourd from the natives, <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> scooped its contents out, and then filled it with water. From the stream he then got a number of stones, and put them into the fire until they became intensely hot. Then with two sticks he raked them out, and dropped them into the water.|$|E
6000|$|... 168. A flat slab, observe. The {{flatness}} {{of surface}} {{is essential to}} the problem of bas-relief. The lateral limit of the panel may, or may not, be required; but the vertical limit of surface must be expressed; and the art of bas-relief is to give the effect of true form on that condition. For observe, if nothing more were needed than to make first a cast of a solid form, then <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> and apply the half of it to the flat surface;--if, for instance, to carve a bas-relief of an apple, all I had to do was to cut my sculpture of the whole apple in half, and pin it to the wall, any ordinary trained sculptor, or even a mechanical workman, could produce bas-relief; but the business is to carve a round thing out of flat thing; to carve an apple out of a biscuit!--to conquer, as a subtle Florentine has here conquered,[130] his marble, so as not only to get motion into what is most rigidly fixed, but to get boundlessness into what is most narrowly bounded; and carve Madonna and Child, rolling clouds, flying angels, and space of heavenly air behind all, out of a film of stone not the third of an inch thick where it is thickest.|$|E

40|$|The {{way that}} a magic trick works {{can be just as}} amazing as the trick itself. My {{favorite}} way of illustrating this is to talk about shuffling cards. In this article, I will try to explain how there is a direct connection between shuffling cards and the Riemann Hypothesis — one of the Clay Mathematics Institute’s Millennium Prize Problems. Let us begin with perfect shuffles. Magicians and gamblers can take an ordinary deck of cards, <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> exactly <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> and shuffle the two halves together so that they alternate perfectly as in figure one, which shows a perfect shuffle of an eight-card deck...|$|R

60|$|This was the dank, fat, savage {{island of}} New Gibbon, lying fifty miles to leeward of Choiseul. Geographically, {{it belonged to}} the Solomon Group. Politically, the {{dividing}} line of German and British influence <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> hence the joint control by the two Resident Commissioners. In the case of New Gibbon, this control existed only on paper in the colonial offices of the two countries. There was no real control at all, and never had been. The bêche de mer fishermen of the old days had passed it by. The sandalwood traders, after stern experiences, had given it up. The blackbirders had never succeeded in recruiting one labourer on the island, and, after the schooner Dorset had been cut off with all hands, they left the place severely alone. Later, a German company had attempted a cocoanut plantation, which was abandoned after several managers {{and a number of}} contract labourers had lost their heads. German cruisers and British cruisers had failed to get the savage blacks to listen to reason. Four times the missionary societies had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island, and four times, between sickness and massacre, they had been driven away, More cruisers, more pacifications, had followed, and followed fruitlessly. The cannibals had always retreated into the bush and laughed at the screaming shells. When the warships left it was an easy matter to rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the ovens in the old-fashioned way.|$|E
6000|$|The {{economic}} question, also, {{is discussed}} by this almond-eyed sage at great length, and {{he writes about}} the curse of capital as eloquently as Mr. Hyndman. The accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil. It makes the strong violent, and the weak dishonest. It creates the petty thief, and puts him in a bamboo cage. It creates the big thief, and sets him on a throne of white jade. It {{is the father of}} competition, and competition is the waste, as well as the destruction, of energy. The order of nature is rest, repetition, and peace. Weariness and war are the results of an artificial society based upon capital; and the richer this society gets, the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is, for it has neither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments for the wicked. There is also this to be remembered—that the prizes of the world degrade a man as much as the world’s punishments. The age is rotten with its worship of success. As for education, true wisdom can neither be learnt nor taught. It is a spiritual state, to which he who lives in harmony with nature attains. Knowledge is shallow if we compare it with the extent of the unknown, and only the unknowable is of value. Society produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer than another. That is the only result of School Boards. Besides, of what possible philosophic importance can education be, when it serves simply to make each man differ from his neighbour? We arrive ultimately at a chaos of opinions, doubt everything, and fall into the vulgar habit of arguing; and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Look at Hui Tzu. ‘He was a man of many ideas. His work would fill five carts. But his doctrines were paradoxical.’ He said that there were feathers in an egg, because there were feathers on a chicken; that a dog could be a sheep, because all names were arbitrary; that there was a moment when a swift-flying arrow was neither moving nor at rest; that if you took a stick a foot long, and <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> every day, you would never {{come to the end of}} it; and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three, because taken separately they were two, and taken together they were one, and one and two made up three. ‘He was like a man running a race with his own shadow, and making a noise in order to drown the echo. He was a clever gadfly, that was all. What was the use of him?’ ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} control of an optimal mirror plate {{actuator}} suitable for large channel count MEMS optical switch applications is researched. An optimal plate actuator structure is presented. <b>Its</b> performance <b>in</b> equilibrium status is analyzed. A design example, which is confirmed by ANSYS simulation, is given along with a design methodology. By considering the squeeze film damping effects, the transient response of this optimal plate actuator is performed. The system stability is proven by using a Lyapunov function and the Routh-Hurwitz test. A conclusion is that the optimal tilted bottom plate can stably approach the maximum tilt angle with the minimum applied actuating voltage, which is one-half of the present industry standard actuating voltage. A four-level stage structure is given {{as an example of}} a practical multi-step realization of such an optimal plate structure. A feedback control system is described using a sensing bridge with a sensing capacitor. Two optimal control methodologies are described, these being fast switching bang-bang control and closed loop feedback control. A high voltage driving circuit is introduced along with design equations based on the special features needed in MEMS mirrors. In addition, by introducing a shift register, a modular architecture to control MEMS mirrors for scalable embedded systems is described. By using this modular structure with its shift register, the system can be scaled when there is a future need to increase channel counts. Overall, this research improves upon the performance of large channel count MEMS optical switches. It achieves low actuating voltage by reducing by one-half of the present industry standard actuating voltage, that is, a reduction from 250 V to 120 V. By using the new high voltage driving circuit, <b>it</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> the number of required control actuating voltages. It obtains a scalable structure for the embedded system, which is beneficial to cost reduction, future maintainability and design simplification. It provides optimal control to switch the mirrors in order to achieve the minimum switching time and to maintain the stability of the system in the appearance of any perturbation...|$|R
