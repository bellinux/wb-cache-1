40|$|Investigations on {{prediction}} {{have two}} main aspects of similar importance: theoretical modelling {{of the effects}} produced by the studied natural phenomenum, {{in this case a}} magmatic intrusion in the crust; and the practical part of continous observation and adecuated treatment of the obtained data. This last aspect should take place not only over activity areas, but also in areas with a possible acti vi ty, such as the case of the island of Lanzarote. For_this reason, since 1987 a Geodynamic Station has been set up on the island (Vieira et al., 1991 (a» there is a series of physical parameters which allow us a better knowledge of the island's dynamics that can be related to its possible volcanic activi ty, are registered in a <b>continous</b> <b>form.</b> During these years the station is being completed wi th instrumentation and staff, counting with the enthusiastic collaboration of the Cabildo Insular (Insular Municipal Council) and several international institutions (European Center for Geodynamics and Seismology, Observatoire Royale de Belgique, State Sismological Bureau). Simultaneously, a work on the modelling of different models of the different effects caused by a volcanic activity has been taking place: gravity variations; surface deformations; and temperature variations in the crust. The results of the continous observation have been published in several articles (Vieira et aI., 1991 (a); Vieira et aI., (b». In this paper we will deal with the modelling aspect, and particularly with the gravity variations and deformations; developing in a complete way the numerical formulation of the calculation for the case of a stratified half space of three layers.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on English Teaching-learning Process at the Eighth Grade of SMP N 1 Cepogo Boyolali in 2014 / 2015 Academic Year. This study is aimed to {{describe}} the teaching objective, curriculum, syllabus, the roles of teacher, the roles of students, material, the procedure of English teaching-learning process, the assessment and the problems faced by {{the teacher and the}} students in English teaching-learning. This is a descriptive qualitative research. The subject of this study is the eighth grade students of SMP N 1 Cepogo Boyolali. The techniques of collecting data are observation, interview, and documents analysis. The data is analyzed using interactive model, namely the data reduction, the data display, and conclusion. The results of this study are there are two objectives of English teaching in SMP N 1 Cepogo Boyolali. First, the general objective of English teaching-learning process in Junior High School is to improve the students’ English ability. It includes four language skills, those are listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Second, the specific objectives are such as in listening, students are expected to be able to identify the detail of information. In speaking, students are expected {{to be able to make}} conversation about a fact. In reading, the students are expected to be able to read a functional text orally with good intonation. In writing, the students are expected to be able to identify the use of present <b>continous</b> <b>form</b> and to identify the use of simple past tense. The curriculum is the 2006 curriculum. The syllabus is theme-based syllabus. The teacher’s roles are as a monitor, as motivator, as a controller, as a model, as a material developer, and as an evaluator. The students’ roles are as listener and performer. The materials are books and cassette or CD. The classroom activities focused on the objectives of English teaching-learning. In assessment, there are three steps. Those are the daily test, mid test and final test. Problems faced by teacher are such as the students of SMP N 1 Cepogo give litle attention to the English teaching-learning process, the teacher has limited time to deliver the material, etc. Problems faced by students are such as English is second language for the students, students have limit vocabulary, etc...|$|E
40|$|A {{suitable}} {{project for}} the new Millenium is to radically reconfigure our image of human rationality. Such a project is already underway, within the Cognitive Sciences, under the umbrellas of work in Situated Cognition, Distributed and De-centralized Cogition, Real-world Robotics and Artificial Life 1. Such approaches, however, are often criticized for giving certain aspects of rationality too wide a berth. They focus their attention on on such superficially poor cousins as “adaptive behaviour”, “ecologically sound perception-action routines”, “fast and frugal heuristics” and “fast, fluent real-time real-world action control” 2. Is this robbery or revelation? Has 'embodied, embedded' cognitive science simply {{lost sight of the}} very phenomena it was meant to explain? Or are we finally seeing rationality aright, as fully <b>continous</b> with various <b>forms</b> of simpler, ecologically situated, adaptive response? I distinguish two ways of developing the 'embodied, embedded' approach. The first, which does indeed threaten to lose sight of the key targets, is fully committed to a doctrine of biological cognitive incrementalism according to which full-scale human rationality is reached, rather directly, by some series of tweaks to basic biological modes of adaptive response. The second depicts human capacities for advanced reason as at best the indirect products of such a process. Such capacities, it is argued, depend heavily upon the effects of a special kind of hybridization in which human brains enter into an increasingly potent cascade of genuinely symbiotic relationships with knowledge-rich artifacts and technologies. This latter approach, I finally suggest, does better justice to our peculiar profile, which combines deep biological continuity with an equally deep cognitive discontinuity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Principal G-spaces have {{a natural}} noncommutative {{geometry}} analogue {{in the concept of}} principal extensions of algebras (Galois-type extensions that are equivariantly projective). One way of constructing such extensions is to form fibre products of finitely many smash products. This leads to the notion of piecewise trivial comodule algebras. We prove that such a comodule algebra P is principal if the defining smash products can be assembled into parts of a flabby sheaf whose space of global sections is P. 1. Overview and results Comodule algebras of Hopf algebras provide a natural noncommutative geometry generalisation of spaces equipped with group actions. Less evidently, principal exten-sions [5] appear to be a proper analogue of principal fibre bundles in this context (see the next section for precise definitions). The classical concept of local triviality of G-spaces can be adapted to the setting of comodule algebras through the concept of piecewise triviality studied in this paper. The basic idea goes back to [8, 7, 10, 12, 17]. Our aim here is to clarify the interplay between piecewise triviality and principality. The first main result we prove is the following: Theorem 1. Let H be a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode and P be a flabby sheaf of H-comodule algebras over a topological space with a finite open covering {Ui} for which P(Ui) is principal. Then P(U) is principal for any open set U. This means in particular that quantum principal fibre bundles in the sense of Pflaum [17] give rise to principal extensions as long as the involved sheaves are flabby. On the other hand, the underlying topological space plays for flabby sheaves only a secondary role, the main point is that the global sections of P form a comodule algebra which should be considered as being glued of the pieces Pi: = P(Ui). If we consider for example a compact Hausdorff space X which is obtained by glueing together two closed subsets X 1, X 2 ⊂ X along their intersection X 1 ∩X 2, then the corresponding algebras of <b>continous</b> complex-valued functions <b>form</b> a pull-back C(X) xxrrr rrr &&L...|$|R
