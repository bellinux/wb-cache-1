40|$|BACKGROUND: All {{around the}} world, {{there is a}} rising trend of {{computer}} use among young children especially at home; yet the <b>computer</b> <b>furniture</b> is usually not designed specifically for children's use. In Hong Kong, this creates an even greater problem as most people live in very small apartments in high-rise buildings. Most of the past research literature is focused on computer use in children in the school environment and not about the home setting. OBJECTIVE: The present pilot study aimed to examine ergonomic issues in children's use of computers at home in Hong Kong, which has some unique home environmental issues. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen children (six male, nine female) aged 8 - 11 years and their parents were recruited by convenience sampling. METHODS: Participants {{were asked to provide}} information on their computer use habits and related musculoskeletal symptoms. Participants were photographed when sitting at the computer workstation in their usual postures and joint angles were measured. RESULTS: The participants used computers frequently for less than two hours daily and the majority shared their workstations with other family members. <b>Computer</b> <b>furniture</b> was designed more for adult use and a mismatch of furniture and body size was found. Ergonomic issues included inappropriate positioning of the display screen, keyboard, and mouse, as well as lack of forearm support and suitable backrest. These led to awkward or constrained postures while some postural problems may be habitual. Three participants reported neck and shoulder discomfort in the past 12 months and 4 reported computer-related discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriate computer workstation settings may have adverse effects on children's postures. More research on workstation setup at home, where children may use their computers the most, is needed. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E

Existing VDT workstations were observed inappropriate for bifocal people facing vision problem, which was analysed thoroughly in simulated laboratory conditions by preparing a test fig with adjustable monitor angle from horizontal. Work posture of VDT operators was assessed with EMG, Photogram Metric Technique, and Centre of Gravity in four stages of test rig. An ergonomics criterion for redesigning VDT workstation was developed. It is appropriate and natural for the man-machine-environment system and also allows comfortable posture and greater efficiency of bifocal and normal VDT operators...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Poor {{quality of}} care is among the causes of high {{maternal}} and newborn disease burden in Tanzania. Potential reason for poor {{quality of care}} is {{the existence of a}} “know-do gap” where by health workers do not perform {{to the best of their}} knowledge. An electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) for maternal health care was piloted in six rural primary health centers of Tanzania to improve performance of health workers by facilitating adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and ultimately improve quality of maternal health care. This study aimed at assessing the cost of installing and operating the system in the health centers. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Lindi, Tanzania. Costs incurred by the project were analyzed using Ingredients approach. These costs broadly included vehicle, <b>computers,</b> <b>furniture,</b> facility, CDSS software, transport, personnel, training, supplies and communication. These were grouped into installation and operation cost; recurrent and capital cost; and fixed and variable cost. We assessed the CDSS in terms of its financial and economic cost implications.

40|$|This design {{research}} {{is focused on}} the integration of different field of theories and these gleams of nowadays. I expect that it will benefit product development and design communication. In the highly competitive globalization and the short life cycle era, the purchase behaviors of customers trend to complexity and diversity. The mass production products can no longer satisfy the market, especially in the mature products such as personal <b>computers,</b> <b>furniture</b> and vehicles. Consequently, based on the advantage of the efficiency and the low cost of mass production, offering personal products and service to achieve different desires become the best policy. Mass Customization is the ability to quickly and efficiently build customized products. These products can be customized for individual customer or niche market. Currently the communication between customers and manufacturers only by texts and 2 D graphic on mass customization, which transfer less information and none-directly perceived through the senses. The 3 D interactivity has being very well developed in game industry recently but not ready for mass customization. This situation leads to the concept of linking up the mass customization with the 3 D interactive media, which provides customers a real time 3 D interactive virtual space and alternative compositions of products. In the virtual space, the customer can go through the show rooms to make purchase decisions by selecting different compositions which they really wants. It will be the trends of product design and design communication among consumers and designers...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The age {{demographic}} {{of the workforce}} is increasing across Europe (Griffiths 1997, Morschhäuser, Sochert 2006, Ilmarinen 2006) and the World (Ross 2010). It is important to investigate the effects of workplace design on healthy ageing. To facilitate this, a questionnaire survey (n= 106) was used to identify workplace opportunities and barriers to working later into life at a major UK construction company {{as part of a}} larger cross-industry study (n= 815 ?). At this company ~ 33 % (n= 29) of respondents were aged ≥ 50. The survey investigated the impacts of workplace equipment and environments on people‟s ability to perform job tasks in relation to age. Participants were asked to respond to statements and questions about; musculoskeletal symptoms, work ability, their work environment, equipment, activities and personal attitudes and experiences towards ageing in the workplace. The survey findings were triangulated by interviewing a sample of workers. At this company, musculoskeletal symptoms peaked for period prevalence in the lower back 44 % (n= 42), followed by the knees 33 % (n= 32). Point prevalence of reported musculoskeletal symptoms was highest in the knees, 24 % (n= 23). Several respondents also directly attributed the symptoms to work tasks. The equipment regularly used to perform job tasks included; <b>computers,</b> <b>furniture,</b> PPE as well as many hand tools. Workplace equipment to perform job tasks, the environment and work activities, can impact on musculoskeletal symptoms experienced by respondents...|$|R
40|$|Sediments and green-lipped mussels, Perna viridis, {{were used}} to {{investigate}} concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in Hong Kong’s marine environment. PBDEs have been used extensively {{over the past two}} decades as flame retardants in polymer additives for a variety of plastics, <b>computers,</b> <b>furniture,</b> building materials, and fabrics. Many measurements of PBDEs in various environmental matrices have been reported from Belgium, Holland, Japan, Europe and North America, but few measurements are available for the southeast Asian region and Hong Kong. PBDE congeners (n = 15) were measured in 13 sediments and nine mussel samples, taken from Hong Kong marine waters. The ? 15 PBDEs in sediments ranged between 1. 7 and 53. 6 ng g - 1 dry wt, with the highest concentrations located around the most heavily populated areas of Victoria Harbour and Sai Kung, while the lowest concentrations of ? 15 PBDEs were found at more remote locations of Sha Tau Kok, Wong Chuk Bay, Castle Peak Bay, and Gold Coast. ? 15 PBDEs ranged from 27. 0 to 83. 7 ng g - 1 dry wt of mussel tissues. Although not identical, most of the congeners in sediments were found in mussel tissues, with BDE- 47, BDE- 99, BDE- 153 and BDE- 183 being the most prominent in both matrices. On the basis of a literature survey, the concentrations of PBDEs reported in Hong Kong sediments and mussel tissues are amongst the highest in the world...|$|R
