Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E

"I find it {{fascinating}} {{that our}} planet still has areas where no modern technology <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>you,</b> {{where you are}} reduced to your most basic - and essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations {{that can lead to}} suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. Ultimately, {{there is no way of}} reconciling these contradictions. All I can do it try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{principles}} that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. Noah, Moses, and Jesus). One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: [...] "Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't worry about Him. [...] If you sin against God, Grace <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>you,</b> but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you." [...] Nonetheless, the [...] "interpretation of this point – that Grace claimed he himself was God – has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and {{only a handful of}} writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside." [...] The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context." [...] The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not [...] "God himself", but merely an [...] "intermediary" [...] and [...] "the path to salvation." ...|$|E

60|$|Answ. Thus: if Christ {{must die}} for sin, then all thy righteousness cannot <b>save</b> <b>thee.</b> 'If righteousness {{come by the}} law, then Christ is dead in vain' (Gal 2:21). By this text it is {{manifest}} that either Christ died in vain, or thy righteousness is vain. If thy righteousness <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>thee,</b> then Christ died in vain; if nothing below or besides the death of Christ could <b>save</b> <b>thee,</b> then thy righteousness is in vain; {{one of the two}} must be cast away, either Christ's or thine. Christ crucified to save the world, discovereth two great evils in man's own righteousness; I mean, when brought for justification and life. 1. It opposeth the righteousness of Christ. 2. It condemneth God of foolishness.|$|R
