Together with the SMI, CONADER also was {{designated}} {{to manage the}} combined tronc <b>commun</b> DDR element and military reform programme. The first post-Sun City military law {{appears to have been}} passed on 12 November 2004, which formally created the new national Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC). Included in this law was article 45, which recognized the incorporation of a number of armed groups into the FARDC, including the former government army Forces Armées Congolaises (FAC), ex-FAZ personnel also known as former President Mobutu's 'les tigres', the RCD-Goma, RCD-ML, RCD-N, MLC, the Mai-Mai, as well as other government-determined military and paramilitary groups.|$|E

The first formal postal service on the islands was established in 1708, with the post office being located at the Casa del <b>Commun</b> Tesoro in Valletta.

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the origins of mail in Malta, but when the island was part of the Kingdom of Sicily mail was carried privately on ships such as speronaras between Malta and Sicily. From 1530 onwards, the Maltese islands (along with Tripoli) were {{administered}} by the Order of Saint John. The earliest known letter is dated 14 June 1532 which was sent from Grand Master l'Isle Adam to the Bishop of Auxerre in France. The first proper postal service was set up by the Order in 1708, and the service was carried out at the Casa del <b>Commun</b> Tesoro (now the Casino Maltese) in Valletta. The first postal markings on Maltese mail appeared later on in the 18th century, sometime between 1755 and 1791.|$|E
25|$|Mercury's {{equatorial}} plane is inclined less than 2° to its orbital plane (Klaasen, 1976; Murray and others, 1981, p. 28); its rotation period of 58.64 terrestrial days is in two- thirds resonance with its orbital period of 87.97 terrestrial days (Colombo, 1965; Colombo and Shapiro, 1966). The resulting lag and orbital eccentricity create {{a variation of}} mean temperature not only with latitude, as on the Earth, but also with longitude. However, because of Mercury's relatively slow rotational period, diurnal variations in temperature probably greatly exceed mean-temperature variations along latitude and longitude, even in the high latitudes. Its pronounced orbital eccentricity (0.2563) causes the apparent solar intensity at Mercury to vary {{by more than a}} factor of 2 throughout a Mercurian year, corresponding to about a 20 percent change in equilibrium temperature. Further, conservation of orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit coupling cause considerable variation in the length of daylight. Dawns and sunsets are prolonged by the long transit time of the Mercurian horizon across the solar disk, so that daylight is lengthened and nighttime reduced by several terrestrial days at sunset and vice versa at sunrise (Robert Wildey, U.S. Geological Survey, oral <b>commun.,</b> 1982). Despite these considerations and despite the daily range in surface temperatures of several hundred kelvins, the subsurface temperature in the polar regions always remains well below freezing (Murray, 1975).|$|E

The second paper, entitled [...] "The Internal Political Organisation of the Congo", compared the merits of Federalism and Unitarianism and proposed that the Congolese adopt one system or the other to ensure the future integrity of their country. After the conference dissolved, the Front <b>Commun</b> accepted the offer of the independence of the [...] "Republic of the Congo" [...] on 30 June 1960.
