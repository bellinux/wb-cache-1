Despite the restrictive 6:30pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious {{problems such as}} teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, eating disorders, alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs, murder, shootings, stabbings, and incest. In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, <b>congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia,</b> and alzheimer's disease. In September 2014, the show featured a natural disaster storyline, in which a tornado descended on Erinsborough and Ramsay Street.|$|E

25|$|A <b>congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> is a {{distinct}} problem, occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births, and requiring pediatric surgery. Intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the diaphragm, posterolateral (in Bochdalek's triangle, resulting in Bochdalek's hernia), or anteromedial-retrosternal (in the cleft of Larrey/Morgagni's foramen, resulting in Morgagni-Larrey hernia, or Morgagni's hernia).|$|E

40|$|T he diaphragm, {{which forms}} an {{anatomical}} wall between the thoracic and abdominal cavities, develops {{in the first}} to fourth months of gestation, along with the body wall muscles, septum transversum, pleuroperitoneal membranes, and mediastinal dorsal me-sentery of the esophagus (1, 2). Congenital disorders of the diaphragm result in fusion defects of the diaphragm or maldevelopment of the gut accompanied by closure of the diaphragm. <b>Congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> are categorized as Bochdalek (posterolateral), Morgagni (anterior-retrosternal), and hi-atal hernias and septum transversum defect. Worldwide, <b>congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> occur in {{one out of every}} 2, 000 – 12, 500 live births (3).

2500|$|Hernias {{may also}} {{occur as a}} result of {{congenital}} malformation, a <b>congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> When the pleuroperitoneal membranes fail to fuse, the diaphragm does not act as an effective barrier between the abdomen and thorax. Herniation is usually of the left, and commonly through the posterior lumbocostal triangle, although rarely through the anterior foramen of Morgagni. The contents of the abdomen, including the intestines, may be present in the thorax, which may impact development of the growing lungs and lead to hypoplasia. This condition is present in 1 out of 2,000 births. [...] A large herniation has a mortality rate of three out of four, and requires immediate surgical repair.|$|E

30|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> are rare; {{most are}} left sided, {{and less than}} 5 % are {{bilateral}} [4].

In right-sided hernias herniation of the liver is nearly always present. Herniation of abdominal structures into the chest leads to different degrees of pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension, and the prognosis depends on these conditions.|$|R
