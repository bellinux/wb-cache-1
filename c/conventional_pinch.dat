With contrast to the <b>conventional</b> <b>Pinch</b> approaches, regional Solid Waste Management (SWM) strategy are often performed via optimisation tool which is often optimized in a "blackbox" optimization mathematical model. However, to enhance understanding and comprehension of the strategy, a visual technique like Pinch Analysis would be vital. A new application of Waste Management Pinch Analysis (WAMPA) for carbon emission was proposed to identify waste management strategies based on specified landfill reduction target and carbon emission target.

40|$|A {{featured}} microchip owning {{three big}} reservoirs and long turned geometry channel {{was designed to}} improve the detection limit of DNA fragments by using floating electrokinetic supercharging (FEKS) method. The novel design matches the FEKS preconcentration needs of a large sample volume introduction with electrokinetic injection (EKI), as well as long duration of isotachophoresis (ITP) process to enrich low concentration sample. In the curved channel [∼ 45. 6 mm long between port 1 (P 1) and the intersection point of two channels], EKI and ITP were performed while the side port 3 (P 3) was electrically floated. The turn-induced band broadening with or without ITP process was investigated by a computer simulation (using CFD-ACE+ software) when the analytes traveling through the U-shaped geometry. It {{was found that the}} channel curvature determined the extent of band broadening, however, which could be effectively eliminated by the way of ITP. After the ITP-stacked zones passed the intersection point from P 1, they were rapidly destacked for separation and detection from ITP to zone electrophoresis by using leading ions from P 3. The FEKS carried on the novel chip successfully contributed to higher sensitivities of DNA fragments in comparison with our previous results realized on either a single channel or a cross microchip. The analysis of low concentration 50 bp DNA step ladders (0. 23 μg∕ml after 1500 -fold diluted) was achieved with normal UV detection at 260 nm. The obtained limit of detections (LODs) were on average 100 times better than using <b>conventional</b> <b>pinched</b> injection, down to several ng∕ml for individual DNA fragment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a new systematic technique for design of heat recovery network with minimum area and exergy loss. This method uses payback period as the decision variable {{to decide the}} best hot and cold stream matches. Based on the payback period, the minimum heat exchanger networks area which yields the minimum exergy loss will be obtained. The proposed technique begins {{with the construction of}} segregated curves on a temperature versus heat load diagram for all process streams to give preliminary information of all possible stream matches. The next step is to set up decision stream match table which uses payback period as the decision variable for streams matching. The final step of the procedure involves optimization the heat exchanger loops and paths. Application of the approach on a case study shows that better results can be achieved in terms of the total cost, utility cost, heat exchanger networks area and exergy loss as compared to the results obtained using <b>conventional</b> <b>Pinch</b> Technique...|$|E
40|$|Pinch {{analysis}} allows {{to determine}} targets and solutions for minimum energy requirements in process plants, basing on innovative tools like composite curves and table problem formulation, which ultimately allow generating an optimized heat exchanger network design. On another hand, this technique {{does not account}} directly {{for a number of}} factors which could play a primary role for the practical feasibility of the network. What if, for instance, once identified an optimal lay-out, we realize that some matches are hardly feasible in practice? Could we adapt the <b>conventional</b> <b>pinch</b> approach to keep into account site topological features since the preliminary design phase? In this paper the authors attempt answering these questions by introducing “Thermal Penalty Factors”, to be calculated for any match by accounting for the capital cost needed to realize it. Appropriate expressions for these penalty factors (in kW) are firstly obtained; successively, these factors are integrated into the composite curves, so as to enable the analyst to account for them since the design phase. A simple case study is adopted to highlight the potential of thermal penalty factors in contributing to achieve more reliable targets...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} is currently {{one of the}} greatest challenges for chemical process industries world wide and especially in oil refineries and chemical industries. Reducing energy consumption and using energy more efficiently is becoming increasingly important, as the impact of energy use on the environment, and the need for reduced cost of production becomes vital. Utilizing Process Integration (PI) techniques for both new and retrofit plant designs enables the process engineer to create efficient energy recovery systems with lower production cost and improved environmental performance. Among the energy recovery systems, heat exchanger networks are of great importance. In process integration, heat exchanger networks are synthesized and retrofitted using two methods which are the Pinch Technology method and the Mathematical Programming method. Despite its success, <b>conventional</b> <b>Pinch</b> Technology methods face serious criticisms. Much of these criticisms related to the complexities in the resultant structure of the heat exchanger networks. The complexity in the network is brought about by the fast development in Pinch technology without taking into consideration the ease of plant operation. These complex HENs make the plant operators face difficulties in understanding where individual streams were going. The criticisms can be removed by decomposing the overall problem into a number of sub-problems associated with specific parts of the process under consideration. Decomposing the problem has major benefits; o It will allow the designer to produce energy-efficient network structures that are simple. o It will control piping costs and avoid the hazards associated with over-integration. o It will simplify the network design and retrofit processes. o It will avoid the need for sophisticated network-optimization procedures o It can be employed using any process-integration targeting software. This has implications for software vendors and purchasers In this study, the “Problem Decomposition” method (also called “Structural Targeting” method) based on Pinch Technology was applied to retrofit existing heat exchanger networks which were retrofitted using the traditional Pinch Technology retrofit method. The example networks were selected from published scientific papers. At {{the end of the study}} a comparison between the results of the two retrofit methods was made. Three case studies were selected for this purpose; a Crude Distillation Unit and two Pulp & Paper plants. The heat exchanger networks of these plants were originally retrofitted using the traditional retrofit method. The results obtained after the application of the Problem Decomposition retrofit method to these case studies, showed much better results in the final retrofitted heat exchanger networks compared to the results that obtained by using the traditional method. The criteria on which the comparison was based are : • The amount of savings in hot utility consumption • The payback period on the capital investment due to the addition of new heat transfer area to the existing heat exchanger networks or due to the installation of new heat exchangers • The structure of the final retrofitted heat exchanger networks • The simplicity of the design phase and the ability of the designer to interact with the analysis and design phases during the retrofit design work...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{air-cooled}} absorption cycles {{appropriate for}} residential applications has been problematic. This study examines an ammonia-water triple effect cycle {{known as the}} kangaroo cycle, and investigates its limitations when used as an air-cooled space air conditioner. The triple effect absorption processes were modeled and a methodology for optimizing the design was developed. The arrangement and relative sizes of the heat exchangers thermally coupling {{the upper and lower}} loops were studied. The thermal coupling involves the upper rectifier, condenser, and absorber rejecting heat to the lower generator. Contrary to other triple effect studies, internal generator heat exchangers were incorporated in both the upper and lower generators and their optimum relative positions were studied. Also, errors of up to 150 percent were shown to result from <b>conventional</b> LMTD and <b>pinch</b> point analysis due to the highly non-linear temperature-enthalpy relationship in the upper condenser. Three configurations for the upper heat exchangers coupling the upper loop to the lower generator were analyzed, and their relative sizes were optimized. The cycle’s performance was shown to depend on the exit temperature of the lower loop generator, and the COP optimization was demonstrated with respect to this design variable. Operation at air-cooled ambient conditions was investigated. At lower ambient temperatures that are heavily weighted in air conditioning rating standards, the efficiency is very favorable. Equipment development and cost issues need to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report for {{contract}} DE-FG 03 - 99 ER 54528, ''Computational Support for Alternative Confinement Concepts''. Progress {{was made in the}} following areas of investigation: (1) Extensive studies of the confinement properties of <b>conventional</b> Reversed-field <b>Pinch</b> (RFP) configurations (i. e., without current profile control) were performed in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. These studies were carried out using the full 3 -dimensional, finite-{beta}, resistive MHD model in the DEBS code, including ohmic heating and anisotropic heat conduction, and thus for the first time included the self-consistent effects of the dynamo magnetic fluctuations on the confinement properties of the RFP. By using multi-variant regression analysis of these results, scaling laws for various properties characterizing the conventional RFP were obtained. In particular, it was found that the, for constant ratio of I/N (where I is the current and N = na{sup 2 } is the line density), and over a range of Lundquist numbers S that approaches 10 {sup 6 }, the fluctuations scale as {delta}B/B {approx} S{sup - 0. 14 }, the temperature scales as T {approx} I{sup 0. 56 }, the poloidal beta scales as {beta}{sub {theta}} {approx} I{sup - 0. 4 }, and the energy confinement time scales as {tau}{sub E} {approx} I{sup 0. 34 }. The degradation of poloidal beta with current {{is a result of the}} weak scaling of the fluctuation level with the Lundquist number, and leads to the unfavorable scaling laws for temperature and energy confinement time. These results compare reasonably well with experimental data, and emphasize the need for external control of the dynamo fluctuations in the RFP. (2) Studies of feedback stabilization of resistive wall modes in the RFP were performed with the DEBS code in collaboration with the CNR/RFX group in Padua, Italy. The ideal growth rates are ''passively'' reduced by the presence of a resistive wall within the radius for perfectly conducting wall stabilization of these modes. In this work we consider cases with up to two resistive walls. Moreover the feedback system is assumed to react to any given Fourier harmonic with an ideal response, in the sense that no spurious harmonics are generated. Successful feedback schemes are shown to be possible. However, a careful choice of the gains, along with the simultaneous feedback on at least 4 or 5 modes, is found to be necessary. (3) Studies of a stable rampdown operating regime for the RFP were performed in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Wisconsin. It was found that completely stable mean profiles can be obtained by properly tailoring the decaying time dependence of the toroidal current and magnetic flux. Deviations from optimal decay rates were shown to lead to single helicity (SH) and quasi-single helicity (QSH) states. In all cases the prospects for improved confinement properties were obtained. These results may account for the experimental observation of QSH states when the toroidal current is allowed to decay...|$|R
