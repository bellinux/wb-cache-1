It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply had to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jayson Rodriguez for MTV News, da Don explained how he conceptualized the song, saying [...] "I came from a Jerry Bruckheimer meeting after seeing the movie, and they were telling us all the music they needed for all the scenes and the characters. So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' It was crazy, because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one.</b> Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} {{throughout}} the novel involves the natural human propensity {{to search for}} meaning with the constant risk of apophenia. Followers of the seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are revealed to be victims of apophenia as the clips are just edited surveillance camera footage. Likewise, Cayce's mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after Cayce's father disappears. Science fiction critic Thomas Wagner underscores the desire for meaning, or pattern recognition, using a comparison between the film clips and Cayce's search for her father after the attacks: he very randomness and ineffability of the clips {{flies in the face}} of our natural human tendency towards pattern recognition ... he subculture that surrounds [...] "following the footage" ... an effective plot device for underscoring the novel's post-9/11 themes: to wit, the uncertainty of the fabric of day-to-day life people began to feel following that event … [...] as people don't like uncertainty, don't like knowing that there's something we can't comprehend. And if we can't fit something into an existing pattern, then by golly we'll <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one.</b> Within the marketing world, Cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel, but rather a paragon of the system. Inescapably within the system, she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns. The review in The Village Voice calls this search [...] "a survival tactic within the context of no context—dowsing for meaning, and sometimes settling for the illusion of meaning".|$|E
500|$|In the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, the Chicago Cubs are {{depicted}} as the 2015 World Series champions, defeating a fictional American League team from Miami (the Miami Marlins {{had not yet}} been formed), whose mascot is an alligator. Screenwriter Bob Gale, who co-wrote the script of Back to the Future Part II, originally intended it as a joke, saying [...] "Being a baseball fan, I thought, 'OK, let's <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the most unlikely scenarios we can think of'", referencing both the Cubs' long championship drought, and the fact that Florida did not have a baseball team in 1989. He also explained the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time, and thus could have been accurate had MLB not added the Division Series in 1994 (but not played until 1995 due to the strike) and the Wild Card Game in 2012. Had the predicted schedule held, Chicago would have swept the Miami team in the World Series with the Series starting October 17th. In the actual 2015 postseason, the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series, but were eliminated in four games. Coincidentally, the final game of the NLCS took place on October 21, the same date as the fictional events of Back to the Future Part II. While the film's prediction proved to be incorrect, the Cubs did win the following year's World Series, marking an end to the team's 108-year championship drought.|$|E

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding peer pressure. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board Blue Midget being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one,</b> Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer {{in an attempt to}} escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to Red Dwarf.|$|E
2500|$|In {{creating}} {{the world of}} Rapture, Levine imagined a utopia that its creators {{did not want the}} outside world to discover. Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a [...] "pseudo-objectivism and extremely capitalistic view on the world" [...] as well as a fear of the New Dealers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from Art Deco, describing the style as, [...] "Yes, we are men, and we control the universe!" [...] He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as Howard Hughes and Ayn Rand, though comparing him to John Galt, a character in Rand's Atlas Shrugged, in that he is more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts. Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection. During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated {{that he did not want}} to kill Ryan, asking Levine, [...] "Are still (sic) doomed to make games where we have to use plot devices to clean that up?" [...] to which Levine responded that video games were admittedly linear, saying that it was hard enough to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> good plot, let alone multiple ones. Levine stated that he did not expect the [...] "ugly comedown from the stratospheric highs" [...] from the Andrew Ryan scene near the end.|$|E

60|$|When I see a fox {{run across}} the pond on the snow, with the {{carelessness}} of freedom, or at intervals trace his course in the sunshine along the ridge of a hill, I give up to him sun and earth as to their true proprietor. He does not go in the sun, {{but it seems to}} follow him, and there is a visible sympathy between him and it. Sometimes, when the snow lies light, and but five or six inches deep, you may give chase and <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> on foot. In such a case he will show a remarkable presence of mind, choosing only the safest direction, though he may lose ground by it. Notwithstanding his fright, he will take no step which is not beautiful. His pace is a sort of leopard canter, as if he were in nowise impeded by the snow, but were husbanding his strength all the while. When the ground is uneven, the course is a series of graceful curves, conforming to the shape of the surface. He runs as though there were not a bone in his back. Occasionally dropping his muzzle to the ground for a rod or two, and then tossing his head aloft, when satisfied of his course. When he comes to a declivity, he will put his forefeet together, and slide swiftly down it, shoving the snow before him. He treads so softly that you would hardly hear it from any nearness, and yet with such expression {{that it would not be}} quite inaudible at any distance.|$|E
