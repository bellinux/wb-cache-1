40|$|Two {{families}} are described, {{each with a}} unique clinical variant of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. Dominant type I PXE {{is characterized by a}} classical flexurally distributed rash, severe and frequent angina of effort, intermittent claudication and hypertension, and a very severe <b>choroidoretinitis,</b> often complicated by blindness. Dominant type II PXE, on the other hand, is a much milder form of the disease, with a macular rash (though identical histological changes), no vascular changes, and a very mild retinal degeneration, which does not progress to either blindness or <b>choroidoretinitis.</b> Younger members of these families often have prominent choroidal vessels. Formal analysis of the two pedigrees and all the pooled genetic data supported the autosomal dominant transmission of both these traits...|$|E
40|$|In a forest-saving mosaic zone of {{south-eastern}} Nigeria endemic for onchocerciasis, {{we identified}} eye disorders in 65. 5 % of a randomly selected population sample. Onchocerciasis-related eye disease {{was present in}} 13. 7 % of the study sample and constituted 21 % {{of the total number}} of eye disorders. A total of 78 (33. 2 %) of 235 subjects with visual impairment had onchocerciasis-related eye lesions, and of 35 who were blind in both eyes, onchocerciasis-induced eye disease was the cause in 28 (80 %). The prevalence of bilateral blindness from all causes in the study area was 4. 1 %, while that from onchocerciasis-related causes was 3. 3 %. The commonest onchocerciasis-induced lesions that were responsible for visual impairment and blindness were <b>choroidoretinitis</b> and optic nerve disease. Sclerosing keratitis, an important causative lesion in onchocerciasis-endemic savanna regions, was encountered only one. Eye disease is therefore an important feature of onchocerciasis in the forest-savanna mosaic areas of Nigeria and should be borne in mind when planning and executing control programmes...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 885 blood and stool samples of four main {{protozoan}} parasitic infections were retrospectively reviewed from January, 2000 to April, 2004. Eleven of the 1, 350 stool samples were shown positive for Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections; {{one of the}} 5 cases was clinically diagnosed as gastrointestinal cryptosporidiosis, while 6 cases were giardiasis. In patients with giardiasis, children were among the high-risk groups, making up 66. 7 of these patients. The common presenting signs and symptoms were: diarrhea (83. 3), loss of appetite (83. 3), lethargy (83. 3), fever (66. 7), nausea/vomiting (50. 0), abdominal pain (16. 7), dehydration (16. 7) and rigor and chills (16. 7). Metronidazole was the drug of choice and was given to all symptomatic patients (83. 3). For the blood samples, 28 of the 92 peripheral smears for Plasmodium spp infection were diagnosed as malaria. The age range was from 4 to 57, with a median of 32. 5 years. The sex ratio (M:F) was 3. 6 : 1, while {{the age group of}} 30 - 44 years was the most commonly affected in both sexes. The majority of patients were foreigners (60. 7) and non-professional (39). Plasmodium vivax (71) infection was the most common pathogen found in these patients, along with a history of traveling to an endemic area of malaria (31). The predominant presenting signs and symptoms were: fever (27), rigor and chills (24), nausea/vomiting (15) and headache (8). Chloroquine and primaquine was the most common anti-malarial regimen used (78. 6) in these patients. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in different groups was 258 / 443 (58) : seropositive for IgG 143 (32. 3); IgM 67 (15); and IgG + IgM 48 (10. 8). The age range was from 1 to 85, with a mean of 34 (+/- SD 16. 6) years. The predominant age group was 21 to 40 years (126; 28. 4). The sex ratio (M:F) was 1. 2 : 1. Subjects were predominantly male (142; 32) and the Malay (117; 26. 4). Of these, 32 cases were clinically diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis. The range of age was from 10 to 56 years with a mean of 30. 5 (+/- SD 12. 05) years. The sex ratio (M:F) was 1 : 1. 7. The majority were in the age group of 21 to 40 years, female (20; 62. 5), and Malay (17; 53). They were also single (16; 50), unemployed (12; 37), and resided outside Kuala Lumpur (21; 65. 6). The more common clinical presentations were blurring of vision (25; 78), floaters (10; 31) and pain in the eye (7; 22). We found that funduscopic examination (100) and seropositivity for anti-Toxoplasma antibodies (93. 7) were the main reasons for investigation. <b>Choroidoretinitis</b> was the most common clinical diagnosis (69), while clindamycin was the most frequently used antimicrobial in all cases. Among HIV-infected patients, 10 cases were diagnosed as AIDS-related toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) (9 were active and 1 had relapse TE). In addition, 1 case was confirmed as congenital toxoplasmosis...|$|E
