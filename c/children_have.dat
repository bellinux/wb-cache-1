5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that <b>children</b> <b>have</b> not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the <b>children</b> <b>have</b> consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends <b>children</b> <b>had,</b> and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age had more friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted <b>children</b> also <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends and low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if <b>children</b> <b>had</b> at least one friend, they had more positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores.

5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in <b>children</b> <b>have</b> had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
