The Supreme Court concluded that “a national bank [...] [...] [...] is a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.” The Supreme Court, however, left open the possibility that a national bank may also be a <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state in which it has its principal place of business, thus putting it on an equal footing with a state-formed corporation.
