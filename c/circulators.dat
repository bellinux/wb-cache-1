40|$|In this article, a very crucial {{subject is}} discussed, {{which is the}} three ports active <b>circulator</b> {{transmission}} lines delayed in time stability analysis. Our circuit is a reflection type phase shifter (RTPS), employing a <b>circulator.</b> Micro strip transmission lines have three ports active <b>circulator,</b> with stability analysis under time delayed. Many radio frequency (RF) systems use active <b>circulator</b> as a passive non-reciprocal three- or four-port device, in which microwave or radio frequency power entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). Micro strip transmission lines feed those active <b>circulator</b> ports and face a delay parasitic effect of transferring signals in time. These <b>circulator's</b> micro strip transmission lines delays cause the system to instability. Due to parasitic effects of active <b>circulator's</b> micro strip transmission lines, there is delay in time for input/output RF signals which result in system instability. We define active <b>circulator's</b> micro strip transmission lines delays τ 1 for the first port current and τ 3 for the third port current. Accordingly, active <b>circulator's</b> micro strip transmission lines delays Δ 1 for the first port current derivative and Δ 3 for the third port current derivative. We have four delays in time τ 1, τ 2, Δ 1, Δ 3 and discuss sub case where separately delays are equal to zero (τ 1 =τ 2 =τ and Δ 1 =Δ 3 = 0) which describe most of active <b>circulator</b> parasitic effects. The three active <b>circulator</b> ports delayed in time equivalent circuit with micro strip segments can be represented as a delayed differential equation which depends on variable parameters and delays. The investigation of our active <b>circulator</b> element with micro strip lines system differential equation is based on stability switching. Active <b>circulator</b> with transmission lines stability switching analysis is done under different time delays with respect to <b>circulator</b> inputs/outputs currents and currents derivative. All of that is for optimization of a three port active <b>circulator</b> equivalent circuit parameters analysis with micro strip transmission lines {{to get the best}} performance. Ofer Alu...|$|R

25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas <b>circulators,</b> and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned.
