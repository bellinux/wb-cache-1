5|$|<b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command did not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the <b>central</b> <b>area,</b> the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the <b>central</b> <b>area,</b> which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF planned four area {{commands}} initially: Southern Area, {{covering all}} units in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia {{and the southern}} Riverina district of New South Wales; <b>Central</b> <b>Area,</b> covering units in New South Wales except southern Riverina and {{the north of the}} state; Western Area, covering units in Western Australia; and Northern Area, covering units in northern New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua. The first two commands established, in March 1940, were Southern Area, which essentially took over the role and headquarters of No.1 Group in Melbourne, and <b>Central</b> <b>Area,</b> which evolved from No.2 Group in Sydney. Western and Northern Areas eventually followed in January and May 1941, respectively; pending their formation, units in Queensland were temporarily controlled by <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command, and those in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Papua came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF's {{area command}} {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the Air Board proposed carving a new <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland. Once again, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E

40|$|Note: Missing Page 166. This thesis {{will deal}} with the <b>Central</b> <b>Areas</b> of Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, London and Quebec from a {{structure}} and form point of view. The first part provides a historical background {{of the development of}} the <b>Central</b> <b>Areas.</b> The second part deals with the theory of <b>Central</b> <b>Areas,</b> basically divided into two sections: the first section discusses theories of the structure: land use functions and the forces behind these functions; the second section deals with the form: physical structure and external visual qualities. The main statement is that the form {{is the result of the}} structure. This second part will give background to the third part, explaining and complementing it from a theory point of view. The third part is the actual study of the <b>Central</b> <b>Areas</b> of Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, London and Quebec, recording existing conditions in 1950 and 1962 and describing future plans. The fourth part will discuss the findings...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the countless}} urban {{planning}} and management challenges in Brazil nowadays, two have been subject of concern and debate: reversion of the great housing deficit in Brazilian cities through housing and requalification of <b>central</b> <b>areas</b> in large and medium-sized cities through effective use of local infrastructure, use diversification and building recycling. The environmental building recycling issue links itself to the <b>central</b> <b>areas</b> requalification debate because of the ever-growing common appreciation of existing building preservation. This research goal is {{to contribute to the}} development of guidelinesand parameters to urban interventions in urban <b>central</b> <b>areas</b> located next to protected historic sites in order to enable public housing provision without any prejudice to the rehabilitation efforts towards these sites...|$|R

Within the <b>central</b> <b>area</b> of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Down Street {{was one of}} the {{stations}} suggested for closure in connection with the extension of the Piccadilly line: the elimination of less-busy stations in the <b>central</b> <b>area</b> would improve both reliability and journey times for long-distance commuters. Additionally, the neighbouring stations were being rebuilt with escalators in place of lifts and their new entrances were even nearer to Down Street, further squeezing its catchment area. The station was permanently closed on 21 May 1932.|$|E

5|$|Religion was an {{important}} part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony.

5|$|The area {{commands}} {{and their}} responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands {{to begin with}} in 1940–41: Southern Area, <b>Central</b> <b>Area,</b> Western Area, and Northern Area. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two groups that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; <b>Central</b> <b>Area</b> itself was disbanded {{and most of its}} units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed No.2 (Training) Group. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War; Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, Northern Command, was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{area of the}} Theban hills {{is subject}} to {{infrequent}} violent thunder storms, causing flash floods in the valley. Recent {{studies have shown that}} there are at least seven active flood stream beds leading down into the <b>central</b> <b>area</b> of the valley. This <b>central</b> <b>area</b> appears to have been flooded {{at the end of the}} Eighteenth Dynasty, with several tombs buried under metres of debris. The tombs KV63, KV62, and KV55 are dug into the actual wadi bedrock rather than the debris, showing that the level of the valley was five meters below its present level. After this event later dynasties leveled the floor of the valley, making the floods deposit their load further down the valley, and the buried tombs were forgotten and only discovered in the early 20th century. This was the area that was the subject of the Amarna Royal Tombs Project ground scanning radar investigation, which showed several anomalies, one of which was proved to be KV63.|$|E
