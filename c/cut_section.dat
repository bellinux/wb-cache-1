500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{in and around}} Cardiff between June and July 2007 {{as part of the}} second {{production}} block of the series. The production team used the episode to expand Rhys' role in the series, due to their appreciation of actor Kai Owen's performances in the first series and the contention of executive producer [...] Russell T Davies that the character should be seen as less of a [...] "sap" [...] in the second series. The alien [...] "space whale" [...] seen in the episode was created using computer-generated imagery, {{with the exception of a}} <b>cut</b> <b>section</b> wound where the humans had been carving meat from. Tregenna characterised the monster as resembling [...] "a giant kebab". A more elaborate design was previously considered, but both Tregenna and Davies felt that this would detract from the alien's suitability to the plot.|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is {{also about}} the fear of death. The section cut from the story {{highlights}} Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the <b>cut</b> <b>section,</b> later published as [...] "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is [...] "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced the grisly reality of death, which can have done [...] "little to assuage Nick's fears." [...] Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally vague {{about the details of}} the birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely [...] "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".|$|E

2500|$|Aderca's {{original}} contribution to literature {{came in the}} form of lyric poetry. His five volumes of poems, published between 1910 and 1912, were noted by Crohmălniceanu for their [...] "intellectualized sensualism", with introspective methods that were ahead of their time. However, Crohmălniceanu also suggests that their <b>cut</b> <b>section</b> of the early 20th century Romanian lexis renders these works dated. Similarly, Călinescu discussed Aderca's love poetry as being dominated by [...] "suggestions" [...] and [...] "sensations", but without [...] "sentiment". The most important of Aderca's lyrical work, he notes, was to be found elsewhere, in [...] "pantheistic" [...] poems rather like those by Ion Barbu, where focus shits toward the great expanses of the cosmos or the mineral world. As noted by Pârvulescu, Aderca's other contributions in the field, in Versuri pentru Monica, falls into the category of [...] "society games" [...] that merely exercise his versification skills.|$|E

40|$|The hyphal healing {{mechanism}} (HHM) {{has been}} shown to differ between Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae. However, this process has not been considered under (severe) physical stress conditions. Scutellospora reticulata and Glomus clarum strains were cultured monoxenically. The impact of long distance separating cut extremities of hyphae and of multiple injuries within hyphae on the HHM was monitored. For long distances (> 5000 mu m) separating cut extremities, hyphae healing was observed in half the cases in S. reticulata and was absent in G. clarum. For multiple-injured hyphae, the HHM was always oriented towards the complete recovery of hyphae integrity in S. reticulata, while in G. clarum, the growing hyphal tips (GHTs) could indifferently reconnect <b>cut</b> <b>sections,</b> by-pass <b>cut</b> <b>sections</b> or develop into the environment. Hyphae behaviour under severe physical stress clearly differentiated S. reticulata from G. clarum, suggesting that both fungi have developed different strategies for colony growth to survive under adverse conditions...|$|R
