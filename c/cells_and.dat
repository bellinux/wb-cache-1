While the vital role of <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> actin fibre orientation has been demonstrated in various studies and across many cell-types, extracting this information from microscopy images is a challenging task. Although several methods {{have been developed to}} quantify alignment of a <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> its actin fibres from experimental images, all of them differ at one step or the other. We highlight the importance of orientation of <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> associated fibres and present a generic scheme of various approaches to assimilate the widely used methods. We have presented a systematic approach to determine <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> fibre orientation. The study will improve our understanding of the core processes and will also help in development of high throughput imaging methods to extract information from experimental images...|$|R

Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats.

Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with the micromechanical modelling of closed-cell polymeric foams (M 130) using Laguerre tessellation models incorporated with realistic foam <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness distributions. The <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness distributions of the foam were measured from microscope images. The Young&# 039;s modulus of cell wall material of the foam was characterised by nanoindentation tests. It is {{found that when}} the <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness {{are assumed to be}} uniform in the models, the Kelvin, Weaire-Phelan and Laguerre models overpredict the stiffness of the foam. However, the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus predicted by the Laguerre models incorporating measured foam <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness distributions agree well with the experimental data. This emphasizes the fact that the integration of realistic <b>cell</b> wall <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> size variations is vital for foam modelling. Subsequently the effects of <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness variations on the stiffness of closed-cell foams were investigated using Laguerre models. It is found that the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus decrease with increasing <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness variations. The degree of stiffness variation of closed-cell foams resulting from the <b>cell</b> size dispersion <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness dispersion are comparable. There is little interaction between the <b>cell</b> size variation <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness variation as far as their effects on foam moduli are concerned. Based on the simulation results, expressions incorporating <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness variations were formulated for predicting the stiffness of closed-cell foams. Lastly, a simple spring system model was proposed to explain the effects of <b>cell</b> size <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickness variations on the stiffness of cellular structures...|$|R
