The microchannel is fabricated with one soft wall, {{so that there is}} a spontaneous transition to turbulence, and thereby enhanced mixing, when the flow Reynolds number increases beyond a critical value. The objective of the study is to examine whether the nanoparticle size and polydispersity can be modified by enhancing the mixing in the microchannel device. The flow rates are varied in order to study nanoparticle formation both in laminar flow and in the chaotic flow after transition, and the molar ratio of the <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> to tannic acid is also varied to study the effect of molar ratio on nanoparticle size. The formation of gold nanoparticles is examined by UV-visual spectroscopy and the size distribution is determined using scanning electron microscopy. The synthesized nanoparticles size decreases from a parts per thousand yen 6 nm to a parts per thousand currency sign 4 nm when the molar ratio of <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> to tannic acid is increased from 1 to 20. It is found that there is no systematic variation of nanoparticle size with flow velocity, and the nanoparticle size is not altered when the flow changes from laminar to turbulent.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the nature of}} <b>Chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> and its potassium salt, has been carried out, with the object of ascertaining certain properties of the complex ions present in aqueous solutions of these compounds. 1. The normal potential was determined at 25 °C. by measuring the potential of gold electrodes in solutions containing a known concentration of the complex compound, {{in the presence of a}} measured excess of chloride ions. The values of the normal potential were calculated from the equation, where the symbols have their usual meaning. The mean values of were found to be 1. 0066 volts and 1. 0055 volts at 25 °, from measurement of the acid and salt respectively. The value of this constant previously determined by Bjerrum and Kirschner Is 1. 001 volts at 17 ° 0. 2. The formulae of the complex ions existing in solutions containing different concentrations of the complex compound, in the presence of varying excess of chloride ions, were calculated by the method of Bodlander. The results obtained indicate that the complex AuCl is the stable ion in solutions containing 0. 1, 0. 02 and 0. 01 M <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid,</b> in the presence of 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid. With greater concentration of the latter, the higher complex AuCl is produced, whilst in dilute solutions containing a small proportion of free chloride ions, hydrolysis occurs. The ion AuCl preponderates In solutions of 0. 02 Mpotassium chloraurate containing 0. 02 and 0. 04 M potassium chloride: no evidence was obtained, for the existence of higher complexes in solutions of this compound. 5. The stability constant of the aurichloride ion, was determined from E. M.

40|$|Gold-silver alloy {{nanoparticles}} {{with varying}} mole fractions are prepared {{in aqueous solution}} by the co-reduction of <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> HAuCl 4 and silver nitrate AgNO 3 with sodium citrate. As the optical absorption spectra of their solutions show only one plasmon absorption it is concluded that mixing of gold and silver leads to a homogeneous formation of alloy nanoparticles. The maximum of the plasmon band blue-shifts linearly with increasing silver content. This fact cannot be explained by a simple linear combination of the dielectric constants of gold and silver within the Mie theory. On the other hand, the extinction coefficient is found to decrease exponentially rather than linearly with increasing gold mole fraction xAu. Furthermore, the size distribution of the alloy nanoparticles is examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

40|$|Abstract. Methanotrophic {{physiology}} {{is strongly}} {{affected by the}} amount of bioavailable copper, which regulates the enzymes used by methanotrophs to oxidize methane. Methanobactin is a small peptide secreted by methanotrophic bacteria that binds copper outside of the bacterial cell. In this study, gold nanoparticles were firstly synthesized with citrate acid, followed by addition of methanobactin. Then as CuSO 4 was continuously added to the solution, we found a red shift in the Uv-vis absorption spectra. Meanwhile, for the mixture of methanobactin, 1, 4 -resorcinol and <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid,</b> we also found an absorption at 540 nm after 1 h in dark. We presume that methanobactin has the bioactivity of protecting gold nanoparticles as well as delivering electron for the catalytic synthesis of gold nanoparticles. These molecules then go on to form gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles can be seen with the naked eye, as they turn a gold solution from yellow/gold to a deep cranberry/red. The nanoparticles also display a characteristic absorbance of approximately 540 nm on absorption spectra...|$|E

The syringe pump supplied a different flow rate which led to a variety of residence time. The blender and oil bath supported a stable temperature condition. The PTFE micro-reactor capillary (inside diameter: 750 μl; length: 100 cm), which is stable in the chemical reagents and can withstand moderate temperatures (up to 350 °C), was coiled in oil bath. The structure of capillary enhanced the mass and heat transfer; moreover, it saved the space. Au-Ag colloid was collected in a collector and, then, separated by centrifuge (8, 000 rpm, 10 min). The average size distribution of Au-Ag alloy was obtained by the statistical calculation of more than 150 particles from different parts of the grid.|$|E
40|$|International @ MATERIAUX+GUR:CLA:ADM:SMR:JECInternational audienceDevelopment of new {{catalysts}} {{to improve}} industrially important chemical reactions {{in terms of}} activity and selectivity, in environmentally more acceptable means and economical matter {{is one of the}} most important needs in research. Heterogeneous catalysis has shown its potential over the last years with the discovery of new catalysts easy to separate from the reaction medium. Today, nanoparticles, and particulary gold clusters, are considered as the most exciting materials in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface/volume ratio allowing for a high numbers of catalytically active sites. Nevertheless, the main problem associated with the use of nanoparticles-based catalysts is their dispersion. When particles form stable colloidal solution, they show good activity and dispersion, but once exhausted, they are difficult to regenerate. In contrast, when nanoparticles are immobilized on a support they are easier to regenerate and still remain in a dispersed state, but these composites exhibit a lower accessible surface area, due to the support, that thus limits their inherent effectivity and in general the support effect is not negligible. To overcome these limitations, we develop new nanostructured materials by using the concept of self-assembly of nanoparticles directed by organic linkers to generate multifunctional hybrid materials with a high number of catalytic centers. To connect gold nanoparticles and prevent their aggregation, we use functionalized hexa-adduct fullerenes as 3 D rigid and defined nodes. [1, 2] Our recent results show that thiocyanate-functionnalized hexaadduct fullerenes can be coupled by direct reaction from <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> and LiBH 4 as a reducing agent and in the presence of 4 -aminothiophenol. This new material has been characterized by small angles XR scattering, TEM and spectroscopy and show the formation of a network with monodisperse 2 nm gold particles and an interparticular distance of 4 nm corresponding to the functionalized fullerene molecules (figure 1). In this presentation we will also discuss the influence of the terminal functions of the hexaadduct fullerenes and the different synthetic pathways on the formation of the networks. 1) Fortgang, P.; Maisonhaute, E.; Amatore, C.; Delavaux-Nicot, B.; Lehl, J.; Nierengarten, J. -F.

40|$|Initially, {{the issue}} of massive drug {{delivery}} deep into tumor tissue has been addressed. For this purpose dual stimuli-responsive polyplex micelles systems have been designed from self-assembly of anionic block copolymers and platinum(IV) -conjugated cationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM-Pt(IV)) dendrimer prodrugs as a drug delivery. In anionic block copolymer, charge conversion occurs in response to mild acidic environment at tumor site (pH ~ 6. 8). As {{a result of the}} charge conversion, there occur an electrostatic repulsion which permitting rapid disassembly of the polyplex micelle. Due to disassembly of the polymer micelles, PAMAM-Pt(IV) prodrug is released in the form of individual molecules, exert deep penetration and well-dispersion activity in the tumor tissue by virtue of its small size and high mobility. Furthermore, the well-dispersed positively charged PAMAM dendrimers having high affinity toward the negatively charged cellular membrane which help them to efficiently internalize into the tumor cells, followed by release of active cisplatin drug in the reductive cytosol. This anticancer drug delivery platform provides a unique two-step delivery of anticancer drug for pursuit of deep tumor tissue penetration and overcoming drug resistance. Later on multi-responsive poly(NIPAM-co-DMAEMA) microgels are synthesized by free radical emulsion polymerization. Swelling and deswelling properties of the prepared microgels are investigated in response to change in pH and temperature of the system. The prepared microgels show a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at about 34 °C and pKa value of 7. 3 for DMAEMA monomer. The microgels are used as microreactor as well as scaffold for gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). Different parameters like temperature, concentration of Au-NPs and content ratio of DMAEMA monomers are studied to show their effect on size and volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of poly(NIPAM-co-DMAEMA) microgels. It is observed that the microgel particle size decreases with increase in all of the above mentioned parameter. Optical properties of Au-NPs are studied by UV-Visible spectroscopy and red shift is observed both with increase in concentration of <b>chlorauric</b> <b>acid</b> and sodium borohydride, respectively. Similarly red shift is observed by increasing temperature of Au-NPs loaded microgel composite in the range of 25 to 50 °C. Moreover, poly(NIPAM-coDMAEMA) /Au-NPs composites can act as excellent catalyst for reduction of 4 -nitrophenol and the catalytic activity of the composite microgel can be controlled by changing temperature of the system. Onward the synthesized cross-linked polymer microgels are doped with a fluorescent dye by free radical emulsion polymerization. Thermo-responsive behavior and microenviroment of the dye doped microgel particles are studied by fluorescence and optical transmittance. It is observed that turbidity of the microgel system start to increase after VPTT due to shrinkage of the microgel network. A dramatic increase in relative fluorescence intensity and wavelength at maximum fluorescence intensity (?max) also occur due to increase in hydrophobic environment around the dye molecules with shrinkage of the microgel system. The poly(NIPAM-co-DMAEMA-co-NBDAA) microgel particles are used for in-situ synthesis of Au-NPs which results in fluorescent quenching of the microgels through Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) process. The morphology of microgels is observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At the end a novel ferric-phosphate induced shape memory (SM) hydrogels are synthesized by one-step copolymerization of isopropenyl phosphonic acid (IPPA) and acrylamide (AM) {{in the presence of a}} cross-linker. The synthesized Shape Memory (SM) Hydrogel is different from traditional ones as our system can be modified into various shapes and can be recovered to its original shape by using different external conditions such as reducing agent or a competitive complexing agent. This unique feature is due to the reason that ferric ions show a high affinity for complexation with phosphate groups of IPPA, which acts as a physical cross-linker to form the secondary networks within the hydrogels to induce the shape memory effect which is totally reversible...|$|E
