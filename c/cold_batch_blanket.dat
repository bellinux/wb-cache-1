40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three dimensional {{study of a}} gas-fired, regenerative, side-port glass melting furnace. The furnace {{is divided into three}} regions: combustion space, glass tank and <b>batch</b> <b>blanket.</b> The combustion space is simulated separately, while the glass tank and the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> are coupled together as a whole. To couple the three regions, a new method is proposed that is more flexible and faster than the existing conventional methods. The melting process of the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket,</b> the natural convection vortices of the glass tank and the turbulence and the chemical reactions of the combustion space are all simulated. The simulation was preformed using Gambit- 2 and Fluent- 6 software. The calculated temperatures are compared with actual values measured at different locations on the furnace surfaces. Results indicate that the maximum relative error is less than 7. 6 %. This work can form the basis for the parametric analysis of the furnace to reduce its fuel consumptio...|$|R

The results of mathematical modelling provide conditions under which the character of the melt flow can be set up and quantity space utilization is used for the quantitative evaluation. We designed a melting device (module) without a <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> and with a controlled melt flow that performs both homogenization processes in parallel, substantially increases the melting performance and reduces the total energy consumption. We also delivered an overview of non-traditional melting techniques and discussed possibilities for implementing the module in real technology.

40|$|The {{selection}} {{of raw materials}} affects the rate of batch-to-glass conversion. In all-electric melters, foam under the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> limits the heat flux from the molten glass, thus slowing the rate of melting. Our study, in which we compare the melting behaviors of three batches formulated to vitrify high-alumina high-level waste, shows that a slowly dissolving refractory component can cause excessive foaming. Faster melting batches with gibbsite [Al(OH) 3] or boehmite [AlO(OH) ] as an alumina source produced substantially less foaming than a batch with corundum (Al 2 O 3). While gibbsite and boehmite dissolved below 500 °C, corundum was still present in the batch up to 900 °C; hence, the glass-forming melt lacked alumina in the batch with corundum. The low viscosity of that batch caused the open pores to close prematurely at 660 °C, trapping gases and expanding to foam. This would explain the literature-reported slow melting rate of a batch with corundum, as compared to batches with gibbsite and boehmite...|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{needs to}} achieve CO 2 neutrality during glass manufacturing {{have been investigated}} by theoretical calculations on energy balances and experimental investigations on batch reactivity and fining efficiency. The concept {{is based on the}} assumption of utilization of woody bio fuel combustion directly over the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> and glass melt bath for heating the glass furnace. Energy balance calculations were made for a "hot top", 50 tonnes per day continuous furnace. Furthermore, elimination of the chemically bound CO 2 in the glass batch has been considered by investigating the possible substitution of the batch carbonates by other compounds not bearing chemically bound CO 2. Compounds not emitting oxides of carbon, nitrogen or sulphur were considered as candidate batch components. Studies on the effect of batch melting and fining indicate a beneficial effect on energy efficiency and melting rate when using carbonate substitutes. It is concluded that the combustion concept is theoretically fully possible for glass tank application. The substitution of batch carbonates by non carbon compounds is questionable from an environmental point view since the alternatives are expected to be synthesized by routes emitting CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a short {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} currently applied glass melting processes/furnaces concerning their energy consumption levels (benchmarking), as well as NOx emissions. The best practice situations will be presented for few glass products (e. g. container glass). Potential improvements in furnace designs to obtain more intensified melting or smaller glass furnace sizes and improved-controlled process steps (melting-in, complete raw material (e. g. sand) digestion of the melt, fining, homogenization & conditioning) will be discussed. Important aspects per process step are control of the applied temperature level, finding optimum glass melt flow regimes and residence times in each compartment of the melting tank, dedicated for a specific process step. Controlled & intensified heat transfer to the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> area is decisive for the possibility to reduce glass furnace size, and consequently lowering structural energy losses. Mathematical modeling studies support the development of new furnace designs and heating methods in industrial glass furnaces with targeted high energy efficiency and moderate / low NOx emissions.

40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} glass furnaces show broad glass melt {{residence time}} distributions in the melting tanks and average residence times may {{be up to}} more than two days for high quality glass products, such as float glass or TV glass, despite the minimum residence times of 8 - 10 hours (or even less than 4 hours for container glass furnaces). Long residence times are associated with large melt tank volume/pull rate ratios and high structural heat losses. The recirculation flows, necessary to supply the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> with sufficient energy for the fusion processes of the batch materials, are often poorly controlled and cause these shown residence time differences. For each elementary process step the most relevant process parameters in terms of desired flow patterns, mixing behavior, temperature, chemistry and required time for completion of the process step are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that the different steps need very different conditions comparing the processes with each other. Therefore glass furnace design modifications should be focused on the development of furnaces with segments, each of them dedicated and optimized for the a certain stage of the melting process: melting-in of batch, sand grain dissolution, removal of gases (bubbles and dissolved gases), re-absorption of residual bubbles and glass melt (chemical and thermal) homogenization.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the flow and thermal structures in the molten glass bath of a typical glass melting furnace with a throat but without air bubblers or electric boosting. Different separate effects on the flow structure of the glass melt are simulated, but only the glass melt is considered. The net heat flux distribution is imposed at the combustion space/glass melt interface, and its effects on the flow and thermal structures of the glass melt are analyzed in a systematic manner by changing the heat flux distribution while keeping the total heat input to the glass bath constant. The main purpose of the work is to evaluate the capability of the furnace operators to control the glass flow and temperature fields by adjusting the firing in the combustion space. The physical phenomena affecting the flow structure in the glass melt are analyzed and discussed in detail. The major results of the study indicate that (i) the heat flux distribution has no significant effect on the flow structure of the glass melt under the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> where several Rayleigh-Benard cells develop in the spanwise direction, (ii) a heat flux gradient in the longitudinal direction is required to generate two recirculation loops in the direction, and (iii) steep heat flux gradient in the refining part of the tank increase significantly the size of the refining recirculation loop near the front wall.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{individual}} mathematical models of batch melting, glass tank, sand grain dissolution, redox and fining and the {{comprehensive mathematical model}} of industrial glass melting furnace were developed. The individual models are capable of simulating the batch melting process, the fluid flow and heat transfer of glass melt, the silica sand dissolution process, the redox and fining processes respectively, and the comprehensive mathematical model is capable of simulating main thermal phenomena occurring in whole industrial glass melting furnace. For the comprehensive model, three main sub-models, which include the combustion chamber model, the batch melting model and the glass tank model, were coupled together by an integrated fashion. The sand grain dissolution model, the redox and fining models, as post-models, were coupled with the comprehensive model. The interface temperatures and heat fluxes between the combustion space, the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket,</b> and the glass melt were calculated by a cyclical iterative way. The accuracy of numerical simulation is improved greatly. The comprehensive model may supply very useful information about whole glass furnace {{as long as the}} inlet and the boundary conditions are given.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the mechanisms of}} fining (removal of gases from melt) {{and the effect of}} batch composition, oxidation state of the melt and furnace atmosphere on bubble removal processes for commercial glass types, such as float glass and container glass compositions. The mechanisms of the different stages of sulfate chemistry in the batch and sulfate fining process are presented, depending on the level of addition of cokes in the batch. The fining gas release as function of temperature from batch and melt are shown for different soda-lime-silica glass forming raw material batches. In case of coke and sulfate containing batches, sulfur dioxide gas release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well. Bubble growth rates during primary fining a float glass melts from experiments and models are compared and the removal of dissolved gases from such melts will be shown. The paper shows that furnace atmosphere may have an important influence on the temperature of fining gas evolution and total fining gas production: water vapor or helium in the atmosphere will reduce fining onset temperature and may significantly increase gas evolution during primary fining...|$|R

The composite computational model of bubble arrays behaviour in a melt was done by using knowledge of the individual bubble behaviour and in advance calculated temperature and velocity fields as well as fields of distribution of oxidation-reduction species inside a 3 D melting space. The influence of the input data (initial and boundary conditions) on the distribution of bubbles in the melting space and on the course of process was accomplished by a parametric study. The parametric study showed basic trends and significance of the individual input data for the melting process. The composite computational model of solid particles (segregated spinel crystals) behaviour in the melt was implemented by using knowledge of the individual particle behaviour and in advance calculated temperature and velocity fields inside the HLW melter (a facility for high level waste vitrification).

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{shows the}} advantages of re-melting post-consumer glass, but also the potential risks of using contaminated cullet in the raw material batch of glass furnaces (e. g. container glass furnaces). As an example of potential advantages: increasing the cullet % in the batch of an efficient end-port fired regenerative container glass furnace from 65 up to 75 % decreased the specific energy consumption from 3. 95 MJ/kg molten glass to 3. 8 MJ/kg and reduced the direct CO 2 emissions with 31 grams per kg glass. Additional, lower indirect CO 2 emissions can be taken into account, since less primary raw materials have to be applied, saving fossil energy in raw material synthesis (e. g. synthetic soda production). Waste glass has to be sorted and prepared in dedicated cullet recycling (treatment) plants (CTP) to meet the strict quality standards often expressed in maximum mass fraction of ceramics, stones, china, metal (ferro & non-ferro) and color mismatches that can still be accepted. But, also the presence of organic components (fats, oils, sugar, food residues, [...] ) has to be controlled to avoid production or glass color problems. Contamination of cullet may lead to: 1. Glass quality problems: inclusions or color changes; 2. Glass melting disturbances by foaming or limited heat transfer into melt; 3. Glass furnace lifetime, by downward drilling of melts of metals, present in the cullet. The most important problems today {{are related to the}} presence of glass ceramics in the post-consumer waste glass and the variable amount of different colors in the glass cullet or fluctuating contamination by organics. Even small pieces of china or glass ceramics in the cullet, with sizes less than 5 mm, may end as glass defects in glass products. Larger pieces of glass ceramics may even lead to severe interruptions in the gob formation process, due to problems with cutting of the gobs with high viscous inclusions. In modern cullet treatment plants most ferro- and non-ferro metals are rather effectively removed. Glass-ceramics are very difficult to distinguish from normal soda-lime-silica glass, because color and transparency can be almost the same. Specific techniques have to be applied to detect glass-ceramic pieces in the cullet based on X-Ray absorption, X-Ray fluorescence, Hyper-spectral Imaging or UV techniques. Such systems are recently applied in modern waste glass treatment plants in Europe, delivering recycling cullet to the glass industry. This paper will show the glass defects related to the presence of glass-ceramics and the typical compositions of these inclusions (often present as cord or big knots). Organic materials can pyrolize within the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket</b> to form carbon rich residues. Carbon or cokes can react with sulfates in the batch and will cause formation of sulfides. A high level of sulfides in the batch (instead of sulfate) will jeopardize the fining process, may cause changes in fining onset temperature, may cause foaming around the <b>batch</b> <b>blanket,</b> or may lead to chemically reduced glass or even amber cords. The process of radiant heat transmission in the melt will change with a variation of the oxidation state of the melt (redox state of batch & cullet). Examples of glass defects caused by metal contamination in the batch will be shown. The composition of the metal inclusions (glass defects) in the glass product may be very different from the composition of the original contamination, causing the defect. An example is metallic aluminum that leads to silicon inclusions in the glass. Nickel sulfide can be formed by pollution of the glass melt by stainless steel flakes. Liquid metals are very aggressive towards the refractory bottom materials of the tank. A droplet of molten lead for instance will drill a hole in the refractory layers: "downward drilling". The presentation will show the relation between glass defects and their origin in contaminated cullet and the mechanism of defect formation or defect conversion...|$|R

To ensure {{the start of a}} new breeding season, eggs should hatch at the beginning of a favorable period. The aim of the current study was to investigate the hatching response of two Ae. aegypti egg batches collected and stored for 3 mo under different conditions, to different low immersion temperatures. Two different hatching media (water and yeast solution) were used for the first batch and only one (water) for the second egg batch. Eggs were immersed for 8 d, during which the number of hatched eggs was recorded daily. The proportion of hatched eggs, delay of the hatching response, proportion of dead larvae, and proportion of remaining eggs within the first egg batch were compared between the two hatching media at each temperature. These parameters also were compared between the two batches immersed in water. Hatching rates were higher and faster in the yeast solution. The hatching response was lower at lower immersion temperatures and among eggs stored under field conditions at <b>colder</b> temperatures (second <b>batch).</b> Among the eggs stored in the laboratory (first batch), older eggs exhibited lower hatching response. The proportion of dead larvae was higher in the yeast solution and in the eggs stored in the laboratory. The conditions that triggered a lower hatching response led to higher proportions of remaining eggs, allowing the population to maintain an egg bank for future favorable opportunities.
