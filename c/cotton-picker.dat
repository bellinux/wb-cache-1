At the age of eight, she worked as a <b>cotton-picker</b> near Hartley.She {{attended}} Mzilikazi High School and then taught English literature at Njube High School, both in Bulawayo. In 1987 she travelled to Canada and she married John Jose, a Canadian whom she had met while he was teaching at Njube. At York University, Toronto, she completed an undergraduate degree, a master's and a PhD, and taught literature.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{reliability}} of cotton pickers is analysed and its importance in studying the performance of harvesting systems is examined. A theoretical development of farm machinery and specifically of <b>cotton-picker</b> reliability is presented and an algorithm based on the exponential distribution is developed. This algorithm is then applied to predict picker reliability, delays caused by machine breakdowns and their implications upon the cotton area harvested {{as well as the}} associated harvesting cost for a cotton producers group in Greece. The results obtained have shown a machine breakdown every 23. 7 h with an average repair time of 2. 86 h. Within a harvesting season, a cotton picker undergoes on average 12. 75 breakdowns and 4 days out of work. This means a reduction in the least cost area harvested of 20 % and an increase in the harvesting cost of 6. 5 %. (C) 2002 Silsoe Research Institute. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|In 1891, {{after the}} split over the {{elections}} bill, the Colored Alliance called {{a general strike}} of black <b>cotton-pickers</b> to demand a wage increase from 50 cents to $1 per hundred pounds of cotton. The white Farmers' Alliance, whose membership in the South included large numbers of landowners employing sharecroppers, were the most vehement opponents of the proposed strike. The Progressive Farmer, paper of Farmers Alliance President Leonidas L. Polk, urged “our farmers to leave their cotton in the field rather than pay more than 50 cents per hundred to have it picked.” ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1891, {{with the}} failure of the <b>cotton-pickers</b> strike, the Colored Farmers' Alliance began to decline in both {{membership}} and political influence. The Texas branch continued to be active by the spring of 1892. Alex Asberry, a black Republican state legislator from Robertson County, was elected state president and founded a newspaper, the Alliance Vindicator. But, by the end of 1892 the Texas Colored Farmers' Alliance had largely disappeared. And by extension the National Colored Farmers' Alliance disappeared after 1896 with the demise of the Populist Party, from where its members were generally recruited.|$|R
50|$|After a two-decade hiatus Lenski {{returned}} to poetry {{in the late}} 1940s, while she was researching and writing Cotton in My Sack. She later explained that she needed a song for her white <b>cotton-pickers,</b> and as the only picking songs she had found during her research belonged to the distinctive traditions of African-American pickers, she wrote a song for her characters. In the early 1950s a prolonged illness prevented her from working on books, but {{she was able to}} write poems and lyrics. Collaborating with the author and composer Clyde Robert Bulla, she produced a book of hymns and two other songbooks.|$|R

The old-fashioned coon was a fine old cuss--he knew his place--but these young dinges don't want to be porters or <b>cotton-pickers.</b> Oh, no! They got to be lawyers and professors and Lord knows what all! I tell you, it's {{becoming}} a pretty serious problem. We ought {{to get together and}} show the black man, yes, and the yellow man, his place. Now, I haven't got one particle of race-prejudice. I'm the first to be glad when a nigger succeeds--so long as he stays where he belongs and doesn't try to usurp the rightful authority and business ability of the white man." ...|$|R
