40|$|NCBI’s PubChem now {{features}} calculated three-dimensional <b>conformers</b> (3 -D <b>conformers)</b> for a {{large proportion}} of the PubChem compound database (17 million records, 88 %). In addition, <b>conformers</b> are clustered to provide a list of similar 3 -D <b>conformers.</b> These similar <b>conformers</b> provide a more relevant and expanded set of compounds with potentially similar biological and pharmacological activity. PubChem also provides a viewer for small molecule <b>conformers</b> and alignments that produces an animated view from displays in the Web service. The new standalone viewer, Pc 3 D, is the small-molecule equivalent of the now standard Cn 3 D viewer for macromolecular structures and provides additional features for visualizing the details of small molecule structures and alignments.

40|$|Compared {{with their}} isoelectronic system ethane, both {{hydrogen}} peroxide and hydrazine exhibit a double well torsional energy curve where skew <b>conformers</b> are favored over trans <b>conformers</b> and cis <b>conformers</b> are energy-maximum states. Clearly, {{the involvement of}} the lone oxygen and nitrogen pairs, or more specifically, the enhanced stabilizing n ->sigma* negative hyperconjugation effect and destabilizing repulsion among lone pairs, complicates the conformational analysis. In this work, the modern ab initio valence bond (VB) method is employed to quantitatively investigate the torsional energy curves of hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine in terms of hyperconjugative stabilization, steric repulsion, and structural and electronic relaxations. It is found that if the hyperconjugation effect is completely quenched, the trans <b>conformers</b> will be favored, while the cis <b>conformers</b> are the only transition state pertaining to the torsional motion in the potential energy surfaces of H 2 O 2 and N 2 H 4. Although usually the steric effect includes the contributions from the electronic and geometric changes, our energy decomposition analysis shows that even the steric effect favors the skew <b>conformers,</b> while the electronic and geometric changes stabilize the trans <b>conformers.</b> Thus, we conclude that both the hyperconjugative and steric interactions lower the energy of skew <b>conformers</b> and eventually form low barriers from skew to trans <b>conformers</b> and high barriers from skew to cis <b>conformers</b> in both H 2 O 2 and N 2 H 4. Comparison between the VB and the natural bond orbital (NBO) results show similarities and discrepancies between the two methods...|$|R
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single <b>conformer.</b> In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the <b>conformer</b> that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation.

The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite <b>conformer</b> due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

Cross sections for 19 <b>conformers</b> (charge states + 5 through + 13) were measured. Two <b>conformers</b> for the + 12 charge state, which were readily separated in FAIMS, were found to have similar cross sections. Based on a method to calibrate the collision gas thickness, the cross sections measured using the FAIMS/energy-loss method were compared with literature values determined using drift tube ion mobility spectrometry. The comparison illustrated that the <b>conformers</b> of bovine ubiquitin that were identified using drift tube ion mobility spectrometry were also observed using the FAIMS device...|$|R

25|$|Nonbonded 1,3-diaxial {{interaction}} energies {{are commonly}} used to approximate strain energy in cyclic molecules, as values for these interactions are available. By taking the difference in nonbonded interactions for each <b>conformer,</b> the equilibrium enthalpy can be estimated. The strain energy for methylidenecyclohexane has been calculated to be 4.5 kcalmol−1 using estimations for 1,3-diaxial strain (0.9 kcalmol−1), methyl/hydrogen allylic strain (1.3kcalmol−1), and methyl/methyl allylic strain (7.6 kcalmol−1) values.|$|E
25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable <b>conformer,</b> and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat <b>conformer.</b> This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of molecules}} which exhibit allylic strain are olefins. Depending on the substituents, olefins maintain {{varying degrees of}} allylic strain. In 3-methyl-1-butene, the interactions between the hydrogen and the two methyl groups in the allylic system cause a change in enthalpy equal to 2 kcal/mol. As expected, {{with an increase in}} substituent size, the equilibrium enthalpies between rotamers also increases. For example, when examining 4-methyl-2-pentene which contains an additional allylic methyl group compared to 3-methyl-1-butene, the enthalpy of rotation for the highest energy <b>conformer</b> increases from 2 kcal/mol to 4 kcal/mol.|$|E

25|$|When one is {{considering}} allylic strain, {{one needs to}} consider the possible conformers and the possible stereoelectronic demand of the reaction.

In stereoselective reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects. The sterics effect is where the largest group prefer to be the farthest from the alkene. The electronic effect is where the orbitals of the subsituents prefer to align anti or outside of the orbitals depending on the reaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the context}} of drug {{discovery}} and development, much effort has been exerted to determine which <b>conformers</b> of a given molecule {{are responsible for the}} observed biological activity. In this work we aimed to predict bioactive <b>conformers</b> using a variant of supervised learning, named multiple-instance learning. A single molecule, treated as a bag of <b>conformers,</b> is biologically active if and only if at least one of its <b>conformers,</b> treated as an instance, is responsible for the observed bioactivity; and a molecule is inactive if none of its <b>conformers</b> is responsible for the observed bioactivity. The implementation requires instance-based embedding, and joint feature selection and classification. The goal of the present project is to implement multiple-instance learning in drug activity prediction, and subsequently to identify the bioactive <b>conformers</b> for each molecule. Methods We encoded the 3 -dimensional structures using pharmacophore fingerprints which are binary strings, and accomplished instance-based embedding using calculated dissimilarity distances. Four dissimilarity measures were employed and their performances were compared. 1 -norm SVM was used for joint feature selection and classification. The approach was applied to four data sets, and the best proposed model for each data set was determined by using the dissimilarity measure yielding the smallest number of selected features. Results The predictive abilities of the proposed approach were compared with three classical predictive models without instance-based embedding. The proposed approach produced the best predictive models for one data set and second best predictive models {{for the rest of the}} data sets, based on the external validations. To validate the ability of the proposed approach to find bioactive <b>conformers,</b> 12 small molecules with co-crystallized structures were seeded in one data set. 10 out of 12 co-crystallized structures were indeed identified as significant <b>conformers</b> using the proposed approach. Conclusions The proposed approach was proven not to suffer from overfitting and to be highly competitive with classical predictive models, so it is very powerful for drug activity prediction. The approach was also validated as a useful method for pursuit of bioactive <b>conformers.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|New crystal {{structures}} of fully hydrogenated borophene (borophane) have been predicted by first principles calculation. Comparing with the chair-like borophane (C-boropane) {{that has been}} reported in literature, we obtained four new borophane <b>conformers</b> with much lower total-energy. The most stable one, washboard-like borophane (W-borophane), has energy about 113. 41 meV/atom lower than C-borophane. In order to explain the relative stability of different borophane <b>conformers,</b> the atom configuration, density of states, charge transfer, charge density distribution and defect formation energy of B-H dimer have been calculated. The results show that the charge transfer from B atoms to H atoms is crucial for the stability of borophane. In different borophane <b>conformers,</b> the bonding characteristics between B and H atoms are similar, but the B-B bonds in W-borophane are much stronger than that in C-borophane or other structures. In addition, we examined the dynamical stability of borophane <b>conformers</b> by phonon dispersions and found that the four new <b>conformers</b> are all dynamically stable. Finally the mechanical properties of borophane <b>conformers</b> along an arbitrary direction have been discussed. W-borophane possesses unique electronic structure (Dirac cone), good stability and superior mechanical properties. W-borophane has broad perspective for nano electronic device.
