However, setting such a threshold {{is by no means}} an easy task. In this paper, we consider a more practical problem: mining top-k strongly correlated item pairs, where k is the desired number of item pairs that have largest correlation values. Based on the FP-tree data structure, we propose an efficient algorithm, called Tkcp, for mining such patterns without minimum <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold.</b> Our experimental results show that Tkcp algorithm outperforms the Taper algorithm, one efficient algorithm for mining correlated item pairs, even with the assumption of an optimally chosen <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold.</b> Thus, we conclude that mining top-k strongly correlated pairs without minimum <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> is more preferable than the original <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> based mining...|$|E

Scale-freeness, i. e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold,</b> and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays...|$|E

This number becomes over 60 % when T[*]=[*] 0.4, and less than 30 % when T[*]=[*] 0.5. For T[*]≥[*] 0.6, the number of nodes with at least 100 neighbors is zero, indicating very poor connections in the network.|$|R
40|$|MEG/EEG {{beamformer}} source imaging is {{a promising}} approach which can easily address spatiotemporal multi-dipole problems without a priori {{information on the}} number of sources and is robust to noise. Despite such promise, beamformer generally has weakness which is degrading localization performance for correlated sources and is requiring of dense scanning for covering all possible interesting (entire) source areas. Wide source space scanning yields all interesting area images, and it results in lengthy computation time. Therefore, an efficient source space scanning strategy would be beneficial in achieving accelerated beamformer source imaging. We propose a new strategy in computing beamformer to reduce scanning points and still maintain effective accuracy (good spatial resolution). This new strategy uses the distribution of correlation values between measurements and lead-field vectors. Scanning source points are chosen yielding higher RMS correlations than the predetermined <b>correlation</b> <b>thresholds.</b> We discuss how <b>correlation</b> <b>thresholds</b> depend on SNR and verify the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed strategy to improve the beamformer through numerical and empirical experiments. Our proposed strategy could in time accelerate the conventional beamformer up to over 40 % without sacrificing spatial accuracy...|$|R

Using standard techniques for the selection of significant genes may lead to many highly correlated genes to be chosen, which may be an issue if we are limited in the number of genes we can select. This article therefore aims to investigate methods for selecting genes with the application of a <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold.</b> The methods are applied to two high-dimensional microarray datasets, one to aid the prediction of {{the presence or absence of}} Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and one to predict whether the oestrogen-receptor class of a given breast cancer cell line is positive or negative. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of the <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> as a gene selection parameter depends on the particular microarray dataset and classification problem. While the <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> may be beneficial in some specific scenarios where the number of required genes is restrictively small, it may also have no or even detrimental effect on the classification accuracy...|$|E

We propose simple local algorithms and analyze their performance in the regime of correlation decay. We prove that an algorithm based {{on a set of}} conditional mutual information tests is consistent for structure learning throughout the regime of correlation decay. This algorithm requires the number of samples to scale as ω(n), and has a computational complexity of O(n^ 4). A simpler algorithm based on <b>correlation</b> <b>thresholding</b> outputs a graph with a constant edit distance to the original graph when there is correlation decay, and the number of samples required is Ω(n).

We propose simple, local and robust algo-rithms and analyze their {{performances in the}} regime of correlation decay, i. e., when c tanhJmax < 1 (where Jmax is the maximum inverse temperature in the model). The algorithms are robust be-cause (i) they do not depend upon the specific model parameters such as the average degree and (ii) they provide guaranteed performance for a large class of sparse n-node Erdős-Rényi random graphs. We prove that a structure learning algorithm based {{on a set of}} conditional mutual informa-tion tests is consistent in high-dimensions throughout the regime of correlation decay provided the number of samples scales as ω(logn).

Thirty five healthy subjects performed continuously increasing static handgrip (HG) and static leg extension (LE) until maximal force (MF). Main findings were: 1) strong correlations between %MF and lnHFRR; 2) threshold phenomena around 65 %MF in %MF vs. LFSP and LFRR/HFRR relations; and 3) greater effects on CVAV of LE than HG (p< 0. 001).

30|$|Using {{the daily}} streamflow data of 151  years (October 1862 –September 2013), the annual streamflow network for the Mississippi River basin at St. Louis, Missouri is constructed, {{following}} the procedure explained earlier. The annual streamflow network thus constructed has 151 nodes, corresponding to 151  years of daily data. Each node consists of 365 daily streamflow values (excluding {{the data for}} February 29 in leap years). This allows calculation of correlations in streamflow between each of the 151 nodes (years) with each and every other node in the network. In this study, the Pearson correlation coefficient {{is used to calculate}} the correlation. The correlations in flow between nodes, in turn, allow identification of neighbors (i.e., links) for each and every node in the network, which {{is the key to the}} implementation of the degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution methods. It is important to note that the <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> (T) may significantly influence the identification of the neighbors (i.e., links), and hence, the outcomes of the methods. However, the optimum <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> is not known a priori. To take this issue into account and examine the influence of threshold, eight different threshold values are considered in the analysis: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, and 0.8 (see Sivakumar and Woldemeskel (2014) for some details on the selection of the <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> values).

30|$|The {{locations}} of all detected clusters in SR 1 {{spread over the}} specimen with a tendency towards the free surface (Figure 12 (a)). This is an expected factor since those clusters with low number of members have lower SNR. It is also possible to capture noise by chance with a low number of members. In order to get around this problem, one can construct another decision system in order to discriminate between AE and noise. Observations indicate that keeping those clusters with large number of members automatically eliminates those recordings with noise or random nature. One can also increase the <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> for identifying the clusters. However, {{there is a chance}} that a high <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> may erase all possible clusters in the data, where the SNR is low. On the other hand, keeping it very low relaxes the constraints, where the chance of obtaining clusters with noise members is increased.

Recurrences to earthquakes are identified employing <b>correlation</b> <b>thresholds</b> to demarcate the most meaningful ones in each cluster. The distribution of recurrence lengths and recurrence times are analyzed subsequently to extract information about the complex dynamics.

In [8], Ke et al. first proposed correlation sub-graph search problem (CGSearch for short) to capture the underlying dependency between subgraphs in a graph database, that is CGS algorithm. However, CGS algorithm requires the specification of a minimum <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold</b> θ to perform computation. In practice, {{it may not be}} trivial for users to provide an appropriate threshold θ, since different graph databases typically have different characteristics. Therefore, we propose an alternative mining task: top-K correlation subgraph search(TOP-CGSearh for short). The new problem itself does not require setting a <b>correlation</b> <b>threshold,</b> which leads the previous proposed CGS algorithm inefficient if we apply it directly to TOP-CGSearch problem. To conduct TOP-CGSearch efficiently, we develop a pattern-growth algorithm (that is PG-search algorithm) and utilize graph indexing methods to speed up the mining task.

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} {{sensitivity to}} binocular correlation in dynamic random-dot stereograms that defined moving sinusoidal gratings-in-depth. At {{a range of}} spatial frequencies and drift rates we established sensitivity by adding Gaussian distributed disparity noise to the modulation of disparity that defined a cyclopean grating, and finding the noise amplitude that rendered the grating just detectable. This permitted <b>correlation</b> <b>thresholds</b> to be measured at a range of suprathreshold disparity amplitudes. Spatial requirements for binocular correlation depend little on temporal frequency, and vice versa. This suggests that binocular correlation mechanisms can be characterized by independent spatial and temporal sensitivity functions. The temporal frequency function has a low pass characteristic. Sensitivity declines above about 1 c/sec, reaching its limit at 4 – 8 c/sec. The spatial characteristic depends greatly on the amplitude of disparity modulation, changing from band pass at low amplitude to low pass at high amplitude. The maximum resolvable spatial frequency is 4 – 6 c/deg, but declines sharply for relatively high amplitudes. The interaction between amplitude and spatial frequency cannot be explained by fixed high or low limits on detectable disparity gradients...|$|R
