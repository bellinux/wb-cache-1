40|$|International audienceAbstractFor centuries {{analyses}} of tissues have depended on sectioning methods. Recent developments of tissue clearing techniques have now opened a segway from studying tissues in 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. This particular advantage echoes {{heavily in the}} field of neuroscience, where {{in the last several years}} there has been an active shift towards understanding the complex orchestration of neural circuits. In the past five years, many tissue-clearing protocols have spawned. This is due to varying strength of each <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> to specific applications. However, two main protocols have shown their applicability to a vast number of applications and thus are exponentially being used by a growing number of laboratories. In this review, we focus specifically on two major tissue-clearing method families, derived from the 3 DISCO and the CLARITY clearing protocols. Moreover, we provide a “hands-on” description of each tissue <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> and the steps to look out for when deciding to choose a specific tissue <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol.</b> Lastly, we provide perspectives for the development of tissue clearing protocols into the research community in the fields of embryology and cancer...|$|E

Using a {{stereoscopic}} <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> and scanning electron microscopy, {{we investigated}} {{the extent and}} nature of microleakage in a total-etch, current-generation dentin adhesive by a wet-bonding technique under different handling conditions. The hypotheses were that inadequate light curing of the primer or incomplete drying of the primer solvent might adversely affect the sealing ability of an acetone-containing adhesive system. The study consisted of three experimental groups: (I) a control group with an adequate light source and with the primer solvent completely dried; (II) an "inadequate-light" group; and (III) an "incomplete evaporation of primer solvent " group. The extent of microleakage after silver staining and clearing of the specimens was scored based on a modified five-point scale. Nonparametric statistica...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{development}} of whole-body imaging at single-cell resolution enables system-level approaches to studying cellular circuits in organisms. Previous clearing methods focused on homogenizing mismatched refractive indices of individual tissues, enabling reductions in opacity but falling short of achieving transparency. Here, {{we show that}} an aminoalcohol decolorizes blood by efficiently eluting the heme chromophore from hemoglobin. Direct transcardial perfusion of an aminoalcohol-containing cocktail that we previously termed CUBIC coupled with a 10  day to 2  week <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> decolorized and rendered nearly transparent almost all organs of adult mice {{as well as the}} entire body of infant and adult mice. This CUBIC-perfusion protocol enables rapid whole-body and whole-organ imaging at single-cell resolution by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy. The CUBIC protocol is also applicable to 3 D pathology, anatomy, and immunohistochemistry of various organs. These results suggest that whole-body imaging of colorless tissues at high resolution will contribute to organism-level systems biology...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a protocol for advanced CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis). The CUBIC protocol enables simple and efficient organ clearing, rapid imaging by light-sheet microscopy and quantitative imaging analysis of multiple samples. The organ or body is cleared by immersion for 1 â€“ 14 d, with {{the exact time}} required dependent on the sample type and the experimental purposes. A single imaging set can be completed in 30 â€“ 60 min. Image processing and analysis can take < 1 d, but it {{is dependent on the}} number of samples in the data set. The CUBIC <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> can process multiple samples simultaneously. We previously used CUBIC to image whole-brain neural activities at single-cell resolution using Arc-dVenus transgenic (Tg) mice. CUBIC informatics calculated the Venus signal subtraction, comparing different brains at a whole-organ scale. These protocols provide a platform for organism-level systems biology by comprehensively detecting cells in a whole organ or body...|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: Due to lack {{of success}} in {{clearing}} whole tissues using only classical clearing techniques (e. g., Heir's 4 ½ solution, KOH, NaOH, lactic acid saturated with chloral hydrate), and because tissue degradation is often a result of harsh clearing agents (e. g., KOH, NaOH), a novel combined treatment was sought to improve the removal of obscuring tannins from intact haustoria. Methods and Results: Stockwell's bleach proved to be useful in removing tannins from haustoria, usually within 3 d (up to 10 d), rendering them opaque to (rarely) translucent. After bleaching, haustoria were successfully cleared in 1 – 3 d in a solution of lactic acid saturated with chloral hydrate at 42 °C Conclusions: The two-step <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> reported here will now facilitate structural studies on haustoria, such as those examining the presence and distribution of callose, and three-dimensional reconstmction using confocal microscopy. Tissues in {{this study did not}} suffer from the degradation in quality observed using harsher treatments.

40|$|Today, Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) {{makes it}} {{possible}} to image fluorescent samples through depths of several hundreds of microns. However, LSFM also suffers from scattering, absorption and optical aberrations. Spatial variations in the refractive index inside the samples cause major changes to the light path resulting in loss of signal and contrast in the deepest regions, thus impairing in-depth imaging capability. These effects are particularly marked when inhomogeneous, complex biological samples are under study. Recently, chemical treatments have been developed to render a sample transparent by homogenizing its refractive index (RI), consequently enabling a reduction of scattering phenomena and a simplification of optical aberration patterns. One drawback of these methods is that the resulting RI of cleared samples does not match the working RI medium generally used for LSFM lenses. This RI mismatch leads to the presence of low-order aberrations and therefore to a significant degradation of image quality. In this paper, we introduce an original optical-chemical combined method based on an adaptive SPIM and a water-based <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> enabling compensation for aberrations arising from RI mismatches induced by optical clearing methods and acquisition of high-resolution in-depth images of optically cleared complex thick samples such as Multi-Cellular Tumour Spheroids...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve injury (PNI), {{a common}} injury {{in both the}} {{civilian}} and military arenas, is usually associated with high healthcare costs and with patients enduring slow recovery times, diminished quality of life, and potential long-term disability. Patients with PNI typically undergo complex interventions but the factors that govern optimal response are not fully characterized. A fundamental understanding of the cellular and tissue-level events in the immediate postoperative period is essential for improving treatment and optimizing repair. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive imaging approach to evaluate peripheral nerve axonal regeneration in a rodent PNI model using a tissue clearing method to improve depth penetration while preserving neural architecture. Sciatic nerve transaction and end-to-end repair were performed in both wild type and thy- 1 GFP rats. The nerves were harvested at time points after repair before undergoing whole mount immunofluorescence staining and tissue clearing. By increasing the optic depth penetration, tissue clearing allowed the visualization and evaluation of Wallerian degeneration and nerve regrowth throughout entire sciatic nerves with subcellular resolution. The tissue <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> did not affect immunofluorescence labeling and no observable decrease in the fluorescence signal was observed. Large-area, high-resolution tissue volumes could be quantified to provide structural and connectivity information not available from current gold-standard approaches for evaluating axonal regeneration following PNI. The results are suggestive of observed behavioral recovery in vivo after neurorrhaphy, providing a method o...|$|E
40|$|Cryptorchidism, or undescended testis, is {{a common}} male genital anomaly of unclear etiology. Hormonal {{stimulation}} of the developing fetal gubernaculum by testicular androgens and insulin-like 3 (INSL 3) is required for testicular descent. In studies of the orl fetal rat, one of several reported strains with inherited cryptorchidism, we studied hormone levels, gene expression in intact and hormone-stimulated gubernaculum, and imaging of the developing cremaster muscle facilitated by a tissue <b>clearing</b> <b>protocol</b> to further characterize development of the orl gubernaculum. Abnormal localization of the inverted gubernaculum was visible soon after birth. In the orl fetus, testicular testosterone, gubernacular androgen-responsive transcript levels, and muscle-specific gene expression were reduced. However, the in vitro transcriptional response of the orl gubernaculum to androgen was largely comparable to wild type (wt). In contrast, increases in serum INSL 3, gubernacular INSL 3 -responsive transcript levels, expression of the INSL 3 receptor, Rxfp 2, and {{the response of the}} orl gubernaculum to INSL 3 in vitro all suggest enhanced activation of INSL 3 /RXFP 2 signaling in the orl rat. However, DNA sequence analysis did not identify functional variants in orl Insl 3. Finally, combined analysis of the present and previous studies of the orl transcriptome confirmed altered expression of muscle and cellular motility genes, and whole mount imaging revealed aberrant muscle pattern formation in the orl fetal gubernaculum. The nature and prevalence of developmental muscle defects in the orl gubernaculum are consistent with the cryptorchid phenotype in this strain. These data suggest impaired androgen and enhanced INSL 3 signaling in the orl fetus accompanied by defective cremaster muscle development...|$|E
