5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued <b>capital</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1980s, the yen failed to rise in value even though current account {{surpluses}} returned and grew quickly. From ¥221 in 1981, the average value of the yen actually dropped to ¥239 in 1985. The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors. A wide differential in interest rates, with United States interest rates much higher than those in Japan, and the continuing moves to deregulate the international flow of capital, led to a large net outflow of capital from Japan. This <b>capital</b> <b>flow</b> increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas. This kept the yen weak relative to the dollar and fostered the rapid rise in the Japanese trade surplus that took place in the 1980s.|$|E

Gross <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> are also pro-cyclical. During expansions, foreigners invest more domestically and domestic agents invest more abroad.

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, as capital inflows surged to emerging market economies, a group of economists at the IMF outlined the elements of a policy toolkit to manage the macroeconomic and financial - stability risks associated with <b>capital</b> <b>flow</b> volatility. The proposed toolkit allowed a role for capital controls. The study, as well as a successor study focusing on financial-stability concerns stemming from <b>capital</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, while not representing an IMF official view, were nevertheless influential in generating debate among policy makers and the international community, and ultimately in bringing about a shift in the institutional position of the IMF. With the increased use of capital controls in recent years, the IMF has moved to destigmatize the use of capital controls alongside macroeconomic and prudential policies to deal with <b>capital</b> <b>flow</b> volatility. More widespread use of capital controls, however, raises a host of multilateral coordination issues, as enunciated for example by the G-20, echoing the concerns voiced by John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White more than six decades ago.|$|E

30|$|A second view focuses {{instead on}} the {{autonomous}} factors driving international <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> that are not merely those implied by changes in the real economy. This view (Bernanke 2005) emphasizes, for example, that international <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> are the results of savings gluts {{in countries such as}} Germany and China, being recycled in claims in countries such as Spain and the United States. Under this approach, international <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> searching for yield were the main source of speculative dynamics in the countries recipient of these <b>capital</b> <b>flows,</b> and, hence, banking crises are connected to the foreign sector developments. Indeed Borio and Disyatat (2011) note that the since the late 1990 s there has been a remarkable growth in gross international flows (the sum of inflows and outflows), larger than the corresponding current account positions (net <b>capital</b> <b>flows).</b> Importantly, this growth is driven to a large extent by an intensification of <b>capital</b> <b>flows</b> among developed nations. All these observations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to focus on international <b>capital</b> <b>flows,</b> rather than on traditional drivers of current account dynamics.|$|R
