40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative modeling, interfacing and training framework and application for microtunneling machines under heterogeneous {{gravel and sand}} soils, based on a machine simulator. It is initialized using a selective collection of skilled pilots' know-how during {{the performance of a}} pipe jacking microtunneling machine operation, generating a rule-based system based on grouped rules and states that replicate the machine's performance. The adjustment of these states and associated rules allows the creation, setup and analysis of a realistic functional model for tunneling machines. The developed system integrates a friendly Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that closely resembles real machines' pilot cabinets and allows natural interaction with the implemented inference engine through the simulated control panel. Additionally, the framework allows the training of tunneling machine operators by simulation and subsequent gathered data analysis, obviating or reducing mechanical movement times if desired. The virtual pilot's desk allows global training time and cost reductions, and increases safety for future operatorsand machinery. The HMI is divided into two screens, which replicate the data and the <b>command</b> <b>panels</b> of a real machine's control desk. The presented framework has allowed the first implementation of a jack piping microtunneling machine simulator by means of the developed pilots' steering know-how capture methodology.

50|$|On flight day four, Dragon {{performed}} HA-3 and CE-3 thruster burns {{to bring}} it 2.5 km below the station once again. NASA's Mission Control Houston team then gave SpaceX the go ahead to perform another set of burns that brought Dragon to within 1400 m of the station. Another decision was made at Mission Control Houston, and then Dragon moved to 250 m from the station. At this point, the COTS 3 demonstration objectives began. Dragon's DragonEye system demonstrated and confirmed that its position and velocity were accurate by comparing its LIDAR image to its thermal imagers. A series of checkout maneuvers commenced. The SpaceX flight control team in Hawthorne, California, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. It moved from 250 to 220 m below the station. The crew, using the <b>command</b> <b>panel,</b> then instructed Dragon to retreat, and the spacecraft moved {{back down to the}} hold point. This test ensured that Dragon's range to the ISS was accurate, and that the flight control team saw the spacecraft's acceleration and braking perform as expected. It was in a holding pattern at 250 m, and once again the Dragon flight team commanded it to approach the station. At the 220 m position, the crew commanded the vehicle to hold.|$|E

40|$|Fixed-effects {{regression}} {{is considered}} a powerful method for estimating causal effects with survey data. However, in the linear model, the conventional technique of time-demeaning does not yield consistent estimates of the parameters when unobserved heterogeneity is not time-constant. Jeffrey M. Wooldridge (2002, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data [MIT Press], 317 – 322) derived a general model for the situation where unobserved and observed characteristics of individuals interact to produce the outcome. The fixed-effects model with individual constants and slopes (FEIS) is a remedy for coefficients that are biased due to, for example, maturation or learning where unobserved traits affect individual growth curves differently for treated and controls. The Stata xtfeis command implements the FEIS estimator in Mata, allowing for individual constants and (potentially many) slopes. Without specifying slope variables, the model collapses to the conventional model estimated by xtreg, fe that accounts for individual constants only. xtfeis implements standard errors that are robust to serial correlation or heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Estimates of the slope parameters are available optionally. The <b>command</b> requires <b>panel</b> data with at least J + 1 observations per unit, where J {{is the number of}} individual-specific slope variables (usually, but not necessarily, also including the individual-specific constant).

Diplomska naloga obravnava nadzor in optimizacijo porabe električne energije varilne naprave, robota in mize – treh največjih porabnikov robotske varilne celice. V prvem delu so predstavljeni njeni porabniki: glavna stikalna omara, robotski krmilnik, robotski {{manipulator}}, miza ali pozicioner, vpenjalno-pozicionirno orodje, varilni sistem, čistilnik, dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča. Robotski krmilnik vodi mnogokratne naloge z možnostjo vodenja do osem robotov. V glavni stikalni omari se nahajajo vsi napajalni gradniki celice. Gibljivi strojni del celice sta robotski manipulator in miza z vpenjalno-pozicionirnim orodjem. Varilni sistem sestavljajo varilni izvor, povezni paket in varilna pištola. Čistilnik skrbi za čiščenje šobe varilne pištole. Dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča, na kateri so vsa glavna stikala, se uporabljata za upravljanje celice. Z meritvami parametrov robota, mize in varilne naprave smo izdelali dve preglednici nadzora porabe električne energije in dve predlogi HMI (human-machine interface). V njih se podatki sami preračunajo do porabe električne energije v kilovatnih urah in stroškov porabe v evrih za en, sto tisoč ter tri milijone zvarjenih kosov. V primerjavi varilna naprava porabi med tri do štirikrat več električne energije kot robot in miza skupaj, razmerje je odvisno predvsem od izbranega varilnega postopka. Porabo električne energije je možno najbolj optimizirati pri varilni napravi z dobro izbiro in nastavitvijo varilnega postopka z nanašanjem varilnega materiala s pulziranjem toka. Pri robotu in mizi je največji prihranek energije možen z izklopom servo regulacije motorjev robota, medtem ko robotska varilna celica v času odmorov za malico ne obratuje. Hardware producers {{strive to}} offer their customers a technologically perfected robotic cell. Two important factors that customers take into consideration are the overview of energy consumption and a possibility for optimization {{with regard to the}} energy cost savings. This thesis deals with the electricity consumption of a welding machine, robot and positioner, three main energy consumers of a robotic welding cell. The first part of the thesis describes the consumers of a robotic welding cell: robot controller, main switch cabinet, robot manipulator, positioner, clamping-positioning tool, welding system, cleaner, two-handed stand-alone counter and <b>command</b> <b>panel.</b> The robot controller performs multiple tasks and has the possibility to supervise up to eight robots. The power components are located in the main switching cabinet. The moving parts of the robotic welding cell are the robot manipulator and the positioner with the clamping-positioning tool. The welding system is composed of a welding source, a connecting package and a welding pistol. The cleaner carries out cleaning of the welding pistol 2 ̆ 7 s nozzle. The two-handed stand-alone counter and the <b>command</b> <b>panel</b> with all the main switches are used to operate the robotic welding cell. By measuring the parameters of the robot, the positioner and the welding source we compiled two tables showing electricity consumption and designed two HMI (human-machine interface). The tables automatically calculate the electricity consumption for one, 100, 000 and 3 million welded products in kilowatt hours and the costs in EUR. In comparison to the robot with the positioner, the welding source consumes three to four times more power, whereby the ratio mainly depends on the selected welding process. The electricity consumption of the welding tool can be best optimized by good setting and choosing the right welding process. With regard to the robot and the positioner, the most electricity can be saved by deactivating the servo regulation of the robot motors during the lunch time, when the robotic welding cell is not in operation...|$|E

FM multiplexed analog frequencies of up to 2 MHz and digital rates of 1 Mb/s are accommodated at a tape speed of 120 inches/second. Recording time in the analog mode varies between 4 minutes for 2 MHz data to 80 minutes for 100 KHz data. The total digital data storage is 3. 44 x 10 ⁹ bits with recording times from 1 hour for 1 Mb/s data to 19 hours for 50 Kb/s data in the serial track switching mode. A versatile command decoder and control interface are used for eight primary modes of operation. The recorder responds to over 7, 000 commands which are combinations of the eight modes, four tape speeds, four delay times, four run periods and track selection. The commands are formatted as 16 bit words by onboard computers or simple, single switch <b>panel</b> <b>commands</b> initiated by the astronauts. The Shuttle recorder uses a hermetically sealed transport unit, occupies approximately 2, 000 cubic inches and weighs 41 pounds. Operation through launch and re-entry vibration environments is accomplished by use of isolators which mount the transport unit to the electronics unit. Tape life is in excess of 20, 000 passes without maintenance...|$|R
