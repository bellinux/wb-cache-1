5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264 BC when {{settlements}} on Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay– Rome and Carthage– in order to solve internal conflicts. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a willingness to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; <b>certainly</b> <b>there</b> was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E
5|$|Once {{satisfied}} with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were <b>certainly</b> <b>there,</b> since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defence of the pass {{in one of his}} speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|Sommerstein {{attempts}} {{a reconstruction}} of {{the plot of the}} Troilos, in which the title character is incestuously in love with Polyxena and tries to discourage the interest in marrying her shown by both Achilles and Sarpedon, a Trojan ally and son of Zeus. Sommerstein argues that Troilus is accompanied on his fateful journey to his death, not by Polyxena, but by his tutor, a eunuch Greek slave. <b>Certainly</b> <b>there</b> is a speaking role for a eunuch who reports being castrated by Hecuba and someone reports the loss of their adolescent master. The incestuous love is deduced by Sommerstein from a fragment of Strattis' parody, assumed to partially quote Sophocles, and from his understanding that the Sophocles play intends to contrast barbarian customs, including incest, with Greek ones. Sommerstein also sees this as solving what he considers the need for an explanation of Achilles' treatment of Troilus' corpse, the latter being assumed to have insulted Achilles in the process of warning him off Polyxena. Italian professor of English and expert on Troilus, Piero Boitani, on the other hand, considers Troilus' rejection of Achilles' sexual advances towards him as sufficient motive for the mutilation.|$|E

25|$|This was {{immediately}} {{followed by a}} symposium in Tasmania in March 1956. In this symposium, the evidence {{was used in the}} theory of an expansion of the global crust. In this hypothesis the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the Earth since its formation. However, this was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of the Earth. <b>Certainly</b> <b>there</b> {{is no evidence that the}} moon has expanded in the past 3 billion years; other work would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius.|$|E

The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, {{knew what was going to}} happen but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E

25|$|The Christian {{community}} to which Matthew belonged, like many 1st-century Christians, were {{still part of}} the larger Jewish community: hence the designation Jewish Christian to describe them. The relationship of Matthew to this wider world of Judaism remains a subject of study and contention, the principal question being to what extent, if any, Matthew's community had cut itself off from its Jewish roots. <b>Certainly</b> <b>there</b> was conflict between Matthew's group and other Jewish groups, and it is generally agreed that the root of the conflict was the Matthew community's belief in Jesus as the Messiah and authoritative interpreter of the law, as one risen from the dead and uniquely endowed with divine authority.|$|E
25|$|There may be {{any number}} of unknown or {{underground}} secret societies at Yale. Any group of students may self-constitute themselves as a society at any time. <b>Certainly</b> <b>there</b> have been many which {{did not last long}} enough to leave any significant records. Indeed, the Yale Rumpus has in recent years published names of students it believes are in various secret societies. According to the Rumpus, numerous other societies (such as Cup and Crown, Phoenix ("Cage and Feather"), Nathan Hale, WIPS, L, Looking Glass, Spade and Grave, Boar and Rampant, Ox, ISO, Truth and Courage, Linonia, Llama and Cardigan, Red Mask, Crab and Bell, Ceres Athena, Gryphon, Fork and Knife, Ink and Needle, etc.) are either active or have been active recently. They typically meet in off campus apartments, fraternity common rooms, classrooms, and other available spaces. Some groups have enough resources to rent a permanent meeting space. Given the extracurricular zeal and competition for society spots evident in the Yale student body culture, a definitive list of secret societies that exist on the campus (or on any campus) can change year by year.|$|E

500|$|On {{a popular}} level, the First Crusade {{unleashed}} {{a wave of}} impassioned, pious Catholic furyexpressed in the massacres of Jews that accompanied the Crusades and the violent treatment of the [...] "schismatic" [...] Orthodox Christians of the east which occurred at Antioch. The Islamic world seems to have barely registered the Crusade; <b>certainly</b> <b>there</b> is limited written evidence before 1130. This may be {{in part due to}} a reluctance to relate Muslim failure, but it {{is more likely to be}} the result of cultural misunderstanding. Al-Afdal and the Muslim world mistook the Crusaders for the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries rather than religiously motivated warriors intent on conquest and settlement. In any case, the Muslim world was divided between the Sunnis of Syria and Iraq and the Shia Fatimids of Egypt. Even the Turks were divided, with rival rulers in Damascus and Aleppo. In Baghdad the Seljuk sultan vied with an Abbasid caliph in a Mesopotamian struggle. This gave the Franks a crucial opportunity to consolidate without any pan-Islamic counterattack.|$|E
500|$|The genre is {{traced to}} the United States and the United Kingdom. By early 1966, various groups began using baroque and {{classical}} instrumentation, described as a [...] "baroque rock" [...] movement by Gendron. The Zombies' single [...] "She's Not There" [...] (1964) marked {{a starting point for}} British baroque pop. Stanley explains that the song [...] "didn't feature any oboes but stuck out rather dramatically in 1964, the year of 'You Really Got Me' and 'Little Red Rooster'". [...] "She's Not There" [...] would inspire New York musician Michael Brown to form the Left Banke, whose song [...] "Walk Away Renée" [...] (1966) is considered by Stanley to be the first recognizable baroque pop single. [...] "Baroque rock" [...] was the label devised by the band's publicists and the music press. According to Richie Unterberger, [...] "the sobriquet may have been ham-fisted, but <b>certainly</b> <b>there</b> were many Baroque elements in the Left Banke's pop—the stately arrangements, the brilliant use of keyboards and harpsichords, the soaring violins, and the beautiful group harmonies." [...] Guerriri says that, in Britain, the song [...] "bridged the passage from rock into psychedelica for numerous groups: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Zombies, [...] the Kinks." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{explained}} before, {{orders are}} ubiquitous in mathematics. However, earliest explicit mentionings of partial orders are probably {{to be found}} not before the 19th century.

2500|$|The {{historian}} Charles Oman {{wrote that}} Fririon was [...] "scientific" [...] and got along well {{with his fellow}} soldiers. However, Masséna appeared to rely too much on his senior aide de camp, Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau and sometimes changed his instructions without consulting with Fririon. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>there</b> was friction among Massena's staff during the campaign. After the Portugal campaign, Fririon became commander of the 1st Military Division. Under the Bourbon Restoration he served as an inspector general of infantry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subject is}} {{complicated}} by {{a reference to the}} Kent versus Hampshire & Sussex match at Guildford Bason on 26 and 28 August 1772. [...] According to the source, [...] "Hampshire & Sussex" [...] was synonymous with [...] "Hambledon Club". It is interesting that Sussex cricket was not very prominent during the Hambledon period and this could have been because Hambledon operated a team effectively representing two counties. [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>there</b> were Sussex connections at Hambledon such as John Bayton, Richard Nyren, William Barber and Noah Mann.|$|E
