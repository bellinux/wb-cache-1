5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the video}} artist Eve Sussman filmed 89 Seconds at Alcázar, a high-definition video tableau {{inspired}} by Las Meninas. The {{work is a}} recreation of the moments leading up to and directly following the approximately 89 seconds when the royal family and their courtiers would have <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> the exact configuration of Velázquez's painting. Sussman had assembled a team of 35, including an architect, a set designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, actors, actresses, and a film crew.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

We must state it clearly: the Jews in the United States do not belong to the Hebrew nation. These Jews are Americans of Hebrew descent.|$|E

25|$|American white {{pelicans}} like to <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> {{groups of}} {{a dozen or more}} birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not easily possible – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach –, they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls and cormorants {{from the surface of the}} water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{competence}} {{is defined as}} a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural self-assessment, being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2014, the University of Mary Washington welcomed a new {{building}} to campus, recently renamed the Hurley Convergence Center.

A University Center was opened in Fall 2015 to provide a campus center that fosters a collaborative and respectful environment where members of the UMW community can engage in their extracurricular and academic pursuits. From a fourth-floor dining center, {{to a wide range of}} bookable spaces, and a large ballroom complete with sound and stage offerings, the University Center is a 100,000 square foot facility that can support numerous events and meetings.|$|E

25|$|The play {{features}} {{three groups}} of characters that interact slightly at first, and then <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Shrewsbury, where {{the success of the}} rebellion will be decided. First there is King Henry himself and his immediate council. He is the engine of the play, but usually in the background. Next there is the group of rebels, energetically embodied in Henry Percy ("Hotspur") and including his father, the Earl of Northumberland and led by his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. The Scottish Earl of Douglas, Edmund Mortimer and the Welshman Owen Glendower also join. Finally, at the centre of the play are the young Prince Hal and his companions Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto. Streetwise and pound-foolish, these rogues manage to paint over this grim history in the colours of comedy.|$|E
25|$|Clara Barton Parkway {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MacArthur Boulevard in Carderock. MacArthur Boulevard heads west toward Great Falls and the affluent community of Potomac. Clara Barton Parkway heads east as a two-lane highway that expands to a four-lane divided highway {{ahead of its}} diamond interchange with an access road to the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center to the north, which features the David Taylor Model Basin, and Carderock Recreation Area of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C) Canal to the south. East of the naval lab, the two roadways split for the parkway's six-ramp interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). There is no direct access from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound I-495 or from southbound I-495 to the eastbound parkway. The parkway roadways <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> Cabin John just west of parking areas accessible from the eastbound direction to C Canal Lock 10 and C Canal Lock 8 and River Center. Access to Cabin John is provided by a diamond interchange to a road connecting the parkway with MacArthur Boulevard in that community.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the lumping-together of taxa {{had come to}} be preferred. The 3rd edition of the AOU {{checklist}} in 1910 placed the screech owls back in Otus. Although this move was never unequivocally accepted, it was the dominant treatment throughout most of the 20th century. In 1988 it was attempted to resolve this by re-establishing all those genera split some 140 years earlier at subgenus rank inside Otus. Still, the diversity and distinctness of the group failed to <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a good evolutionary and phylogenetic picture, and {{it was not until the}} availability of DNA sequence data that this could be resolved. In 1999, a preliminary study of mtDNA cytochrome b across a wide range of owls found that even the treatment as subgenera was probably unsustainable and suggested that most of the genera proposed around 1850 should be accepted. Though there was some debate about the reliability of these findings at first, they have been confirmed by subsequent studies. In 2003, the AOU formally re-accepted the genus Megascops again.|$|E
