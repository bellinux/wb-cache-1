50|$|Assumption {{reinsurance}} {{is a form}} of reinsurance {{whereby the}} reinsurer is substituted for the <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer</b> and becomes directly liable for policy claims. This ordinarily requires a notice and release from affected policyholders. In the more typical reinsurance arrangement, the reinsurer has an obligation to indemnify the <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer,</b> which remains liable for claims on policies it has issued, and policyholders' approval is not required.|$|E
50|$|The NRRA {{provides}} {{that if the}} <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer’s</b> state of domicile is an NAIC-accredited state, or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar thereto, {{and the state of}} domicile recognizes credit for reinsurance, then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance. In addition, a state that is not the <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer’s</b> domiciliary state is preempted to the extent that any of its laws or regulations: restrict or eliminate the rights of <b>ceding</b> and assuming <b>insurers</b> to resolve disputes pursuant to contractual arbitration; require that a certain state’s laws govern a reinsurance contract, disputes arising from such contract, or requirements of the contract; attempt to enforce a reinsurance contract on terms different from those set forth in the reinsurance contract; or otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance agreements of <b>ceding</b> <b>insurers</b> not domiciled in the state.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{aggregation}} of dependent stop loss reinsurance risks where the dependence among the <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer(s)</b> risks {{is governed by}} the Sarmanov distribution and each individual risk belongs to the class of Erlang mixtures. We investigate {{the effects of the}} <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer(s)</b> risk dependencies on the reinsurer risk profile by deriving a closed formula for the distribution function of the aggregated stop loss reinsurance risk. Furthermore, diversification effects from aggregating reinsurance risks are examined by deriving a closed expression for the risk capital needed for the whole portfolio of the reinsurer and also the allocated risk capital for each business unit under the TVaR capital allocation principle. Moreover, given the risk capital that the reinsurer holds, we express the default probability of the reinsurer analytically. In case the reinsurer is in default, we determine analytical expressions for the amount of the aggregate reinsured unpaid losses and the unpaid losses of each reinsured line of business of the <b>ceding</b> <b>insurer(s).</b> These results are illustrated by numerical examples.

And if such issues influence systemic stability, what design features of the bond and characteristics of issuing insurer cause catastrophe bond issues to destabilize the financial sector?

40|$|Abstract: Severe natural catastrophes in {{the early}} 1990 s {{generated}} a lack of financial capacity in the catastrophe line of the global reinsurance market. The finance industry reacted to this situation by issuing innovative products designed to spread the excess risk more widely among international investors (risk securitization). The paper reviews these developments and emphasizes their significance {{with respect to the}} economic theory of risk exchanges. Special attention is devoted to the case of catastrophe-linked bonds, issued by <b>ceding</b> <b>insurers</b> to secure ex post conditional capital for the payment of claims. We analyze these new securities as financial portfolios combining a straight bond and catastrophe options. Using option pricing theory and simulation analysis in a stochastic interest rate environment, we show that investors attracted by the potential for diversification benefits should not overlook the optional features when including these securities in an asset portfolio.

40|$|The {{quest for}} optimal {{reinsurance}} design has remained an interesting problem among insurers, reinsurers, and academicians. An {{appropriate use of}} reinsurance could reduce the underwriting risk of an insurer and thereby enhance its value. This paper complements the existing research on optimal reinsurance by proposing another model for {{the determination of the}} optimal reinsurance design. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the value-at-risk of the net risk of the insurer while subjecting to a profitability constraint. The proposed optimal reinsurance model, therefore, has the advantage of exploiting the classical tradeoff between risk and reward. Under the additional assumptions that the reinsurance premium is determined by the expectation premium principle and the ceded loss function is confined to a class of increasing and convex functions, explicit solutions are derived. Depending on the risk measure's level of confidence, the safety loading for the reinsurance premium, and the expected profit guaranteed for the insurer, we establish conditions for the existence of reinsurance. When it is optimal to <b>cede</b> the <b>insurer's</b> risk, the optimal reinsurance design could be in the form of pure stop-loss reinsurance, quota-share reinsurance, or a combination of stop-loss and quota-share reinsurance. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT __________________________________________________________________________________ Liabilities <b>ceded</b> by life <b>insurers</b> to shadow reinsurers (i. e., less {{regulated}} and unrated off-balance-sheet entities) {{grew from}} $ 11 billion in 2002 to $ 364 billion in 2012. Life insurers using shadow insurance, which capture {{half of the}} market share, ceded 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in 2012, up from 2 cents in 2002. Our adjustment for shadow insurance reduces risk-based capital by 53 percentage points (or 3 rating notches) and increases default probabilities {{by a factor of}} 3. 5. We develop a structural model of the life insurance industry and estimate the impact of current policy proposals to limit or eliminate shadow insurance. In the counterfactual without shadow insurance, the average company us-ing shadow insurance would raise prices by 10 to 21 percent, and annual life insurance underwritte...|$|R
40|$|Let X {{denote the}} loss {{initially}} assumed by an insurer. In a reinsurance design, the <b>insurer</b> <b>cedes</b> {{part of its}} loss, say f(X), to a reinsurer, and thus the insurer retains a loss If (X) = X − f(X). In return, the insurer is obligated to compensate the reinsurer for undertaking the risk by paying the reinsurance premium. Hence, {{the sum of the}} retained loss and the reinsurance premium can be interpreted as the total cost of managing the risk in the presence of reinsurance. Based on a technique used in Müller and Stoyan (2002) and motivated by Cai and Tan (2007) on using the valueat-risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE) of an insurer’s total cost as the criteria for determining the optimal reinsurance, this paper derives the optimal ceded loss functions in a class of increasing convex ceded loss functions. The results indicate that depending on the risk measure’s level of confidence and the safety loading for the reinsurance premium, the optimal reinsurance can be in the forms of stop-loss, quota-share, or change-loss...|$|R
50|$|Section 201 authorizes $300 {{million to}} be {{split between the}} states {{annually}} as a grant for states to establish their own qualifying high-risk or reinsurance pool or other risk-adjustment mechanism used {{for the purpose of}} subsidizing the purchase of private health insurance. Qualifying high-risk pools must cover only high-risk populations, their spouses, and dependents, offer multiple competing health plan options, and offer at least one or more high-deductible plan in combination with a contribution to an HSA. Qualifying reinsurance pools and other risk-adjustment programs must cover only the same individuals as qualifying high-risk pools, but only on a prospective basis under which the <b>insurer</b> <b>cedes</b> the insured to the pool in exchange for a reinsurance premium. Bonus payments made available under this section can only be used for providing health insurance coverage to certain individuals with prior group coverage, a reduction in premium trends, actual premiums, or other cost-sharing requirements, any expansion of the pool of high-risk individuals, or for adopting the Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals promoted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).|$|R
40|$|An <b>insurer</b> (<b>ceding</b> enterprise) {{may enter}} into a multiple-year {{retrospectively}} rated reinsurance contract (RRC) with a reinsurer (assuming enterprise). Examples of these contracts may include transactions referred to as "funded catastrophe covers. " These contracts include a "retrospective rating " provision that provides {{for at least one}} of the following based on contract experience: (1) changes in the amount or timing of future contractual cash flows, including premium adjustments, settlement adjustments, or refunds to the ceding enterprise, or (2) changes in the contract's future coverage. A critical distinguishing feature of these contracts is that part or all of the retrospective rating provision is obligatory such that the retrospective rating provision creates future rights and obligations as a result of past events. A retrospectively rated contract that could be canceled by either party without further obligation is not covered by this Issue.

40|$|The {{short-term}} reinsurance process {{usually involves}} three parties, namely the insurer, the reinsurer {{and the original}} policyholder, as the <b>insurer</b> <b>cedes</b> {{a part of the}} covered risk of the policyholder to the reinsurer. This research however addresses the perceptions of reinsurers regarding their reinsurance activities, where the reinsurer sells reinsurance to other insurance entities (viz. insurers and reinsurers), as well as buys reinsurance from other insurance entities. The crux of short-term reinsurance is therefore mutually loss sharing between the various insurance entities. The objective of this research focuses on the improvement of financial decision-making regarding the reinsurance operations of the reinsurers. To achieve this objective a literature study was undertaken to provide adequate background to compile a questionnaire for the empirical survey. The primary study embodies the perceptions of the South African short-term reinsurers regarding the following aspects: the various reasons why reinsurance occurs; the contracts / methods of reinsurance; the bases / forms of reinsurance; and the factors which determine the retention levels of a reinsurer. South Africa is classified as a developing economy, {{is a member of the}} BRICS countries and has an emerging market economy. The empirical results should therefore also be valuable to other countries which are classified similarl...|$|R
