Each query has to be resolved by the individual attention of a member of each local research team, as well as an individual in the study administration. To ensure quality control, these queries are usually addressed and resolved before the CRF data is included by the sponsor in the final clinical study report.

Student funding has long been characterised by low up-front fees and limited support for students, aiming at ensuring social justice. Yet, the French system has partly failed to address inequalities of access to higher education and has recently been subject to the international movement towards cost-sharing. Thus the status quo is relatively fragile. While national policy reforms do not propose new tuition fee instruments, some higher education institutions have recently renewed their practices, especially by implementing variable fees. These institution-based instruments have not challenged so far the overall predominance of the French service public logic, where higher education is expected to be inexpensive and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> is to vary according to parental income.

40|$|ABSTRACT : Genome-wide {{association}} studies raise study-design {{and analytical}} {{issues that are}} still being debated. Among them, stands the issue of {{reducing the number of}} markers to be genotyped without loss of efficiency in identifying trait loci, which can reduce the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> and minimize the multiple testing problem. With this aim, we proposed a two-step strategy based on two analytical methods suited to examine sets of markers rather than single markers: the local score, which screens the genome to select candidate regions in Step 1, and FBAT-LC, a multiple-marker family-based association test used to obtain significance levels of regions at step 2. The performance of this strategy was evaluated on all replicates of Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 3 simulated data, using the answers to that problem. Overall, seven of the nine generated trait loci were detected in at least 87 % of the replicates using a framework designed to handle either association with the disease or association with the severity of disease. This multiple-marker strategy was compared to the single-marker approach. By considering regions instead of single markers, this strategy minimizes the multiple testing problem and the number of false-positive results...|$|E
40|$|Capacity of {{a system}} to perform with a satisfactorily behavior, when damages in some of its {{elements}} occur, is a key aspect for a rational design, and has focused also the attention of designers. In light of this, a controlled suspension bridge is herein considered {{as a case study}} for performing numerical simulations where the robustness of the control system, consisting in Tuned Mass Dampers at the bridge deck mid-span for mitigating variable wind buffeting, is investigated. A failure of the Tuned Mass Dampers system, is simulated by an additional fixed mass on the bridge main girder. It is expected that such a failure will degrade the performance of the whole system, but that this will still be comparable to that of the uncontrolled bridge version. Hybridization of the Tuned Mass Dampers system, by means of passive and semi-active dampers between the towers and the deck, seems also a promising solution for improving the robustness of the system against local malfunctioning. An hybrid system is studied where the reduction in performance due to the Tuned Mass Damper failure is compensated by the presence of dampers along the deck. Finally, a simplified approach of modeling the bridge is introduced to economize on the numerical <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> on the structure dynamics and control issues...|$|E

In this work an existing physical model (DTMB # 5415, similar to the US Navy DDG- 51 combatant) was replicated in STAR-CCM+, initially without appendages, then {{with the addition of}} the appendages. Towed resistance was calculated at various speeds. The bare hull model was unconstrained in heave and pitch, thus allowing the simulation to achieve steady dynamic attitude for each speed run. The effect of dynamic attitude on the resistance is considered to be significant and requires accurate prediction. The results were validated by comparison to available data from tow tank tests of the physical model. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the CFD package and the potential for increasing the use of CFD as an effective tool in design space exploration. This will significantly reduce the time and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> that previously depended solely on physical model testing during preliminary ship design efforts. by Petros Voxakis.

Moreover in- and outflows of students show imbalances and such imbalances are expected to increase with mobility. Therefore, we first suggest and discuss an alternative system transferring the responsibility for financing higher education to the country of origin of the students (except for those from developing countries). Origin country finances students from its territory through a two-part portable voucher: one part is dedicated to the financing of the true <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies,</b> the other part intends to support student’s life and might be designed {{in such a way that}} some social goals are reached.

Second, we show that, when coupled with a compensation of the origin country in case of international career of the graduate, the system proposed in this paper might be equivalent to a centralized efficient design.

Examination of quantitative data on approximately 118, 000 applicants, a purposive sample of households and policy-makers reveals geographic inequalities in university choice-making and student destinations. Multinomial logistic regression analysis of HE applicant first-choice HEIs, their general aptitude and residential origin shows that of two applicants with the same measured general aptitude, an applicant from a mountainous village is approximately 12 times more likely to apply to a least rather than a most prestigious HEI than an applicant from the capital. Qualitative evidence is used to explicate some aspects of the complex process of HE choice-making. Applicants and their families consider a number of factors like HEI location, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies,</b> prestige and availability of the desired programme when applying to tertiary education and selecting HEIs. Large differences are observed in applicant chances to enter prestigious HEIs by their residential origin. When controlling for prestige of first-choice HEIs, applicant measured aptitude and an array of other variables, applicants from mountainous villages are almost 8 times more likely to gain access to a least rather than the most prestigious HEI than applicants from the capital. International research shows that HEI quality is closely linked with higher probability of graduation, greater access to postgraduate studies and higher wage premium. It can be argued that rural students who apply and gain admission to less prestigious HEIs, may benefit from tertiary education to a lesser extent than urban students...|$|E
40|$|Many {{students}} at the University of Namibia have frequently complained about ineffective assessment practices used at the institution. On many occasions, these complaints have not been substantiated with evidence of any kind. The {{purpose of this study}} was to obtain some empirical evidence that would ascertain undergraduate students’ perceptions of the University of Namibia’s grading and assessment practices. Using a structured scaled questionnaire, data were obtained from a representative sample of the University’s undergraduate students studying for Medical and Pharmacy degrees. The questionnaire items covered matters related to students’ experiences of assessment practices, feedback on assessment tasks, reliability and validity of assessment tools used by lecturers, efficacy of processes of administering examinations, perceptions of irregular and unfair assessment practices, impact of assessment regimes on students’ <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies,</b> motivation, morale, rate of progression in studies and graduation, the degree of compliance with assessment ethics and on academic quality assurance. According to the data reported in this article, the majority of the respondents perceived that the Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy at the University of Namibia applied assessment practices that yielded reliable and valid results. This was the case because most lecturers in the two schools used appropriate assessment tools and provided their students with prompt and informative feedback on the results of assignments, tests and examinations. In addition, most respondents reported that whereas examination procedures used in the two schools were efficient and effective, lecturers graded examination scripts fairly.

Rather, views that individual applicants hold about outcomes that they envisage personally can be expected to be significant; these are explored in this paper which is based on research conducted in seven secondary schools/colleges among Year 13 pupils taking courses that would make them eligible to apply for higher education.

Self-reported exacerbations (event-based definition) in 409 primary care patients with COPD participating in the International Collaborative Effort on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease: Exacerbation Risk Index Cohorts (ICE COLD ERIC) cohort were ascertained every 6 months over 3 years. Exacerbations were adjudicated by single experienced physicians and an adjudication committee who had information from patient charts. We assessed the accuracy (sensitivities and specificities) of self-reports and single-physician chart review against a central adjudication committee (AC) (reference standard). We used multinomial logistic regression and bootstrap stability analyses to explore determinants of misclassifications. The AC identified 648 exacerbations, corresponding to an incidence rate of 0. 60 ± 0. 83 exacerbations/patient-year and a cumulative incidence proportion of 58. 9 %. Patients self-reported 841 exacerbations (incidence rate, 0. 75 ± 1. 01; incidence proportion, 59. 7 %). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reports were 84 % and 76 %, respectively, those of single-physician chart review were between 89 % and 96 % and 87 % and 99 %, respectively.

Quality {{of higher}} {{education}} and its accessibility {{is an integral part}} of the public life, its changes and development. Debates on whether higher education should be free-of-charge or not is an old global discussion. United States of America have chosen the path of free higher education, meanwhile most of the Europe has taken a more moderate position, even without a specific provision in constitutions, as it is indicated in Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania that higher education at State schools should be free-of-charge. However, even in those countries, whose constitutions make a reference to a free higher education, de facto situation demonstrates that it is not adopted to its full extent or it is done with exceptions. Lithuania is no exception and one of the most discussed questions in the Constitutional Court was free of charge education for well-learning citizens. 	Since 2002, when Lithuanian higher education system was complemented by colleges the number of students has generally increased. Because of the demographic boom and additional higher education places in colleges, the state was unable to grant free of charge higher education. 	Constitutional Court of Lithuania has interpreted the concept of well- learning student for a total of six times. The purpose of this research paper is to systematically review and summarise all the rulings of the Constitutional Court that are related to free-of-charge higher education. Moreover, it aims to discuss official constitutional doctrine of free higher education for well-learning citizens with an emphasis on the basic provisions and norms. Paper provides examples of several states, in order to demonstrate how the accessibility and funding {{of higher education}}, which is defined by constitution, is acting de facto. Moreover, necessity of the Constitutional interpretation is reviewed, as well as positive Constitutional legislation, which is relevant to understanding interpretations of Constitutional Court of Lithuania. 	The review of rulings of Constitutional Court focuses on interpretation of interactions of constitutional norms which oppose one another. How the state order which is created in accordance with public demand, has to interact with constitutional norms in order to guarantee free-of-charge higher education for well-learning citizens. 	Moreover, it is aimed to analyse the dependence of state-funded place and results of an accession to higher education institution. This research paper reviews rulings of the Constitutional Court, that highlights specific moments when student receives and when loses a state-funded place. It is discussed presumptions and circumstances of such actions, analysed the importance of whether the student was enrolled to state-funded or state non-funded studies and part of his/her studies was self-funded for the free-of-charge higher education, in accordance with official doctrine of constitutional court. 	The latest interpretation of Constitutional Court occurred on November, 2014. Meanwhile, the new definition of a good student in the Law on Science and Studies was introduced only in 2016. In the previous versions of Law on Science and Studies the definition of a well-learning student focused on average level of grades. Newest version of Lithuanian Law on Science and Studies defines a well-learning person as a student, who has reached corresponding knowledge level, but not the one who has a specific grade average. In this way, law encodes new paradigm of student evaluation in higher education institutions, shifting from grades to evaluation of level of achievements as interpreted in the recommendations and agreements of Bologna Accord. 	By reviewing the Law on Science and Studies it is analysed how legislature managed to compare and balance two constitutional norms, which are contradictory in themselves. The major goal of analysis of new version of the Law on Science and Studies is to examine whether legislature was successful in finding balance between the order of the state, established in accordance with public needs, and the right of well-learning student for free-of-charge studies. 	The paper also reviews other funding mechanisms, identified in Law on Science and Studies that are directly or indirectly related to constitutional right to free education for well-learning students. It is also discussed the State-supported loans for students and mechanism of reimbursement of a part of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies.</b> By using those two mechanisms legislature aims to consolidate official doctrines established by constitutional court. 	Naturally, the new system raises issues of its application. Considering that in Lithuania student rotation was not implemented for last two years. Moreover, new version of the law will force higher education institutions to perform changes in their inner policies that are related to students’ evaluation and funding of their studies. These policies are particularly important to students who are seeking to obtain or maintain state-funded place. The legislative provisions have given rise to various debates in the state level which focused on its further application. Therefore, it is very important that legally drafted provisions, norms and values would be effectively transposed in the higher education institutions. 	It is clear, that it is very important to review not only how law seeks to advance the official doctrine of Constitutional Court in a new way, but also how higher education institutions are preparing themselves for implementation of this law. In the past, there have been cases, when law rules in higher education institutions are treated differently and this creates unequal opportunities to students to pursue constitutional right to free-of-charge studies. Obviously, this infringes students’ rights and expectation and also discredits existing arrangements. During the implementation of the system’s changes it is necessary to avoid such cases, therefore it is essential to do a prior analysis of the situation. This helps to prevent any possible interpretations of higher education institutions, which in one way or another provides unequal opportunities to students to pursue the constitutional right to free-of-charge studies. 	By analysing provisions of the law and preparedness to apply it in the higher education institutions this research paper aims to reply to the question whether Lithuanian students will have equal rights to gain free-of-charge higher education, which is guaranteed by Constitution irrespective to higher education institution, study programme or form of study funding. It is done by looking up the temporary procedures of higher education institutions and study regulatory documents. On a review of these documents it is summarised the results and its attribution to corresponding skill level, for the purpose of determining whether student meets the term of well-learning student. It is also presented comparison of hypothetical situations on how different calculation methodologies could lead to divergent results for two different students who are in the identical situation. 		Paper includes conclusions and recommendations for legislature and executive authority on possible changes and additional actions, in order to ensure equal opportunities to students to pursue the constitutional right to free-of-charge studies irrespective to higher education institution, study programme or form of study funding...|$|E
