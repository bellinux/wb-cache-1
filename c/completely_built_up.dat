25|$|In 1987, Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their {{operations}} with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With {{the advent of}} Mercosur, the regional common market, Ford {{was finally able to}} rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are built only in Brazil, and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported <b>completely</b> <b>built</b> <b>up.</b> Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right hand drive versions.|$|E

Ballistic missile accuracy is only dependent on the INS accuracy {{up to the point}} when rocket fuel is expended (100 seconds for Agni-II) and it exits the atmosphere (> 90 km altitude), after that the trajectory is purely ballistic that is predetermined and easily computed. INS in a combat aircraft requires continuous operation of IMU and navigation computer throughout the flight during which the error keeps building as IMU sensors drift. A ballistic missile that can update its position and velocity from auxiliary means, can <b>completely</b> eliminate the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> error from INS and continue flight at a precise predetermined path, if necessary correcting the launch error by using: ...|$|R
5000|$|Spiritele anului 3000, {{authored}} when Ionescu {{was just}} 17, {{is thought to}} be one of the first works of science fiction in Romanian literature. Written as a first-person narrative and dream sequence, it depicts its author and main character falling into slumber and awaking on the close of the 30th century. The world he encounters is peopled by humans of a small stature, who reach full maturity at the age of 15. Spiritele anului 3000 is part political satire and part political project. Humanity is unified into a single confederation of republics and administrated from Liberty (a <b>completely</b> new capital <b>built</b> <b>up</b> on an artificial island in the Mediterranean Sea), while monarchies and wars have disappeared altogether. Romania is set [...] "in her natural borders" [...] through the intervention of a Supreme Tribunal, while the Romanian language adopts a form to Ionescu's liking (having shunned the more artificial etymology favored by Transylvanian intellectuals and the Romanian Academy alike). The Romanian climate is improved by afforestation, the country is spanned by canals, and the garden-like Bucharest, over which the narrator and Aru, his friend from the future, fly in a moored balloon, no longer has any churches left standing.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 1960s, Malaysian market Toyota {{models were}} only {{imported}} as <b>completely</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> (CBU) units. By the 1960s, the Malaysian government began to emphasise industrialisation, then {{viewed as a}} more dependable economic sector for employment and economic growth. In May 1964, the Malaysian government enacted a policy to encourage the local assembly of vehicles and manufacturing of automotive components, as per the recommendation of experts from the Colombo Plan. The new policy made <b>completely</b> <b>built</b> <b>up</b> (CBU) cars more expensive through the addition of import duties, and licenses were issued to various car companies {{who were interested in}} setting up local assembly plants. Cars that were locally assembled with Malaysian manufactured components, then limited to low-value parts like tyres, lights and batteries would be granted a reduction in import duty, making them cheaper and more competitive as a result.|$|E
