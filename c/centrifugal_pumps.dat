5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps.</b> They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E

25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps</b> were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E

40|$|Pumps are an {{integral}} part of engineering systems used in power and process industries. Flow through the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> is very complex mainly due to the rotation imposed by the impeller and its interaction with the volute casing.

Cavitation has direct influence on operating stability and service life of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump.</b> The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique is emerging as a useful computational tool for the prediction of pump performance and occurrence of cavitation at different flow conditions.
