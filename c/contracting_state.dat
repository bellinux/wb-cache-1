25|$|In 2003, Russia {{also joined}} the Rome Convention, the {{analogue}} of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003. The Rome convention covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. For phonograms, it stipulated that phonograms {{produced by a}} national of a <b>contracting</b> <b>state,</b> or fixated in a <b>contracting</b> <b>state,</b> or published in a <b>contracting</b> <b>state</b> were covered, but allowed signatory countries to choose among the latter two (article 5). Russia chose to apply the criteria of nationality and publication, declaring the criterion of fixation as inapplicable in its adherence to the treaty. The Rome Convention is non-retroactive and applies only to phonograms created after and to performances or broadcasts that occurred after a country jointed the convention (article 20).|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} easier to enforce {{arbitration}} awards {{in a foreign}} country than court judgments. Under the New York Convention 1958, an award issued in a <b>contracting</b> <b>state</b> can generally be freely enforced in any other <b>contracting</b> <b>state,</b> only subject to certain, limited defenses. Only foreign arbitration awards are enforced pursuant to the New York Convention. An arbitral decision is foreign where the award was made in a state other than the state of recognition or where foreign procedural law was used. In most cases, these disputes are settled with no public record of their existence as the loser complies voluntarily, although in 2014 UNCITRAL promulgated a rule for public disclosure of investor-state disputes.|$|E
25|$|A refugee, {{generally}} speaking, is a {{displaced person}} who has been forced to cross national boundaries and who cannot return home safely (for more detail see legal definition).

40|$|The {{automated}} {{performance monitoring}} of contracts, {{in terms of}} tracking <b>contract</b> <b>state,</b> {{is an important issue}} investigated in this work. We define <b>contract</b> <b>state</b> to be the sum of the normative relations that hold between contract parties.

25|$|The Convention has {{uniform rules}} {{determining}} which country's authorities are competent {{to take the}} necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one <b>Contracting</b> <b>State</b> in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis {{on the need for}} international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{characteristic}} of cross-border enforcement of arbitration awards {{that makes them}} appealing to commercial parties {{is that they are}} not limited to awards of damages. [...] Whereas in most countries only monetary judgments are enforceable in the cross-border context, no such restrictions are imposed on arbitration awards and so it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an injunction or an order for specific performance in an arbitration proceeding which could then be enforced in another New York Convention <b>contracting</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although the Refugee Convention 1951 {{generally}} {{provided that}} <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> should recognise {{those who came}} within its definition as refugees, it did not prescribe how <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> should determine this in order {{to enable them to}} balance this obligation with their national interests. However, evidence from the background and drafting of the Refugee Convention 1951 suggests that the provisions that a <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> would implement in order to protect its interests would be commensurate with the human rights spirit of the treaty. This implied that <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> would act fairly in balancing the competing interests in devising status determination policies and would take into account decent considerations. But, from a theoretical viewpoint, it is arguable that some recent asylum determination policies have been based on the threats posed by asylum seekers. Asylum seekers have come to be blamed for contributing to the national issues that some <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> face and as such, some <b>contracting</b> <b>states</b> have adopted draconian measures as a result. This paper argues that Criminal Law also has an intrinsic nature based on, amongst other things, the need to deter certain forms of harmful conduct on the basis of culpability and, arguably, that some status determination policies are now coming to mirror this...|$|R
