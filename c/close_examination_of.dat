5|$|<b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> {{the inner}} {{region of the}} Andromeda Galaxy with the same {{telescope}} also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|However, a <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the {{excavated}} tracks {{may give}} a more differentiated picture. While there is {{agreement that the}} grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|<b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the {{spectral}} lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, {{which is an}} interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

25|$|This {{term was}} derived from isotopic spin, a {{confusing}} term to which nuclear physicists prefer isobaric spin, which is more precise in meaning.

25|$|Queer {{theory is}} a field of post-structuralist {{critical}} theory {{that emerged in the}} early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies.

25|$|Nevertheless, <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> {{the results}} shows, {{that many of}} them {{contradict}} with laws of physics, which were already known {{at the time of the}} flights. Prof. L.W. Gilbert discussed the results published by Robert in his Annalen der Physik. and showed why Robert was wrong. For example, Robert claimed, that a spring scale with attached weights showed a lower weight at altitude as compared to the ground. Such an effect is existing, but only becomes apparent at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet (20,000 metres).|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} days of the 20 th century Hatshepsut’s {{coronation}} inscription has been thought to be a copy of a Middle Kingdom original. This claim is based on a few mutilated blocks in the Berlin Museum presumably from a temple in Fayyum. However, a <b>closer</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the two texts reveals that they do not use similar phrases and deviate in various other ways as well. Hence the assumption of a textual dependence is rejected.

25|$|A <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> Medieval {{trade in}} Europe shows that {{numerous}} significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism {{and common sense}} called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called commenda, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.|$|E
