40|$|Water {{turbidity}} is {{an important}} characteristic of surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents {{as well as a}} key indicator of water quality. Turbidity is the lack of clarity of water caused by microalgae and other particles that attenuates light. The cost of <b>clarifying</b> <b>water</b> can be high. This is primarily due to the physical and chemical steps that must be taken to remove the extremely small entrained particles and colloidal substances that cause high turbidity, and the large amounts of water that generally must be process for such small masses of entrained materials. This paper discusses the results of a series of experiments of a potentially new method of <b>clarifying</b> <b>water</b> by incorporating microfiltration through a high throughput filter operating under a centrifugal force. The results have shown that significant reductions in turbidity can be achieved at relatively high water flux values through a commercially available filter.

The untreated feed water stream enters {{from the top of the}} vessel and flows down a feed channel underneath the inclined plates.

40|$|In this work, {{the issue}} of how {{pre-filter}} chlorination of drinking water causes an increase in disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation is examined. Chlorination and granular media filtration are two widely used practices in drinking water treatment. It is also common to apply chlorine ahead of the filters. However, this has been shown to elevate disinfection byproducts (DBP) levels. Experiments were performed at full- and bench-scale using filter influent and effluent from working filters and several anthracite/sand filter columns operated in parallel. The filter influent for the bench-scale experiments was <b>clarified</b> <b>water</b> from the Warner Water Treatment Plant operated by the Aquarion Water Company in Fairfield, Connecticut. In several filters, pre-filter chlorine was supplied to the <b>clarified</b> <b>water</b> influent feed line.

Contact with chlorine works to deplete the precursor present from the media surface and leads to subsequent reactions with chlorine, creating DBPs. This effect is eliminated by elimination of chlorine from the influent, where a build-up of NOM can be found on the filter media. 11...|$|E
