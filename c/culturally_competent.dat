25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors.

25|$|A {{healthcare}} system, {{sometimes referred}} to as health system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to meet the health needs of target populations. A <b>culturally</b> <b>competent</b> health system not only recognizes and accepts the importance of cultural diversity at every level but also assesses the cross-cultural relations, stays vigilant towards any changes and developments resulting from cultural diversity, broadens cultural knowledge, and adapts services to meet the needs that are culturally-unique.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{competence}} {{is defined as}} a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become <b>culturally</b> <b>competent</b> include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural self-assessment, being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.|$|E

2500|$|Patient-Physician {{communication}} involves two sides. While {{physicians and}} other healthcare providers are being encouraged or {{required to be}} <b>culturally</b> <b>competent</b> in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures.

They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services.

40|$|Undocumented end stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) {{patients}} in the United States only have access to emergency dialysis. To compensate {{for the lack of}} regular dialysis these patients must follow strict renal dietary restrictions. However, nutrition counseling by a dietitian {{is not part of the}} renal management of patients on emergency dialysis. The purpose of this quantitative quasi-experimental treatment-control study was to assess how the application of nutritional counseling that is both <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>competent</b> affects dialysis frequency and biochemical lab values such as serum potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin D of patients in emergency dialysis. The study was grounded on the social cognitive theory and consisted of a secondary data analysis of information collected from electronic medical records. The sample size consisted of 96 emergency dialysis patients, 51 from the intervention group, and 45 from the control group. Results from Quade 2 ̆ 7 s test revealed there is statistically significant difference in serum levels of phosphorus [F(1, 94) = 9. 616, p = 0. 003] and levels of Vitamin D [F(1, 94) = 51. 411, p =. 000] between the intervention and control groups, controlling for age, gender, and time on dialysis. These findings suggest the implementation of nutrition counseling that is both <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>competent</b> can improve phosphorous and vitamin D levels among emergency dialysis patients. The potential social change implication of this study is that its findings may serve to assist health care professionals to design and implement interventions to improve the health status of emergency dialysis patients and reduce their impact on the public health system...|$|R

40|$|Healthy People 2010 sets {{elimination}} of health disparities {{as a key}} goal for the United States (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000).

While a large body of literature on the general theory and methods of developing health promotion messages and materials exists, a paucity of its content addresses specific approaches effective with diverse populations. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on how to assure that health promotion materials reflect the principles and practices of cultural and linguistic competence.

The Guide is designed to be used by a variety of audiences, including: those who implement health promotion activities and want to ensure cultural and linguistic competence; community organizations, including faith-based organizations, that want to address health issues and public health officials and funders who want to assure that health promotion activities they support are <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>competent.</b> The Resources section o...|$|R
