5|$|The {{chemically}} resistant (but expensive) fluorinated ionomers {{are used as}} electrochemical cell membranes, of which {{the first and most}} prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based chloralkali process cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are <b>crosslinked</b> fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E

25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then <b>crosslinked</b> at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a <b>crosslinked</b> network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{long-range}} <b>crosslinks</b> are induced in Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA by far-UV irradiation. <b>Crosslinking</b> {{patterns in}} two other organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Thermus aquaticus, were investigated {{to determine if the}} number and location of <b>crosslinks</b> in E. coli occur because of unusually photoreactive nucleotides at particular locations in the rRNA sequence. Thirteen long-range <b>crosslinks</b> in B. subtilis and 15 long-range <b>crosslinks</b> in T. aquaticus were detected by gel electrophoresis and 10 <b>crosslinks</b> in each organism were identified completely by reverse transcription analysis. Of the 10 identified <b>crosslinks</b> in B. subtilis, eight correspond exactly to E. coli <b>crosslinks</b> and two <b>crosslinks</b> are formed close to sites of <b>crosslinks</b> in E. coli. Of the 10 identified <b>crosslinks</b> in T. aquaticus, five correspond exactly to E. coli <b>crosslinks,</b> three are formed close to E. coli <b>crosslinking</b> sites, one <b>crosslink</b> corresponds to a UV laser irradiation-induced <b>crosslink</b> in E. coli and the last is not seen in E. coli. The overall similarity of <b>crosslink</b> positions in the three organisms suggests that the <b>crosslinks</b> arise from tertiary interactions that are highly conserved but with differences in detail in some regions...|$|R

50|$|In genetics, <b>crosslinking</b> of DNA {{occurs when}} various {{exogenous}} or endogenous agents react with two different {{positions in the}} DNA. This can occur in either the same strand (intrastrand <b>crosslink)</b> or in the opposite strands of the DNA (interstrand <b>crosslink).</b> <b>Crosslinks</b> also occur between DNA and protein. DNA replication is blocked by <b>crosslinks,</b> which cause replication arrest and cell death if the <b>crosslink</b> is not repaired.|$|R

25|$|Capping only {{occurs on}} motile cells and is {{therefore}} believed to reflect an intrinsic property of how cells move. It is an energy dependent process and in lymphocytes is partially inhibited by cytochalasin B (which disrupts microfilaments) but unaffected by colchicine (which disrupts microtubules). However, {{a combination of these}} drugs eliminates capping. A key feature of capping is that only those molecules that are <b>crosslinked</b> cap: Others do not.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} patches are moved {{to the rear of the}} cell by direct attachment to the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanism for how this could be achieved is unclear, since, when glycolipids or GPI-bound proteins (in the outer monolayer of the cell's surface bilayer) are <b>crosslinked,</b> they cap, just like any surface protein. As these molecules cannot themselves interact directly with the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton, this scheme seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be <b>crosslinked</b> peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E
40|$|The hydroxypyridinium (HP) <b>crosslink</b> is the {{predominant}} non-reducible collagen <b>crosslink</b> in heart. HP concentration in left ventricle (LV) increases progressively throughout life, and this increase {{is thought to}} reflect the slower turnover of collagenous proteins seen with aging, allowing mature extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen to <b>crosslink</b> more heavily. There are also species differences {{with higher levels of}} <b>crosslinking</b> found in the hearts of larger mammals including humans, compared to smaller mammals such as the rat. Marked deviations from normal in the concentration of this <b>crosslink</b> are implicated in a variety of left ventricular hypertrophies and altered ventricular function. Interestingly these deviations may be bi-directional in nature, ranging from an apparent lack of the <b>crosslink</b> in a mouse cardiomyopathy model, to a doubling in HP concentration in viable myocardium post-infarction. This review outlines the major pathway involved in the formation of myocardial collagen <b>crosslinks.</b> Possible mechanisms by which rate of <b>crosslink</b> formation and deposition are regulated will be discussed, and functional implications of altered <b>crosslinking</b> patterns addressed.

40|$|We {{have used}} photo-crosslinking to {{investigate}} the structure and dynamics of four-way junction hairpin ribozyme constructs. Four phenylazide photo-crosslinkers were coupled to 2 ′-NH 2 -modified U+ 2 in the substrate and irradiated at different Mg 2 + concentrations and temperatures. Consistent {{with the role of}} divalent metal ions in hairpin ribozyme folding, we observed more interdomain <b>crosslinks</b> in the presence of Mg 2 + than in its absence. In general, we observed intradomain <b>crosslinks</b> to nucleotides 2 – 11 and interdomain <b>crosslinks</b> to the U 1 A binding loop. <b>Crosslinks</b> to A 26 and G 36 in domain B were also observed when <b>crosslinking</b> was carried out at − 78 °C. In contrast to <b>crosslinking</b> results at higher temperatures (0, 25 and 37 °C), similar <b>crosslinks</b> were obtained in the presence and absence of Mg 2 + at − 78 °C, suggesting Mg 2 + stabilizes a low-energy hairpin ribozyme conformation. We also evaluated the effects of photo-crosslinker structure and mechanism on <b>crosslinks.</b> First, most <b>crosslinks</b> were to unpaired nucleotides. Second, shorter and longer photo-crosslinkers formed <b>crosslinks</b> to intradomain locations nearer to and farther from photo-crosslinker modification, respectively. Finally, fluorine substitutions on the phenylazide ring did not change the locations of <b>crosslinks,</b> but rather decreased <b>crosslinking</b> efficiency. These findings have implications for the use of phenylazide photo-crosslinkers in structural studies of RNA...|$|R

25|$|An {{intramolecular}} cyclization {{reaction is}} where the growing polymer chain reacts with a vinyl functional group on its own chain, rather than with another growing chain in the reaction system. In this way the growing polymer chain covalently links to itself in a fashion {{similar to that of}} a knot in a piece of string. As such, single chain cyclized/knotted polymers consist of many of these links (intramolecularly cyclized), as opposed to other polymer architectures including branched and <b>crosslinked</b> polymers that are formed by two or more polymer chains in combination.|$|E
25|$|Collagen {{hydrolysis}} {{is performed}} {{by one of}} three different methods: acid-, alkali-, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully <b>crosslinked</b> materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in bovine hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the gelatin industry, the gelatin obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin and the gelatin obtained from alkali-treated raw material {{is referred to as}} type-B gelatin.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xc): The crosslinking of polyethylene is {{also possible}} by a downstream radiation source (usually a electron accelerator, occasionally a isotopic radiator). PE products are <b>crosslinked</b> below the crystalline melting point by splitting off hydrogen atoms. β-radiation possesses a penetration depth of 10 mm, ɣ-radiation 100mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the crosslinking. However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation crosslinking plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide crosslinking. In contrast to peroxide crosslinking, the process is {{carried out in the}} solid state. Thereby, the cross-linking takes place primarily in the amorphous regions, while the crystallinity remains largely intact.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{our recent}} work on linear viscoelasticity, large deformation behaviour and fracture properties of self-recovery dual <b>crosslink</b> gels having covalent and reversible <b>crosslinks.</b> The breakage of transient <b>crosslinks</b> dissipates strain energy and enhances the fracture toughness and extensibility of the gels.

25|$|Papillomaviruses {{replicate}} {{exclusively in}} keratinocytes. Keratinocytes form the outermost {{layers of the}} skin, {{as well as some}} mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The cell layers are formed through a process known as cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, <b>crosslinked</b> surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.|$|E
25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed.

The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|E
25|$|Alkylating {{agents are}} the oldest group of {{chemotherapeutics}} in use today. Originally derived from mustard gas used in World War I, {{there are now}} many types of alkylating agents in use. They are so named because {{of their ability to}} alkylate many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. This ability to bind covalently to DNA via their alkyl group is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects. DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate <b>crosslinked</b> DNA during cell division, or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.|$|E

For electrospun polyelectrolytes, a post-spinning <b>crosslinking</b> process is necessary for producing a hydrogel. Typically, radiation or thermal <b>crosslinking</b> routines are employed that require multifunctional <b>crosslinking</b> molecules and <b>crosslink</b> reaction initiators (free radical producers). Here, ultraviolet subtype-C (UVC) radiation was employed to <b>crosslink</b> neat poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) nanofibres and films to different <b>crosslink</b> densities.

The fibres could be reversibly swollen/contracted by treatment with solutions of varying pH, demonstrating their potential as artificial muscles.

25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be <b>crosslinked</b> to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
500|$|The cyclol {{hypothesis}} {{is the first}} structural model of a folded, globular protein. [...] It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions.

[...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds.

[...] These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. [...] Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of these sensors, however, rely on entrapping the protein in hydrogels, as these are more sturdy and [...] protect the protein {{more than a simple}} coating or membrane.

In the case of protein, they can work either by physically entrapping the protein having pores smaller than the proteins or by chemical linkage of the protein to the matrix. In physically entrapping gels, the protein has to be added when the gel is <b>crosslinked,</b> so the conditions used must not damage the protein, excluding the hydrogel, which requires non-aqueous solvents or harsh chemicals, an example being TEMED-persulphate-catalysed (peroxide radical initiation) acrylamide or acrylate, which is used for SDS PAGE but for not protein encapsulation.|$|E
