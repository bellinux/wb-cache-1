500|$|During the {{campaign}} that preceded the 1960 U.S. Presidential election, both candidates—Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy—made campaign stops in Alaska. Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, [...] "I see the greatest dam {{in the free world}} at Rampart Canyon, producing twice the power of the Tennessee Valley Authority to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska." [...] Nixon, arriving three months after Kennedy, said, [...] "As far as Rampart Canyon Dam is concerned, <b>certainly</b> <b>you</b> can expect progress, more progress, I believe, in our administration than his".|$|E
500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity. This is exemplified when Hogarth says to the Giant [...] "You are who you choose to be". McCanlies commented that [...] "At a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out {{for the rest of your}} life." [...] McCanlies added that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would [...] "make us feel like we're all part of humanity [...] is something we need to feel." [...] When some critics compared the film to [...] (1982), Bird responded by saying [...] "E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay. <b>Certainly</b> <b>you</b> risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} his hopes for fan {{reaction to the}} second season's emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: [...] "I'll be curious {{to know what the}} audience's perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked." [...] In response to fans' concerns that Voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous Star Trek installments, he believed that the growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show's futuristic storylines, explaining: [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} who don't consider a lot [...] science fiction." [...] He followed this up by saying: [...] "But <b>certainly</b> <b>you</b> can make a case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling." [...] Taylor viewed the second season as focused on [...] "character-driven, introspective" [...] stories, with a majority of the [...] "action-adventure" [...] aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.|$|E

6000|$|Cecily. I wish Uncle Jack {{would allow}} that unfortunate young man, his brother, {{to come down}} here sometimes. We might have a good {{influence}} over him, Miss Prism.

6000|$|... "But that <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> did, for <b>you</b> {{spent the}} whole morning in Edgar's Buildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and I am pretty sure that you and John {{were alone in the}} parlour some time before you left the house." ...|$|R
