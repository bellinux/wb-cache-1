2500|$|The first {{inversion}} in {{roller coaster}} history {{was part of}} the Centrifugal Railway of Paris, France, built in 1848. It consisted of a 43-foot (13-meter) sloping track leading into a nearly circular vertical loop 13 feet (3.9 m) in diameter. During the early 1900s, many rides including vertical loops appeared around the world. These early loops had a major design flaw: the circular structure produced intense g-forces (hereafter [...] "Gs"). The Flip Flap Railway, designed by Lina Beecher and built in 1895 on Coney Island of Brooklyn, United States, had a 25-foot circular loop at the end which though initially popular caused some discomfort in passenger's necks, and the ride soon closed. Loop the Loop, another looping coaster, was built later in Coney Island as well. This time the loops were slightly oval-shaped rather than circular, though not <b>clothoid</b> in shape like modern loops. Although the ride was safe, it had a low capacity, loading four people every five minutes (48 people per hour, compared to 1800 riders per hour on Corkscrew, an early modern coaster that opened in 1976), and was poorly received after the discomfort of the Flip Flap Railway. As their novelty wore off and their dangerous reputation spread, compounded with the developing Great Depression, the early looping coasters faded and disappeared.|$|E

Understanding the generated optical flow may help in lessening simulator sickness. Two experiments {{were designed to}} investigate the perceived optical flow in different driving environments using two driving simulators: 1) a fixed base simulator and 2) a turning cabin simulator whose turning cabin rotates around the y-axis. In the first experiment, the perception of optical flow when making left/right turns was studied using both simulators. Results revealed that subjects experienced a higher amount of optical flow when making right turns then left turns. In addition, the optical flow perceived by drivers in the fixed base simulator was greater than that in the turning cabin simulator. We designed the second experiment to investigate the optical flow perceived when driving straight ahead, driving on circular curves, and driving on curves with transitions (<b>clothoids).</b> Again, two simulators were used. The amount of optical flow was highest when driving on circular curves, and was lowest when driving straight ahead. While using the turning cabin simulator, the degree of optical flow decreased greatly on circular curves, and curves with <b>clothoids</b> as compared {{to that in the}} fixed base simulator.

50|$|On the way up, {{from the}} bottom {{to the top of}} the loop, gravity is in {{opposition}} to the direction of the cars and will slow the train. The train is slowest at the top of the loop. Once beyond the top, gravity helps to pull the cars down around the bend. If the loop's curvature is constant, the rider is subjected to the greatest force at the bottom. If the curvature of the track changes suddenly, as from level to a circular loop, the greatest force is imposed almost instantly (see jerk). Gradual changes in curvature, as in the <b>clothoid,</b> reduce the force maximum (permitting more speed) and allow the rider time to cope safely with the changing force.|$|E
50|$|Lapbars {{were first}} used in 1907 with the Coney Island coaster, Drop the Dip. Lapbar {{restraints}} {{consist of a}} padded bar mounted to the floor or side of the train that swings backwards into the rider's lap. These restraints are usually found on roller coasters that lack inversions. Some inverting roller coasters, notably ones created by Anton Schwarzkopf safely operate {{without the need for}} shoulder restraints. Historically, inverting roller coasters with lapbars could only perform vertical loops, as the higher centripetal force (and low lateral force) exerted while traversing a simple <b>clothoid</b> loop helps to keep riders safely in the train. However, with modern advances in engineering, more roller coasters with complicated inversions are able to run without over-the-shoulder restraints. For example, most of Premier Rides' LIM-launched roller coasters (the vast majority of which have multiple inverting elements) operate with only lapbars. Lapbar restraints, like buzz bars give the rider much greater freedom of movement than over-the-shoulder restraints, enhancing the feeling of danger for some.|$|E

For a racing slalom ski, {{this can be}} as low as 12 metres and for Super-G it is normally 33 metres.Sidecut {{is the extent to}} which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arcing, hourglass-like curve that runs along a ski’s edges from tip to tail. This curve dictates how skis turn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that matches the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance, with a radial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius will perfectly fit the curvature of the sidecut. This particular radius is the given specification from the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. Mathematical functions, such as a parabola or a <b>clothoid,</b> are often used to describe the curvature of a sidecut. Also, multiple radii are stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.|$|E
