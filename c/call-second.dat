5000|$|In telecommunication, a <b>call-second</b> is a unit used {{to measure}} {{communications}} traffic density.|$|E
5000|$|Note 1: A <b>call-second</b> is {{equivalent}} to 1 call {{with a duration of}} 1 second.|$|E
50|$|Hence, in {{a one-hour}} period: 1 CCS = 100 <b>Call-Seconds</b> = 1/36 erlangs.|$|R
50|$|Note 3: The acronym CCS (Centum Call Seconds) {{is often}} used to {{describe}} 100 <b>call-seconds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note 5: 3600 <b>call-seconds</b> {{per hour}} = 36 CCS per hour = 1 call-hour per hour = 1 erlang = 1 traffic unit.|$|R
5000|$|Note 2: One user making two 75-second calls is {{equivalent}} to two users each making one 75-second call. Each case produces 150 <b>call-seconds</b> of traffic.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{mathematical}} theory of probability, offered load {{is a concept}} in queuing theory. The offered load {{is a measure of}} traffic in the queue. The offered load is given by Little's law: the arrival rate into the queue (symbolized with λ) multiplied by the mean holding time (symbolized by τ), the average amount of time spent by items in the queue. Offered load is expressed in Erlang units or <b>call-seconds</b> per hour, a dimensionless measure.|$|R
40|$|Three {{fixed service}} {{telecommunications}} demand assessment studies were completed for NASA by The Western Union Telegraph Company and the U. S. Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. They provided forecasts {{of the total}} U. S. domestic demand, from 1980 to the year 2000, for voice, data, and video services. That portion that is technically and economically suitable for transmission by satellite systems, both large trunking systems and customer premises services (CPS) systems was also estimated. In order to provide a single set of forecasts a NASA synthesis of the above studies was conducted. The services, associated forecast techniques, and data bases employed by both contractors were examined, those elements of each judged {{to be the most}} appropriate were selected, and new forecasts were made. The demand for voice, data, and video services was first forecast in fundamental units of <b>call-seconds,</b> bits/year, and channels, respectively. Transmission technology characteristics and capabilities were then forecast, and the fundamental demand converted to an equivalent transmission capacity. The potential demand for satellite-provided services was found to grow by a factor of 6, from 400 to 2400 equivalent 36 MHz satellite transponders over the 20 -year period. About 80 percent of this was found to be more appropriate for trunking systems and 20 percent CPS...|$|R
