25|$|Hill's easy wit {{and charm}} helped him become a {{television}} personality, notably on the BBC show <b>Call</b> <b>My</b> Bluff with Patrick Campbell and Frank Muir. For {{a number of}} years in the early 1970s he appeared as one half of a double act, with Jackie Stewart, as an insert within the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show.

His appearance was later rebroadcast as part of the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the programme in January 1995, with Damon presenting a new segment at the end.|$|E
25|$|BBC Two was {{launched}} in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found {{a place in the}} weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included Man Alive, <b>Call</b> <b>My</b> Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test, Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Money Programme. When BBC Two became the first British channel to broadcast in colour in 1967, Attenborough took advantage by introducing televised snooker, as well as bringing rugby league to British television on a regular basis via the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Several {{years as}} party leader earned Salmond {{an unusually high}} profile for an SNP {{politician}} in the London-based media. In 1998, Salmond won the Spectator Award for Political Strategist of the Year. Following an appearance on the entertainment programme <b>Call</b> <b>My</b> Bluff, Salmond used one of the 'bluff' cards that are used as props in the show {{in the run-up to}} the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. To counter his frustration at having to sit in silence through what he claimed was an inappropriately political speech by Tony Blair at a charity lunch, he held up the bluff card as the Prime Minister began querying Scotland's economic prospects should independence occur. Throughout his time in politics, Salmond has maintained his interest in horse racing, writing a weekly column for The Scotsman and appearing a number of times on Channel 4's The Morning Line. During the election campaign, Salmond was photographed feeding a young supporter a Solero ice cream during an event at Stirling University, creating a photograph that would become iconic.|$|E

500|$|Miyazaki forgoes {{traditional}} screenplays in his productions, instead {{developing the}} film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. [...] "We {{never know where}} the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops," [...] he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to [...] "enrich the visual look", though he ensures that each film can [...] "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and {{still be able to}} <b>call</b> <b>my</b> films 2D". He oversees every frame of his films.|$|E

Jackson was awarded the Vanguard Award at the 19th annual GLAAD Media Awards, honoring her contributions in promoting equal rights among the gay community. The organization's president commented, [...] "Ms. Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out, and having her stand with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely significant." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning. With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} not comfortable with the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you <b>call</b> <b>my</b> name, It's like a little prayer, I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the dual meaning referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to <b>call</b> <b>my</b> own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered different {{interpretations of the}} music video and its story line. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line [...] "I hear you <b>call</b> <b>my</b> name, And it feels like.... Home" [...] is played. The women of Italian East Harlem in New York call their Church as la casa di momma (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church. This divine aspect is further explored by Nicholas B. Dirks, author of Culture/power/history, who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that [...] "Madonna is really not putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one." ...|$|E

[...] Discussing her casting a year into her time on the show, Lewington assessed: [...] "I enjoy it more as I wade through the years. As with any ensemble work, the more time spent as a team, working together and discovering each others rhythms, dynamics and struggles, the better. And because of that, more fun. I certainly feel more settled and confident. Part of something. It was all a bit daunting for a while." ...|$|E
