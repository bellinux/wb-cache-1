40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} study of the humidity-sensitive {{electrical}} properties of TiO 2 :WO 3 thick films. Prototype sensors have been prepared by depositing an emulsion of TiO 2 and WO 3 powders in acetone with <b>cellulous</b> glue onto an alumina substrate, by a spin coating technique using a low spreading speed (125 r. p. m.). Films were prepared with five different atoms proportions of Ti and W: 100 : 0, 100 : 1, 100 : 6, 100 : 18 and 100 : 36. The oxides thick films were successively fired a...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{examples}} of filled <b>cellulous</b> and the high filled polymer it was shown that mechanical behavior of polymeric materials depends substantially on the loading rate or the strain rate. The change of mechanical characteristics of filled <b>cellulous</b> with increasing of the strain rate in the interval from 7 · 10 - 6 to 700 s- 1 {{is related to the}} change of dominating mechanisms of the resistance to deformation and fracture of material. The transition from viscous failure to brittle fracture is occurred at increasing of strain rate to several hundreds of inversed seconds. The criterion of the long-time resistance of polymeric materials was suggested. This criterion was based on the evaluation of the damage of the material. The damage increment was defined as the relation of the strain energy increment to value of the fracture energy at appropriate rate of deformation. The experimental verification of this criterion was carried out for the investigated materials as at tension so at complex stress state by the results of the tests with stepwise change of strain rate. The comparison of suggested criterion with well-known deformational criterion was carried out on the base of obtained experimental data It was shown that suggested criterion can be used for evaluation of time to fracture of polymeric materials at complex programs of loading with changing of strain rate in wide range...|$|E
40|$|Cleaning mural {{paintings}} using microemulsions {{were applied}} {{by means of}} export poultice technique (50 : 50) mixture of Arbocel BC 1000 and Arbocel BC 200 (type of pure <b>cellulous</b> fibers). The cleaning fluid is added to pure cellulose until the saturation of pulp is converted into compress which apply to the cleaned surface. In current study, three global successful microemulsions were chosen {{to be used in}} cleaning models of fresco paintings from the monastery of saint Jeremiah using three kinds of available local low cost pulps (paper pulps – cotton fiber – wood mulch (sawdust)) instead of the Arbocel. The results are supported by optical microscope, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for the poultices after treatment to define the sol-ubilizing spots in the compresses after treatment. The paper pulp is the most successful compress as it con-tained the wax and glue spots with the three kinds of microemulsions compared to sawdust and cotton fiber...|$|E
40|$|Conference Name: 8 th Annual IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems, IEEE NEMS 2013. Conference Address: Suzhou, China. Time:April 7, 2013 - April 10, 2013. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC); Peking University; Soochow University; Chinese Academy of SciencesEthyl <b>cellulous</b> (EC) fibrous {{films were}} {{fabricated}} via electrospinning from solutions with various DMF/acetone volume ratios and the hydrophobic properties were investigated. The morphology of electrospun EC films reveals a conversion from beads to uniform nanofibers by decreasing the DMF/acetone ratio. Pure DMF solution leads to bead structures while uniform nanofibers {{can be obtained}} from DMF/acetone ratio of 2 / 3. The fibrous surfaces of electrospun EC films greatly improve their hydrophobicity with the average water contact angles range from 138 ° to 151 °, exceeding that of spin-coating film (59 °). The highest contact angle (151 °) was found on the bead-on-string films prepared from the solution with DMF/acetone ratio of 4 / 1. For this hydrophobic capacity, the electrospun EC films would broaden their applications in the fields of coating and encapsulation. ? 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) released from biomass burning have multiple {{effects on the}} Earth's biogeochemical cycle, climate change, and ecosystem. These effects depend on the relative abundances of C and N species emitted, which vary with fuel type and combustion conditions. This study systematically investigates the emission characteristics of biomass burning under different fuel moisture contents, through controlled burning experiments with biomass and soil samples collected from a typical alpine forest in North America. Fuel moisture in general lowers combustion efficiency, shortens flaming phase, and introduces prolonged smoldering before ignition. It increases emission factors of incompletely oxidized C and N species, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (NH 3 ). Substantial particulate carbon {{and nitrogen}} (up to 4 times C in CO and 75 % of N in NH 3 ) were also generated from high-moisture fuels, maily associated with the pre-flame smoldering. This smoldering process emits particles that are larger and contain lower elemental carbon fractions than soot agglomerates commonly observed in flaming smoke. Hydrogen (H) /C ratio and optical properties of particulate matter from the high-moisture fuels show their resemblance to plant <b>cellulous</b> and brown carbon, respectively. These findings have implications for modeling biomass burning emissions and impacts...|$|E
40|$|Electrospinning of biopolymers {{has gained}} {{significant}} {{interest for the}} fabrication of fibrous mats for potential applications in tissue engineering, particularly for wound dressing and skin regeneration. In this study, for the first time, we report successful electrospinning of chitosan-based biopolymers containing bacterial <b>cellulous</b> (33 wt %) and medical grade nanodiamonds (MND) (3 nm; up to 3 wt %). Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy showed that long and uniform fibers with controllable diameters from 80 to 170 nm were prepared. Introducing diamond nanoparticles facilitated the electrospinning process with {{a decrease in the}} size of fibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy determined hydrogen bonding between the polymeric matrix and functional groups of MND. It was also found that beyond 1 wt % MND, percolation networks of nanoparticles were formed which affected the properties of the nanofibrous mats. Uniaxial tensile testing of the woven mats determined significant enhancement of the strength (from 13 MPa to 25 MP) by dispersion of 1 wt % MND. The hydrophilicity of the mats was also remarkably improved, which was favorable for cell attachment. The water vapor permeability was tailorable in the range of 342 to 423 µg·Pa− 1 ·s− 1 ·m− 1. The nanodiamond-modified mats are potentially suitable for wound healing applications...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} the therapeutic effect of autologous peripheral {{blood stem cell}} transplantation (APBSCT) in combination with rituximab in treatment of CD 20 + B <b>cellulous</b> non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Methods　Sixty patients with CD 20 + aggressive or refractory and recurrent B-NHL and treated with APBSCT in our department from Jan. 2005 to Jan. 2011 were admitted. All the subjects were divided into 2 groups {{according to their own}} choice: 25 patients received rituximab treatment (treatment group) and 35 patients were treated without rituximab treatment (control group). All patients underwent chemotherapy and APBSCT. For patients in treatment group, rituximab was used with CHOP before collecting the stem cells and after the transplantation. After transplantation, rituximab and IL- 2 were used in treatment group every 3 - 6 months as maintenance treatment. Results　No side effect was observed during the use of rituximab either before or after transplantation. The mononuclear cell count in treatment and control group was (8. 2 ± 2. 9) × 108 /kg and (8. 4 ± 3. 9) × 108 /kg (P= 0. 822), respectively; CD 34 +cell count was (12. 3 ± 12. 7) × 106 /kg and (13. 2 ± 13. 9) × 106 /kg (P= 0. 799), respectively. Haemopoiesis reconstruction was successfully achieved in the patients of treatment group, while 3 patients in control group failed to have haemopoiesis reconstruction. No significant difference was found between two groups on the recovery time of neutrophilic granulocytes and platelets. All patients achieved complete remission. The average follow-up time was 22 months. The disease relapsed in two patients in treatment group and six in control group. The 3 -year overall survival rate in treatment group (91. 6 %) was a little higher than that in control group (69. 5 %, P= 0. 060). Conclusion　To patients of CD 20 + B lymphoma, the use of rituximab shows no side effect before or after collection of stem cell and hemopoiesis reconstruction, and the overall survival rate may be improved...|$|E
