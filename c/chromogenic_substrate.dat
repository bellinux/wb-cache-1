50|$|In the {{clinical}} assay, a known quantity of ecarin {{is added to}} the plasma of a patient treated with hirudin. Ecarin activates prothrombin through a specific proteolytic cleavage, which produces meizothrombin, a prothrombin-thrombin intermediate which retains the full molecular weight of prothrombin, but possesses a low level of procoagulant enzymatic activity. Crucially, this activity is inhibited by hirudin and other direct thrombin inhibitors, but not by heparin. The ECT is also unaffected by prior treatment with coumadin or the presence of phospholipid-dependent anticoagulants, such as lupus anticoagulant. Thus, the ECT is prolonged in a specific and linear fashion with increasing concentrations of hirudin. An enhancement of the ECT is the ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) in which diluted sample is mixed with an excess of purified prothrombin and the generated meizothrombin is measured with a specific <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate.</b> This assay shows no interference from prothrombin or fibrinogen in the sample and is suitable for the measurement of all direct thrombin inhibitors Lange U, Nowak G, Bucha E.

50|$|The {{effects of}} LMWHs cannot be acceptably {{measured}} using the {{partial thromboplastin time}} (PTT) or activated clotting time (ACT) tests. Rather, LMWH therapy is monitored by the anti-factor Xa assay, measuring anti-factor Xa activity. The methodology of an anti-factor Xa assay is that patient plasma is added to a known amount of excess factor X and excess antithrombin. If heparin or LMWH {{is present in the}} patient plasma, it will bind to antithrombin and form a complex with factor X, inhibiting it from becoming factor Xa. The amount of residual factor Xa is inversely proportional to the amount of heparin/LMWH in the plasma. The amount of residual factor Xa is detected by adding a <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> that mimics the natural substrate of factor Xa, making residual factor Xa cleave it, releasing a colored compound that can be detected by a spectrophotometer. Antithrombin deficiencies in the patient do not affect the assay, because excess amounts of antithrombin is provided in the reaction. Results are given in anticoagulant concentration in units/mL of antifactor Xa, such that high values indicate high levels of anticoagulation and low values indicate low levels of anticoagulation.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{analytical}} {{methods used to}} study the pharmacokinetics of recombinant hirudin in the plasma of rats that had been injected with (125) I-recombinant hirudin. METHODS: 2. 0 mg/kg (125) I-recombinant hirudin were injected intravenously into rats. The recombinant hirudins in the plasma was analyzed by <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), total radioisotope assay (RA) and trichloroacetic acid pre-treated total radioisotope assay (TCA-RA). RESULTS: The <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> assay standard curve was linear over the concentration range from 3. 12 to 40. 00 ng/ml for the recombinant hirudin in plasma. The relative standard deviations (RSD) for the intra- and inter-day variation were 5. 0 to 6. 3 % and 11. 9 to 12. 6 %, respectively. The recoveries of recombinant hirudin was 89. 8 % to 100. 7 %. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 3. 12 ng/ml. The concentration-time curve of the recombinant hirudin in the plasma could be explained as a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the half-life of distribution phase (t 1 / 2 α), the half-life of elimination phase (t 1 / 2 β), volume of apparent distribution (Vd), and area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinite time (AUC 0 -t) were 7. 59 min, 46. 99 min, 0. 17 L/kg, and 204. 5 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> assay; 6. 41 min, 47. 28 min, 1. 24 L/kg, and 575. 18 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by ELISA; 3. 69 min, 701. 90 min, 0. 04 L/kg, and 4189 mg/L/min, respectively as determined by RA; and 4. 57 min, 724. 9 min, 0. 09 L/kg, and 2329 mg/L/min, respectively, as determined by TCA-RA. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> assay on the concentration dynamics of the recombinant hirudin in the plasma is a specific, sensitive, and accurate analytical method for pharmacokinetic studies.

For assay, diluted urethral samples and <b>chromogenic</b> <b>substrate</b> were added directly to single-test LAL vials, and objective color endpoint determinations were made visually after a 10 -min incubation period at 37 degrees C.
