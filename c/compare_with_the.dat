In study 1, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DB group, the water group had a greater decrease in weight (1. 2 kg more weight loss in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P= 0. 015), BMI (0. 5 kg/m² more BMI reduction in <b>the</b> water <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P= 0. 002), fasting insulin (1 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in <b>the</b> water <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (0. 2 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> water <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and 2 -h postprandial glucose(0. 305 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> water <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001).

There was also a greater reduction in fasting insulin levels (1. 8 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), better improvement in HOMA-IR (0. 5 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001), a greater decrease in 2 -h postprandial plasma glucose (0. 5 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and glycated hemoglobin (0. 2 more HbA 1 c reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 030) in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs over 18 months.

Also reduction of fasting insulin (1. 6 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), fasting plasma glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more Fasting plasma glucose reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 003), HOMA-IR (0. 7 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 003) and 2 hour postprandial glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> water group <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 027) was greater in the water group. By contrast, changes in waist circumference and lipid profiles {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups in these three studies. Replacement of DBs <b>with</b> water after <b>the</b> main meal in obese and overweight healthy and type 2 diabetic women who were regular users of DBs may cause greater weight reduction during 24 weeks and also in the longer period of an 18 month weight management program. In addition, replacement of DBs with water offers clinical benefits to improve insulin resistance. Generally, better improvements in energy and carbohydrate metabolism may occur when water rather than DBs is consumed over a weight loss program...|$|R

5|$|The earlier {{of known}} records of {{commercial}} hunting of killer whales {{date to the}} 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, {{and the difficulty of}} taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (<b>Compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.|$|E
