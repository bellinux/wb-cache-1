50|$|An {{image is}} {{projected}} through a lens onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge {{proportional to the}} light intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, whereas a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has {{been exposed to the}} image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which converts the charge into a voltage. By repeating this process, the controlling circuit converts the entire contents of the array in the semiconductor to a sequence of voltages. In a digital device, these voltages are then sampled, digitized, and usually stored in memory; in an analog device (such as an analog video camera), they are processed into a continuous analog signal (e.g. by feeding the output of the <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier</b> into a low-pass filter), which is then processed and fed out to other circuits for transmission, recording, or other processing.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{and analysis of}} low level vibrations and Acoustic Emissions in components, fabrications and structures, is often accomplished by the utilisation of multiple distributed piezoelectric sensors. The frequencies of interest usually commence in the upper audio range above 2 kHz, but are more typically ultrasonic frequencies (up to 1 MHz). Such measurements are intrinsically limited {{in terms of their}} dynamic range due to the signal to noise ratio of the overall system (comprising the transducer and front end signal amplification, together with associated interconnection cables). This paper demonstrates that the latest bipolar operational amplifier technologies (rather than traditional FET technologies) can provide a better solution at higher frequencies in these ultra low noise systems, whilst still delivering the high gain bandwidth needed. This paper also presents a comparative noise analysis for the three principle operational amplifier circuit topologies commonly utilised for piezoelectric sensors: (single ended <b>charge</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> differential <b>charge</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and voltage mode amplifiers). The effects of transducer cables and system configuration are also considered from the noise perspective. The theoretical analysis has been verified by practical experiment...|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} {{development of the}} medical nuclear imaging, the low noise performance {{has always been a}} mandatory requirement {{in the design of the}} semiconductor pixelated radiation detector system in order to achieve the high detectability of the charge signal. The noise-optimized analog front-end signal processing channel composed of the <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier</b> and the pulse shaper is used extensively in processing the radiation charge signals from the pixelated semiconductor detector. The existing noise optimization methodology only deals with the major noise contributors such as the input transistor in the <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier.</b> However, as CMOS technologies progress deeper into the submicron range, the power supply voltages are decreasing and hence, the noise contributions of the secondary noise sources such as the current source transistor in the <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier</b> are increasing. This thesis presents a noise optimization methodology for the current source transistors in the <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier</b> that will complement the existing noise optimization methodology. Using IBM 130 nm CMOS technology, the proposed current source transistor noise optimization methodology has been applied to design a noise optimized <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier.</b> With the low single channel power consumption in the range of a few mW, the analog front-end signal processing channel features a noise optimized <b>charge</b> sensitive <b>amplifier</b> and a first order CR-RC pulse shaper with short peaking time. The results of the pre-layout and the post-layout simulations make the design a very good candidate for the low-power system integration. Future directions for this thesis are now being considered, which include designing the additional analog-to-digital block for the signal extraction circuitry as well as developing the complete and optimized layout for the targeted 16 analog front-end signal processing channels...|$|R

While subsequently head of the Instrumentation Lab at the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, Winterthur, he pioneered a new measurement technology using Piezo-electric quartz crystals as the transduction element in accelerometers, load cells, and pressure gauges. This new technology {{was made possible by}} Kistler’s invention of a <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier</b> that could handle the very high impedance signals obtained from such sensors. For these achievements, he would in 1980 receive the prestigious Albert F. Sperry Award from the Instrument Society of America (ISA).|$|E
50|$|Zeroed {{impedance}} uses an inverting (usually op-amp) amplifier with enormously {{high gain}} Av → ∞. The output voltage is almost {{equal to the}} voltage drop VZ across the impedance and completely neutralizes it. The circuit behaves as a short connection and a virtual ground appears at the input; so, {{it should not be}} driven by a constant voltage source. For this purpose, some circuits are driven by a constant current source or by a real voltage source with internal impedance: current-to-voltage converter (transimpedance amplifier), capacitive integrator (named also current integrator or <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier),</b> resistance-to-voltage converter (a resistive sensor connected in the place of the impedance Z).|$|E

Hans Conrad Sonderegger {{is the father of}} the current (2010) CEO. In 1959 the company became active on the stock market. Since 1961 the company started the in house production of charge amplifiers and the development of other sensors. The company made several major innovations, some of which would be put to use in the Apollo manned spaceflights, and became a world leader in the development of quartz sensors. Kistler left the company in 1970 and moved to Seattle, Washington.|$|E

Normally this then goes to discrimination circuits or a multi channel analyzer.|$|R

50|$|A current {{integrator}} is {{an electronic}} device performing a time integration {{of an electric}} current, thus measuring a total electric charge. A <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is an example of}} current integrator. A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a Faraday cup in a residual gas analyzer to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in ion beam deposition, where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the ions is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to be connected to the ion source and the substrate, closing the electric circuit which in part is given by the ion beam.|$|E
50|$|While {{passing through}} the detector, a {{particle}} will ionise the gas atoms by pulling up an electron creating an electron/ion pair (1). When no electric field is applied, the ion/electron pair recombines and nothing happens. But here, within an electric field {{in the order of}} 400 V/cm the electron will drift (2) toward the amplification electrode (the mesh) and the ion toward the cathode. When the electron arrives close to the mesh (3), it enters an intense electric field (typically on the order of 4 kV/cm in the amplification gap).Accelerated by this field, the electron reaches enough energy to produce ion/electron pairs that will also ionise the gas, creating pairs; it’s the avalanche effect (4). By this means, several thousand pairs are created from hundreds of primary charges, which originate from the interactions with the impinging particle. The primary charges need to be multiplied to create a significant signal. A last, we read the electronic signal on the readout electrode (5) by a <b>charge</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The readout electrode is usually segmented in strips and/or pixels in order to obtain the position of the impinging particle in the detector. The amplitude and the shape of the signal, read via the electronic on the readout electrode, gives information on the time and energy of the particle.|$|E

Useful for dynamic/frequent measurements of force. Most applications for piezo-based load cells are in the dynamic loading conditions, where strain gauge load cells can fail with high dynamic loading cycles.It must be remembered that the piezoelectric effect is dynamic, that is, the electrical output of a gauge is an impulse function and is not static. The voltage output is only useful when the strain is changing and does not measure static values.However, depending on conditioning system used, [...] "quasi static" [...] operation can be done.Using a so-called [...] "Charge amplifier [...] " [...] with [...] "Long" [...] time constant allow accurate measurement lasting many hours for large loads to many minutes for small loads.Another advantage of Piezoelectric load cell, conditioned with a <b>Charge</b> <b>amplifier,</b> is the wide measuring range that can be achieved.Users can choose a load cell {{with a range of}} hundred of kN and use it for measuring few N of forces with the same Signal/Noise ratio, again this is possible only {{with the use of a}} [...] "Charge amplifier" [...] conditioning.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine origins of {{electronic}} noise in a 127 -micron pixel {{thin film transistor}} (TFT) /photodiode image sensor array. The imaging array is a 1536 data line by 1920 gate line amorphous Silicon (a-Si) sensor array connected to low noise <b>charge</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and 14 -bit electronics. We measure the contributions of A/D converters, <b>charge</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> data-line resistance and capacitance, and pixel switching to the overall electronic noise of 1040 e- per pixel. Noise power spectra are evaluated for each dark offset image. When suitably filtered linear power supplies are used for supplying gate and bias voltages to the array, the noise power spectra are identical in the x and y directions, i. e., row correlated noise is negligible. Noise measurements taken under different band-pass conditions correlate well with data-line resistance generated Johnson noise. No variations in noise along the data lines and a slight reduction in noise along the gate lines suggest only small transmission line effects. Pixel noise was measured {{as a function of}} frame time, yielding a component of noise due to TFT switching and a frame time dependent component modeled as pixel leakage current shot noise. It was found that this shot noise current was three times higher than leakage currents derived from dark offset difference images...|$|R

Example calculations are given to illustrate our approach. Experimental results are given that demonstrate that one can construct complete systems, from detector through data analysis, that come near the theoretical limits...|$|R
