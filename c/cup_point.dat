Five days later he was instrumental in ensuring the All Whites drew 1–1 with reigning champions Italy, making several acrobatic saves. His good form meant that he started the final group game against Paraguay on 24 June, but despite pulling off more excellent saves and keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw, the All Whites were unable to reach the last 16.|$|E

5000|$|Knurl {{point set}} screws {{should not be}} reused because the cutting edges of the knurls are {{deflected}} when tightened. During removal, the cutting edges are torn and no longer have full strength to resist unscrewing. ISO standard for Knurled <b>cup</b> <b>point</b> set screw is ISO 4029 ...|$|E
50|$|Knurl point screws are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the knurl cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging {{action of the}} <b>cup</b> <b>point</b> with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|E
50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the <b>cup</b> <b>point.</b> This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the <b>cup</b> <b>point</b> offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated lock washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|E
