Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children.

However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech about the way he let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in.

25|$|Scientific {{management}} {{may have}} exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: {{the erosion of}} employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were {{made possible by the}} deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the knowledge transfer that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages just described.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wider}} countercultural {{context of the}} time, with disillusion {{increasingly}} rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, {{in the words of}} Rolling Stone, [...] "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties".

[...] Among Harrison's biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as [...] "the George Harrison Moment", while Gary Tillery has written: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as something more than just a major celebrity...

500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{describes}} the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as [...] "very emotional". The concerts {{took place at}} Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as {{the first part of}} his fundraising program for the 8–10 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public, encouraged Harrison to feel [...] "very positive about certain things". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison [...] "slightly enraged", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had [...] "changed the perception" [...] of rock musicians, [...] "making it clear they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> world citizens too", while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's [...] "cautious yet optimistic and tender" [...] worldview: [...] " [...] stood {{in stark contrast to the}} ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture." [...] The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.|$|E
