40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{a method for}} {{continuously}} coating copper on steel wire is heing developed. The pre-treated steels have made to run horizontally through various cells containing cleaning solution, pickling solution, strike bath and plating hath. After a thin coat of nickel, the steel wil-e was plated using an acid copper bath. A single strand horizontal wire plating unit was fabricated for the purpose. Hull Cell was used to optimise the operating conditions of the selected bath. The current efliciency {{of the process and}} the electrical resistivity of the <b>coated</b> <b>wires</b> were also measured.

[...] Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both knitting flat or knitting in the round. [...] The two tapered ends, typically 4–5 inches (10.5–13cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or <b>coated</b> <b>wire).</b> [...] The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from [...] to [...] or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. [...] The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.|$|E

50|$|In this process, a wire (or {{bundle of}} wires) is {{preheated}} to above the glass transition or melting {{temperature of the}} polymer coating {{that is to be}} applied. This is to ensure adhesion of the new coating. Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire. Due to the geometry of the dies used, relatively high extrusion rates are possible while still avoiding melt fracture. The newly <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> is then drawn through an air or gas flame to smooth the surface of the coating, and finally a water bath to fully cool the <b>coated</b> <b>wire.</b> Coated wires are now spooled to prepare for further processing, if desired.|$|E

30|$|In the past, <b>coated</b> {{esthetic}} <b>wires</b> {{have been}} used as archwires, fixed retainers [7], and to reinforce anchorage [8], but such wires have higher friction (archwires), and the esthetic coating tend to dehisce {{over a period of time}} [9 – 17]. Also, <b>coated</b> <b>wires,</b> being opaque, cause no tooth color transmission through these wires. The FRPC archwire, being translucent in nature, allows tooth color transmission, thereby improving esthetics. Aforementioned phenomenon is particularly beneficial in cases where ceramic/tooth colored brackets are used in conjunction with FRPC wires for orthodontic treatment. Moreover, allergic reactions to nickel [18 – 21], a metallic ion found commonly in contemporary metallic archwires, is averted with the FRPC archwire.|$|R

40|$|Comparison of {{frictional}} forces between aesthetic orthodontic <b>coated</b> <b>wires</b> and self-ligation brackets Objective: The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of polymer- and rhodium-coated wires compared to uncoated wires by measuring the {{frictional forces}} using self-ligation brackets. Methods: 0. 016 -inch nickel titanium (NiTi) wires and 0. 017 × 0. 025 -inch stainless steel (SS) wires were used, and the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to 0 o, 5 o, and 10 °.

40|$|The {{experimental}} investigations on {{the electrical}} explosion of aluminum, silver, tungsten and platinum wires are carried out. The {{dependence of the}} parameters related to the specific energy deposition on the primary material properties is investigated. The polyimide coatings are applied to enhance the energy deposition for the exploding wires with percent of vaporized energy less than unit. The characteristics of the exploding wires of different materials with and without insulating coatings are studied. The effect of wire length on the percent of vaporization energy for exploding <b>coated</b> <b>wires</b> is presented. A laser probe is employed to construct the shadowgraphy, schlieren and interferometry diagnostics. The optical diagnostics demonstrate the morphology of the exploding products {{and structure of the}} energy deposition. The influence of insulating coatings on different wire materials is analyzed. The expansion trajectories of the exploding wires without and with insulating coatings are estimated from the shadowgram. More specific energy is deposited into the <b>coated</b> <b>wires</b> of shorter wire length, leading to faster expanding velocity of the high-density products...|$|R

50|$|This type of weld {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} with an arc or MIG welder. It {{can also be}} accomplished by brazing. With arc welding, after the butt weld is complete, the weld itself needs to be struck with a hammer forge to remove slag (a type of waste material) before any subsequent welds can be applied. This is not necessary for MIG welds however, as a protective gas removes any need for slag to appear. Another with a MIG welder is that a continuous copper <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> is fed onto the stock, making the weld virtually inexhaustible.|$|E

50|$|Irwin {{moved on}} to {{landscape}} projects after developing a stylistic move towards experiential space, projecting what he learned about line, color, and most of all, light onto the built environment. Since 1975 Irwin has conceived of fifty-five site projects. 9 Spaces 9 Trees (1980-3) was originally commissioned in 1980 for the rooftop of the Public Safety Building by the Seattle Arts Commission; it was re-imagined in 2007 and sited on campus at the University of Washington. Irwin's Filigreed Line (1979) made for Wellesley College, Massachusetts, consists of a stainless steel line, running along a ridge of grass near a lake, in which a pattern of leaflike forms is cut. His 1983 work Two Running Violet V Forms, two crossing blue-violet, plastic <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> fences fixed with high poles, is featured {{as part of the}} Stuart Collection of public artwork {{on the campus of the}} University of California, San Diego.

5000|$|An {{inductor}} usually {{consists of}} a coil of conducting material, typically insulated copper wire, wrapped around a core either of plastic or of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material; the latter is called an [...] "iron core" [...] inductor. Since power inductors require high induction levels, high permeability and low saturation points in the core materials are not ideal. The high permeability of the ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are constructed like transformers, with cores of electrical steel laminated to prevent eddy currents. 'Soft' ferrites are widely used for cores above audio frequencies, since they do not cause the large energy losses at high frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes. Most are constructed as enamel <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> (magnet wire) wrapped around a ferrite bobbin with wire exposed on the outside, while some enclose the wire completely in ferrite and {{are referred to as}} [...] "shielded". Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a ferrite bead on a wire.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{advantages}} of <b>coated</b> orthodontic <b>wires</b> such as esthetic {{and their effects}} on reduced friction, corrosion and allergic reaction and the significant consequences of plaque accumulation on oral health encouraged us to assess bacterial colonization on these wires. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 (9 upper and 9 lower) epoxy resin coated 16 × 22 nickel-titanium wires (Spectra, GAC, USA) and 18 (9 upper and 9 lower) non-coated 16 × 22 nickel-titanium wires (Sentalloy, GAC, USA) with isolated packages were selected and sterilized before application. The samples were divided randomly between upper and lower arches in 18 patients and hence that every patient received one coated and one uncoated wire at the same time. Samples were removed and cut in equal lengths after 3 weeks and placed in phosphate buffered saline buffer. After separation of bacteria in trypsin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, the diluted solution was cultured in blood agar and bacterial colony forming units were counted.
