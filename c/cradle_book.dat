5000|$|William McDonough and his {{architecture}} and urban design firm, William McDonough + Partners, ground {{their work in}} Cradle to Cradle Design, a philosophy developed by McDonough and German chemist Dr. Michael Braungart in their 2002 <b>book,</b> <b>Cradle</b> to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. The goal is to frame design as [...] "a beneficial, regenerative force—one that seeks to create ecological footprints to delight in, not lament." ...|$|R

50|$|The ScanRobot SR301 has a claimed {{operating}} speed of 2400 pages per hour. The book scanner scans two pages {{at once and}} turns the pages automatically using a vacuum {{to pick up the}} pages and using an air flow to turn the pages.If a book is opened by 180° for the digitization often the binding becomes broken. To avoid such damage the ScanRobot uses a wooden made <b>book</b> <b>cradle</b> with a 60° opening angle. In this way the books are handled carefully, avoiding stress in the binding.|$|R
30|$|To ensure safe {{handling}} throughout the analyses, a supportive <b>book</b> <b>cradle</b> was specially {{designed to fit}} the equipment geometries while making certain that the binding was not put under strain, that the particular folio being analyzed would lie flat horizontally, and that the entire manuscript was well supported. The open manuscript volume was secured to the cradle with polyethylene strips. During infrared imaging, the same cradle and strapping technique were used, but the cradle was placed vertically so the manuscript page being documented was positioned normal to the camera.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{difficulty}} inherent in recycling {{comes from the fact}} that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of sustainable design aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the <b>book</b> <b>Cradle</b> to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things by architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart. They suggest that every product (and all packaging they require) should have a complete [...] "closed-loop" [...] cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through biodegradation or be recycled indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|Johannes Gutenberg {{was named}} on 17 January 1465 a courtly nobleman by the Archbishop and Elector Adolph II of Nassau, {{who at the}} time resided in the Electoral castle at Eltville. Presumably under Gutenberg's guidance, the Brothers Bechtermünz founded a small {{printing}} shop. This published in 1467 the Vocabularius ex quo, a Latin dictionary. In this workshop, Thomas Aquinas's Summa de articulis fidei (1472) was also reprinted. This made Eltville one of the <b>cradle</b> towns of <b>book</b> printing. In the castle tower, a memorial recalls Gutenberg. Gutenberg's brother, Friele Gensfleisch, lived in Eltville from 1434 until his death in 1447. The Gensfleisch-Haus still stands today right next to the castle.|$|R

[...] Encouraged by the fact that Harlequin thought her plotting had promise, Warren continued writing. Her next two manuscripts did not satisfy her, but she sent her fourth attempt back to Harlequin. The manuscript was shuffled through the different Harlequin lines before being purchased on April 19, 1999 by the Harlequin SuperRomance line.|$|R

50|$|Upcycling is {{the title}} of the German edition of a book first {{published}} in English in 1998 by Gunter Pauli under the title Upsizing (the opposite of downsizing). The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the Volkshochschule in Osnabruck. The concept was later incorporated by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 <b>book</b> <b>Cradle</b> to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea behind}} DuraBooks came to Melcher {{when he saw}} an article about women who enjoy reading in the bathtub. Together with his former {{production}} director, Andrea Hirsh, he settled on a synthetic variant of paper that consists of polypropylene and inorganic fillers rather than wood fibers, {{as well as a}} waterproof binding sewn with special thread and adhered with special non-toxic glue. The first book in the DuraBook format was Aqua Erotica, a racy collection of original fiction published by a division of Random House in 2000, while Melcher’s patent was still pending. Several titles have followed, including Cradle to <b>Cradle,</b> the bestselling <b>book</b> that uses the DuraBook format because of its positive environmental impact, and The Beach Book, an anthology of contemporary literary fiction set on beaches around the globe.|$|R
50|$|Flatbed {{scanners}} {{often come}} in contact with {{at least part of the}} object to be scanned. They also require books to be fully opened most of the time (there are some exceptions where the scanning surface ends at the edge of the flatbed scanner, so that a book can be opened partially). Both practices can damage rare books; For example, opening a book 180 degrees can be damaging to its spine. These scanners are also implemented to scan other fragile documents such as old maps. However, planetary scanners that allow the book to open to a full 180 degrees have special features that protect the book binding from being damaged. Many of those scanners are equipped with self-balancing <b>book</b> <b>cradles,</b> gaps for the binding to be placed in, and pressure-sensitive glass controls. It is argued that by opening the book to a full 180 degrees and using scan glass, the scanner is able to capture further into the binding than those using a V cradle.|$|R

5000|$|Cradle-to-cradle {{design is}} a popular {{environmental}} approach to product design that seeks to eliminate waste by designing products that can be continuously recirculated through our economy. This is contrasted against a [...] "cradle to grave" [...] design which typically includes single use products or products made of multiple different materials that cannot be separated {{in order to be}} recycled properly.5 Cradle to Cradle design is mimicked after processes in the natural environment which do not create waste but instead every output is an input for another organism. Cradle to Cradle design is often achieved through using environmentally friendly resources (non-toxic) that can either be recycled into other products or composted. Another important component of cradle to cradle design is the ability to easily take products apart for better reuse as well as designing with durability in mind. This idea was popularized by the 2002 <b>book</b> <b>Cradle</b> to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things written by William McDonough and Michael Braungart.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} way to display bound {{materials}} is closed and lying horizontally. If a volume is shown open, the object {{should be open}} {{only as much as}} its binding allows. Common practice is to open volumes at an angle no greater than 135°. [...] There are some types of equipment that help support volumes as they displayed openly: blocks or wedges, which hold a book cover to reduce stain at the <b>book</b> hinge; <b>cradles,</b> which support bound volumes as they lay open without stress to the binding structure; and polyester film strips, which help to secure open leaves. Textblock supports are best used in conjunction with <b>book</b> <b>cradles</b> where the textblock is greater than 1/2 inch, or where the textblock noticeably sags. Regardless of its method of support, however, {{it is worth noting that}} any book that is kept open for long periods can cause damage. One should turn an exhibited book's pages every few days in order to protect pages from overexposure to light and spread any strain on the binding structure.|$|R
40|$|Sustainable Business: Key Issues is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} introductory-level textbook to address the interface between environmental challenges and business solutions to {{provide an overview of}} the basic concepts of sustainability, sustainable business, and business ethics. The book introduces students to the background and key issues of sustainability and suggests ways in which these concepts can be applied in business practice. Though the book takes a business perspective, it is interdisciplinary in its nature and draws on knowledge from socio-economic, political, and environmental studies, thereby providing a practical and critical understanding of sustainability in the changing paradigm of global business. It goes beyond the conventional theories of sustainability and addresses critical issues concerned with population, consumption and economic growth. It discusses realistic ways forward, in particular the Circular Economy and Cradle to <b>Cradle</b> frameworks. The <b>book</b> is both a theoretical and practical study guide for undergraduate and postgraduate international students of broad areas of sustainability, teaching ways to recognize opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship at the intersection of environmental, economic, ethical, and social systems. It takes a strategic approach in applying the power of business methods and policy to address issues of global importance such as climate change, poverty, ecosystem degradation and human rights. This textbook is essential reading for students of business, management and sustainability courses. It is written in an engaging and accessible style, with each chapter including case studies, discussion questions, end of chapter summaries and suggestions for further reading...|$|R
2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered quill in her proper right hand and an open <b>book</b> <b>cradled</b> {{in the crook of}} her proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed in front of her body, horizontal to her waist. She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|R
40|$|More {{than ten}} years ago, a first image {{digitisation}} product was published by the National Library of the Czech Republic in co-operation with an almost unknown small software company. It was a CD-ROM requested by UNESCO for its Memory of the World programme. After {{that there were many}} tests concerning digitisation devices and another two CD-ROM projects were completed to present two interesting manuscripts with rich description metadata related to all the structural levels of the book, including full text. In 1995 - 1996, our first digitisation centre was built to process manuscripts and old printed books. Later, it was upgraded several times with additional devices such as scanners, <b>book</b> <b>cradles</b> for careful document fixation, sophisticated camera stands, microclimate control units, etc. Simultaneously, many software tools were developed to assist the digitisation production. The co-operation with the company became crucial for further development of this activity and both the library and the company grew thanks to each other. In 1999, another project started to output digital data: it was based on the idea of safeguarding acid-paper library materials through preservation microfilming combined with digitisation of microfilm for access purposes. In {{order to be able to}} store large amounts of image data produced by this second programme, a mass storage facility was plugged into the digitisation production line. It was based on robotic library using magnetic tapes as storage medium. Successively, the digitisation programmes began to be used also by other Czech institutions holding rare collections of documents: other libraries, museums, archives, and even castle libraries and church institutions. Today, from all the digitised documents almost half of them are from other institutions than the National Library. This is an important success that has taken place thanks to support of the Ministry of Culture through specific grant programmes. Interested institutions can ask the Ministry for up to 70 % of the total digitisation cost for their projects with which they apply in calls for proposals...|$|R
40|$|Building, {{supported}} by the practice of architecture, is churning resources into waste at an alarming rate. Our method of construction has its inevitable conclusion {{in a pile of}} rubble. Lamentably, the natural resources we build with are finite, and our exploitation of these has nearly reached its peak. As humanity strives for a renewable energy future, architecture must engage in the renewable use of materials. In the long term future, architects need to design buildings so their materials can be recovered, refurbished and reused. Principles for designing in circular life cycles were laid out by McDonough and Braungart in their 2002 <b>book,</b> <b>Cradle</b> to Cradle. [1] In more than a decade since the book was published, {{there is little evidence that}} the process of architecture has changed to support design for disassembly and the reuse of materials. This thesis aims to outline a method of design for material reuse that supports a healthy circular flow of material life, death and rebirth. World Expositions have become the epitome of disposable architecture, with renowned architects designing pavilions with an intended life span of six months. This thesis proposes a transformation of the Expo type from an endgame of waste to one of reuse. A contemplated Expo Toronto in 2025 provides the opportunity to reclaim a reputation for showcasing the future. The proposed brief for such an Expo challenges countries to exhibit stories of regeneration in an event built on the theme of reuse and recycling. The Expo is an ideal venue for the design of prototype pavilions assembled out of renewable and reusable materials. This thesis proposes two pavilion types, which at the Expo’s conclusion will be immediately reused in communities across Canada. The first type is designed to be entirely recycled when it is no longer needed. The second pavilion type is assembled of material which can be composted, returning nutrients to the soil. The resulting buildings will be adaptable to change, reusable in parts, and return their materials to circular flows at end of life...|$|R
