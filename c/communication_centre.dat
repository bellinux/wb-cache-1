25|$|Immediate German {{propaganda}} claims {{following the}} attacks and post-war discussions {{on whether the}} attacks were justified {{has led to the}} bombing becoming one of the moral causes célèbres of the war. A 1953 United States Air Force report defended the operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target, which they noted was a major rail transport and <b>communication</b> <b>centre,</b> housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers in support of the German war effort. Several researchers have asserted that not all of the communications infrastructure, such as the bridges, were targeted, nor were the extensive industrial areas outside the city centre. Critics of the bombing have claimed that Dresden was a cultural landmark of little or no strategic significance, and that the attacks were indiscriminate area bombing and not proportionate to the military gains. The bombing has been referred to by some in the German far-right as a war crime.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of Nexus, a secret military <b>communication</b> <b>centre</b> in Karen, Nairobi. The Government spent Sh2.6 billion (US$36.9 million) {{to construct the}} complex. Three years later, military personnel have not moved into the centre. A phantom company, Nedermar BV Technologies, which {{is said to have}} its headquarters in the Netherlands, implemented the secret project situated along Karen South Road. Nedermar is linked to businessman Anura Pereira. However, Pereira has denied this. The tendering process for the Nexus project was circumvented as DoD's Departmental Tender Committee. Funding for the project was made through the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The complex is currently headed by Colonel Philip Kameru. Nexus was first meant to be an ammunition dumpsite before it was turned into a military communication and operations centre. Construction continued without any site visits by either the DoD staff or Ministry of Public Works officials. The Nexus project was implemented during the tenure of General Joseph Kibwana.|$|E
500|$|It {{had several}} {{security}} zones. Sperrkreis 1 (Security Zone 1) was {{located at the}} heart of the Wolf's Lair. Ringed by steel fencing and guarded by RSD and FBK men, it contained Hitler's bunker and ten other camouflaged bunkers built from [...] thick steel-reinforced concrete. Sperrkreis 2 (Security Zone 2) surrounded the inner zone. This area housed the quarters of several Reich ministers, the HQ personnel, two messes, a <b>communication</b> <b>centre,</b> as well as the military barracks for the FBB. Sperrkreis 3 (Security Zone 3) was a heavily fortified outer security area which surrounded the two inner zones. It was defended by land mines and the FBB, which manned guard houses, watchtowers and checkpoints. Despite the security, the most notable assassination attempt against Hitler was made at the Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{divisions}} made rapid progress, {{with little}} opposition. The 19th Division in particular, under Major General [...] "Pete" [...] Rees was approaching the vital rail centre of Indaw, [...] east of Sittaung, after only five days. Slim realised {{at this point}} that his earlier assumption that the Japanese would fight forward of the Irrawaddy was incorrect. As only one of IV Corps' divisions had so far been committed, he was able to make major changes to his original plan. The 19th Division was transferred to XXXIII Corps, which was to continue to clear the Shwebo plain and attack towards Mandalay. The remainder of IV Corps, strengthened by Fourteenth Army's reserve divisions, was switched from the army's left flank to its right. Its task was now to advance down the Gangaw Valley west of the Chindwin, cross the Irrawaddy near Pakokku and seize the vital logistic and <b>communication</b> <b>centre</b> of Meiktila by a rapid armoured thrust. To persuade the Japanese that IV Corps was still advancing on Mandalay, a dummy corps HQ was set up near Sittaung. All radio traffic to 19th Division was relayed through this installation.|$|E

2500|$|A multi-option poll by Near East Consulting (NEC) in November 2007 {{found the}} bi-national {{state to be}} less popular than either [...] "two states for two people" [...] or [...] "a Palestinian state on all {{historic}} Palestine" [...] with only 13.4% of respondents supporting a binational solution. However, in February 2007, NEC found that around 70% of Palestinian respondents backed the idea when given a straight choice of either supporting or opposing [...] "a one-state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews have equal rights and responsibilities". In March 2010, {{a survey by the}} Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found that Palestinian support had risen to 29 percent. In April 2010, a poll by the Jerusalem Media and <b>Communication</b> <b>Centre</b> also found that Palestinian support for a [...] "bi-national" [...] solution had jumped from 20.6 percent in June 2009 to 33.8 percent. If this support for a bi-national state is combined with the finding that 9.8 percent of Palestinian respondents favour a [...] "Palestinian state" [...] in [...] "all of historic Palestine", this poll suggested about equal Palestinian support for a two-state and one-state solution in mid-2010. In 2011, a poll by Stanley Greenberg and the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and sponsored by the Israel Project revealed that 61% of Palestinians reject a two state solution, while 34% said they accepted it. 66% said the Palestinians’ real goal should be to start with a two-state solution but then move to it all being one Palestinian state.|$|E
