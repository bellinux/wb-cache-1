50|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>gas</b> {{molecules}} {{are used}} as scaffolds for nanocluster synthesis in solid state. In aqueous medium there are two common methods for stabilizing nanoclusters: electrostatic (charge, or inorganic) stabilization and steric (organic) stabilization. Electrostatic stabilization occurs by the adsorption of ions to the often-electrophilic metal surface, which creates an electrical double layer. Thus, this Coulomb repulsion force between individual particles will {{not allow them to}} flow freely without agglomeration. Whereas on the other hand in steric stabilization,the metal center is surrounded by layers of sterically bulk material. These large adsorbates provide a steric barrier which prevents close contact of the metal particle centers.|$|E

Mobile cryogenics container tank has been designed for transportation of LNG as well as other liquefied <b>cryogenic</b> <b>gases</b> with the temperature down to – 196 °C. The analysis included two types of logistics solutions: one involving the transport full container, which is removable from the vehicle and left in the workplace, and the second solution with reloading from mobile tank into simplified container tank or other mobile tank located in the workplace. Simplified container tank and mobile tank have been designed to storage some <b>cryogenics</b> <b>gases</b> as well as mobile container but without transportation of them.

The flow and heat transfer characteristics around the evaporating <b>cryogenic</b> <b>gas</b> {{in such a}} medium were analyzed based on the VOF (Volume of Fluid) method. The thermal leakage through the porous medium to the outer shell was then analyzed using heat transfer considerations. To support the numerical results, an experiment was then performed using LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) as the fluid and glass wool as the porous medium. The numerical results for the outer shell temperature predict the experimental values well. Based on the validated numerical results, the transient behavior of temperature distribution in outer shell is analyzed. The effect of crack size on the reliability of insulation system is investigated.

Helium is one of these <b>cryogenic</b> <b>gases</b> which liquefy at 4. 2 K. Helium is very costly gas so we use this in any industry in closed cycle manner. Helium goes down to the 4. 2 K so we can use it in different processes.

In this age the micro-tube heat exchanger are used for heating or cooling of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>gases.</b> In this work we tried to find out the most suitable material, suitable thickness of microtube with the help of change in different parameters. In this work, a two dimension numerical study is carried out to study the effect of axial wall conduction in fully heated circular microtube (in conjugate heat transfer mode) subjected to constant wall heat flux at the outer surface. A microtube of inner diameter of 0. 4 mm and total length of 60 mm is considered in the numerical modeling. The cross sectional surfaces of the microtube are keeps adiabatic.
