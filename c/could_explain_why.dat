5|$|This {{activity}} <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> {{the pyramid}} complex of Unas was {{the object of}} restoration works under the impulse of Prince Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II (12791213 BC).|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{theories}} of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff {{said that the}} Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin.

50|$|No {{one could}} come up with a good reason for this event, which they all found very disturbing. Nor <b>could</b> anyone <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the Monument-Makers were inhabiting a station of such {{inferior}} technology.|$|R
5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> he was succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, {{he found that}} water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
60|$|April 2.--I {{wrote the}} lady as civilly as I <b>could,</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> I made no further apology, which may do some good. Then a cursed morning of putting to rights, which drives me well-nigh mad. At {{two or three}} I must go to a funeral--a happy and {{interesting}} relief from my employment. It is a man I am sorry for, who married my old servant, Bell Ormiston. He was an excellent person in his way, and a capital mason--a great curler.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary reason}} Wood gave for {{changing}} her findings was her {{realization that the}} microscopic slides of the popliteal vein and the photographs of muscle tissue in the surrounding area provided evidence of trauma which <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> the thrombus formation. She <b>could</b> not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> {{she had not seen}} this before.|$|R
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} genomic {{diversity}} mapping {{would be in}} disease research.

5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of Þórfinnr's {{power in the}} Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038. Just as Echmarcach may have seized upon Knútr's demise to expand, {{it is possible that the}} vacuum caused by Knútr's death allowed Þórfinnr to prey upon the Irish Sea region. Certainly, the corresponding annal-entry of the Annals of Tigernachstating that Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) succeeded Echmarcach as King of Dublin that yearappears to indicate that Echmarcach had been forced from the kingship. Ímar appears have been a descendant (possibly a grandson) of Amlaíb Cuarán, and thus a close relative of the latter's son, Sitriuc, whom Echmarcach drove from the kingship only two years before. It is possible that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in England, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr Knútsson <b>could</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. The fact that Ímar proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin. Whatever the case, Ímar's reign lasted only eight years. In 1046, the Annals of the Four Masters records that he was expelled by Echmarcach, who was then elected king by the Dubliners. The Annals of Tigernach, on the other-hand, simply state that Echmarcach succeeded Ímar.|$|E

25|$|A hyper-vigilant state {{created in}} the {{midbrain}} may further contribute to hallucinations.
