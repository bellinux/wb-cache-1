25|$|The {{southern}} room (called {{the dining}} room or the palladian room), was public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable rococo design. The fireplace wall has an ornate <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b> On {{either side of the}} fireplace are beaufats, these ones with shallower shelves than in the little parlour, and no doors. Classical broken pediments top the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and the beaufats. The floor was made of carefully matched blind-doweled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut entry doors. During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated paper covered the thin pine paneling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.|$|E
25|$|In {{the front}} parlor the {{fireplace}} has its original wooden mantelpiece and <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b> The rear has been reconfigured, with some doors and walls removed. Upstairs is another original newel post, {{and some of}} the original lath and plaster on the walls. The basement has also been modified, but may have contained the original kitchen and dining room.|$|E
25|$|Above Taylor's vaulted kitchen, {{between the}} Pillared Room and the State Dining room, Soane created a Smaller Dining Room (sometimes called the Breakfast Room) that still exists. To build it, Soane removed the chimney {{from the kitchen}} to put a door in the room. He then moved the chimney to the east side, running a Y-shaped split flue inside the walls up either side {{of one of the}} windows above. The room {{therefore}} has a unique architectural feature: over the fireplace there is a window instead of the usual <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The central square {{is made up}} of two 4 in {{leaves of}} {{brickwork}} with a 4 in cavity, which is used for chimney flues and warm air ducting, to heat rooms without fireplaces. The double wall eliminates the need for projecting <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{has a similar}} plan but with higher {{ceilings}} in the parlors. Both also have plaster cornices; medallions seem to be missing but remain in the stair hall. <b>Chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> in both rooms have been stripped of their original plaster. The window surrounds, paneling beneath the windows and flooring are all original.|$|R
2500|$|The {{house at}} Poreč typifies {{the nature of}} the few stone houses {{remaining}} of this period in that the main living quarters were on the first floor, elevated above a basement or [...] "undercroft", and accessed by an external stone staircase. The house at Poreč has another feature also seen in England, an external <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> projects from the upper storey directly above a doorway.|$|E
2500|$|... 16 April: Thérèse Siegenthaler, (21). A {{sociology}} {{student at}} Greenwich Community College. Siegenthaler was abducted by the Wests as she hitchhiked from South London to Holyhead. Fred mistook her distinct Swiss accent to be a Dutch one, and always {{referred to her}} as either [...] "the Dutch girl" [...] or [...] "Tulip". She was reported missing to Scotland Yard by her family in Switzerland when communication from their daughter ceased. Fred would later further conceal Siegenthaler's remains by building a false <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> atop her grave.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{externally}} clad in {{red brick}} and tiles, the chapel is completely timber-framed. [...] The entrance {{is at the}} east end and is framed by a porch with columns of the Tuscan order, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "over-broad". [...] Above this, three evenly spaced sash windows, an oculus and the stone tablet sit below the gable. [...] A <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> extends up the west wall. [...] The roof is covered with slate tiles and has a small boxlike louvred projection, topped with a pyramid-style cap, in the middle. [...] There are four pairs of sash windows {{in the north and}} south walls, which are faced with mathematical tiles and slates respectively.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{resistant}} plaster is {{a building}} material used for coating walls and <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts.</b> Its {{purpose is to}} replace conventional gypsum plasters {{in cases where the}} temperature can get too high for gypsum plaster to stay on the wall. Heat resistant plaster should be used in cases where the wall is likely to exceed temperatures of 50 °C.|$|R
50|$|The town is {{surrounded}} by wooded hillsides and was {{the seat of the}} Dukes of Rohan from the 13th to 15th century. The old castle was destroyed in the building of new houses and many townhouses contain parts of <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts,</b> turret stones and gateway posts. The most impressive sight is the 14th century Porterie - the entrance to what was the old castle.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} layout comprises four {{substantial and}} two smaller rooms {{either side of}} a central corridor on the ground floor, and four large and two small bedrooms on the upper floor. The entrance hall has frescos on the walls and ceilings, and is divided with a decorative arch. The rooms throughout the ground floor contain marble <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> and rich plaster work and cornices. The joinery appears to be primarily cedar.|$|R
2500|$|In Italy {{a complex}} of medieval {{buildings}} has been restored at the Castle of Monselice (Castello Cini) which includes houses from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. The oldest, known as Casa Romanica has two large arches making a loggia at the ground floor, above which rises a plain facade broken only by small windows and a jutting <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b> The loggia leads into a large kitchen with rough-hewn wooden columns standing on stone bases and spreading {{the weight of the}} wide beams of the upper floor on projecting horizontal brackets. The upper floor has a [...] "great hall" [...] and a smaller room over the loggia with a groin vault. The 12th-century [...] "Castelletto" [...] and 13th-century Ezzolino's Tower have both retained Romanesque characteristics, with the later being built of brick and having more ornate features such as paired mullioned windows on its upper floor.|$|E
2500|$|Thurstaston Hall has a U-shaped {{plan with}} a central block and two wings, and is in two storeys. [...] The 14th-century west wing is in stone. [...] On its east face are two blocked doorways with pointed arches, and on the gable end is a pointed window in the first floor with a hood mould and with stops carved with heads. [...] The west face has a <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and a {{projection}} further to the west containing a datestone inscribed with the date 1680. [...] The central block is in brick with stone dressings, and has a symmetrical three-bay front. [...] In the centre is a bolection-moulded doorcase surrounded by unfluted Corinthian half-columns, and a broken pediment containing an armorial shield. [...] Above the doorway is an oval window, and the other windows on the front are mullioned and transomed. At {{the top of the}} front is a cornice with blind oval windows and finials. The east wing is in Elizabethan style. It contains mullioned windows and gabled half-dormers. [...] On the gable end is a bay window containing sashes. [...] At the rear of the hall are service rooms, closets, steps and passageways.|$|E
2500|$|In England that {{familiar}} style known as Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At {{the present time}} hardly {{a home in the}} land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is [...] from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, {{but it is difficult to}} discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.|$|E
50|$|False <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> are {{sometimes}} constructed around a twin-walled flue, or {{against a wall}} pierced by a flue, for purely cosmetic purposes. Typically they will consist of a timber frame or stud work covered with plaster board and a plaster skim. If the false breast contains a flue {{it may be necessary}} to line it with a refractory material such as vermiculite. Usually additional cosmetic features will be added such as cosmetic beams, overmantels or fireplace surrounds.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the older}} {{sections}} of the Cottage have lath and plaster walls and ceilings, timber floors, and some original joinery. The upper parts of the walls taper in towards the room as they reach the ceiling. <b>Chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> are found {{in two of the}} early rooms, and towards the ceiling these taper outward. Remnants of early wall paper survive in several of the rooms, and efforts have been made by the present owners to repaper one of the rooms with a reconstructed paper.|$|R
50|$|Just {{south of}} a single exposed {{basement}} window, wooden steps climb up to enter a projecting gabled vestibule from the north. It has four-over-four double-hung sash on all three sides, and glass in {{the west side of}} the gable. The entrance doors are in pointed arches.They open into a large reception hall with tiled floor, and curving staircase. The pointed-arch motif is repeated in the door panels, banister spindles and on the <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> of the fireplaces. The living room is the size of a ballroom, with exposed beams on its 13 ft ceilings and an exposed chimney.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening the}} sorrowing friends sat with their hostess beside the large fire, Knight in the recess {{formed by the}} <b>chimney</b> <b>breast,</b> where he was in shade. And by showing a little {{confidence}} they won hers, and she told them what they had stayed to hear--the latter history of poor Elfride.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} and {{appearance of a}} <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> can vary according to function and style. English and American builders more often treat the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and fireplace as distinct architectural features, whereas French buildings have gradually trended towards concealed construction.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> is {{a portion}} of a chimney which {{projects}} forward from a wall to accommodate a fireplace. Typically {{on the ground floor of}} a structure, the masonry extends upwards, containing a flue which carries smoke out of the building through a chimney stack. Chimney jambs similarly project from the wall, but they do so on either side of the fireplace and serve to support the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b> The interior of a <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> is commonly filled with brickwork or concrete.|$|E
50|$|Up {{the steps}} is a lounge with fireplace. On its west {{is the large}} living room and meeting space that runs {{the full length of}} that side of the building. It has full-height windows and a fireplace. Other {{decoration}} includes projecting <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts,</b> engaged pilasters, molded shadow box panels, broad crown moldings and encased ceiling beams. Medallions representing the alma maters of the founding members form a frieze on some walls. In the rear is the large main dining room and its supporting kitchen, as well as the club's office and library. The Terrace Room runs along the rear facade.|$|R
50|$|The {{southeast}} room {{is decorated}} in an Adamesque style, featuring an onyx mantelpiece. To its west is the library, now {{used as a}} conference room. Its oak flooring is {{laid out in a}} herringbone pattern. Mahogany moldings, <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> and cornice complete the room. The dining room, opposite, is paneled in darker mahogany, complemented by a green marble mantelpiece. Its north wall opens into the conservatory. Next to the dining room is a small breakfast room with mirrors and wooden latticework on its walls. The northeast corner room is done in dark paneling and hand-tooled leather. Another room in the house has a strapped plaster ceiling. The rooms on the second and third stories are more modest, with some having mantelpieces of their own. The billiards room on the third floor has dark paneling and a large fireplace.|$|R
50|$|Behind the Hall were {{separate}} laundry rooms, {{a stable}} and a coach house, and food storage areas for fresh produce from the estate. The orchard dates from this time. By 1891, when the Hall was put up for sale, a single storey Billiard Room had been built. This is the present Library. The ceilings {{in this area are}} highly decorated with papier-mâché and pierced coving, and the rooms that were used by the family have <b>chimney</b> <b>breasts</b> for open fires. The Hall was used as a family home for nearly one hundred years until 1939. It was then taken over during the Second World War as a training base for Fleet Air-Arm apprentices, and extra outbuildings built. Only the gymnasium, chapel and minibus garage remain from this time. The Hall was painted in camouflage during the war time. It was used as a training camp, for the Royal Navy. This was a land based unit, a 'stone frigate' and named HMS Daedalus II.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{factors that}} need to be {{considered}} when removing a <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> are: ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} layout, the doorways opened onto a small lobby area {{in front of}} the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast,</b> a characteristic feature of Nantwich buildings dating from the early 17th century. The staircase was located {{on the far side of}} the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and a wattle-and-daub partition protected the fire from draughts. The interior has been sensitively restored, and retains the exposed timbers throughout.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chimney</b> <b>breast</b> - The part of {{the chimney}} which {{projects}} into a room to accommodate a fireplace.|$|E
50|$|The paneled main {{entrance}} door, with single-light sidelights and transom, opens into a hall {{running along the}} west side. It is currently used as a gift shop and admission area for the museum. In the wider central portion of the hall is the freestanding <b>chimney,</b> its <b>breast</b> faced in plaster, with turned wooden cornerbeads and beaded fir wainscoting. A small administrative office is in the southwest corner.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen, servant's room, pantry, {{and large}} storage {{cupboard}} open {{from the back}} hall. The kitchen has a fireplace with a painted brick <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b>|$|E
50|$|The laundry {{under the}} kitchen has a {{concrete}} floor. The room retains early or original fixtures including a concrete washtub and a copper tub {{built into the}} <b>chimney</b> <b>breast.</b>|$|E

50|$|The White House was reconstructed in 1817, {{after which}} the Cabinet Room/Presidential Library was called the State Dining Room. The {{reconstruction}} added an extensive <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> to the fireplace in the room's west wall.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centre}} {{there is a}} stone {{fireplace}} and <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> {{from the time of}} the Irish Famine, and there are many local artefacts dating from the last century which have been gathered from the local area.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} room (called {{the dining}} room or the palladian room), was public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable rococo design.

Classical broken pediments top the <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and the beaufats. The floor was made of carefully matched blind-doweled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut entry doors. During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated paper covered the thin pine paneling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{there is}} one single room with a large stone <b>chimney</b> <b>breast</b> and {{fireplace}} and mahogany bookshelves. Other original wooden trim and furnishing remains. There is a bronze memorial plaque with a poem by Jane Rushmore Patterson, Rushmore's daughter. The basement is fully excavated.|$|E
