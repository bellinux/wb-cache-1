5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This <b>complements</b> <b>the</b> mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it <b>complements</b> <b>the</b> main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this <b>complements</b> <b>the</b> poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E

50|$|In the decimal {{numbering}} system, <b>the</b> radix <b>complement</b> {{is called}} <b>the</b> ten's <b>complement</b> and <b>the</b> diminished radix <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> nines' <b>complement.</b> In binary, <b>the</b> radix <b>complement</b> is called <b>the</b> two's <b>complement</b> and <b>the</b> diminished radix <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> ones' <b>complement.</b> <b>The</b> naming of <b>complements</b> in other bases is similar. Some people, notably Donald Knuth, recommend using {{the placement of}} the apostrophe to distinguish between <b>the</b> radix <b>complement</b> and <b>the</b> diminished radix <b>complement.</b> In this usage, <b>the</b> four's <b>complement</b> refers to <b>the</b> radix <b>complement</b> of a number in base four while fours' <b>complement</b> is <b>the</b> diminished radix <b>complement</b> of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use one's and nine's complement, and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending ones and nines complement.|$|R
