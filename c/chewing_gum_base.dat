25|$|The {{polymers}} {{that make}} up the main component of <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer’s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in chewing gum, but not the gum base itself. This allows for gum to be chewed {{for a long period of}} time without breaking down in the mouth like conventional foods. Chewing gum can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.|$|E
30|$|This finding {{allows the}} {{following}} conjecture: If the lemon-juice stimulation is actually {{associated with an}} increase of the absorbed dose per activity primarily caused by an increased glandular blood flow, {{the results of the}} sonography investigations suggest that the absorbed doses should be lower for the non-stimulation and chewing-gum stimulation groups. In addition, because Dawes and Macpherson [15] demonstrated that the salivary flow was higher while <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> than for non-stimulation, it is expected that the absorbed doses will be lower for the chewing-gum stimulation group than for the non-stimulation and lemon-juice stimulation groups. Thus, the washout effect may dominate over the rebound effect when <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base.</b> These suggestions were partially confirmed in this study.|$|E
30|$|The {{results suggest}} that salivary flow induced by <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> does not cause a {{significant}} reduction of the salivary gland absorbed dose compared with that in the non-stimulation group.

40|$|Introduction: Study on {{the effect}} of topically applied mutanase on plaque {{formation}} and caries in rats showed strong inhibition of dental caries. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the presence of mutanase in dental plaque may affect the synthesis and structure of sticky, extracellular glucans. The Hypothesis: Mutanase can be easily added to <b>gum</b> <b>base.</b> After <b>chewing</b> of mutanase-containing <b>chewing</b> <b>gum,</b> the enzyme will be released into the oral cavity. Mutanase will hydrolyze sticky, extracellular glucans, e. g., mutan inhibiting cariogenic bacteria to cohere/adhere and form plaque. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: The main challenge with this hypothesis is the source of mutanase. It can be obtained from Paenibacillus sp. MP- 1 or Trichoderma harzianum F- 340. Directly compressible medicated <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>bases</b> can be used to avoid inactivation of mutanase during the manufacturing process...|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{stimulation}} protocol-related {{and methodological}} factors {{may influence the}} outcome of the absorbed dose calculations. Variations of the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> per hour and of chewing frequency may affect the results. Dawes and Macpherson [15] demonstrated that the flow rate ratio of initial to later <b>chewing</b> on <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> is approximately 5. Thus, the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> on the first day influences the salivary flow rate; however, no correlation between the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>gums</b> and the absorbed doses per activity was observed in this study. Moreover, the salivary flow rate has been demonstrated to be independent of the chewing frequency after a few minutes [16]. Methodologically, the similar results of the absorbed doses using the three-point and seven-point models show that the outcome is not strongly affected by the calculation models. Moreover, the errors in the co-registration and the drawing of volumes of interest around the salivary glands have been shown to produce an average error of 9 % in the absorbed dose calculation [17]. As a result, the factors mentioned are unlikely reasons for the unexpected findings.|$|R

30|$|To {{determine}} the blood flow within the glandular tissue, an established methodology was applied [11] on three healthy test persons, two males of ages 38 and 47 and one female of age 23.

Initially, the salivary glands were imaged without stimulation and thereafter stimulated by either <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> or sucking on lemon juice. The submandibular gland's sonograms were used representatively because they allowed a better visualization with ultrasound than the parotid glands [11]. Duplex ultrasonography was performed during sucking on a slice of lemon.

40|$|Background: Medicated gums are {{intended}} to be chewed and act either locally, absorbed via the buccal mucosa or swallowed with saliva. We prepared the metformin gum to overcome its side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdomen discomfort. Furthermore, {{it could be useful}} for those who have swallowing problems. Materials and Methods: Metformin hydrochloride (250 mg) with suitable sweeteners was mixed manually for 5 min. This mixture was spray dried, freeze dried, or directly mixed with <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base.</b> Glycerin, xylitol, and menthol were added and the produced paste was kept in the freezer for 2 h to be stable. As the metformin shows bitter taste, we tried to mask this unpleasant taste with using different methods explained. The releasing pattern was evaluated by using a mechanical chewing machine. The best formulation with the optimized releasing pattern, suitable physicochemical properties and pleasant taste were selected. Content uniformity, releasing percent, and other physicochemical properties were identified as well. Taste, flavor, and appearance characteristics were evaluated by using a self-made questionnaire based on the hedonic test method. Results: The chewing gum dosage content was about 86. 2 %. The release rate of metformin chewing gum was about 70 % after 5 min of mastication. Masking the bitter taste of drug was achieved by using acesulfame-isomalt as sweeteners and prepared it by freeze drying equipment. Conclusion: Metfornin chewing gum had suitable appearance and appropriate invitro characteristics that fallow the pharmacopeia suggestions.

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the effect of sugar-free chewing gum sweetened with xylitol or maltitol compared to the use of a gum base or no gum on gingivitis and plaque scores under both brushing and non-brushing circumstances. Methods The design of the study was a four-group, double-blinded, randomized controlled study with a 3 -week duration. In each group, the participants did not brush the teeth in the lower jaw designated to develop experimental gingivitis, while maintaining normal oral hygiene procedures in the upper jaw. After professional dental prophylaxis, the participants were allocated into one of four groups (xylitol, maltitol, gum base or no gum). Chewing gum was used five times a day for 10 min. Results 220 participants completed the study and provided evaluable data. The increase in bleeding on marginal probing (BOMP) and plaque scores (PS) in the non-brushed (lower) jaw with experimental gingivitis was significant in all groups (P < 0. 001). As compared to the gum base, the increase in BOMP in the xylitol and maltitol group was significantly lower. In the brushed upper jaw, no significant changes for BOMP were observed from the baseline to the end point of the study, and there were no significant differences in BOMP and PS between the groups. Conclusion In circumstances where regular brushing is performed, no effect of chewing gum was observed on bleeding and plaque scores. In the absence of brushing, chewing xylitol or maltitol gum provided a significant inhibitory effect on gingivitis scores compared to <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>base.</b> The difference when compared to the group not using gum was not significant...|$|E

Distilled water adjusted to the pH of each saliva sample was used as a control. In the second experiment, the suppressive ability of saliva against enamel demineralization was quantitatively analyzed using quantitative light- induced fluorescence (QLF). Aliquots of stimulated saliva obtained from a subject were mixed with 15 ml of 100 % orange juice in saliva:orange juice ratios of 1 / 30, 1 / 15, 1 / 10 and 1 / 5, and bovine teeth were soaked for 24 hours in the solutions. The △Q of the QLF analyses of the enamel was then measured. The lowest titrant volume which reduced the pH of the initial saliva (7. 7 on average) to pH 5. 4 was that of the orange juice.

The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides. Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or skin conditioning agenta, as food additives in <b>gums,</b> <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> <b>bases</b> and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan. Some of the polysaccharide-derived products have interesting and useful properties and show biological activities, such as immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anti-mutagenic, radioprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-ulcer, antidepressant, anti-septicaemic or anti-inflammatory activities.
