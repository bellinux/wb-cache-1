5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} occupy {{a central role in}} English {{political}} life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> the 100 years after Edward I's reign. The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.|$|E

5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it.

5|$|In May 2015, the WMATA {{board voted}} to ban {{advocacy}} advertising after the American Freedom Defense Initiative sought to purchase advertisements in five subway stations and on twenty buses depicting Muhammad. The New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority previously attempted to deny similar anti-Islam ads by the AFDI, but had their decision successfully <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court, and subsequently voted to ban non-commercial advertising.|$|E
5|$|Thelema {{continued}} {{to develop and}} spread following Crowley's death. In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California {{under the leadership of}} Grady Louis McMurtry; in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite Marcelo Ramos Motta.|$|E

5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} that corporations enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E
5|$|When the August 10, 2007, filing {{deadline}} passed, {{the discussion}} around San Francisco shifted {{to talk about}} Newsom's second term. He was <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> the election by 13 candidates that included George Davis, a nudist activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club. Conservative former supervisor Tony Hall withdrew by early September {{due to lack of}} support.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E

5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Following the Velvet Revolution, an {{amendment}} act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, {{physically and mentally}} sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection. Newly, denial of license could be <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E

5|$|In 1830, {{on the eve}} of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte {{transferred}} {{control of}} the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns.|$|E
5|$|Ryba {{announced}} on 1 December 1980 {{that he intended}} to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad. When {{the rest of the team}} returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he wrote a letter to the PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court.|$|E
5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General {{answer the question}} of whether same-sex marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly <b>challenged</b> <b>in</b> court.|$|E
