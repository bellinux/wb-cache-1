50|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is {{a phrase}} {{used in the}} field of {{internet}} governance to describe governments' desire to exercise control over the Internet within their own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities. In his 2015 book Data and Goliath, American security expert Bruce Schneier says the <b>cyber</b> <b>sovereignty</b> movement, in countries such as Russia, China, France and Saudi Arabia, was given an enormous boost by the 2013 revelations of widespread international NSA surveillance, which those countries pointed to as justification for their activities and evidence of U.S. hypocrisy on Internet freedom issues.|$|E

This approach is {{in stark contrast}} to United States efforts that have demonstrated a focus on “acting globally, thinking locally” philosophy wherein most of its cyber efforts have been outwardly facing and are distinct from other security considerations.
