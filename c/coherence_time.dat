5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> {{of the light}} source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where {{the number of}} terminals is {{much less than the}} number of base station (mobile station) antennas. In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the <b>coherence</b> <b>time</b> of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E

These lead to several potential advantages for a Si:Bi donor electron spin qubit compared to the more common phosphorus donor. Most previous studies on Si:Bi have been performed using natural silicon where linewidths and electron spin <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> are limited {{by the presence of}} 29 Si impurities.

40|$|While quantum {{computation}} {{has the potential}} to revolutionize the scientific community, to date no architecture has been developed which offers the necessary combination of high <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> and massive scalability. Superconducting flux qubits satisfy the second requirement well but to date useful devices are limited to <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> of typically only a few &mus. In this dissertation we examine the possibilities of improving the coherence performance of the flux qubit to the levels required for fault-tolerant {{quantum computation}}. We find that <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> for many devices are limited by photon-induced quasiparticles and mitigation of these quasiparticles increases <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> by more than a factor of two. Beyond this, however, we find little improvement in flux qubit performance compared to prior results. Despite improved fabrication techniques and varied device designs we find flux qubit <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> are still typically below 5 &mus. Furthermore, wide device-to-device variations are observed which prevent effective scaling of the flux qubit to quantum information circuits. Based on the proposal by You, et al. we develop of a capacitively-shunted version of the flux qubit called the C-shunt flux qubit. With the addition of a capacitive shunt across the small junction of the flux qubit we are able to reduce the amplitude sensitivity to both charge and flux noise by more than a factor of three. The result is a predicted ten-fold enhancement in the <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> compared to the unshunted flux qubit. At the same time we preserve much of the anharmonicity of the flux qubit resulting in a device with <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> comparable to modern transmons but with a factor of four better anharmonicity and more flexible coupling configurations. By using a high-quality MBE aluminum shunt process on an annealed sapphire substrate coupled with a more conventional electron-beam-evaporated aluminum Josephson junction process we fabricate hybrid C-shunt flux qubits. We also incorporate a new bridgeless junction technique which offers more robust and repeatable fabrication processing. This technique enables improved accuracy of the junction sizing, a trait which will become essential as we move to multi-qubit experiments. T 1 and T 2 times for these C-shunt devices reach in excess of 40 &mus at degeneracy, achieving the predicted ten-fold improvement based on the reduced noise sensitivity. At the same time we see decreased device-to-device variation with typical T 1 times exceeding 20 &ndash 25 &mus at all bias points. Combined with the high anharmonicity and standard planar fabrication techniques these <b>coherence</b> <b>times</b> make the C-shunt flux qubit a competitive candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation...|$|R
