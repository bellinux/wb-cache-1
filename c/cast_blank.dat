25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses together and then the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly <b>cast</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On February 17, on the 36th ballot, Jefferson was elected. Federalist James A. Bayard of Delaware and {{his allies}} in Maryland and Vermont all <b>cast</b> <b>blank</b> ballots.

Bayard, as the sole representative from Delaware, changed his vote from Burr to no selection. The four representatives present from South Carolina, all Federalists, also changed their 3–1 selection of Burr to four abstentions.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{to exert}} {{considerable}} direct influence over Argentine politics despite the ongoing ban of Peronism or the Justicialist Party as Argentina geared for the 1958 elections, Perón instructed his supporters {{to cast their}} ballots for the moderate Arturo Frondizi, a splinter candidate within the Peronists' largest opposition party, the Radical Civic Union (UCR). Frondizi went on to defeat the better-known (but, more anti-Peronist) UCR leader, Ricardo Balbín. Perón backed a [...] "Popular Union" [...] (UP) in 1962, and when its candidate for governor of Buenos Aires Province (Andrés Framini) was elected, Frondizi {{was forced to resign}} by the military. Unable to secure a new alliance, Perón advised his followers to <b>cast</b> <b>blank</b> ballots in the 1963 elections, demonstrating direct control over one fifth of the electorate.|$|E
