5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E

Paul then gives the song to Amali Ward, but she decides against {{recording}} it. Paul attempts to sue Georgia, but drops the case when he learns Jack has died. He then asks for his fraud conviction {{to be removed from}} his criminal record, so he can run for mayor. Karl unsuccessfully runs against him. Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to enable him to sack Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese and he keeps the hotel within the Lassiter's chain. Paul learns Rebecca works for a civic project called Twin Cities and forges Karl's signature on a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> to get Rebecca to return. Paul tells Rebecca that he became mayor for her because he still loves her. Paul asks Rebecca to move back to Erinsborough, but she refuses. Paul disapproves when Kate gets back together with Mark Brennan. They reconcile just before she is fatally shot. Paul blames Mark for Kate's death.|$|E

25|$|The University of Ottawa’s {{cooperative}} education program is an optional program which presents students with excellent work experiences and other various benefits {{the program has}} to offer. The program is offered for both undergraduate programs and certain graduate programs. The program was first introduced to the school over 30 years ago, in the year 1980. The University of Ottawa's co-operative program has expanded very quickly since its creation and now stands as the second largest program in Ontario with a placement success rate of over 98 percent. The co-operative education {{program is designed to}} generally have students work full-time during altering semesters, in their area of study. One work term generally lasts 15 or 16 weeks. Every work term is a paid work term where students’ pay varies on the program of study related to their job; however, student pay can range anywhere from 400-700 dollars per week. In addition to the hands-on experience students may acquire through this program, the co-op program at the University of Ottawa can further offer a range of services to the students such as: one on one consultations concerning resume or <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> reviews, various workshops, and numerous training possibilities for different purposes such as for interview preparation and work term success. The University of Ottawa’s co-op program claims to offer excellent experiences to students as the program maintains “regular contacts with over 4000 active private- and public-sector employers throughout the year”. The University of Ottawa’s co-op program has five fees, with prices varying each year. There is a fee issued for each work term and an additional free which is paid when the student accepts the co-op offer for the training and support provided by staff leading up to the work terms. The fees go towards the preparation and training of students, allowing them to develop {{a better understanding of the}} job market, resume reviews, and extensive preparation for interviews and jobs.|$|E

50|$|After this is completed, users {{would create}} between 1-5 {{targeted}} résumés and <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> {{for each type}} of position he or she requires. The company used a ‘fill-in’ concept on the <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> to provide semi-customization when applying to jobs. The company then created a search algorithm of keywords and websites to conduct deep searches for jobs on the internet. The jobs found were then applied to with the provided <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> and résumés via the user's email address. The company had multiple redundancy controls to prevent applying to those companies and websites that a user advises them to avoid. This improved efficiency by not wasting time with companies known not to be of interest, while also providing privacy protection for employed job seekers or customers in the interview process with the companies on this list. Given the human element of the process, customers have the ability to tailor and refine their search daily depending on their status.|$|R

500|$|In {{the middle}} of the year Baird {{received}} five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them. [...] Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> that was so remarkably negative {{about the quality of the}} manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories [...] "despite the foregoing, or because of it". [...] However, Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to resubmit only one story, [...] "Dagon". [...] It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird's tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to Weird Tales: as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of Frank Owen and Seabury Quinn.|$|E
500|$|Barber's first attempt, modeled for {{the half}} dollar, disregarded Leech's instructions. Instead of a design based on French coinage, it {{depicted}} a standing figure of Columbia, bearing a pileus atop a liberty pole; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her. The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, enclosed inside a thick oak wreath, with the required legends surrounding the rim. Leech rejected the design, and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid-September {{with a head}} of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin. Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster; on September 28, he wrote Barber that Liberty's lips were [...] "rather voluptuous" [...] and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath. Barber did so, and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck. Barber complained, in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell, but intended for Leech, that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time. Leech replied, stating {{that he did not}} care how much effort was expended in order to improve the design, especially since, once issued, they would have to be used for 25 years. Barber's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb (Bosbyshell was traveling) stating that Barber [...] "disclaims any intention to be captious and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage". The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements, and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences; the overall tone was argumentative. Leech chose not to write again; he addressed one concern, about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately, by visiting the National Botanical Garden, obtaining one, and sending it to Barber.|$|E
