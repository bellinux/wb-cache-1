5|$|Running {{along the}} western edge of the plaza, NY129 bends north at a view of the New <b>Croton</b> Dam, {{continuing}} its way north alongside the New <b>Croton</b> Reservoir. NY129 soon changes names to <b>Croton</b> Dam Road, passing east of the <b>Croton</b> Harman School District headquarters. At an intersection with East Mount Airy Road, NY129 runs eastward along the reservoir, changing names to Yorktown Road. On a short stint away from the reservoir, NY129 intersects with <b>Croton</b> Road before crossing over the Hunters Brook Bridge, where it crosses into the historic community of Huntersville. Continuing northeast from Huntersville, NY129, now known as <b>Croton</b> Lake Road, bends through the town of Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|NY134 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY133 (<b>Croton</b> Avenue) {{in the village}} of Ossining, just east of the latter's west end at U.S. Route9 (North Highland Avenue). The route proceeds northeast as the two-lane Dale Avenue, passing through a residential section of the village and passing Dale Cemetery. Just past the cemetery, the highway changes names to Hawkes Avenue as it leaves the village for other parts of the town of Ossining. The route continues generally northeastward past homes to the vicinity of NY9A (the BriarcliffPeekskill Parkway), where NY134 forks from Hawkes Avenue and begins to parallel NY9A on Kitchawan State Road, a short connector to nearby <b>Croton</b> Dam Road. Upon intersecting <b>Croton</b> Dam Road, NY134 turns northward and immediately intersects NY9A at an at-grade intersection.|$|E
5|$|The second {{concurrency}} between US9 and NY9A {{runs for}} 0.65 miles (1km), with NY9A leaving the <b>Croton</b> Expressway at <b>Croton</b> Point Avenue in Croton-on-Hudson.

After crossing US9 {{once more in}} Cortlandt, NY9A ends at the Welcher Avenue interchange in southern Peekskill.|$|E
50|$|In {{tropical}} climates, <b>crotons</b> make attractive hedges and potted patio specimens, {{valued for}} their striking foliage. They only survive outdoors where temperatures do not normally drop below 10° to 13°C in winter; colder temperatures can cause leaf loss. In colder climates, {{the plants are}} grown in greenhouses or as house plants. The cultivated garden <b>crotons</b> are usually smaller than the wild plant, rarely over 1.8 m tall, and come in a wide diversity of leaf shapes and colours. They are sometimes grouped under the name Codiaeum variegatum var. pictum (Lodd.) Müll. Arg., though this is not botanically distinct from the species and usually treated as a synonym of it.|$|R

5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in <b>Croton</b> Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and <b>Croton</b> Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New <b>Croton</b> Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in <b>Croton</b> Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} railroad tracks. Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate {{to the site of the}} next station, North Salem's hamlet of <b>Croton</b> Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the <b>Croton</b> River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E

5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them <b>croton</b> finches because of their liking for the <b>croton</b> bush, but the pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present.|$|E

This paper presents some of the plant collections grown in this space. It comes out that, by number, diversity and value (scientific/decorative) of the taxa, many collections – azaleas and camelias, carnivorous plant, palm trees, bromelias, orchids, cicads, <b>crotons,</b> ficuses – have a unicum value in the country...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{cemetery}} had become unkempt, and was cause for local comment. Consequently, in 1900 the trustees sought permission to increase the burial fees to defray the expense of ground improvements. A new sexton, William Parsons, was appointed, and by his efforts the principal pathway was metalled and bordered with variegated hedging plants and <b>crotons,</b> flowering shrubs and trees were planted along the fence fronting McLeod Street, the graves were cleared of weed and spear grass, and couch grass imported from the south was laid.|$|R

The Veitch family name is honoured by hundreds of plant names, including the genus Veitchia. The Veitch nursery introduced 232 orchids, some 500 greenhouse plants, 118 exotic ferns, about 50 conifers, 153 deciduous trees, 72 evergreen and climbing shrubs, 122 herbaceous and 37 bulbous plants from various corners of the globe.|$|R
5|$|Étienne-Maurice Falconet's marble Milo of <b>Croton</b> (1754) secured his {{admission}} to the Académie des beaux-arts, but was later criticized for lack of nobility. The work clashed with the classical ideal requiring a dying hero to express stoic restraint.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the <b>Croton</b> Expressway, {{the only}} {{piece of the}} failed Hudson River Expressway project that was ever built, began in the mid-1960s. It became part of a realigned US9 when it was {{completed}} by 1967. The former surface routing of US9 along Albany Post Road between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an overlap with US9 from {{the north end of}} the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death {{have become the}} subjects of modern art and literature. His death was a popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of <b>Croton</b> (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.|$|E
50|$|Terminalia arjuna, Manilkara hexandra, neem (Azadirachta indica), Azadirachta indica, {{sacred fig}} (Ficus religiosa) and Piliostigma racemosum are {{commonly}} found {{in the area around}} the Minneriya tank. Chloroxylon swietenia, Vitex altissima, Berrya cordifolia, Diospyros quaesita, and Drypetes sepiaria are dominant plant species in Minneriya. Randia dumetorum, <b>crotons,</b> and Calotropis gigantea are common in abandoned chena cultivations and scrublands.

5000|$|The first tarmac runway was {{constructed}} in 1946 {{at a cost of}} £46,500; 7000 ft by 150 ft [...]Then, as now, Fiji was the crossroads of the Pacific - and in those days was even more important as a refuelling stop. The apron was shaded by palms, <b>crotons</b> and hibiscus trees, with whitewashed stone paths connecting it to the terminal. These have now been lost under concrete as the apron has expanded over the years, as aeroplanes larger in both number and size land at Nadi. In the 1940s and '50s, the airport's official name was Colony of Fiji: Nadi Airport, although foreign timetables continued to spell the name in phonetic English: Nandi.|$|R
