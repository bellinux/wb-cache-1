40|$|National audienceObject: Hadrontherapy is {{becoming}} an increasingly attractive modality for cancer treatment due to the favourable depth-dose profile of ions and high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in the tumour region. Since RBE depends on multiple parameters related both to the irradiation beam and the cell properties, biophysical models are essential {{to comply with the}} demands of a clinical environment. NanOxTM addresses some of the flaws in the models currently implemented in the treatment planning systems, and shows many innovative features. Method: The model takes into account the fully stochastic nature of ionizing radiation by considering dose fluctuations both at nanometric and micrometric scales, and introduces the concept of <b>chemical</b> <b>dose.</b> The latter represents the induction of cell death by “non-local” events as the accumulation of cellular oxidative stress or sub-lethal lesions induced by radical species. Such “non-local” events are complementary to the “local” events, which take place at a very localized scale and are considered as lethal since can singly cause cell death. Results: NanOxTM predictions for V 79 and HSG cell lines irradiated by photons, protons and carbon ions are in good agreement with the experimental data. The model is able to describe the effectiveness of ions, including the overkill effect at high LET values. Moreover, the typical shoulder in cell survival curves is reproduced owing to the introduction of the <b>chemical</b> <b>dose</b> which varies with LET. Conclusion: The promising results obtained with NanOxTM stress its potential in the context of hadrontherapy, and may lead in the future to apply it to neutron beam therapy or photoactivation of nanoparticles. Despite a rigorous mathematical approach, its implementation remains simple and compatible with the constraints of clinical application. The model relies in fact on the fit of a reduced set of parameters, and its pragmatic architecture facilitates improvements and optimizations...|$|E

A promising methodology for the prediction of these phenomena is physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, which centers on the prediction of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (pharmacokinetics) and the biological effe-cts (pharmacodynamics) of the chemical on the organism. Strengths of this methodology include modeling across multiple scales of bio-logical organization and facilitates the extrapolation of results across routes of exposure, dosing levels, and species. It is also useful as the foundation for tools to (i) predict biomarker levels (concentrations of chemical species found in the body that indicate exposure to a foreign chemical) given a <b>chemical</b> <b>dose</b> or exposure, (ii) reconstruct a dose given the levels of relevant biomarkers, and (iii) estimate population variability.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigated}} the potential impacts of sonication on sludge dewaterability and the optimal conditions. Both sonication conditioning and sonication-chemical co-conditioning were tested. Final water content of dry sludge {{was used to}} represent the sludge dewaterability. The results showed that sonication significantly changed the sludge dewaterability and the changes were strongly influenced by the ultrasonic power density and time. The best sonication for sludge conditioning, alone or together with chemicals, was 7 s and 0. 8 W/ml. The optimal energy dose was 960 kJ/kgDS while energy input higher than 1200 kJ/kgDS deteriorated the sludge dewatering. Sonication alone only reduced the sludge specific resistance to filtration (SRF) by 40 % and the final water content to 90 %; thus, chemical conditioning was necessary. Combination of FeCl 3 and polyacrylamide (PAM) was very effective for sludge conditioning and the optimal PAM/FeCl 3 was 0. 01. When chemicals were used, sonication effectively reduced the necessary <b>chemical</b> <b>dose</b> by 40 - 50 % but showed little improvement in SRF. The best sludge conditioning parameters were found to be: sonication for 7 s at 0. 8 W/ml, 1. 5 g/L FeCl 3, and 15 mg/L PAM.

However, these two environmental factors cannot {{be separated from}} each other in the real world because a number of chemical agents contaminate food chains. Obj e c t i v e: We propose a unifying mechanism that can link epigenetic alterations in relation to DNA hypomethylation due to chemical agents and to nutrient deficiency or imbalance, emphasizing the importance of an integrative approach in the field of environmental epidemiology. Discussion: Methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are needed for DNA methylation. Diets low in sources of methyl groups can lead to global DNA hypomethylation by impairing synthesis of SAM. However, even without nutritional deficiency, enhanced need to synthesize glutathione (GSH) can impair synthesis of SAM and perturb DNA methylation, because the methylation cycle and the GSH synthesis pathways are biochemically linked.

A high speed camera recorded 25 second video clips. The videos were image-analyzed and the fiber length {{and the amount of}} fiber in each sample were measured. Prior to the flocculation process, fibers were fractionated into short and long fibers. Trials were conducted using the unfractionated fiber, short fiber, and long fiber. The short and long fibers were mixed in several trials to study the effect of fiber length. The concentration of cPAM was varied as well as the motor speed of the impeller (RPM). It was found that the average fiber length decreased more rapidly with increasing motor speed. Increasing the concentration of cPAM also led to a greater decrease in average fiber length. A key finding was that a plateau was reached where further increasing the amount of cPAM had no effect. Hence, fibers below a critical length resisted flocculation even if the <b>chemical</b> <b>dose</b> or shear was increased. This critical length was related to the initial length of the fiber. M. S.

The dose distribution deposited by ions, and for the heaviest, their higher biological effectiveness, make them more interesting to destroy localized tumors while sparing healthy tissues. Such an effectiveness is quantified through the RBE (relative biological effectiveness), which is a complex function of multiple parameters like cell line, cell cycle stage, radiation quality and irradiation conditions. Therefore, determining the value of RBE for every scenario is a challenging task that requires modeling {{to comply with the}} demands of a clinical environment. Several solutions have already been developed and a few are currently used in treatment planning [1 - 4]. Nevertheless, despite the progress these models have allowed, they present some shortcomings [5 - 7] that may limit their improvement. We present thereby a new approach that gathers some principles of the existing ones and addresses some of their weaknesses. The innovative features of NanoxTM are that it is fully based on statistical physics, taking in particular into account the fluctuations in energy deposition at multiple scales, and that it introduces the concept of a <b>chemical</b> <b>dose.</b> The latter is chosen as a parameter defined at the cell scale to represent the induction of cell death by “non-local” events as the accumulation of cellular oxidative stress or sublethal lesions induced by the produced radical species. Such “non-local” events are complementary to the so-called “local” events, which take place at a very localized (nanometric) scale. The “local” events are considered as lethal since a single event can cause cell death. The cell survival predicted by NanoxTM for V 79 cell line was compared with experimental results for photons, protons and carbon ions, and even others like neon and argon ions. A good agreement was found in all cases. In particular, the model is able to describe the effectiveness of ions, including the overkill effect at higher LET values. Moreover, NanoxTM can reproduce the typical shoulder in cell survival curves. This was possible due to the introduction of the “non-local” events, through the <b>chemical</b> <b>dose,</b> which varies with LET. It is worthwhile to note that such results were obtained through the adjustment of a reduced number of free parameters. The first results of NanoxTM, obtained for V 79 cell line, give us confidence that this model has potential for application in a clinical scenario in the context of particle therapy. Although it requires the tuning of only a few free parameters, NanoxTM is based on solid principles and a thorough mathematical implementation, which renders this approach simple but reliable for application in clinical practice...|$|E

A wide range of procedures and techniques are currently being used to define the quantitative relationship between the extent and duration of chemically induced cell proliferation and carcinogenic potential in different species and target organs. However, a limited database and nonstandard protocols and procedures for measuring cell proliferation have made it difficult to compare results between laboratories. Comparison of frequencies of S phase between control and treated animals is the most commonly used end point in cell proliferation studies and may be regarded as an indirect indication of a proliferative response. This response can be ascertained as labeling indexes (LI; percentage of cells in S phase) after the administration of the DNA precursor labels (tritiated thymidine; 3 H-TdR; bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU) or through immunostaining of the endogenous cell replication marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).

40|$|Abstract: Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is an {{organochlorine}} compound {{that has been}} widely used as a biocide in several industrial, agricultural, and domestic applications. Although {{it has been shown}} to induce systemic toxicity and carcinogenesis in several experimental studies, the literature is scarce regarding its toxic mechanisms of action at the cellular and molecular levels. Recent investigations in our laboratory have shown that PCP induces cytotoxicity and transcriptionally activates stress genes in human liver carcinoma (HepG 2) cells [1]. In this research, we hypothesize that environmental exposure to PCP may trigger cytotoxic, mitogenic, and endocrine-disrupting activities in aquatic organisms including fish. To test this hypothesis, we carried out in vitro cultures of male channel catfish hepatocytes, and performed the fluorescein diacetate assay (FDA) to assess for cell viability, and the Western Blot analysis to assess for vitellogenin expression following exposure to PCP. Data obtained from FDA experiments indicated a strong dose-response relationship with respect to PCP cytotoxicity.
