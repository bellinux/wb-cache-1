40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to explore the feasibility of building management information gateways that relay management information at regular intervals between the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). This management information is stored in an object-oriented Management Information Base (MIB) that can be accessed by <b>Common</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> (CMIS) management applications. An approach for polling based on a variable polling frequency is proposed. A stateful model for a simple version CMIP proxy agent for SNMP which requires management information collected from SNMP agents to be stored in the proxy agent's MIB is also proposed. The proxy agent is implemented using the so-called OSIMIS- 3. 0 software package which implements CMIP, and an existing SNMP application. A policy of variable polling frequency which is based on the cost of polling, the cost of loss of relevant management information and the frequency of update of new information is used by the proxy agent. The agent is tested on a distributed network consisting of a LAN at McGill University and another LAN at the University of Montreal. The results from the test show that using the above model of a proxy agent between CMIP and SNMP yields a better response time as compared to the stateless proxy agent model used by the Network Management Forum (NMF 93), as well as an up-to-date information about the network to a CMIS manager during critical situations...|$|E
