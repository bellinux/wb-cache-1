5|$|The {{plays and}} the {{paintings}} suggested {{the theme of}} loss of traditional Indian culture {{in the face of}} <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh {{interprets the}} {{self-determination}} clause in Article 1 as applying {{in the historical}} context of <b>colonialism.</b> It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 {{within the context of}} its constitution and domestic law.|$|E
5|$|During this period, {{there was}} also {{substantially}} more interaction among the various poetic traditions, {{in part due to}} the spread of European <b>colonialism</b> and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.|$|E

5|$|The Speech at the Ceremony of the Proclamation of the Congo's Independence {{was a short}} {{political}} speech given by Patrice Lumumba on 30 June 1960. The address marked the independence of Congo-Léopoldville (the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) from Belgium and became a famous example of an attack on <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The speech continued, {{outlining}} the personal {{suffering of the}} nationalists {{during the course of}} the struggle. Lumumba then turned to enumerating the suffering of ordinary Congolese people under <b>colonialism,</b> through forced labour, systematic racial discrimination, land seizure, wealth disparity and physical maltreatment at the hand of the colonial state.|$|E
5|$|Written {{in formal}} Malay and {{including}} traditional Minangkabau storytelling {{techniques such as}} pantuns, Sitti Nurbaya touches on the themes of <b>colonialism,</b> forced marriage, and modernity. Well-received upon publication, Sitti Nurbaya continues to be taught in Indonesian high schools. It {{has been compared to}} Romeo and Juliet and the Butterfly Lovers.|$|E
5|$|Cameroonian {{literature}} has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era {{writers such as}} Louis-Marie Pouka and Sankie Maimo were educated by European missionary societies and advocated assimilation into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world. After World War II, writers such as Mongo Beti and Ferdinand Oyono analysed and criticised <b>colonialism</b> and rejected assimilation.|$|E
5|$|Having {{dominated}} Zimbabwe's {{politics for}} nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and divisive figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British <b>colonialism,</b> imperialism, and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was {{committed}} {{to the belief that}} European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under <b>colonialism,</b> the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands.|$|E
5|$|Language {{varieties}} of Toraja, including Kalumpang, Mamasa, Tae, Talondo, Toala, and Toraja-Sa'dan, {{belong to the}} Malayo-Polynesian language from the Austronesian family. At the outset, the isolated geographical nature of Tana Toraja formed many dialects between the Toraja languages themselves. After the formal administration of Tana Toraja, some Toraja dialects {{have been influenced by}} other languages through the transmigration program, introduced since the <b>colonialism</b> period, and it has been {{a major factor in the}} linguistic variety of Toraja languages.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced <b>colonialism</b> and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|Philippine {{music has}} evolved rapidly {{due to the}} {{different}} influences stemming from <b>colonialism</b> under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao. This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British <b>colonialism.</b> The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Jerusalem was {{the first}} {{experiment}} in European <b>colonialism</b> creating a 'Europe Overseas' or Outremer. The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing trade between Europe and the outremer. The Italian city states of Genoa and Venice flourished, creating profitable trading colonies in the Eastern Mediterranean. This trade was sustained through the middle Byzantine and Ottoman eras, and the communities were often assimilated and known as Levantines or Franco-Levantines.|$|E
5|$|The first {{descriptions}} of Greenlandic {{date from the}} 1600s, and {{with the arrival of}} Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish <b>colonialism</b> in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on <b>colonialism,</b> however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|While sculptors Eric Schilsky (1898–1974) and Hew Lorimer (1907–93) {{worked in}} the {{existing}} tradition of modelling and carving, sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world. George Wyllie (1921–2012), produced works {{of social and political}} commentary including the Straw Locomotive (1987), an event which raised questions about the decline of heavy industry and the nature of <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of <b>colonialism.</b> Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European <b>colonialism</b> in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast {{territory}} of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E
5|$|Champion of the Raj is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed by Level 9 Computing {{and published by}} Personal Software Services. It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom for the Amiga, Atari ST and systems running DOS in 1991. It is the thirteenth and final instalment to the Strategic Wargmes series. The game revolves around European imperialism and <b>colonialism</b> of India, in which six factions: British, French, Mogul, Sikhs, Gurkhas and Marathas fight to gain overall control of India.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British <b>colonialism</b> had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of <b>colonialism</b> would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and <b>colonialism</b> were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{nationalism}} and movements supporting independence from Dutch <b>colonialism,</b> such as Budi Utomo, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), Sarekat Islam, and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), grew {{rapidly in the}} first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated Volksraad ("People's Council") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule. Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony. The most notable of these leaders were Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the Dutch Ethical Policy.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to <b>colonialism,</b> which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French <b>colonialism,</b> which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, <b>colonialism</b> and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British <b>colonialism,</b> globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on <b>colonialism</b> was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the two countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to <b>colonialism</b> and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of <b>colonialism</b> and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
