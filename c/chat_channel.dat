5|$|Upon {{reaching}} level 3, characters may join a clan, {{a band of}} cooperating characters. A clan has a clan hall {{which can}} be furnished with beneficial equipment {{as well as a}} clan stash for sharing useful items. Clan members can chat with each other in a private <b>chat</b> <b>channel.</b> In 2008, a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of hobos. Eurogamer likened Hobopolis to World of Warcraft instances. Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.|$|E
5|$|Player-run guilds come in {{the form}} of Free Companies, {{organized}} bands of adventurers under the auspices of one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea. Free Company members may gain access to a shared company chest, a private <b>chat</b> <b>channel,</b> and Company Actions which are 24-hour buffs to certain aspects of gameplay, such as increased EXP or reduced gear damage. Free Company members may also pool their resources to purchase a house in one of the residential districts. In addition to decorating the house, players may use the grounds to grow unique items through the gardening system, train their chocobo companion, embark on airship expeditions, and purchase a private room for personal use. Linkshells are another form of in-game networking; whereas players may only belong in one Free Company, they may join up to eight linkshells which act as private chat channels for interested sub-groups.|$|E
25|$|The chat system enables {{players to}} {{communicate}} with each other. Public Chat broadcasts text to players in the local area on one server, both by text appearing above the speaker's head and in the message box. Friends Chat broadcasts text in the message box only to certain players tuned into a specific channel, who can be available on any RuneScape world. Each Friends <b>Chat</b> <b>channel</b> has an owner, who can assign different ranks to individual players; players' ranks dictate their ability to perform administrative tasks within the channel. Clan Chat allows members of a clan {{to communicate with}} each other through a separate channel. Quick Chat allows players to choose from a list of predetermined messages to send as Public Chat, Clan Chat, or Friends Chat.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} an integrated chat system {{which is available}} only after completing a basic test of English grammar and spelling. There are many <b>chat</b> <b>channels,</b> including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku. Most of the <b>chat</b> <b>channels</b> are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official Kingdom of Loathing forums are another active venue for discussion among players.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{potentially}} offensive words and word combinations were automatically censored in messages that were typed in any <b>chat</b> <b>channel,</b> be it public, private, group, or club chat. Users {{were able to}} report inappropriate or offensive behavior of other users to moderators by accessing the PlayStation Home Safe Screen. Moderators reviewed these reports periodically, and took action against a user's account based on the type and severity of the offense. A limited number of live moderators also patrolled PlayStation Home, who {{had the ability to}} take action against users immediately. These moderators were often invisible to other users, and typically would not type in public chat. Suspensions and bans were made against a user's PSN account, and restricted their ability not only to use PlayStation Home, but any other online service on PSN. Users were also able to change their communication settings to block or mute messages from users who were not on their friends list.|$|E
25|$|Now, RTÉ has a {{nationwide}} communications network with an increasing emphasis on regional news-gathering and input. Broadcasting on Radio 1 provides comprehensive coverage of news, current affairs, music, drama and variety features, agriculture, education, religion and sport, mostly in English {{but also some}} Irish. RTÉ 2fm is a popular music and <b>chat</b> <b>channel</b> which commenced broadcasting as RTÉ Radio 2 on 31 May 1979, Brendan Balfe being the first voice to be heard on the station at midday, when he introduced the first presenter, Larry Gogan. RTÉ lyric fm serves the interests of classical music and the arts, coming on air in May 1999, and replacing FM3 Classical Music, which had catered for the same target audience and time-shared with RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, an exclusively Irish-language service, which first began broadcasting on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1972. Formerly RTÉ operated RTÉ Radio Cork (previously 'Cork 89FM' and 'RTÉ Cork Local Radio'), a local radio service in Cork, but this closed down in the early 2000s.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{language}} used in <b>chat</b> <b>channels</b> of World of Warcraft to illustrate that players of World of Warcraft have adapted L 337 language in order to suit their specific requirements in the game. By doing so the players have created a new variation of L 337 Language: WoWspeak. We will find that players not only strive to create their own in-game jargon, but also they try to economise language as they attempt to mimic oral conversation as much as possible. The material analysed is computer-mediated conversations gathered from <b>chat</b> <b>channels</b> in the game...|$|R
