50|$|These {{batches of}} {{different}} beads, each batch being an assay or capture {{site for a}} specific biomolecule, are applied sequentially creating a unique pattern for every well. The coordinates of each individual bead in each sequential batch is recorded in a large map/decoding data table that is provided to the user alongside the carrier (like a USB flashdrive). The assay itself follows the sandwich ELISA principle with a read out based on a fluorescent reporter introduced at the final step of the assay. Following imaging using fluorescence microscope technology on the reacted chip, the company's analysis software identifies the individual beads according to their unique signals, later decrypted with the company's software to deliver a <b>customized</b> <b>report</b> to the user. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of downstream analysis while {{increasing the number of}} individual protein targets that can be analyzed in very low sample volumes.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Surveys {{are often}} used in health studies to collect data about {{participants}} for scientific research. An increasing number of health scientists are turning to online data collection methods because they are less costly and can reach a large diverse population quickly. Online surveys also {{make it easy to}} track and manage the responses from participants. The WAVE project is a 5 year childhood obesity prevention study being conducted at Oregon State University by health scientists utilizing a web application called WavePipe. WavePipe enables the health scientists to create studies, enroll subjects, assign mobile devices, collect physical activity data, collect nutritional data through online surveys, and analyze the data. This Master’s project presents a new sub-system that enables health scientists to analyze and visualize large quantities of AMPM 24 -hour dietary recalls for sub-groups of participants over any desired period of time.

40|$|A hyperspectral data {{processing}} tool ‘HyDAT ’ {{has been developed}} in MATLAB environment for processing of Field Spectroradiometer data for vegetation studies. Several basic functions e. g. data visualization, pre-processing, noise removal and data transformation and features like automatic absorption feature recovery and their characterization have been introduced. A new concept of spectral geometry has been included as a separate module which is conceptualized as triangle formed over spectral space joining the vertices of green reflectance peak, red well and inflection point and is extremely useful for vegetation health analysis. A large variety of spectral indices both static and dynamic, have been introduced which is useful for remote estimation of foliar biochemicals. Keeping in view the computational requirement, MATLAB {{was used in the}} programming environment. It has various in-built functions for statistical and mathematical analysis, signal processing functions like FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform), direct smoothing function for moving average, Savitzky-Golay smoothing technique, etc. which can be used with ease for the signal processing and field data analysis. FSF (Field Spectroscopy Facility) Post processing Toolbox can also be freely downloaded and can be used for the direct importing and pre-processing of Spectroradiometer data for detector overlap correction, erroneous water band removal and smoothing. The complete package of the software has been bundled for standalone application of shared libraries with additional files for end users.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we lay the {{foundations}} for exchanging, adapting, and interoperating engineering analysis models (EAMs). Our primary foundation {{is based upon the}} concept that engineering analysis models are knowledge-based abstractions of physical systems, and therefore knowledge sharing is the key to exchanging, adapting, and interoperating EAMs within or across organizations. To enable robust knowledge sharing, we propose a formal set of ontologies for classifying analysis modeling knowledge. To this end, the fundamental concepts that form the basis of all engineering analysis models are identified, described, and typed for implementation into a computational environment. This generic engineering analysis modeling ontology is extended to include distinct analysis subclasses. We discuss extension of the generic engineering analysis modeling class for two common analysis subclasses: continuum-based finite element models and lumped parameter or discrete analysis models. To illustrate how formal ontologies of engineering analysis modeling knowledge might facilitate knowledge exchange and improve reuse, adaptability, and interoperability of analysis models, we have developed a prototype engineering analysis modeling knowledge base, called ON-TEAM, based on our proposed ontologies. An industrial application is used to instantiate the ON-TEAM knowledge base and illustrate how such a system might improve the ability of organizations to efficiently exchange, adapt, and interoperate analysis models within a computer-based engineering environment. We have chosen Java as our implementation language for ON-TEAM so that we can fully exploit object-oriented technology, such as object inspection and the use of metaclasses and metaobjects, to operate on the knowledge base to perform a variety of tasks, such as knowledge inspection, editing, maintenance, model diagnosis, <b>customized</b> <b>report</b> generation of analysis models, model selection, automated customization of the knowledge interface based on the user expertise level, and interoperability assessment of distinct analysis models...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} {{where we are}} working {{there are a lot}} of {{different}} clients requesting similar reports with some differences due to customization of elements' position, colours and pages, all of them providing data in an xml document. At the moment the report's xsl stylesheet is modified for each request. We would like to reduce the number of different reports created and allow the customization of a single one big report that, via some customization steps will provide a pdf report with the desired characteristics for the user. Currently there are many platforms allowing report creation with a GUI and retrieving data from a structured xml file. What we cannot obtain by any of these existing platforms, is a huge level of contents and a way of representing element customization as the companies are requesting. Particular problems have arisen in choosing pages and elements to be shown, and in customizing colours of charts in a simple way. Since reports will be customized directly from the client, who knows xml but is not an expert in using it, what we are looking to achieve is an easy way to customize reports in xml language. The aim of this project is to provide a platform that starting from a complex xml document (derived from an existent application) describing in detail the report structure, will create an easy xml for customization and an xsl stylesheet for the final xsl-fo structure. In a second phase the user will provide the xml document containing the data, charts will be created, customization will be applied to the xsl if they need to modify the xsl structure, or by the xsl if they modify the report structure, and the final <b>customized</b> <b>report</b> is created. We would like to use as much as possible existing free products, exploiting their potentiality and adding some other newer through some simple actions for the end user, who can be either a technical specialist (for report structure creation and customization in case the end user is requesting some particular customization who is not able to apply by itself) or not (for report customization) ...|$|E
