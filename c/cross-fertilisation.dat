5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that <b>cross-fertilisation</b> {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through <b>cross-fertilisation</b> would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. <b>Cross-fertilisation</b> would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual <b>cross-fertilisation</b> with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the {{interaction}} between the western Christian and Islamic cultures was a significant, ultimately positive, factor in the development of European civilisation and the Renaissance. The many interactions between Europeans and the Islamic world across {{the entire length of the}} Mediterranean Sea led to improved perceptions of Islamic culture, but also make it difficult for historians to identify the specific source of various instances of cultural <b>cross-fertilisation.</b> The art and architecture of the Outremer show clear evidence of cultural fusion but it is difficult to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources. Textual sources are simpler, and translations made in Antioch are notable but considered secondary in importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and the hybrid culture of Sicily. In addition, Muslim libraries contained classical Greek and Roman texts that allowed Europe to rediscover pre-Christian philosophy, science and medicine.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{assemblage}} thinking and actor-network theory (ANT) {{have much more}} to gain from each other than debate has so far conceded. Exploring the conjunctions and disjunctions between the two approaches, it proposes three <b>cross-fertilisations</b> that have implications for understanding three key processes in our socio-material world: stabilisation, change and affect. First, the conceptual vocabulary of ANT can enrich assemblage thinking with an explicitly spatial account {{of the ways in}} which assemblages are drawn together, reach across space and are stabilised. Second, each approach is better attuned to conceptualising a particular kind of change in socio-material relations: ANT describes change without rupture, or fluidity, whereas assemblage thinking describes change with rupture, or events. Third and last, assemblage thinking could fashion ANT with a greater sensitivity for the productive role of affect in bringing socio-material relations into being through the production of desire/wish (désir). We demonstrate the implications of these <b>cross-fertilisations</b> for empirical work through a case study of the global market for assisted reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Few {{episodes in}} postcolonial Australian history have shown so {{remarkable}} {{a capacity to}} generate ever-increasing <b>cross-fertilisations</b> between myth, history and memory than the narratives centred on Eliza Fraser. The archive of materials surrounding the shipwreck of this British woman and her brief sojourn among the indigenous people of the Badtjala community of Fraser Island {{in the nineteenth century}} continues to grow. Kay Schaffer’s impressive work overtook earlier studies of the phenomenon but concentrates mainly on the many European re-constructions of the episode. The fecundity of the materials is far from exhausted. This paper explores some of the Aboriginal reactions to the tale but its main focus is Patrick White’s novel A Fringe of Leaves, which grew out of his own research and constructs a new myth with implications for the nation.

40|$|At {{the small}} {{gathering}} at the University of Hong Kong {{that resulted in}} many of the papers published in this issue of the JBA, I was paired with Nigel Holden, well-known for his work on cross-cultural management (CCM) in the field of international business (IB). I am an anthropologist with over 20 years of experience researching cross-cultural business contexts. As we did in Hong Kong, here I respond to Nigel’s commentary. Specifically, I discuss Hofstede’s project and the implications of CCM’s emphasis on “values ” and “measurement ” from an anthropological perspective. I then turn to the state of the field for qualitative research in IB, adding my voice to the growing chorus concerned with the imbalances of quantitative and qualitative methods in that discipline.

5|$|The {{book was}} his first {{detailed}} demonstration {{of the power of}} natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by <b>cross-fertilisation.</b> Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. Orchids was {{the first in a series}} of books on his innovative investigations into plants.|$|E
5|$|Except for his juvenilia, {{little of}} which has survived, Mahler {{composed}} only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song-cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of <b>cross-fertilisation</b> is important, it is during Mahler's extended Wunderhorn phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ("The Heavenly Life"), composed in 1892, became {{a key element in}} the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song, Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ("The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892, Urlicht ("Primal Light"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.|$|E

40|$|The Mediterranean is {{a unique}} setting and a kaleidoscopic melting pot; a calm, {{protected}} basin which thanks to its central position has for centuries been a crossroads connecting three continents; a place for meeting and exchange. The Mediterranean coasts possess an accumulation of exceptional urban places that are uniquely rich, layered and complex, and whose physical and geographical features have enabled them to play {{a fundamental role in}} the development of civilisations. The port cities around the Mediterranean are highly sophisticated artefacts of major heritage value and are the outcome of a process dating back to the beginning of time but also expressing the varied, many-sided present day as well as looking forward to the future. But the complex connotations of this urban fabric cannot simply be explained as a consequence or a product of the interaction between the morphology of the Mediterranean territory, the evolution of a single civilisation, or the result of applying different rules.

40|$|Using {{geographic}} information system datasets and Monte Carlo simulations, this study investigates {{to what extent the}} intra-regional variability in maize share and field distribution affects the feasibility of implementing isolation perimeters between genetically modified (GM) and non-GM maize fields. More specifically, five scenarios differing in shares and spatial distributions of GM maize were tested for various isolation perimeters in six agricultural areas in Flanders (Belgium). Proportions of non-GM maize fields and farmers having at least one non-GM maize field occurring within isolation perimeters were calculated to assess how spatial co-existence measures would affect the freedom of choice of neighbouring farmers to grow non-GM maize on their fields. Irrespective of the scenario tested, our results demonstrated that the proportions of non-GM maize fields and their corresponding farmers falling within the isolation perimeters are approximately two to eight times higher in areas with the highest maize share than in areas with the lowest maize share. The higher the share of GM maize and the wider the imposed isolation perimeter, the lower the intra-regional differences became. Hence, those findings confirm that farmers will not be equally affected by isolation perimeters, indicating the importance of considering intra-regional differences in the choice of appropriate spatial co-existence measures. Since uniform and wide isolation perimeters tend to be difficult to implement in practice and hardly reflect the diversity of the agricultural landscape, relying on flexible or combining various co-existence measures is worthwhile considering. As an alternative to single co-existence measures for limiting the GM input from <b>cross-fertilisations</b> between neighbouring maize fields, the appropriateness of other on-farm co-existence measures is discussed for Flemish agricultural conditions. Proposing the most appropriate co-existence measures on a case-by-case basis may be one step forward in reaching proportionate, fair and consistent co-existence at the regional and landscape level...|$|R

He joined the influential Heidelberg museum and participated fully in the city's literary life, reviewing local theatre for English readers.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to Down House, a quiet former parsonage {{in the village of}} Downe. He wrote, [...] "The flowers are here very beautiful". Darwin {{followed}} the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist Robert Brown, and read Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered). The little known book, published in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a teleological purpose: insects would act as [...] "living brushes" [...] to cross-fertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of evolution gave new meaning to Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for <b>cross-fertilisation.</b> He welcomed its support for his supposition that <b>cross-fertilisation</b> in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self-fertilisation, and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.|$|E
500|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} {{in birds}} typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group {{in order to}} remain with the family to help rear younger kin.

In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

[...] He told a friend [...] "I cannot endure doing nothing", and resumed his work on orchids, assisted in his research by his son Francis Darwin.

500|$|While the {{bee orchid}} showed {{adaptation}} for self-fertilisation, its mechanism also enabled occasional <b>cross-fertilisation,</b> creating the biological diversity that Darwin felt {{was needed for}} vigorous survival, {{which could not be}} provided by self-fertilisation. As an example of [...] "how beautifully everything is contrived", Darwin described how he had found that in Spiranthes flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At Torquay he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting {{at the bottom of the}} spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add [...] "to her store of honey" [...] while perpetuating the flowers [...] "which will yield honey to future generations of bees".|$|E

A new Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee (CASAC) was set up, but there was no requirement for the CAS to accept its advice. According to historian Alan Stephens, Rowland considered that the [...] "collective wisdom" [...] engendered by the Air Board had been generally beneficial to the RAAF, and believed the new arrangements led to paralysis and arrogation of decision making', and empire building in the Public Service component". Though known as a strong committee member who enjoyed a good argument, he [...] "found that the sheer time involved in attending meetings made it very difficult for him to run the Air Force 'the way [...] wanted to. To facilitate the <b>cross-fertilisation</b> of ideas on air power between senior officers, he inaugurated an annual CAS Symposium. During his term as CAS, Rowland reoriented the RAAF's priorities in line with the Defence of Australia policy, which had been adopted by the government in the early 1970s. As a result, he placed the strongest emphasis on protecting Australia from air attack, followed by conducting air strikes on targets in other countries, and supporting the Army and Navy.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the many}} {{prominent}} biologists who began research on coevolution, Hermann Müller was {{particularly interested in}} the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other. Like Darwin, he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure <b>cross-fertilisation,</b> and added his own premise that most insects were not [...] "limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers". On this basis, he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects (without making access too easy for non-pollinators), and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar. He found that Alpine flowers tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes, and by butterflies at higher altitudes, beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators. By comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor, and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees, {{he was the first to}} use a combination of morphological and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation. His brother Fritz Müller used similar methods when studying mimicry in Brazil. The early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry; Henry Walter Bates had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the Linnean Society of London in December 1861 in Darwin's presence, and published in November 1862.|$|E
