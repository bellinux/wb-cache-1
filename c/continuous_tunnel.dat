25|$|The {{conversion}} proposal—which {{would have}} involved a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> running from Lake Street station in Brighton to Maverick Square in East Boston, plus a second through route from Lechmere to Tremont Street in Roxbury—was never implemented {{except for the}} partial completion of the Huntington Avenue Subway in 1941. However, {{many of the other}} extension proposals were partially or wholly completed, {{with the opening of the}} Blue Line to Wonderland in 1954, the Highland Branch conversion to light rail in 1959, the partial conversion of the Reading Hill Line to the Haymarket North Extension in 1977, the extension of the Red Line to Braintree in 1980, and the relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor in 1987. Two additional projects were considered in the report but not recommended for immediate work: a circumferential route which would reappear years later as the Urban Ring, and an extension of Tremont Street Subway through service from Lechmere to Woburn via the Lowell Line.|$|E

50|$|Together, the A pulleys form a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> and, {{because each}} A pulley's {{attachments}} on the bone is wider than its roof, its shape prevents the pulley from pinching its neighbours at extremes of flexion. The short roof also minimises {{pressure on the}} tendon under tension, instead distributing pressure throughout the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The station built {{during the}} {{renovation}} in the 1970s remained {{in many ways}} an inadequate station, partly because of its lack of <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Deutsche Bahn is planning the renovation of the station. All tracks and platforms of the passenger station are to be rebuilt and the signalling system is to be modernised. The modernisation is expected to cost almost €100 million.|$|R
50|$|The TWT was a {{blow-down}} type tunnel. In {{contrast to}} a <b>continuous</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> a blow-down wind tunnel only provides air for short period. A <b>continuous</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> is driven by large fans and typically is only capable of subsonic speeds. Because a blow-down tunnel can build up pressure {{over a long period}} time, it can release air at faster speeds.|$|R
50|$|A {{protective}} tunnel formed with row cover {{is sometimes called}} a cloche, although a cloche, or bell jar, commonly refers to a distinct type of protective covering, made of glass or plastic, usually placed over individual plants. No longer in general use, a type of cloche employed in Europe involved panes of glass attached with wire to form <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels</b> to protect rows of crops.|$|R
50|$|Glass shards are {{cleaned and}} milled to a powder before a foaming agent, active carbon, is added in either liquid or solid form. The {{material}} is {{passed through a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> furnace and heated to a temperature of 800-900 °C. Optimum temperatures produce maximum quantities of the foamed product. The foamed molten glass breaks into gravel on cooling.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, Brayton {{married his}} second wife, Ellen Webster Grieve (known as “Webb”), {{and they began}} to {{transform}} the small workshop into a larger commercial enterprise. They constructed a new manufacturing facility on a five-acre plot of land in 1938, between the Pacific Coast Highway and Glenneyre Street. The completely modern new location featured two <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> kilns, essential for large-scale production, as well as design facilities and a showroom.|$|E

From Wiesbaden Central Station, the route would follow the A 66 to Wiesbaden's Cross and from there run to Frankfurt Airport. While parts of the railway would be in cuttings, it would run through the city of Wiesbaden in a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Except at the extremities, {{the line}} ran through <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels</b> and {{was of course}} {{operated}} by steam trains. (Some locomotives were fitted with condensing equipment.) 130 passenger trains ran each way daily, and heavy mineral traffic to Stobcross used the route. The ventilation and lighting of the sub-surface stations were poor, and the environment attracted much criticism. At this time technical development suggested that electric traction might be feasible. The Central London Railway was being constructed on that system; (it opened in 1900;) and of course street tramcars had been using electricity, not without problems at first.|$|R
50|$|From 2005 to 2008, major {{upgrading}} works took place, and now {{a significant}} portion of the southern part runs underground. They are the longest urban motorway tunnels in Europe, with sections of more than 6 km in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction, between the south entry of the Avenida de Portugal tunnel and the north exit of the M-30 south by-pass there are close to 10 km of <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The M30 tunnels run between a point roughly 700 meters north of the junction with A5 motorway and continue all the way up to the junction between M30 and A3 motorway.|$|R
5000|$|A86 (sometimes called [...] "Paris super-périphérique") is {{the second}} ring road around Paris, France. It follows an {{irregular}} path around Paris with {{the distance from the}} city centre (Notre Dame) varying from 8 - 16 km. A part of A86 contains the world's longest urban motorway tunnel (10 km of <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel),</b> opened in two parts in 2009 and 2011. The tunnel is limited to a height of 2.0 m (6'7") and commercial vehicles are prohibited as a result.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel's {{cost was}} {{estimated}} to be around , and was financed through Oslo Package 1, with part of the funding coming from the city's toll ring. The project includes an additional 8.0 km of roads, 5.7 km of pedestrian and cyle paths and 3.5 km of bus lanes. The project will create a 6.0 km <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> from Framnes (at the Kiel ferry terminal) to Ryen. The connection with the Festning Tunnel will require a 100 m sinking of the latter, and it will have a basement built under it.|$|E
50|$|The {{structural}} {{characterization of}} phosphoglycolate phosphatase from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB 1L6R, pictured) revealed the monomer of the dimeric enzyme (indicated {{by the light}} blue and green coloring) includes two distinct domains, a smaller cap domain and a larger core domain. While the topology of the large domain is conserved, there is structural variation of the smaller domain. The active site of the protein is a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> through the monomer and is lined with acidic residues, a feature consistent with other acid phosphatases. In addition, electrostatic surface analysis indicates a relatively acidic surface.|$|E
50|$|On 21 December 2009, NZTA {{announced}} that the tunnels would be built further east as <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels</b> without an (open) gap halfway, and expressed confidence {{that they would be}} able to be completed within the original project budget. NZTA argued that this would be the most cost-effective option for constructing this section, and would require 205 houses to be bulldozed. Underground land would need to be purchased from 105 properties. The board had decided against including a central interchange at New North Road. Construction on the project was proposed to start in mid to late 2011 with an anticipated completion date in the 2015/16 financial year.|$|R

50|$|Tom Clark, one of Rice Owen Clark's great-grandsons, {{began working}} in the firm during the depression. He was {{responsible}} for the plant expanding in 1937 to produce items unrelated to the building trade such as electrical insulation equipment and moulds for rubber products such as gloves, baby bottle teats and condoms. Clark was an employer who always encouraged his staff to experiment with new products. As a result, an oil-fired <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> kiln was built in 1941, and tableware manufacture began the following year. The company had established a research department in 1938 to investigate the viability of producing tableware from New Zealand clays.|$|E
50|$|In January 2012 the Transport Secretary {{announced}} further {{revisions to}} the Phase 1 route. The key revisions included a new 2.7 mi tunnel at South Ruislip avoiding the Chiltern Line and mitigating the impact in the Ruislip area; realignment of the route and extension of the <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel,</b> originally from the M25 to Amersham, to near Little Missenden; at Wendover and nearby South Heath extension to the green tunnels to reduce impact on local communities; an extension to the green tunnel beside Chipping Warden and Aston Le Walls; and realignment to avoid heritage sites around Edgcote. The revised route would comprise 22.5 mi in tunnel or green tunnel compared to 14.5 mi, a 55% increase. Overall, 79 mi of the 140 mi route will be in tunnel or cutting, while 40 mi will be on viaduct or embankment, a reduction of 10 mi from the route in the original consultation documents.|$|E

5000|$|The tunnel work, {{as stated}} in the {{invitation}} to bidders, will include: [...] "removal of loose rock, rock bolting to secure unstable rock blocks, repair of the existing concrete tunnel liner, installation of a membrane liner that will provide a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> waterproofing system, installation of CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras at both portals, and installation of a lighted pedestrian path inside the tunnel that extends a minimum of 50 feet (15 m) beyond both portals. A radio system must also be installed that provides radio signal and coverage inside the tunnel. The requirements will also include rock excavation from the west tunnel portal, effectively reducing the overall tunnel length by a minimum of 15 feet (4.6 m). The work also includes railroad track bed excavation, initial ballast placement, and rock excavation and slope protection and stabilization of loose and potentially loose rock on both the west and east rock cut approaches to the tunnel. This slope protection shall address rockfall hazard protection including construction of adequate catchment areas, the installation of cable mesh and/or netting, vegetation and tree removal, removal of loose rock and rock bolting to secure unstable blocks. The protection shall extend approximately 1,700 feet (520 m) from the west portal and 200 feet (61 m) from the east portal. The work also includes a section of track roadbed restoration beyond the west portal, including cutting, clearing, and disposal of all brush, trees, and vegetative matter, and its drainage system, approximately 8,000 feet (2460 m) long." ...|$|E

40|$|National audiencePiping erosion {{is one of}} {{the main}} cause of serious {{hydraulic}} work failure. This phenomenon involves the progression of a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the upstream and the downstream side. Starting from the bulk equations for diphasic flow with diffusion and from the jump equations with erosion, we propose a two parameters scaling law for piping erosion. The first parameter is the critical shear stress. The second parameter is the erosional characteristic time, which is a function of the initial hydraulic gradient and of the erosion coefficient. The comparison with experimental data has confirmed the validity of the scaling law. We deduce an estimation of the time for breaching in hydraulic works (dams, dykes) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} big scheme was {{improvement}} of the M30. This road is the inner ring motorway of Madrid. Significant portions of M30 run underground and its urban motorway tunnels have sections of more than 6 km in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction. Between the south entry of the Avenida de Portugal tunnel and the north exit of the M-30 south by-pass there are close to 10 km of <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels.</b> M40 is a ring motorway which borders Madrid at a mean distance of 10.07 km {{and it has a}} total length of 63.3 km. M45 is a partial ring around the city serving the metropolitan area of Madrid. It was built to help alleviate the congestion of the M40 from the southern to the north-eastern, runs between the M40 and the M50 where the two ring motorways are more separated. M50 is the outer of the Madrid orbital motorways and has a total length of 85 km. It services mainly the metropolitan area at a mean distance of 13.5 km.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{stations}} {{in the world with}} platform screen doors are ten {{stations in}} the Saint Petersburg Metro's Line 2 that opened between 1961 and 1972. The platform [...] "doors" [...] are actually openings in the station wall, which support the ceiling of the platform. The track tunnels adjoining the ten stations' island platforms were built with tunnel boring machines (TBMs), and the island platforms were actually located in a separate vault between the two track tunnels. Usually, TBMs bore the deep-level tunnels between stations, while the station vaults are dug out manually and contain both the tracks and the platform. However, {{in the case of the}} Saint Petersburg Metro, the TBMs bored a pair of <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnels</b> that passed through ten stations, and the stations themselves were built in vaults that only contained the platform (with small openings on the sides of the vault, in order for passengers to access the trains in the tunnels). These openings were covered with steel doors in order to prevent people from falling into the gaps between the walls.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability soils, consolidation processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the advancing face. Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation advance rate must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of advance rate to ground permeability. The higher the advance rate, the lower the surface settlements and the angular distortion will be. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{process called}} "piping", which often occurs in water-retaining {{structures}} (earth-dams, dykes, levees), involving {{the formation and}} progression of a <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the upstream and downstream sides, {{is one of the}} main cause of structure failure. Starting with the diphasic flow volume equations and the jump equations including the erosion processes, a simplified one-dimensional model for two-phase piping flow erosion was developed. The numerical simulation based on constant input and output pressures showed that the particle concentration can be a significant factor at the very beginning of the process, resulting in the enlargement of the hole at the exit. However, it was concluded that this influence is a secondary factor: the dilute flow assumption, which considerably simplifies the description, is relevant here...|$|E

First and second stage flight of the space shuttle were simulated by firing the main engines in conjunction with the SRB rocket motors or only the SSME's into the <b>continuous</b> <b>tunnel</b> airstream. For the correct rocket plume environment, the simulated altitude pressures were halved to maintain the rocket chamber/altitude pressure ratio. Tunnel freestream Mach numbers from 2. 2 to 3. 5 were simulated over an altitude range of 60 to 130 thousand feet with varying angle of attack, yaw angle, nozzle gimbal angle and SRB chamber pressure.
