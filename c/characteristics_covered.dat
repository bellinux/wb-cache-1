40|$|Cloud {{services}} have recently gained popularity and play an increasing role in enterprise architectures. Organizations adopting cloud services expect not only improvements in flexibility and scalability, {{but also a}} means of outsourcing IT tasks. In contrast to custom or packaged applications, {{software as a service}} offerings help to reduce the technical expertise required to provide the necessary IT resources. Software quality models help organizations to assess the state of their application systems and have been subject to research for a couple of decades. However, the stakeholder of the existing quality models is mainly concerned with the internal structure of software components. With the shift towards cloud based service offerings, a different conception of quality arises. Current quality models consider resource owner and provider as a single entity. Thus, most of the quality <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> in the models reflect the internal view of a software service. To address the deficiency, this paper puts forward a new quality characteristic that reflects the priorities of the service user as a distinct party, implying six different phases of service consumption.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of those individual characteristics which have the ability to, or have been purported to, influence physiological responses to heat stress. This overview is based on studies which are, for the most part, cross-sectional in design and singular in focus. As used here, "individual characteristics " refer to physical or physiological traits which are not readily modifiable within a relatively short time h e. Therefore, such factors as heat acclimation and hydration state are not included. Those individual <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> are gender, age (including menopausal status), race, body size and composition, and VoZmaX. Furthermore, there is a propensity to use the general (but typically illdefined) term "heat tolerance " in the vast body of literature which relates to individual charactmistics and heat stress. In the interest of clarifying the often contradictory findings in this area, the present paper divides the vague notion of "heat tolerance " into 2 distinct levels of response Variables- body core temperature responses and heat loss effector responses (sweating, skin vasodilatation, etc.). It is important to note that these 2 related response outcomes are often not directly linked, e. g. a lower sweating rate does not necessarily result in a higher body core temperature...|$|E
40|$|The study {{consists}} of two essays investigating different aspects of e-tailing dynamics. The first one uses archival data from public sources on 335 online retailers. Business <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> are order of market entry, single-channel e-tailer, and e-tailer age. After controlling for other effects, the findings do not show any order of entry impact. Single-channel e-tailers are more vulnerable than multi-channel retailers. The results also indicate an increasing exit hazard as e-tailers become older. Industry characteristics {{included in the study}} are market expectations reflected by NASDAQ, digital products, and competitive density. E-tailers that start operations during periods of high NASDAQ stock prices encounter the highest risk of failure. E-tailers selling digital products such as books, music, videos, and software have higher survival rates versus other e-tailers. Further, as categories become more crowded, the probability of failure increases. The second essay looks at factors that can drive traffic to an e-tailer 2 ̆ 7 s site. The study uses unique data on 81 top e-tailers. Findings indicate that early entry assures greater awareness resulting in more traffic to a web site. Also, an e-tailer 2 ̆ 7 s name presence in the media is the biggest driver of site visits. E-tailers with more product categories or e-tailers in the digital categories attract more traffic overall. Within categories, relative consumer preference is the biggest predictor of web site traffic. The study concludes with a discussion of the results and managerial implications. ...|$|E
40|$|Molecular imaging {{studies have}} {{recently}} found inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in World Health Organization (WHO) grade II gliomas. A correlative analysis with tumor histology, however, is still lacking. For elucidation we conducted the current prospective study. Fifty-five adult patients with an MRI-based suspicion of a WHO grade II glioma were included. [F- 18]Fluoroethyltyrosine (18 FET) uptake kinetic studies were combined with frame-based stereotactic localization techniques {{and used as}} a guide for stepwise (1 -mm steps) histopathological evaluation throughout the tumor space. In tumors with heterogeneous PET findings, the O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status and expression of mutated protein isocitrate dehydrogenase variant R 132 H (IDH 1) were determined inside and outside of hot spot volumes. Metabolic imaging revealed 3 subgroups: the homogeneous WHO grade II glioma group (30 patients), the homogeneous malignant glioma group (10 patients), and the heterogeneous group exhibiting both low- and high-grade characteristics at different sites (15 patients). Stepwise evaluation of 373 biopsy samples indicated a strong correlation with analyses of uptake kinetics (p < 0. 0001). A homogeneous pattern of uptake kinetics was linked to homogeneous histopathological findings, whereas a heterogeneous pattern was associated with histopathological heterogeneity; hot spots exhibiting malignant glioma <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> 4 – 44 % of the entire tumor volumes. Both MGMT and IDH 1 status were identical at different tumor sites and not influenced by heterogeneity. Maps of 18 FET uptake kinetics strongly correlated with histopathology in suspected grade II gliomas.

40|$|Aim. Bare metal stents have {{improved}} results of endovascular treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. Polytetrafluoroethylene covered stents may further improve patency rates by preventing tissue ingrowth, and might reduce complications. This {{study was conducted}} to assess possible assets or liabilities of covered stents used for aortoiliac occlusive disease and to conduct a comparison with bare metal stents. Methods. A review was performed of literature published until March 2012 for infrarenal aortic lesions, iliac lesions and complex aortoiliac lesions. Outcomes were technical success, patency rates, clinical success and complication rates. Results were addressed to the three anatomic regions: the infrarenal aorta, the aortoiliac bifurcation and iliac arteries. Results. A total of 51 articles were included in the study. Overall technical success varied between 73 % and 100 %. Randomized data have proven the superiority of covered stents in extensive iliac occlusive lesions. Case series of patients with iliac occlusive disease demonstrated a 1 -year primary patency of bare metal stents between 76 % and 100 % with a 5 -year primary patency rate of 63 %- 83 %. One-year primary patency of covered stents varied between 70 % and 100 %, while no long term patency rates with covered stents have been reported so far. Reliable comparisons between groups cannot be made due to variances in patient and lesion <b>characteristics.</b> <b>Covered</b> stents seem to improve results of kissing stents and are related to excellent results in isolated aortic lesions. No difference in complication rate between bare metal and covered stents have been described, to date. Conclusion. Covered stents improve results of endovascular treatment of extensive iliac occlusive lesions and are related to excellent results in isolated aortic lesions. They may provide a valid alternative for surgery in patients with extensive aortoiliac disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{summarize}} all of the published data on the Tolbachik volcanic massif in order to provide a clear framework for the geochronologic, petrologic, geochemical and to a lesser extent the geophysical and tectonic characteristics of the Tolbachik system established prior to the 2012 – 2013 eruption. The Tolbachik massif forms the southwestern part of the voluminous Klyuchevskoy volcanic group in Kamchatka. The massif includes two large stratovolcanoes, Ostry (“Sharp”) Tolbachik and Plosky (“Flat”) Tolbachik, and a 70 km long zone of the basaltic monogenetic cones that form an arcuate rift-like structure running across the Plosky Tolbachik summit. The Tolbachik massif gained international attention after the 1975 – 1976 Great Tolbachik Fissure Eruption (GTFE), which was one of the largest eruptions of the 20 th century and one of the six largest basaltic fissure eruptions in historical time. By the end of the GTFE, 2. 2 km 3 of volcanic products of variable basaltic compositions with MORB-like isotopic <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> an area of > 1000 km 2. During the following three decades more than 700 papers on various aspects of this eruption have been published both in national and international journals.

40|$|The {{phosphorus}} retention {{ability of}} soils depends on several factors and influences {{the effectiveness of}} fertilization {{as well as the}} release of P from soil to water. In the present study the phosphorus supplying and/or retention ability of soils were estimated by two approaches: biological approach (pot experiments) and modelling (by regression analyses). In the course of the biological approach pot experiments were carried out with soils showing significant differences in total and available P contents. Soil samples were collected from selected plots of 9 sites of the National Long-Term Fertilization Trials (NLFT) after 20 years of fertilization, which represents different agro-ecological regions of Hungary. Site <b>characteristics</b> <b>covered</b> a wide range in pH, carbonate and P content, representing typical soil types of the country. With the statistical approach (modelling), the most important soil properties were included and the role of these factors was evaluated by stepwise regression analyses. From the equations, the contribution of important soil parameters to phosphorus supplying and retention ability could be quantified. The objective {{of the present study was}} to find a simple way to compare and evaluate the two approaches in P nutrient turnover of soils. Results of the two approaches were correlated. From these results, a rank correlation was also made from the experimental and calculated results. A very close relationship was observed for the P supply and retention of soils (r value was 0. 918 for the N 0 P 0 K 0 unfertilized control and 0. 927 for the N 200 P 200 K 100 fertilization level). Values obtained with rank correlation were 0. 87 and 0. 866, respectively, verifying that both methodologies are reliable for estimating the nutrient dynamics in soils and to predict P dynamics in a diverse range of soils...|$|E
