500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a <b>cat.</b> <b>I</b> {{think it would be}} fair to say he was flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a <b>cat.</b> <b>I</b> really am a cat person".|$|E

He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the <b>Cat.</b> <b>I</b> drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's <b>cat,</b> <b>I</b> reach for my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E
