Second, epipolar 'curve' pair does not exist.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Giant {{designed}} the first road bicycle with a sloping top tube featuring a smaller rear triangle. The tighter chainstay-seatstay configuration {{is said to}} be inherently stiffer than a more <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> design, and because less material is used, the Compact Road design is also said to be lighter. With more responsive cornering and improved acceleration, as well as improved aerodynamics, the Giant design became largely imitated.|$|E

30|$|Later on, {{being the}} {{generalization}} of the frames, fusion frames were introduced by Casazza and Kutyniok (2004) and Fornasier (2002) to handle some large systems which {{are impossible to}} handle effectively by just a simple frame. The essence of fusion frame is the construction of global frames from local frames in Hilbert space. So the characteristic fusion frame is special suiting for application such as distributing sensing, parallel processing and packet encoding, and so on. Now, many excellent results of <b>conventional</b> <b>frames</b> have been achieved and applied successfully, which properties of the <b>conventional</b> <b>frames</b> may be extended to the fusion frames? It is a tempting subject because {{of the complexity of}} the structure of fusion <b>frames</b> compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we mainly {{study the}} equalities and inequalities of fusion frames. On some equalities for <b>conventional</b> <b>frames</b> were first found by Balan et al. (2007) when the authors studied the optimal {{decomposition}} of a Parseval frame. Later on, many authors such as Gǎvruţa (2006) and Zhu and Wu (2010) developed or improved some equalities or inequalities of the <b>conventional</b> <b>frames</b> {{on the basis}} of the work in originally in Balan et al. (2007).|$|R

5000|$|Boiserie ( [...] ; {{often used}} in the plural boiseries) is the French term used to define ornate and {{intricately}} carved wood panelling. Early examples of boiseries were unpainted, but later the raised mouldings were often painted or gilded. Boiseries were popular in seventeenth and eighteenth century French interior design and the Palace of Versailles has many fine examples. The panels were not confined to just {{the walls of a}} room but were used to decorate doors, frames, cupboards, and shelves also. Often pictures would be set into the boiseries, the carving framing the picture rather like a <b>conventional</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the barn has three aisles, separating areas used for different functions. The main framing of the barn is hand-hewn timbers with posts that have a gunstock shape, and are connected to transverse beams via plates. This construction method, more normally found in older (or traditionally-built) English barns, is relatively rare in Maine's gambrel-roofed barns, {{most of which were}} built later in the 19th or early 20th centuries. This building's gambrel roof is a <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> construction that probably replaced the original gable roof in the 1920s during a major renovation that also relocated the posts of the center aisle.|$|E
50|$|Integral {{frame and}} body {{construction}} requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a <b>conventional</b> <b>frame.</b> In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle—forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or {{by a combination of}} these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a monocoque structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still ribs, bulkheads and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description semi-monocoque more appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{assembly}} method, {{the pieces}} are end-matched. This method {{eliminates the need for}} mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on [...] or [...] centres of <b>conventional</b> <b>framing.</b>|$|R

30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of our study}} was the variety of fixators used in group B. Four types of <b>conventional</b> circular <b>frames</b> were included. However, the standard Ilizarov procedure was used with all four types. Also, cases that were allocated to receive I–TSF were more complex cases than those receiving only <b>conventional</b> circular <b>frames,</b> which might have introduced selection bias. Further limitations of our study include {{the small sample size}} and retrospective design. Further comparative studies are needed to prove the efficacy of bone transport with a TSF in combination with an Ilizarov frame compared with a <b>conventional</b> circular <b>frame</b> only.|$|R

5000|$|The 1941, Nash 600 was {{the first}} mass-produced unibody {{construction}} automobile made in the United States. Its lighter weight compared to body-on-frame automobiles and lower air drag helped it to achieve excellent fuel economy for its day. The [...] "600" [...] model designation {{is said to have}} been derived from overdrive-equipped examples of this car's ability to travel 600 mi on a 20 gal tank of gasoline. In other words, it would achieve 30 mpg. The 600 models used an unusual steering/front suspension system with extremely long king pins. Inadequate lubrication became a problem for these systems, commonly resulting in premature failures. The design of the cars was improved by new front ends, upholstery, and chrome trim from 1942 to 1948. The larger Ambassador models shared the same bodies with the 600 but placed this unibody structure on top of a <b>conventional</b> <b>frame,</b> resulting in an extremely strong car.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1941 and 1942 model years (only) all Nash {{vehicles}} became Ambassadors, {{and rode}} both {{long and short}} wheelbases. The Ambassador Eight now shared the Ambassador Six's 121-inch wheelbase. The Nash Ambassador 600, built on a 112 in wheelbase, became the first popular domestic automobile to be built using the single-welded [...] "unibody" [...] type of monocoque construction that Nash called [...] "Unitized", rather than body-on-frame. From 1941 through 1948, Nash Ambassador models placed this unibody structure {{on top of a}} <b>conventional</b> <b>frame,</b> thus creating a solid and sturdy automobile. It {{was also one of the}} first in the [...] "low-priced" [...] market segment with coil spring suspension in front and back, [...] "giving it the best ride in its class." [...] In the spirit of wartime conservation, the Ambassador Six and Eight lost their twin ignition feature for 1942, reverting to a single spark plug per cylinder. The 1941-42 Ambassador 600 was also the only Ambassador ever powered by an L-head engine. Nash would remain with this model arrangement through the post-war 1946-1948 model years, although the 600 would no longer be known as an Ambassador.|$|E

5000|$|In many areas, diners were {{superseded}} in the 1970s by {{fast food}} restaurants, but {{in parts of}} New Jersey, New York, the New England states, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the independently-owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including Cape Cod and Colonial styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish wallpaper, fountains, crystal chandeliers and Greek statuary. The {{definition of the term}} [...] "diner" [...] began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated facade. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.|$|E

The background is encoded at a low frame rate, and up-converted to the same. frame rate as R 01 at the decoder, with an integrated background motion composition model. The experimental results indicate that, compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> rate up-conversion and normal codec schemc without frame rate up-conversion at the same bandwidth, the proposed scheme has higher PNSR performance and better subjective visual quality...|$|E
50|$|The cost of SIPs {{are higher}} than the {{materials}} for a comparable framed building in the United States; however, {{this may not be}} true elsewhere. A well-built home using SIPs will have a tighter building envelope and the walls will have higher insulating properties, which leads to fewer draughts and a decrease in operating costs. Also, due to the standardized and all-in-one nature of SIPs, construction time can be less than for a frame home, as well as requiring fewer tradespeople. The panels can be used as floor, wall, and roof, {{with the use of the}} panels as floors being of particular benefit when used above an uninsulated space below. As a result, the total life-cycle cost of a SIP-constructed building will, in general, be lower than for a <b>conventional</b> <b>framed</b> one—by as much as 40%. Whether the total construction cost (materials and labor) is lower than for <b>conventional</b> <b>framing</b> appears to depend on the circumstances, including local labor conditions and the degree to which the building design is optimized for one or the other technology.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLet {Wi}i∈I be a (redundant) {{sequence}} of subspaces of a Hilbert space each being endowed with a weight vi, and let H be the closed linear {{span of the}} Wis, a composite Hilbert space. {(Wi,vi) }i∈I is called a fusion frame provided it satisfies a certain property which controls the weighted overlaps of the subspaces. These systems contain <b>conventional</b> <b>frames</b> as a special case, however they reach far “beyond frame theory. ” In case each subspace Wi {{is equipped with a}} spanning frame system {fij}j∈Ji, we refer to {(Wi,vi,{fij}j∈Ji) }i∈I as a fusion frame system. The focus of this article is on computational issues of fusion frame reconstructions, unique properties of fusion frames important for applications with particular focus on those superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>frames,</b> and on centralized reconstruction versus distributed reconstructions and their numerical differences. The weighted and distributed processing technique described in this article is not only a natural fit to distributed processing systems such as sensor networks, but also an efficient scheme for parallel processing of very large frame systems. Another important component of this article is an extensive study of the robustness of fusion frame systems...|$|R
40|$|In modern age, the {{decrease}} of available free land and increase of land prices {{along with the}} wide spread of urban area has made architects and engineers to develop the cities vertically. For vertical growth, the only option is to construct the buildings as high as possible. It is a task of a structural designer to make the desired building stand and stable throughout its life. There are various structural systems for tall buildings, among them diagrid system is selected for this work. Diagrid is an exterior structural system which resists the lateral forces by axial actions of diagonals provided in periphery. Statistical analysis of tall buildings in India is carried out and presented for buildings having height more than 150 m or 40 storeys. Parametric study and detailed comparison of diagrid structural system with respect to <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> is carried out for symmetrical buildings. In this study seven steel buildings of identical base area and loadings with different heights are designed for optimum sections for both structural systems diagrid and <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> in ETABS. Various parameters like fundamental time period, maximum top storey lateral displacement, maximum base shear, steel weight, percentage differences in change of steel weight, maximum storey displacement and maximum storey drift are considered in this study. A Diagrid structure performs well than <b>conventional</b> <b>frame</b> structures and increase in steel weight with increase in height of building is considerably less in diagrid structure...|$|E
