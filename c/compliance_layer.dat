This approach reflects {{the diversity of the}} technical environment, the service provider's environment, the user requirements and maturity of standards by separating contextual aspects; technical and non-technical policies; the selection of appropriate solutions and the <b>compliance</b> <b>layer.</b> To place the layered approach in a working context, case studies are provided of the types of environments in which the standards framework could be implemented, from an established standards-based service, to a new service in the process of selecting and implementing metadata standards. These examples serve to illustrate the need for such frameworks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a layered approach to selection {{and use of}} open standards which is being developed to support development work within the UK higher and further educational communities. This approach reflects {{the diversity of the}} technical environment, the service provider's environment, user requirements and maturity of standards by separating contextual aspects; technical and non-technical policies; the selection of appropriate solutions and the <b>compliance</b> <b>layer.</b> To place the layered approach in context, case studies are provided of the types of environments in which the standards framework can be implemented. The paper describes how this contextual approach can be extended to address other areas such as Web accessibility and use of open source software. Use of a common model can provide consistent approaches by funding bodies and shared understanding for developers. This contextual approach is being extended to support development work with other public sector organizations within the UK. We describe how the approach is well-suited to ensure common ways of working across disparate sets of organizations and how the approach can be applied within a wider context...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to better {{understand}} the factors that affect melt-wear in the armature-to-rail contact interface of an electromagnetic launcher (EML). In order to investigate the factors, the study uses finite element analysis (FEA) to vary parameters of a lab-scale EML at the Georgia Institute of Technology. FEA is used due to the complex nature of the system, which includes the geometry and various engineering aspects that the EML incorporates. The study focuses on an uncoupled analysis of the structural, electromagnetic (EMAG), thermal, and modal aspects. The reason for the uncoupled analysis was because the system was complex and there were computational limits. Also, by uncoupling the analysis fields, the way the parameters affected melt-wear could be viewed separately. The study varied the geometry of the armature, the stiffness of the rail system (<b>compliance</b> <b>layer),</b> and the material of the armature. The structural analysis was for the initial contact of the rail to the armature and found the von Mises stresses, contact area, and contact pressure. The EMAG analysis found the Lorentz forces in the system based on a current curve used in the lab-scale EML. The thermal analysis consisted of friction heating and Joule heating. The modal analysis was for the unstressed and pre-stressed armature. Based on the study conducted, it was found that aluminum would provide the best speeds due to its lighter mass, but lacked in the thermal resistance area. Tungsten provided the better thermal resistance, but lacked in the potential speed due to its heavier mass. M. S.

40|$|The {{success of}} e-Learning is largely {{dependent}} {{on the impact of}} its multimedia aided learning content on the learner over the hyper media. The e-Learning portals with different proportion of multimedia elements have different impact on the learner, as there is lack of standardization. The Learning Technology System Architecture (LTSA) Layer 1 deals with the effect of environment on the learner. From an information technology perspective it specifies learner interaction from the environment to the learner via multimedia content. Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCROM) is a collection of standards and specifications for content of web-based e-learning and specifies how JavaScript API can be used to integrate content development. In this paper an examination is made on the design features of interactive multimedia components of the learning packages by creating an algorithm which will give a comparative study of multimedia component used by different learning packages. The resultant graph as output helps us to analysis to what extent any LMS <b>compliance</b> LTSA <b>layer</b> 1 and SCORM specification...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>compliance</b> of rock <b>layers</b> is {{referred}} to as competence: a competent layer or bed of rock can withstand an applied load without collapsing and is relatively strong, while an incompetent layer is relatively weak. [...] When rock behaves as a fluid, {{as in the case of}} very weak rock such as rock salt, or any rock that is buried deeply enough, it typically shows flow folding (also called passive folding, because little resistance is offered): the strata appear shifted undistorted, assuming any shape impressed upon them by surrounding more rigid rocks. The strata simply serve as markers of the folding. Such folding is also a feature of many igneous intrusions and glacier ice.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) and hypertension are {{two common}} diseases that often coexist. The {{most common cause}} of death in the diabetic patient is heart disease. In the present investigation we combine Nebivolol and Nateglinide for better patient <b>compliance.</b> IR <b>layer</b> was formulated using various superdisintegrants like Crospovidone, Croscarmellose sodium, and sodium starch glycolate and SR layer was formulated using polymers and gums like HPMC E 15, ethyl cellulose, Gaur gum, and Xanthan gum. The disintegration and dissolution study of both layers showed that inclusion of surfactant (sodium lauryl sulphate) to the tablet formulation (IR) and dissolution medium (SR) enhanced the release of drugs from both layers. Kinetic studies of optimized IR layer (NBL 8) and SR layer (N 9) showed good linearity with regression coefficient of 0. 9714 (Higuchi model) and 0. 9931 (zero order kinetics), respectively. The above results reveal that the optimized IR layer of Nebivolol (NBL 8) and SR layer of Nateglinide (N 9) might be suitable for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension by sequential release of the two drugs in a bilayer tablet. IR-immediate release, SR-sustain release, NBL 8 -Nebivolol 8, N 9 -Nateglinide 9...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of the {{calculation}} of negative effective density and negative effective <b>compliance</b> for a <b>layered</b> composite. We show that the frequency-dependent effective properties remain positive for cases which lack the possibility of localized resonances (a 2 -phase composite) whereas they may become negative for cases where there exists a possibility of local resonance below the length-scale of the wavelength (a 3 -phase composite). We also show that the introduction of damping in the system considerably affects the effective properties in the frequency region close to the resonance. It is envisaged that this demonstration of doubly negative material characteristics for 1 -D wave propagation would pave the way for the design and synthesis of doubly negative material response for full 3 -D elastic wave propagation...|$|R
40|$|A study {{into the}} effects of wall <b>compliance</b> on {{boundary}} <b>layer</b> how in an adverse pressure gradient has been undertaken. The two-dimensional flow given by a Falkner-Skan profile was considered where a powerful inviscid instability mechanism {{occurs as a result}} of a point of inflexion in the boundary layer profile. Results are presented for two cases: (a) a purely inviscid calculation where the compliant walt is modelled as a thin plate supported by a spring foundation, (b) a double-layer viscoelastic wall model with viscous effects retained. Wall parameters which ensure the absence of hydroelastic instability were used and found to produce growth rate reductions in excess of 50 % of the corresponding rigid wall values.

30|$|Service {{providers}} such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Hitachi, {{and others}} claim compliance for HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, SOX, and GLBA. References [2, 35, 49] describe RAs for clouds with conceptual and logical views that include security management and compliance. Their architectures use models and enumeration to describe components and their interactions. Amazon Web Services (AWS) published {{a list of}} compliance eligible services such as DynamoDB, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic Cloud Compute (EC 2), Glacier, Redshift, Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Simple Storage Service (S 3), Identity and Access Management (IAM), CloudTrial, CloudHSM, and Amazon Relational Database (RDS) to protect customersâ€™ data at rest and in motion [1, 3]. Reference [51] published an RA for PCI-DSS using specific products such as VMware, Cisco, Trend Micro, and HyTrust; this architecture maps PCI rules to hardware and software products. Reference [61] describes a compliance Reference Architecture Framework (RAF) to address requirements at the infrastructure, application, and end user computing <b>layers.</b> Infrastructure <b>layer</b> <b>compliance</b> includes network security, configuration management, log management, and platform security. Application <b>layer</b> <b>compliance</b> includes permissions and governance, service level agreement, and data security. End user computing layer includes identity management, end point security, authentication, and authorization. Reference [61] maps regulation policies to corresponding layers and VMware products. Reference [10] built regulatory compliant architectures using a risk management framework to address functional capabilities, operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and security. The framework uses a standard enterprise layer architecture (i.e. web layer, application layer, service layer, business, and data layers) to identify components, and map compliance policies to corresponding Cisco products. References [10, 62] proposed a compliance reference architecture by abstracting regulations and corporate policies. References [43, 62] use SOX and Microsoft products to identify components, build the architecture, and map compliance policies to appropriate Microsoft products. Reference [34] proposes a compliance architecture derived from regulation overlaps among corporate governance and regulations. Reference [35] enumerates policies from regulations and maps them to proprietary identity and access management products.|$|R
30|$|The {{global change}} in {{compliance}} between PEEPARDSnet and PEEPEIT phases was {{the net result}} of two opposed changes in regional compliance: increasing in the dorsal layers (likely due to recruitment) and decreasing in the ventral layers (likely due to overdistension). We cannot exclude {{that part of the}} improvement in the <b>compliance</b> of dorsal <b>layers</b> might be due to the presence of intratidal recruitment; however, this effect was unlikely since previus studies showed that increasing PEEP leads to a decrease in intratidal recruitment [2]. FiO 2 was kept stable in all study phases (0.5 Â Â±Â  0.1); in this way, we avoided erroneous estimation of alveolar collapse and recruitment due to low alveolar oxygen concentration [31, 33]. We believe that this result further underlines the need for a regional real-time monitoring of the distribution of ventilation, which could prompt a decrease in tidal volume until overdistension of ventral regions drops back to baseline.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{use of a}} new {{quality control}} (QC) and quality {{assurance}} (QA) specification involving Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) testing in concert with conventional moisture and density testing {{is becoming more and}} more frequent in various parts of the world. The need for this additional testing is essential, as the regular in-situ density tests cannot alone ensure the <b>compliance</b> of the <b>layers</b> constructed with the compaction requirements. Recent analyses of the correlation between the DCP testing and the California Bearing Ratio CBR testing show that QC and QA DCP testing is adequate to verify compaction, stability and vertical uniformity in both cohesive and granular soils. Two examples of DCP usage in two Israeli earthwork projects, one of clayey soils and the other of silty-sand soils, indicate the benefits of this usage along with, though for the clayey example only, Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) testing...|$|R
40|$|For an {{efficient}} utilization of thin-layer rubber-metal elements (further - TLRME) in modern mechanical engineering, including vibration insulation, {{it is necessary}} to be able to calculate the ruggedness characteristics of TLRME. Numerous experimental studies have shown that at tension and compression this characteristic is influenced essentially by value of specific load, <b>compliance</b> of non-elastomeric <b>layers</b> and way of fastening of elastomeric layers in the TLRME package. In the present article the calculation method of ruggedness constant of TLRME is presented at static load, tension - compression, in the field of small deformations taking into account the deformation of a glutinous layer. The solution is obtained by the method of Ritsa using the principle of the minimum complete potential energy of deformation. The obtained solution allows to receive asymmetrical ruggedness constant of TLRME at tension - compression without the assumption regarding dissimilar modularity of rubber...|$|R

40|$|Saponins are a wide {{class of}} natural surfactants, with {{molecules}} containing a rigid hydrophobic group (triterpenoid or steroid), connected via glycoside bonds to hydrophilic oligosaccharide chains. These surfactants {{are very good}} foam stabiliziers and emulsifiers, and show a range of nontrivial biological activities. The molecular mechanisms behind these unusual properties are unknown, and, therefore, the saponins have attracted significant research interest in recent years. In our previous study (Stanimirova et al. Langmuir 2011, 27, 12486 - 12498), we showed that the triterpenoid saponins extracted from Quillaja saponaria plant (Quillaja saponins) formed adsorption layers with unusually high surface dilatational elasticity, 280 +/- 30 mN/m. In this Article, we study the shear rheological properties of the adsorption layers of Quillaja saponins. In addition, we study the surface shear rheological properties of Yucca saponins, which are of steroid type. The experimental {{results show that the}} adsorption layers of Yucca saponins exhibit purely viscous rheological response, even at the lowest shear stress applied, whereas the adsorption layers of Quillaja saponins behave like a viscoelastic two-dimensional body. For Quillaja saponins, a single master curve describes the data for the viscoelastic creep compliance versus deformation time, up to a certain critical value of the applied shear stress. Above this value, the <b>layer</b> <b>compliance</b> increases, and the adsorption layers eventually transform into viscous ones. The experimental creep recovery curves for the viscoelastic layers are fitted very well by compound Voigt rheological model. The obtained results are discussed from the viewpoint of the layer structure and the possible molecular mechanisms, governing the rheological response of the saponin adsorption layers...|$|R
