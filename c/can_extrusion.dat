40|$|The ironing {{process and}} the {{backward}} <b>can</b> <b>extrusion</b> process are widely used for the manufacturing of thin walled cans. In the ironing process the die is commonly made with a cylindrical die land and in backward <b>can</b> <b>extrusion</b> the punch is commonly made with a cylindrical punch land. LS-Dyna {{has been used in}} the analysis of the influence, which the die land and the punch land have. The results suggest that a small misalignment of the die land, respectively the punch land may cause the process to become unstable resulting in uneven can height and uneven can wall thickness. Simulations also suggest that it is possible, by making minor changes to the geometry of the die land respectively the punch land, to make the process significantly more robust with regard to the influence from a small misalignment of the land. The results obtained from the LS-Dyna simulations are in good agreement with experimentally obtained results. KEYWORDS...|$|E

The observed changes in friction {{are believed to be}} caused by phase transitions in the lubricant. The lubricant systems consisted of two different carrier coatings (crystalline Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 · 4 H 2 O and amorphous Zn 1. 5 Ca 1. 5 (PO 4) 2) lubricated with soap or MoS 2. The temperature in the lubricant film during the process was estimated from changes in friction in correlation with observed phase transitions in the lubricant. Phase transitions in the carrier coatings as a function of pressure and temperature were investigated. Several previously unknown phase transitions were discovered. Four different crystal structures of Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 ·xH 2 O were observed as a function of temperature. At 700 – 900 °C Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 becomes amorphous (depending on the pressure). Amorphous Zn 1. 5 Ca 1. 5 (PO 4) 2 crystallises at 200 – 300 °C and a second phase transition is observed at 400 – 700 °C (depending on the pressure).

For hot extrusion, {{two different types}} of extrusion dies, a conventional flat-face die and an experimental die, are used. The experimental die combines the process of equal channel angular pressing with the process of hot extrusion in a single die, which increases the strain and pressure affecting the chips during extrusion, both critical factors for achieving sound chip bonding. Subsequently, the chip-based extrudates are machined to fabricate chip-based preforms for the cold extrusion experiments. In order to investigate different processing routes, forward rod extrusion and backward <b>can</b> <b>extrusion</b> trials were conducted.

In {{the present}} study, the finite element {{analysis}} has been conducted to investigate the deformation characteristics of forward and backward <b>can</b> <b>extrusion</b> process using AA 1100 aluminum alloy tubes in terms of maximum forming load and extruded length ratio in a combined material flow.

40|$|Abstract. Combined {{extrusion}} processes {{generally have}} advantages of forming {{in terms of}} the minimum deformation power since the material is pressed through two or more orifices simultaneously. This paper is concerned with the analysis of forming load characteristics of a forward-backward <b>can</b> <b>extrusion</b> process using thick-walled pipe as an initial billet. The combined tube extrusion process was analyzed by using a commercial finite element code. A thick-walled pipe was selected as an initial billet and the punch geometry has been chosen on the basis of ICFG recommendation. Several tool and process parameters were employed in this analysis and they are punch nose radius, backward tube thickness, punch face angle, and frictional conditions, respectively. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of process parameters on the force requirements in combined extrusion process. The possible extrusion process to form a forward-backward tube parts in different process sequences were also simulated to investigate the force requirements in sequential operations, i. e. separate operations. It was easily concluded from the simulation results that lower forming load was predicted for the combined extrusion, compared to those for separate sequential operations. It was also revealed that the punch nose radius and the punch face angle have little effect on the force requirements and the forming load increases significantly as the frictional condition along tool-workpiece interface becomes severe. The simulation results in this study suggest that the combined extrusion process has strong advantage in terms of force requirements as long as the simultaneous material flow into multiple orifices could be closely controlled...|$|E

In this paper, we tackle the problem of automated detection of break-ins of new unknown threats such as worms, spyware and adware on personal computers. We propose Break-IN DEtectoR (BINDER), a host-based break-in detection system. Our key observation is that many break-ins make extrusions, stealthy malicious outgoing network connections. BINDER exploits a unique characteristic of personal computers, that most network activities are directly or indirectly triggered by user input. Since threats tend to run as background precesses and thus do not receive any user input, the intuition behind BINDER is that only threats generate connections without user input.
