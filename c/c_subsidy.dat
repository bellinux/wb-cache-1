40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact on}} social welfare of government policies supporting open source software (OSS). Mass-market consumers can be divided between those who are informed {{about the existence of}} OSS and those who are uninformed. Since OSS producers have little incentive to advertise, there may be a substantial mass of uniformed consumers, leading to market failures that may justify government intervention. We study three government policies: (a) mandated adoption, whereby the government forces public agencies, schools, and universities to adopt OSS, (b) information provision, whereby the government informs the uninformed users about the existence and the characteristics of OSS, and (<b>c)</b> <b>subsidy,</b> whereby the government makes a payment to consumers if they adopt OSS. We show that mandated adoption and information provision may increase social welfare, but the subsidy always reduces it. When network externalities are added to the model, we show that mandated adoption and information provision may increase social welfare if they help the market to tip towards standardization.

40|$|Early leafing and {{extended}} leaf longevity can be important mechanisms {{for the invasion}} of the forest understory. We compared the leaf phenology and photosynthetic characteristics of Berberis thunbergii, an early leafing invasive shrub, and two co-occurring native species, evergreen Kalmia latifolia and late leafing Vaccinium corymbosum, throughout the 2004 growing season. Berberis thunbergii leafed out 1 month earlier than V. corymbosum and approximately 2 weeks prior to the overstory trees. The photosynthetic capacity [characterized by the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V (cmax)) and the RuBP regeneration capacity mediated by the maximum electron transport rate (J (max)) ] of B. thunbergii was highest in the spring open canopy, and declined with canopy closure. The 2003 overwintering leaves of K. latifolia displayed high V (cmax) and J (max) in spring 2004. In new leaves of K. latifolia produced in 2004, the photosynthetic capacity gradually increased to a peak in mid-September, and reduced in late November. V. corymbosum, by contrast, maintained low V (cmax) and J (max) throughout the growing season. In B. thunbergii, light acclimation was mediated by adjustment in both leaf mass per unit area and leaf N on a mass basis, but this adjustment was weaker or absent in K. latifolia and V. corymbosum. These results indicated that B. thunbergii utilized high irradiance in the spring while K. latifolia took advantage of high irradiance in the fall and the following spring. By contrast, V. corymbosum generally did not experience a high irradiance environment and was adapted to the low irradiance understory. The apparent success of B. thunbergii therefore, appeared related to a high spring <b>C</b> <b>subsidy</b> and subsequent acclimation to varying irradiance through active N reallocation and leaf morphological modifications...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} CO 2 separation {{technologies for}} production of {{synthetic natural gas}} (SNG) from biomass gasification – amine-based absorption, membrane-based separation and pressure swing adsorption – are investigated for their thermo-economic performance {{against the background of}} different possible future energy market scenarios. The studied scale of the SNG plant is a thermal input of 100 MW th,LHV to the gasifier at a moisture content of 20 wt-% with a preceding drying step reducing the biomass' natural moisture content of 50 wt-%. Preparation of the CO 2 -rich stream for carbon capture and storage is investigated for the amine-based absorption and the membrane-based separation technology alternatives. The resulting cold gas efficiency ηcg for the investigated process alternatives ranges between 0. 65 and 0. 695. The overall system efficiency ηsys ranges from 0. 744 to 0. 793, depending on both the separation technology and the background energy system. Amine-based absorption gives the highest cold gas efficiency whereas the potential for cogeneration of electricity from the process' excess heat is higher for membrane-based separation and pressure swing adsorption. The estimated specific production costs for SNG c SNG for a process input of 90. 3 MW th,LHV at 50 wt-% moisture vary between 103 – 127 € 2010 /MWh SNG. The corresponding production subsidy level <b>c</b> <b>subsidy</b> needed to achieve end-user purchase price-parity with fossil natural gas is in the range of 56 – 78 € 2010 /MWh SNG depending on both the energy market scenario and the CO 2 separation technology. Sensitivity analysis on the influence of changes in the total capital cost for the SNG plant on the production cost indicates a decrease of about 12 % assuming a 30 % reduction in total capital investment. Capture and storage of biogenic CO 2 – if included in the emission trading system – only becomes an option at higher CO 2 charges. This is due to increased investment costs but, in particular, due to the rather high costs for CO 2 transport and storage that have been assumed in this study. </HTML...|$|E

In this study, {{we aim to}} {{provide an overview of}} the published data of carbon (C) and nutrient exchange of mangrove forests with the coastal ocean at different spatial scales to assess whether the exchange is correlated with environmental parameters. We collected data on C (dissolved and particulate organic C; DOC and POC) and nutrient exchange (dissolved and particulate nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) and examined the role of latitude, temperature, precipitation, geomorphological setting, hydrology, dominant mangrove species and forest area in explaining the variability of the exchange. We identified that there are a range of methodologies used to determine material exchange of mangroves with the coastal zone, each methodology providing data on the exchange at different spatial scales. This variability of approaches has limited our understanding of the role of mangroves in the coastal zone. Regardless, we found that mangrove forests export C and nutrients to the coastal zone in the form of litter and POC. We found that precipitation is a major factor influencing the export of C in the form of litter; sites with low annual precipitation and high mean annual temperatures export more C as litter than sites with high precipitation and low temperature. Furthermore, export of POC is higher in zones with low mean annual minimum temperature. Identification of broad-scale trends in DOC and dissolved nutrients was more difficult, as the analysis was limited by scarcity of suitable studies and high variability in experimental approaches. However, tidal amplitude and the concentration of nutrients in the floodwater appears to be important in determining nutrient exchange. The strongest conclusion from our analysis is that mangrove forests are in general sources of C and nutrients in the form of litter and POC and that they {{are most likely to be}} exporting <b>C</b> <b>subsidies</b> in dry regions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Externalities {{represent}} a market failure situation and they appear when one person´s activities influence other person´s welfare {{in a way}} that is outside the market mechanism. In contrast to the effects transmitted by market prices, externalities negatively affect the economic efficiency. They arise in everyday life and are noticed only if the effects are obvious. Ronald Coase´s approach started from the premises that externalities can be internalized. His model provides private sector means to defend against market failure. Coase´s solution to internalize externalities based on negotiation between the involved parties, given the property rights, has influenced the free market approach of market failures and today many economists consider that governments should work with the market and not against it using taxes and regulations. In the mainstream literature it is said that if for small local externalities the private sector can find solutions to solve problems, big scale externalities, such as global warming, need government intervention. As far as the last ones are concerned, we can talk about: a) the Pigouvian tax, which is a tax levied on polluting activities; b) the Pigouvian subsidy, given to those who suffer from negative externalities; <b>c)</b> the <b>subsidy</b> paid to individuals or firms to conduct activities with positive externalities; d) legal regulations, such as limits for emitting polluters and restrictions regarding the time of day or year when negative externalities can be legally produced...|$|R

Our analysis suggests three important elements that need to be considered: a) targeting wage subsidies to workers who need and can benefit from the work experience and learning (which implies that the identification should be with the program sponsor and not employers); b) setting the wage subsidy in proportion to negotiated wages – not in absolute value or as a negative income tax; and <b>c)</b> give the <b>subsidy</b> to individuals, not particular sets of employers, who then are allowed to seek the jobs that better match their skills.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyse which {{concession}} alternative for Callao port, mono- or multi-operator, is more beneficial for the Peruvian society. The author uses the regulation theory, publicly available data, Monte Carlo simulation and real-option theory to analyse the viability of the concession under both alternatives. Its main findings are the following: (a) Although it seems preferable to concession Callao under a multi-operator scheme, superiority of one option over the other will depend on the nature of the port's cost function. If the latter is sub-additive for the forecasted demand, a mono-operator option would be more desirable. (b) If the concession of Callao port was to be carried out under a mono-operator scheme, the Peruvian Government could obtain proceeds in excess of US$ 60 million, or port users could expect to pay 22 % lower tariffs for the use of the infrastructure. (<b>c)</b> Without a <b>subsidy,</b> the mono-operator alternative is the only viable one. (d) The real cost of the required subsidy, imposed on the Peruvian society, could amount up to US$ 12 million, while the benefits of the multi-operator alternative would amount up to US$ 60 million. Therefore, its benefits being higher than its costs, it is preferable to concession Callao port under a multi-operator scheme, even if a subsidy is required.

Considering China's particular circumstances and the purposes of energy subsidies, the perverse fossil fuel subsidies in China mainly concentrated on industries, and gasoline, diesel and natural gas consumption, which are always regressive. Other subsidies, such as those for residential electricity consumption and agriculture, should be kept for the time being. Results indicate that China's perverse fossil fuel subsidies amounted to CNY 509. 22 billion in 2008, equivalent to 61. 2 % of total fossil fuel subsidies and 1. 69 % of GDP in that year. In addition, reasonable subsidies will not affect energy conservation and emission reduction. Furthermore, CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our finding shows that removing perverse energy subsidies will result in a significant decline in energy demand and CO 2 emissions, but will have negative impacts on the macro-economy. Therefore, supporting (or offsetting) policies, like carrying out other cost-benefit and sustainable programs with the revenues saved from subsidy reduction, are needed to alleviate the adverse impacts of removing perverse <b>subsidies.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the process of energy price reform is slow, even though China faces increasing problems of energy scarcity and environmental deterioration. This paper focuses on analyzing fossil fuel subsidies in China by estimating subsidies scale and the implications for future reform. We begin by measuring fossil-fuel subsidies {{and the effects of}} subsidy removal in a systematic fashion during 20062010 using a price-gap approach. Results indicate that the oil price reform in 2009 significantly reduced China's fossil-fuel subsidies and modified the subsidy structure. Fossil-fuel subsidies scale in China was 881. 94 billion CNY in 2010, which was lower than the amount in 2006, equivalent to 2. 59 % of the GDP. The macro-economic impacts of removing fossil-fuel subsidies are then evaluated by the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Results demonstrate that the economic growth and employment will be negatively affected as well as energy demand, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Finally, policy implications are suggested: first, risks of government pricing of energy are far from negligible; second, an acceptable macroeconomic impact is a criterion for energy price reform in China; third, the future energy policy should focus on designing transparent, targeted and efficient energy <b>subsidies.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Prices subsequently fell precipitously so that by early November 2008 (and continuing in the subsequent few months), the near-term futures prices of corn, wheat, and soybeans stood about 50 – 70 % higher than before the price run-up began. 1 The huge percentage price increases in 2007 and 2008 demanded attention from the press and policymakers concerned about food price increases (Washington Post 2008; Lazear 2008; Glauber 2008). Of even greater concern are impacts on hunger among the poor in poor countries (Benson et al. 2008). Many economists summarized the potential sources of the price jumps and assessed their relative importance (McCalla 2008; Trostle 2008 a; OECD 2008).

We extend this work to consider the possible social gains from supporting development of new markets for nature-based recreational goods, which may alleviate negative externalities caused by congestion problems.

And iii) if so, then how could such intervention be best performed? We use a two-stage non-cooperative Bayesian simultaneous-move game model and show that in spite of apparent potential first-mover advantages in a developing market, demand uncertainty and sunk costs may equally well result in widespread presence of non-movers on the supplier side. We show that social gains can be made from offering a subsidy towards the sunk costs. Analysing three possible subsidy schemes, we show a) that fixed costs may make rationing optimal, b) that sequential rationing does not necessarily dominate strict rationing because <b>c)</b> the more <b>subsidies</b> are offered, the larger each subsidy must be to induce participation, and that d) the longer a single agent on the market may keep market information to himself, the better a non-rationing scheme will perform relative to rationing schemes.

40|$|The {{policies}} of the present Government {{for the management of}} the New Zealand economy are clearly 'more market' (Douglas. 1984). The economy, in the judgement of the Government and its economic advisor, The Treasury, is most efficient when there is free competition for resources and prices are determined by the market. The role of Government is, nevertheless, important to provide an administrative and legal framework for the economy and for society; provide those goods and services (such as defence and policing) that cannot satisfactorily be provided by the private sector; and, maintain equity between the members of society (Berthold, 1985). For hill and high country farmers the 'more market' economic policy issues which are of principal concern are inflation, exchange rates, industry assistance, financial controls and prospects for the sheep meats industry. With the rapid rise (albeit with a recent fall) {{in the value of the}} New Zealand dollar, many of the advantages to pastoral farmers of the November 1984 devaluation are fading. Other adjustments being made to achieve a 'more market' economy (such as removal of financial controls, renewal of industry assistance etc.) and the imminent prospect of a goods and services tax indicate a moderate level of inflation is likely to continue for at least two years even though present indications show a downward trend. Fluctuations in exchange rates combined with inflation can only increase business risks and reduce hill and high country pastoral farm incomes even after allowing for a marked (or even total) fall in farm maintenance and development. Sheep farmers relying on the sale of export lambs for much of their gross income will be acutely aware of likely lower farm gate returns from lambs. Many farmers, wary of four years of an almost collapsed sheep meats industry, will be examining their options for sheep production carefully.

40|$|In 2003 India {{launched}} a National Mission on Biofuels. Its main {{strategy has been}} to promote Jatropha curcas; a perennial shrub that bears non-edible oil seeds {{that can be used}} to produce biodiesel with the aim of achieving a target of 20 % blending of biodiesel by 2012. This thesis recommends a framework that will enable people to implement Biodiesel Production System in Karnataka State, India, and possibility replicate it in other developing countries. Detailed combinations of Life Cycle Assessment with Technical and Cost-benefit Analysis have been developed to assess the suitability of individual oilseed crops for large scale cultivation from energy, environmental and socio-economic perspectives. The ways in which biodiesel are produced with the impacts on energy balance, GHG emissions and costs have been evaluated. All large scale agricultural and small-scale agricultural scenarios produced negative NPV per life cycle. A key common feature from all the results is that in conditions of an established market, the price of Jatropha oilseeds, as a final product of agricultural enterprise, has a strong influence on price of Jatropha SVO, the main raw material for biodiesel production. As such, it will require strong and direct government‟s intervention to both agricultural and industrial phases of this chain, to keep them in business. For large scale agricultural scenarios demonstrate the following options to make NPV of the feedstock production positive: a) raise Jatropha oilseed price in 1. 91 - 2. 08 times, b) impose government‟s subsidies on working capital at least 41. 55 - 69. 85 % large, or <b>c)</b> impose government‟s <b>subsidies</b> on CAPEX at least 27. 25 - 28. 81 % large. For small-scale agricultural scenarios sensitivity analysis produces the following options: a) to raise Jatropha oilseed price in 1. 92 - 2. 38 times, or b) to impose government‟s subsidies on working capital at least 41. 5 - 51. 0 % large. The results of this work do not show a way in which subsidies could be removed. In deciding whether to support this technology, the public support for early stage commercialization investment might be considered as illustrated in the “Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change” (2006) by experience curves. For all large scale and small-scale agricultural scenarios, the correlation results demonstrate that price of oilseeds, the Jatropha oilseed yields, the labour cost coefficient, and subsidies on working capital (Private Capital) are all significantly correlated with NPV and NPV/GHG avoided ratio. For both large scale and small-scale production scenarios, only the price of Jatropha oil significantly correlated with NPV and NPV/GHG avoided ratio. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates a very high GHG avoided (GBP/tCO 2 eq) costs for all scenarios compared to the current market price of Certified Emissions Reduction (CER). To make average costs of GHG avoided comparable with current CER price, the price of Jatropha oilseeds should be reduced by 0. 91 - 1. 99 times in Irrigated and by 1. 22 - 1. 91 times for Rainfed scenarios. However, in this case, the effect on economics of Jatropha oilseeds cultivation (agricultural scenarios) will be disastrous. To show the potential savings, the energy use and GHG emissions for each Model have been compared with the Well-to-Tank (WTT) energy and GHG emissions for diesel (basic scenario). Some Models actually save more fossil energy than is contained in the produced biodiesel as a result of the large energy savings attached to electricity production and other by-products utilization. The GHG savings has a pattern which is clearly corresponding with the energy one. The emissions from farming, especially excessive N 2 O emissions, are responsible for significant fraction of total GHG emissions. All Rainfed scenarios demonstrate much better energy and GHG emissions performance than Irrigated scenarios. Unfortunately, considerable benefits of energy and GHG savings produced by small-scale in comparison to large-scale Jatropha cultivation have been challenged by the negative results of the Cost-benefit analysis for the same Models.
