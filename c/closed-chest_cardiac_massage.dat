40|$|At {{the present}} there are {{principles}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) which {{are reflected in}} the recommendations of the AHA and ESC of 2010. They include strict rules on well-timed and proper <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage.</b> According to these rules chest compressions should be repeated at least 100 times per minute at a depth of not less than 5 cm. To comply with the standards is not easy even for skilled staff, operator tiredness quickly leads to decrease in CPR quality. Various mechanical devices for <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> are used nowadays. One of them is LUCAS system.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of postmortem heparinization by <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> in a canine model of left single-lung allotransplantation from non–heart-beating donors. MethodsLeft lung transplantation was performed in 18 weight-matched pairs of mongrel dogs. Donors were killed with an intravenous injection of potassium chloride and left at room temperature for 2 hours. The cadaveric donors were assigned randomly to one of the three groups. In group 1 (n = 6), no heparin was given as a control. In group 2 (n = 6), heparin sodium (1000 U/kg) was administered intravenously before cardiac arrest. In group 3 (n = 6), heparin sodium (1000 U/kg) was administered intravenously 10 minutes after death, then <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> was performed for 2 minutes. After 2 hours of cardiac arrest, donor lungs were flushed with low-potassium dextran-glucose solution and preserved for 60 minutes. After left lung transplantation, the right pulmonary artery was ligated, and recipient animals were followed up for 3 hours. Univariate and multivariate repeated analyses were used for statistics. ResultsBoth groups 2 and 3 had significantly better gas exchange and lower pulmonary vascular resistance than group 1. Changes in thrombin-antithrombin III complex concentration during the warm ischemia indicated that postmortem heparinization suppressed clotting activation in the donor.

40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> is {{the first}} and most {{important}} step during Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Effective massage restores blood flow to the brain and heart and plays a remarkable role in a successful CPR. Exhaustion of treatment team during resuscitation is one of the factors which may lead to reduced quality of resuscitation massages or failure in some cases. The aim {{of this study was to}} design, construct and evaluate a new <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator to improve the quality of CPR in adult patients. Methods: In this study, the massage facilitator was designed and registered as a glove which was worn by rescuers during <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> (number of invention: 80797). A load cell sensor was placed under the surface of the glove and the facilitator could be displayed number and depth of massage in centimeters. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the designed system, an experimental study was conducted among 30 emergency students. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 19 software using Pearson correlation and independent sample t-test. P-values lower than   0. 05 were considered to be significant. Results: The mean age of all participants was 23. 41 ± 2. 02 years, the mean height was 175 ± 4. 43 centimeters and the mean weight was 65. 45 ± 5. 02 kilograms. The instrument validity was evaluated using standard validation method of concurrent validity. Our findings revealed a significant correlation between the <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator and Sim Pad system (more than 0. 9). Accordingly, the validity of <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator was confirmed. While assessing the efficient <b>massage</b> criteria during <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator utilization, the massage possessed suitable depth (less than 5 cm) in 98 % of participants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{previously}} reported that post-mortem heparinization by <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> is beneficial in lung transplantation from non-heart-beating donors by preventing formation of microthrombi. In this study, we evaluated the optimal time for post-mortem heparinization in canine lung transplantation from non-heart-beating donors. METHODS: Left lung transplantation {{was performed in}} 25 weight-matched pairs of mongrel dogs. Donors were killed with an intravenous injection of potassium chloride and left {{at room temperature for}} 2 hours. The cadaver donors were assigned randomly to one of five study groups. In Group H 0, heparin sodium (1, 000 U/kg) was given intravenously before cardiac arrest. In Groups H 10, H 30, H 45 and H 60, heparin sodium (1, 000 U/kg) was given intravenously 10, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after cardiac arrest, respectively, followed by <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> for 2 minutes. After 2 hours of cardiac arrest, donor lungs were flushed with low-potassium dextran glucose solution and preserved for 60 minutes. After left lung allotransplantation, the right pulmonary artery was ligated, and recipient animals were followed up for 3 hours. Uni- and multivariate repeat analyses were utilized for statistical assessment. RESULTS: After transplantation, gas exchange was significantly worse in Groups H 45 and H 60 than in Groups H 0, H 10 and H 30. Thrombin/anti-thrombin III complex concentration during warm ischemia was significantly higher in Groups H 30, H 45 and H 60 than in Groups H 0 and H 10.

40|$|A 64 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to the hospital withchest discomfort. ECG recording and coronary angiog-raphy were performed and revealed myocardial infarction due to an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. During angiography, cardiac arrest occurred, and <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> was performed successfully. After 3 minutes of resuscitation, a sinus rhythm was restored, but the patient developed progressive hemodynamic instabil-ity. To exclude other potential causes of hemodynamic deterioration such as aortic aneurysm, a computed tomo-graphic scan was obtained, revealing a significant hemoperi-cardium and a subcutaneous hematoma of the chest wall; rib and sternal fractures were absent. The site of bleeding could not be detected, but the epicardial fatty tissue appeared effaced, and myocardial contusion was assumed (Figure 1). Intraoperatively, a distinct hematoma of the epicardial fatty tissue of the right ventricle was seen, and incision of the epicardium revealed a roundish lesion of the right ventricle right below the sternum (Figure 2). The ventricular rupture was sutured, and after closure of the thorax, vital signs were stable, and cardiac function was satisfactory. However, 2 days later, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias occurred, and the patient died despite prolonged life-saving measures. Since its introduction in the 1960, a number of complica-tions resulting from closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion such as regurgitation, aspiration, and rib and sternal fractures have been described. 1 In contrast to these adverse effects, life-threatening complications due to resuscitative measures such as ventricular rupture are exceedingly rare (5 %; ventricular rupture, 0. 1 %) and are related primarily to rib or sternal fractures, insufficient skills, or preexisting myocardial damage (eg, myocarditis). 2, 3 In this patient, the cause of rupture of the right ventricle and of death could not be clarified.

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: : To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} early intravenous adrenaline administration on circulatory recovery, cerebral reoxygenation, and plasma catecholamine concentrations, after severe asphyxia-induced bradycardia and hypotension. METHODS: One-day old piglets were left in apnoea until heart rate and mean arterial pressure were less than 50 min(- 1) and 25 mmHg, respectively. They randomly received adrenaline, 10 μg kg(- 1) (n= 16) or placebo (n= 15) and were resuscitated with air ventilation and, when needed, <b>closed-chest</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> (CCCM). Eight not asphyxiated animals served as time controls. RESULTS: CCCM was required in 13 piglets given adrenaline and in 13 given placebo. Time to return of spontaneous circulation was: 72 (66 - 85) s vs. 77 (64 - 178) s [median (quartile range) ] (p= 0. 35). Time until cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrS(O 2)) had increased to 30 % was 86 (79 - 152) s vs. 126 (88 - 309) s (p= 0. 30). The two {{groups did not differ}} significantly in CrS(O 2), heart rate, arterial pressure, right common carotid artery blood flow, or number of survivors: 13 and 11 animals. Plasma concentration of adrenaline, 2. 5 min after resuming ventilation, was 498 (268 - 868) nmol l(- 1) vs. 114 (80 - 306) nmol l(- 1) (p= 0. 01). Corresponding noradrenaline concentrations were 1799 (1058 - 4182) nmol l(- 1) vs. 1385 (696 - 3118) nmol l(- 1) (ns).

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between the effects of ventilation with oxygen and expired air via a non-rebreathing circuit during manual external <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> for 43 - 60 minutes in two groups of dogs. Ten of the eighteen dogs receiving expired air survived, as did six of the twenty which received oxygen. The Paco 2 remained below 10 rnm Hg in the oxygen group and was about 28 mm Hg in the expired air group. In the expired air group the Pa ^ remained above 63 mm Hg. The calculated venous arterial admixtures in eight of the dogs were between 2. 1 and 14. 7 per cent. The importance of pupillary changes and the complications occurring during and after external <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> are discussed. It is suggested that, when oxygen is not available, expired air ventilation combined with external <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> may safely be encouraged during resuscitation in previously fit humans. Following the description of external cardiac mas-sage (e. c. m.) by Kouwenhoven and his colleagues in 1960 the technique has been widely and suc-cessfully applied in hospital practice, combined with positive pressure ventilation with oxygen (Sykes and Orr, 1966; Linko et al., 1967; Kirby and McNicol, 1967).
