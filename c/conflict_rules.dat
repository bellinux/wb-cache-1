40|$|Abstract. When {{applying}} an {{unordered set}} of classification rules, the rules may assign {{more than one}} class to a particular example. Previous methods of resolving such <b>conflicts</b> between <b>rules</b> include using the most frequent class in the <b>conflicting</b> <b>rules</b> (as done in CN 2) and to use Naive Bayes to calculate the most probable class. An alternative way of solving this problem is presented: by generating new rules from the examples covered by the <b>conflicting</b> <b>rules.</b> These newly induced rules are then used for classification. Experiments {{on a number of}} domains show that this method significantly improves the accuracy compared to the CN 2 approach and Naive Bayes. 1 Introduction Two major induction strategies are used in top-down rule induction: Divide-and-Conquer [9] or Separate-and-Conquer (SAC) [5]. The former strategy does not generate overlapping rules and hence no <b>conflict</b> between <b>rules</b> can occur, whilethe latter strategy can give rise to overlapping rules. The rules can be ordered to avoid conflicts (which results in decision lists) [10] or they may be used withoutany ordering [3, 2]. In the latter case one has to deal with conflicts that occur when two or more rules cover the same example but assign different classes toit. This work addresses the problem of handling <b>conflicting</b> <b>rules</b> and how tosolve the conflicts in a more effective way than using existing methods. Previous methods that deals with <b>conflicts</b> among <b>rules</b> either returns the most frequentclass covered by the <b>conflicting</b> <b>rules</b> (as done in CN 2 [2]) here referred to as Frequency-based classification, or uses Naive Bayes [8] to calculate the mostprobable class...|$|R

50|$|Article 3 {{provides}} that the Convention only applies to express trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing. It will therefore not cover oral trusts, resulting trusts, constructive trusts, statutory trusts or trusts created by judicial order. But signatory states {{are free to}} apply the Convention to any form of trust and the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 has applied the provisions to all trusts arising under English law, no matter when or how they were created, albeit only applying the provisions to transactions affecting those trusts made after 1 August 1987. There are incidental question problems if the trust is testamentary and, under Article 4, if it is alleged that the testator lacked capacity, or that the will is formally or substantively invalid, or {{that it had been}} revoked, these issues must be determined first under the lex fori <b>Conflict</b> <b>rules</b> on characterisation and choice of law before the Convention rules can apply. This will include, for example, a detailed consideration of any marriage settlement or applicable law containing community property provisions which might prevent the testator alienating property from a spouse or child of the family (see succession (conflict)). Obviously, if the will purporting to create the trust is held invalid, there are no trusts to adjudicate upon.|$|E

Although it may appear logical to allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument, i.e. the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae. So the <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> of the lex fori (the domestic law of the court dealing with the case) are usually applied even though, in extreme cases, the application of only the substantive provisions of the foreign law by the forum court could produce a judgment that neither the lex causae nor the lex fori would normally have produced.

The first chapters look at the topic of private international law in general, followed by the introduction of European Private international law, mentioning the relevant changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty, and discussing the importance of unification of <b>conflict</b> <b>rules,</b> for which regulations as proper legal instruments are used.

A <b>conflict</b> <b>rule</b> referring assignment to the law of the assignor's residence is too rigid to do justice to the dynamic nature of assignments in cross-border transactions and it is unjustly one-sided. It offers no real advantages when compared to other conflict rules; it even has serious disadvantages which make the <b>conflict</b> <b>rule</b> unsuitable for efficient assignment-based cross-border transactions. It is not unconceivable that this <b>conflict</b> <b>rule</b> would even be contrary to the fundamental freedoms of the ECTreaty.

40|$|Abstract. ‘International subcontracting’ (sous-traitance de marché or de {{services}} or sous-traité, sous-entreprise, Zulieferwesen or Zuliefervertrag, subappalto or subfornitura) {{refers to a}} widespread contractual practice of the modern construction industry, at {{the very core of}} the ‘self-made law of building industry’, which has so extensively contributed {{to the development of the}} lex mercatoria. As often described in literature, international subcontracting denotes an agreement, entered into by a contractor and a third party that undertakes to perform all or a part of the contractor’s obligations required by an employer under an actual or proposed cross-border construction contract. Reference hereby shall be made to private procurements only, since subcontracts related to public procurements almost exclusively involve administrative concerns, which deserve a separate appreciation. International subcontracts, because of the contractual connection to the construction contract, raise significant issues of private international law that require, subject to certain conditions, a deviation from the classic standard of neutrality and blindness of <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> in contracts. Indeed, only <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> likely to support the substantial private interests within the contractual connection can properly keep the focus on the functional unity that closely connects international subcontracts and construction contracts, which escape mechanical allocation by means of hard and fast <b>conflict</b> <b>rules.</b> To this purpose, a recent wave of scholarship should be taken into account, which suggests a functional approach to <b>conflict</b> <b>rules,</b> which focuses on the nature of the relationships between the parties, rather than on the territorial scope of the applicable rules, to achieve the application of the law ‘which is presumed to be most concerned with the party in need of protection’. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the law {{applicable}} to insurance contracts in the EU, most notably on the Regulation No 593 / 2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I), which will replace the Rome Convention. The conflict of law rules relating to insurance contracts have {{always been one of}} the most complicated areas in (European) private international law. The <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> emanate from diverse sources - various directives and the Rome Convention - and lack cohesion and uniformity. The conversion of the Rome Convention into the Rome I Regulation was an excellent opportunity to get rid of this maze and to formulate uniform <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> for insurance contracts. The Commission proposal did not include a rule on insurance contracts, but a special rule was introduced during the negotiations. The difficult negotiations on this provision demonstrated clearly the complexity and delicacy of the matter. Various proposals were put forward and special consultations were launched, but the final result, laid down in Article 7 Rome I, seems to be no more than a complex compromise. The Regulation of international insurance contracts still remains unnecessarily complicated, fragmented and incomprehensible. In my opinion, therefore, the new rule in Article 7 is disappointing. Rather than removing the current divergences, the introduction of Article 7 mainly conceals them. It may be hoped that on the occasion of the evaluation of the Rome I Regulation, the <b>conflict</b> <b>rules</b> on insurance contracts will be carefully reconsidered...|$|E
