60|$|None of the Guachos {{had ever}} been there, but they knew its {{situation}} and general features by report. There had been no difficulty in following the trail since they had struck it. The broad line of trodden ground, and the frequent <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> sufficiently told the tale.|$|E
50|$|Close to this {{building}} a huge flour mill has erected by Messrs. Joseph Rank, Ltd. Every provision {{has been made}} thereat fur dealing with an extensive trade in the most complete manner, and no doubt this will add considerably to 'the future prosperity of the Barry Railway. A modern dock like Barry would not be complete without a cold store. and one has been constructed adjacent to the dock quays, in which frozen meat and other goods requiring cold storage are stored, and the arrangements are such that the Traffic may be discharged direct from the ship‘s held into trucks and despatched to the consuming centres or stored in the cold store with the least possible despatch and exposure. At present the store is capable of accommodating 80,000 <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and other goods, and is capable of being largely extended.|$|E
60|$|Now, however, it {{was dry and}} {{all about}} its surface were dotted {{numerous}} camp-fires round which men were moving, also some women {{who appeared to be}} engaged in cooking food. At a little distance too, upon the further edge of the moat-like depression were a number of white-robed individuals gathered in a circle about a large stone upon which something was stretched that resembled the <b>carcase</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheep</b> or goat, and round these a great number of spectators.|$|R
60|$|The {{misery of}} that supper-party {{will never be}} forgotten. Had Brisket been Adonis himself, {{he could not have}} been treated with softer courtesies by those two harpies; and yet, not an hour ago, Sarah Jane Jones had been endeavouring to raise a {{conspiracy}} against his hopes. What an ass will a man allow himself to become under such circumstances! There sat the big butcher, smirking and smiling, ever and again dipping his unlovely lips into a steaming beaker of brandy-and-water, regarding himself as triumphant in the courts of Venus. But that false woman who sat at his side would have sold him piecemeal for money, as he would have sold the <b>carcase</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheep.</b>|$|R
60|$|For some {{hours the}} crew were {{hard at work}} {{lowering}} down the stores into the hold, packing the ammunition in the magazine, hoisting up the two eighteen-pounders and their carriages, and getting them into position. At half-past three a boat was sent ashore, and returned with the two Turks and a quantity <b>of</b> provisions. The <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> three <b>sheep</b> were {{handed over to the}} crew, with the greater portion of the vegetables, one sheep being kept {{for the use of the}} cabin and the petty officers, together with a supply of vegetables sufficient for some days. A good supply of fruit had been brought, which was also divided. As soon as the deck was cleared, all hands were set to wash it down.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so Brisket is married. Brisket is right. Brisket {{is a happy}} man," [...] he said to himself, as {{he walked}} slowly down the passage by St. Botolph's Church. [...] "Brisket is {{certainly}} right; I will go and see Brisket." [...] So he did; and continuing his way {{along the back of}} the Bank and the narrow street which used to be called Lad Lane,--I wish they would not alter the names of the streets; was it not enough that the [...] "Swan with Two Necks" [...] should be pulled down, foreshadowing, perhaps, in its ruin the fate of another bird with two necks, from which this one took its emblematic character?--and so making his way out into Aldersgate Street. He had never before visited the Lares of Brisket, for Brisket had been his enemy. But Brisket was his enemy no longer, and he walked into the shop with a light foot and a pleasant smile. There, standing at some little distance behind the block, looking with large, wondering eyes at the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> which hung around her, stood a wee little woman, very pretty, with red cheeks, and red lips, and short, thick, clustering curls. This was the daughter of the grazier from Gogham. [...] "The shopman {{will be back in a}} minute," [...] said she. [...] "I ought to be able to do it myself, but I'm rather astray about the things yet awhile." [...] Then George Robinson told her who he was.|$|R
60|$|At {{the temple}} gates our party was {{received}} by a guard of soldiers, {{who appeared to}} be under the orders of a priest; and by them we were conducted into one of the ray or 'petal' courts, as the priests call them, and there left for at least half-an-hour. Here we conferred together, and realizing that we stood in great danger of our lives, determined, if any attempt should be made upon us, to sell them as dearly as we could -- Umslopogaas announcing his fixed intention of committing sacrilege on the person of Agon, the High Priest, by splitting his head with Inkosi-kaas. From where we stood we could perceive that an immense multitude were pouring into the temple, evidently in expectation of some unusual event, and I could not help fearing that we had to do with it. And here I may explain that every day, when the sunlight falls upon the central altar, and the trumpets sound, a burnt sacrifice is offered to the Sun, consisting generally <b>of</b> the <b>carcase</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheep</b> or ox, or sometimes of fruit or corn. This event comes off about midday; of course, not always exactly at that hour, but as Zu-Vendis is situated not far from the Line, although -- being so high above the sea it is very temperate -- midday and the falling of the sunlight on the altar were generally simultaneous. Today the sacrifice was to take place at about eight minutes past twelve.|$|R
60|$|The other {{instance}} I may adduce {{is that of}} {{the horror}} of blood which is curiously different in animals of the same species and in the same animals at different times. I have had a good deal of experience of the behaviour of oxen at the sight of blood, and found it to be by no means uniform. In my South African travels I relied chiefly on half-wild slaughter oxen to feed my large party, and occasionally had to shoot one on every second day. Usually the rest of the drove paid no particular heed to the place of blood, but at other rare times they seemed maddened and performed a curious sort of war-dance at the spot, making buck-leaps, brandishing their horns, and goring at the ground. It was a grotesque proceeding, utterly unlike the usual behaviour of cattle. I only witnessed it once elsewhere, and that was in the Pyrenees, where I came on a herd that was being driven homewards. Each cow in turn, as it passed a particular spot, performed the well-remembered antics. I asked, and learned that a cow had been killed there by a bear a few days previously. The natural horror at blood, and it may be the consequent dislike of red, is common among mankind; but I have seen a well-dressed child of about four years old poking its finger with a pleased innocent look into the bleeding <b>carcase</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheep</b> hung up in a butcher's shop, while its nurse was inside.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the <b>carcase</b> composition <b>of</b> Taiwan simulated native chickens {{at different stages of}} growth. The results indicated that the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> male chickens exhibited significantly larger protein mass and water mass than those of females during weeks 7 to 20; as was the ash mass during weeks 8 to 20. However, the fat mass <b>of</b> the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> female chickens was larger than that of males during weeks 14 to 20. Separate regression equations were derived for the relationship between protein mass, fat mass, ash mass and water mass and both carcase weight and age of both male and female chickens...|$|R

They played a game at the MCG against a Victorian XV which was won 26-6. They docked in Fremantle and played and won a fixture against a Western Australian XV 58-6.|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the Scanogram as an aid in assessing <b>carcase</b> composition <b>of</b> live <b>sheep</b> was made using 23 Dorset Horn rams. Live animal measurements included tracings from Scanogram photographs taken at the 12 th rib, tuber coxae and shoulder sites and an 18 -hour fasted liveweight. Half carcases were dissected into fat, muscle, bone and connective tissue. Repeatability of photograph interpretation was {{of the order of}} 0. 75 for fat depth at the 12 th rib and tuber coxae sites and M. longissirnus area, but low for shoulder fat depth. Correlations between scan and carcase measurements made at the same site were of the order of 0. 7 for 12 th rib and tuber coxae fat depth and low and non-significant for shoulder fat depth and M. longissirnus area. Scanogram measurements of fat depth at the 12 th rib and tuber coxae sites were the best predictors of percentage fat, and when considered in combination with liveweight provided the best estimate <b>of</b> total <b>carcase</b> fat weight. Liveweight was the best predictor of total muscle weight and the addition of Scanogram measurements to liveweight did not improve the accuracy of prediction. From examination of confidence intervals about predicted means it was concluded that the value of the Scanogram, as an aid to assessing carcase composition, was limited to differentiating between individual animals <b>of</b> widely differing <b>carcase</b> composition, or selecting groups of animals where confidence was required in the group mean...|$|R

50|$|The EUROP {{grid method}} of carcass {{classification}} was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. 1208/81 and No. 2930/81 were enacted {{to facilitate the}} application of a community scale for the classification <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification <b>of</b> the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.|$|R
