50|$|Aerobic {{capacity}} {{describes the}} functional {{capacity of the}} <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>system,</b> (the heart, lungs and blood vessels). Aerobic capacity refers to {{the maximum amount of}} oxygen consumed by the body during intense exercises, in a given time frame. It is a function both of cardiorespiratory performance and the maximum ability to remove and utilize oxygen from circulating blood. To measure maximal aerobic capacity, an exercise physiologist or physician will perform a VO2 max test, in which a subject will undergo progressively more strenuous exercise on a treadmill, from an easy walk through to exhaustion. The individual is typically connected to a respirometer to measure oxygen consumption, and the speed is increased incrementally over a fixed duration of time. The higher the measured cardiorespiratory endurance level, the more oxygen has been transported to and used by exercising muscles, and the higher the level of intensity at which the individual can exercise. More simply put, the higher the aerobic capacity, the higher the level of aerobic fitness. The Cooper and multi-stage fitness tests {{can also be used to}} assess functional aerobic capacity for particular jobs or activities.|$|E

Of these air-breathing fishes, only some (e. g., mudskippers) venture onto land {{but the vast majority of}} them remain in water and use air as an oxygen source to different degrees. With the development of air-breathing capacity, the circulatory system of fishes has often been modified in various ways to accommodate blood to and from the newly developed air-breathing surface. However, most air-breathing fishes, except snakeheads and lungfishes, seem to lack the ability of separating O 2 -rich effluent blood of the airbreathing organ from O 2 -poor systemic venous blood during passage through the central cardiovascular system, although this has been inferred usually only from anatomical studies. Mudskippers attest to the fact that transition from aquatic to amphibious life is possible without restructuring the gross anatomy of the <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>system,</b> at least to some extent.

In order to elucidate mechanisms underlying many neurological and cardiovascular disorders, a better understanding of the functional and the physiological role of specific neurons is crucial. Here we describe an entirely novel synthetic biology approach for selectively investigating the identification, function and regulation of different types of neurons by expressing genes encoding fluorescent proteins, ribosome inactivating proteins and light-activated ion channels under the control of synthetically engineered neuron-specific promoters. By engineering synthetic promoters This combined approach has broad applicability and offers a novel strategy to better understand the underlying mechanisms of any cells in any system. A key advantage of the approach that we are outlining here is that we combine targeted cell death and optogenetic stimulation / inhibition approaches using a neuron-specific promoter system that targets cells on the basis of particular genes that they express.

40|$|Central neurons in the {{brainstem}} {{and spinal}} cord {{are essential for}} the maintenance of sympathetic tone, the integration of responses to the activation of reflexes and central commands, and the generation of an appropriate respiratory motor output. Here, we will discuss work that aims to understand the role that metabotropic neurotransmitter systems play in central cardiorespiratory mechanisms. It is well known that blockade of glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and glycinergic pathways causes major or even complete disruption of <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>systems,</b> whereas antagonism of other neurotransmitter systems barely affects circulation or ventilation. Despite the lack of an ‘all-or-none’ role for metabotropic neurotransmitters, they are nevertheless significant in modulating the effects of central command and peripheral adaptive reflexes. Finally, we propose that a likely explanation for the plethora of neurotransmitters and their receptors on cardiorespiratory neurons is to enable differential regulation of outputs in response to reflex inputs, {{while at the same time}} maintaining a tonic level of sympathetic activity that supports those organs that significantly autoregulate their blood supply, such as the heart, brain, retina and kidney. Such an explanation of the data now available enables the generation of many new testable hypotheses. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{establish}} what advanced {{physical assessment}} skills {{are being used}} by cardiac nurses after they undertook a clinical patient assessment module; and to explore {{the factors that influence}} their use of these skills. METHOD: A longitudinal descriptive approach using convenience sampling was employed. Qualitative data was obtained from individual interviews, non-participant observation within the participants' clinical environment and self-reported activity logs. FINDINGS: Five key themes emerged: use of advanced physical assessment skills varied; use and development of skills was linked to personal characteristics; use influenced by perceptions of role boundaries, permission and cooperation; use influenced by participants' perception of nursing and the development of their own nursing practice; and use influenced by the physical environment and the human support within it. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Cardiac nurses selectively use physical assessment skills, predominately related to the <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>systems.</b> Organisational structure, professional relationships and the professionalism of the individual nurse appear to play a significant part in the use of physical assessment skills. Although the findings from this qualitative study cannot be generalized, they concur with findings from recent research into physical assessment skills used by a variety of UK nurses.

40|$|Although {{variability}} is a ubiquitous {{characteristic of}} the nervous system, under appropriate conditions neurons can generate precisely timed action potentials. Thus considerable {{attention has been given}} to the study of a neuron’s output in relation to its stimulus. Frequency selectivity of mode locking exhibits in clinical studies of human <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>systems</b> [1], experimental sensory processing in the auditory nerve [2] and hair cells in cochlea [3], and experimental brain study in thalamocortical relay neuron response [4]. To under-stand the mechanisms behind these functional features, spiking neuron models are used in studying the precise timing of firing events that is thought to underlie the frequency mode locking. In this study, we consider an increasingly popular model, the adaptive exponential integrate- and-fire (aEIF) neuron, and, for analytical tractability, its piecewise linear variant is adopted to understand the responses of such neurons to periodic stimuli. We construct general solutions of arbitrary mode locked states driven by a sinusoidal external stimulus, and describe their stability by the maximal Lyapunov exponent. We find period-doubling and saddle-node bifurcations of mode locked solutions, and the instabil-ities of the mode locked states lead to a so-called Arnol’d tongue structure in parameter space (Figure 1 shown in input amplitude versus current), with p:q denoting the neuron firing p times for every q periods of the stimuli (Figure 1 B). An interesting aspect of this model that is unaware of occurring elsewhere, is that if the amplitude of periodic stimulus is sufficiently large, solutions can enter different regions of phase space (switching manifold) multiple times between firing.

There was a mean increase in arterial blood pressure of 52 ± 5 mmHg (300 μM; P < 0. 01). Heart rate and sSNA also increased by 40 ± 4 beats/min (P < 0. 01) and 162 ± 33 % (P < 0. 01), respectively. Phrenic nerve amplitude (PNamp, 73 ± 8 %, P < 0. 01) and phrenic expiratory period (+ 0. 16 ± 0. 02 s, P < 0. 05) increased following 300 μ M bombesin. The gain of the sympathetic baroreflex increased from - 2. 8 ± 0. 7 to - 5. 4 ± 0. 9 % (P < 0. 01), whereas the sSNA range was increased by 99 ± 26 % (P < 0. 01). During hyperoxic hypercapnia (10 % CO 2 in O 2, 90 s), bombesin potentiated the responses in heart rate (- 25 ± 5 beats/min, P < 0. 01) and sSNA (+ 136 ± 29 %, P < 0. 001) but reduced PNamp (from 58 ± 6 to 39 ± 7 %, P < 0. 05).
