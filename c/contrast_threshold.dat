The {{resolution of the}} human eye (the receptive field size) is approximately one arc-minute in the center (the fovea) and increases in peripheral vision. Riccò's law {{is applicable}} for targets of angular area less than {{the size of the}} receptive field. This region is variable based on the amount of background luminance.

Therefore, the <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> required for detection is proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio multiplied by the noise divided by the area. This leads to the above equation.|$|E

A computer-controlled colour vision {{test was used to}} determine colour <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> along a blue-yellow tritan axis. Prior to the threshold measurement, a heterochromatic flicker brightness test was performed to ensure isoluminance between the test stimulus and the background for every subject individually.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study we {{investigate}} the dependence of photopic <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> on retinal illuminance in infants and adults. <b>Contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured at five retinal illuminances between about 6 and about 20   000 Td in subjects in both age groups. The forced-choice preferential looking technique was used in 3 -month-old infants, and standard forced-choice techniques were used in adults. The stimulus was a 0. 25 cy/deg squarewave grating phase alternated at 6 Hz. Infants’ <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> were more than two log units {{higher than those of}} adults at all retinal illuminances. <b>Contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> had a similar dependence on retinal illuminance in both infants and adults. For both age groups, <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> initially decreased with increasing retinal illuminance. However, at both ages, above a critical illuminance of about 200 Td, <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> remained constant, following Weber's law. Thus a vertical shift was sufficient to bring the two data sets into correspondence. In the context of a two-site model of light adaptation, our results imply that infants’ elevated <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} photoreceptoral immaturities. Later physiological immaturities must also limit infants’ photopic <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds...</b>|$|R

All <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for stereoscopic tasks were normalised to <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for detecting the appropriate stimulus. We found that at isoluminance <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for depth judgements were no higher for random-dot compared to figural stereograms, even when normalised to the same thresholds obtained with isochromatic stimuli. On the other hand <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for three-dimensional form judgements were much higher than those for depth judgements in isoluminant, compared to isochromatic random-dot-stereograms.

50|$|Using {{the results}} of a {{contrast}} sensitivity exam, a contrast sensitivity curve can be plotted, with angular frequency on the horizontal, and <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> on the vertical axis. Also known as contrast sensitivity function (CSF), the plot demonstrates the normal range of contrast sensitivity, and will indicate diminished contrast sensitivity in patients who fall below the normal curve. Some graphs contain “contrast sensitivity acuity equivalents”, with lower acuity values falling in the area under the curve. In patients with normal visual acuity and concomitant reduced contrast sensitivity, the area under the curve serves as a graphical representation of the visual deficit. It can be because of this impairment in contrast sensitivity that patients have difficulty driving at night, climbing stairs and other activities of daily living in which contrast is reduced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to find out what {{differences}} between foveal and peripheral pattern recognition remain unexplained by the inhomogeneities of retinal sampling and the optics of the eye. We measured <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for pattern recognition at different eccentricities. The effects of retinal sampling were homogenised by using M-scaling of the stimuli, and the effects of the optics of the eye were by-passed either by using strong external noise (signal-to-noise ratio is not affected by optical attenuation) or by computing retinal image contrast by means of the optical modulation transfer function. The stimuli were hand-written numerals filtered to two-octave bands of various centre object spatial frequencies (c/object). The results were described as <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and recognition efficiency. At all eccentricities, lowest <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and highest recognition efficiencies were found at medium object spatial frequencies. At high object spatial frequencies the peripheral retinal <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and recognition efficiencies were nearly as good as at the fovea, but at low object spatial frequencies most of the data showed superiority of the fovea to the periphery. Therefore, at high object spatial frequencies peripheral recognition performance could be explained relatively well by the retinal sampling gradient, or equivalently by the cortical magnification factor, together with the effects of the optics of the eye. Some eccentricity dependent deterioration of recognition at low object spatial frequencies remained unexplained...|$|R
40|$|We {{combined}} {{an external}} noise paradigm with an efficient procedure for obtaining <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> (Lesmes et al., 2006) {{in order to}} model developmental changes during childhood. Specifically, we measured the <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 5 -, 7 -, 9 -year-olds and adults (n = 20 /age) in a two alternative forced-choice orientation discrimination task {{over a wide range}} of external noise levels and at three levels of accuracy. Overall, as age increased, <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> decreased over the entire range of external noise levels tested. The decrease was greatest between 5 and 7 years of age. The reduction in threshold after age 5 was greater in the high than the low external noise region, a pattern implying greater tolerance to the irrelevant background noise as children became older. To model the mechanisms underlying these developmental changes in terms of internal noise components, we adapted the original perceptual template model (Lu and Dosher, 1998) and normalized the magnitude of performance changes against the performance of 5 -year-olds. The resulting model provided an excellent fit (r 2 = 0. 985) to the <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> at multiple levels of accuracy (60, 75, and 90 %) across a wide range of external noise levels. The improvements in <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> with age were best modelled by a combination of reductions in internal additive noise, reductions in internal multiplicative noise, and improvements in excluding external noise by template retuning. In line with the data, the improvement was greatest between 5 and 7 years of age, accompanied by a 39 % reduction in additive noise, 71 % reduction in multiplicative noise, and 45 % improvement in external noise exclusion. The modelled improvements likely reflect developmental changes at the cortical level, rather than changes in front-end structural properties (Kiorpes et al., 2003) ...|$|R

A letter <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> function describes the lowest contrast letters that a client can recognize, over a range of sizes.

Previously, Bijl showed that the <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> of a target image with spatially band-limited noise {{is a function of}} noise spatial frequency.

Methods: A consecutive series of patients with Stage II to IV macular holes was studied before macular hole surgery.

The chromatic contrast thresholds were measured using a computerized cathode ray tube-based system along red-green and tritan confusion axes. Results: Preoperative and postoperative chromatic contrast thresholds were elevated significantly in affected eyes (P < 0. 001). Preoperative VA showed a strong correlation with postoperative VA (r = 0. 66, P < 0. 001) but a weak correlation with visual improvement (r = - 0. 33, P = 0. 03).
