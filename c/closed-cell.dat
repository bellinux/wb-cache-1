25|$|Although it is a <b>closed-cell</b> foam, both {{expanded}} and extruded polystyrene {{are not entirely}} waterproof or vaporproof. In expanded polystyrene there are interstitial gaps between the expanded <b>closed-cell</b> pellets that form an open network of channels between the bonded pellets, and this network of gaps can become filled with liquid water. If the water freezes into ice, it expands and can cause polystyrene pellets to break off from the foam. Extruded polystyrene is also permeable by water molecules {{and can not be}} considered a vapor barrier.|$|E
25|$|An HFEV is an all-electric car {{featuring}} an open-source battery in {{the form}} of a hydrogen tank and the atmosphere. HFEVs may also comprise <b>closed-cell</b> batteries for the purpose of power storage from regenerative braking, but this does not change the source of the motivation. It implies the HFEV is an electric car with two types of batteries. Since HFEVs are purely electric, and do not contain any type of heat engine, they are not hybrids.|$|E
25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see <b>Closed-cell</b> PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a wide-format printer. These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a <b>closed-cell</b> structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|Foams can {{be either}} [...] "closed-cell", {{where most of the}} {{original}} bubbles or cells remain intact, or [...] "open-cell", where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or mattresses. <b>Closed-cell</b> rigid foams are used as thermal insulation, for example in refrigerators.|$|E
2500|$|Expanded {{polystyrene}} (EPS) is a {{rigid and}} tough, <b>closed-cell</b> foam. It is usually white {{and made of}} pre-expanded polystyrene beads. EPS is used for many applications e.g. trays, plates, bowls and fish boxes. Other uses include molded sheets for building insulation and packing material ("peanuts") for cushioning fragile items inside boxes. Sheets are commonly packaged as rigid panels (size 4 by 8 or 2 by 8 feet in the United States), which are also known as [...] "bead-board".|$|E
50|$|<b>Closed-cell</b> foams do {{not have}} {{interconnected}} pores. The <b>closed-cell</b> foams normally have higher compressive strength due to their structures. However, <b>closed-cell</b> foams are also in general denser, require more material, {{and as a consequence}} are more expensive to produce. The closed cells can be filled with a specialized gas to provide improved insulation. The <b>closed-cell</b> structure foams have higher dimensional stability, low moisture absorption coefficients, and higher strength compared to open-cell-structured foams. All types of foam are widely used as core material in sandwich-structured composite materials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Closed-cell</b> foam {{does not}} absorb water and is impermeable. <b>Closed-cell</b> rods are less {{compressible}} {{and should not}} be compressed more than 25%. <b>Closed-cell</b> rod will also lose firmness and out-gas if damaged during installation or overcompressed or at sharp bends. The gasses cannot pass through this backer rod and can deform, weaken, and even cause holes (leaks) in the sealant as it escapes. Out-gassing is the reason open-cell backer rod was developed.|$|E
50|$|Solid foams can be <b>closed-cell</b> or open-cell. In <b>closed-cell</b> foam, the gas forms {{discrete}} pockets, each completely {{surrounded by}} the solid material. In open-cell foam, gas pockets connect to each other. A bath sponge {{is an example of}} an open-cell foam: water easily flows through the entire structure, displacing the air. A camping mat {{is an example of a}} <b>closed-cell</b> foam: gas pockets are sealed from each other so the mat cannot soak up water.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Closed-cell</b> foams are {{superior}} insulators. While open-cell foams typically have R-values of 3 to 4 per inch (RSI-0.53 to RSI-0.70 per inch), <b>closed-cell</b> foams can attain R-values of 5 to 8 per inch (RSI-0.88 to RSI-1.41 per inch). This is important if space is limited, {{because it allows}} a thinner layer of insulation to be used. For example, a 1-inch layer of <b>closed-cell</b> foam provides about the same insulation factor as 2 inches of open-cell foam.|$|E

5000|$|PVC foamboard is {{distinct}} from the extra-lightweight foamcore board, laminated of foam and card surfaces, used for indoor signage and modelling. Like PVC, <b>closed-cell</b> PVC foamboard is solid and has a very rigid structure. Where it differs is in its <b>closed-cell</b> foam structure, which makes it very light (as little as half the weight of solid PVC), highly resistant to moisture and some chemicals, and very easy to cut and shape. It also has thermoplastic properties, and begins to soften at around [...] Typically, <b>closed-cell</b> PVC foamboard can be cut as easily as wood, softened and shaped by immersing in boiling water or with a standard heat gun, and painted with standard automobile paints. In addition, <b>Closed-cell</b> PVC foamboard {{is made up of}} polarized molecules otherwise known as dipoles. [...] It has a very low moisture absorption. The mixture of Polyvinyl chloride and polyurea has a good bond strength. <b>Closed-cell</b> PVC foam takes solid shape due to its linear structure. However, due to this structure, it is more brittle than open-celled PVC foam. It is available in densities varying from 3 pcf to 25 pcf (pounds per cubic foot). [...] It has a low flammability rate. [...] A Universal cross-linked <b>closed-cell</b> PVC that was used in a comparison with three heat-resistant cross-linked had a glass temperature of 83.2 Â°C. However, there are issues using PVC that can affect one's health and safety when in use.|$|E
