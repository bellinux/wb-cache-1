40|$|In this {{exploratory}} study, {{changes in}} the structure of the Australian labour market during the 1970 s are examined, with the aim to ascertain the effects these changes might have on the wellbeing of the workforce. Six issues have been selected for initial analysis: unemployment of youth; shift from full-time to part-time work; employment of women; early withdrawal from the workforce; low incomes in relation to the cost of living and taxation system; and the position of labour in a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy.</b> From the perusal of official statistics and research papers, a conclusion is drawn that some of the concepts and methods used in labour market studies need re-appraisal; and new approaches to research may be necessary, so that the effects of a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> on the labour market can be identified and the implications for social policy can receive appropriate consideration. Although necessarily tentative in its conclusions, the analysis suggests a deteriorating capacity of the low-income earners to achieve a social wage; i. e., a wage sufficient to meet the cost of goods and services which are essential for an acceptable minimum level of social functioning in contemporary society. This indicates a potential exclusion of some occupational groups from the mainstream of social life, posing a danger of a polarized society. Thus the inference is made that increases in public expenditure on income maintenance provisions may be a necessary cost society will have to incur in order to sustain a ‘free’ <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of the US labor share over the past 65 years. We find that intellectual property products (IPP) capital entirely accounts for the observed decline of the US labor share, which otherwise is secularly constant for structures and equipment capital. The decline of the labor share reflects that the US is undergoing a transition to a more IPP <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy.</b> This result has essential implications for the US macroeconomic model...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} has suggested that financial statements have lost their value relevance because of a shift from a traditional <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> to a hightechnology, service-oriented economy. These conclusions are based on studies that find a temporal decline in the association between stock prices and accounting information (earnings and book values). This paper empirically tests a theoretical prediction arising from the Noisy Rational Expectations Equilibrium model that suggests that the decline could be driven by non information based (NIB) trading activity, because such trading reduces the ability of stock prices to reflect accounting information. Specifically, Dontoh et al. (2004) show that when NIB trading increases, the R-squares of a regression of stock price on accounting information declines. Our empirical tests confirm this prediction; i. e., the decline in the association between stock prices and accounting information as measured by R-squares is driven by an increase in NIB trading. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis where global aggregate demand is struggling, countries occasionally get accused of weakening their currency to gain competitiveness. The method of weakening the currency to gain competitiveness is explained by the Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that a devaluation in the long-term will strengthen the balance of trade. But is this policy always rational? And if not, which economies should avoid it? This study investigates whether the structure of the export industry can explain the varying response in the balance of trade from a devaluation. The Johansen Procedure with a Vector Error Correction Model is used to estimate long-run price elasticities of demand for exports and imports. The countries chosen are among the 30 countries with the lowest rank of economic complexity based on its output, listed by the Observatory of Economic Complexity. The exports of these countries are consisting of a single or a few goods, which enables for investigating how individual industries respond to a devaluation. The hypothesis is that there are differences between labour- and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economies</b> and that the former should respond more positive to a devaluation than the latter. The results indicate that there is a pattern, to the opposite of the hypothesis, where the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economies</b> respond more positive to a devaluation than the labour-intensive economies. This could be misleading due to underlying factors that should be controlled for to be able to produce reliable estimates. The Marshall-Lerner condition is fulfilled for two countries, Gabon and Niger, out of nine in the final sample...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Dual Economy" [...] {{model was}} {{developed}} by Dutch colonial economist J.H. Boeke, and extended and popularized by the anthropologist Clifford Geertz in [...] "Agricultural Involution: The Process of Ecological Change in Indonesia." [...] Boeke's “dual economy” thesis maintained that Dutch capitalism never penetrated the [...] "native" [...] economy of Indonesia (the Netherlands East Indies); the native economy was shaped and moulded by a pre-capitalist culture and thus remained embedded in “social” rather than “economic” needs. In an early debate with liberal economists (a debate later recapitulated by substantivist and formalist economic anthropologists in the 1960s), he argued {{for the creation of}} a new sub-discipline, colonial economics, which was not predicated upon universalizing models of economic man. However, Boeke’s model served colonial interests by underscoring western economic rationality and placing Indonesians in a subordinated evolutionary position: the yet to be civilized. Geertz argued that colonialism “stabilized and accentuated the dual economy pattern of a capital-intensive Western sector and a labor-intensive Eastern one by rapidly developing the first and rigorously stereotyping the second.” Geertz’s interpretation of Javanese peasant economic rationality as static, coddled within a closed corporate community and isolated from a <b>capital-intensive</b> colonial <b>economy</b> has increasingly been challenged. Critics argue that Geertz ignores the manner in which the [...] "traditional" [...] Javanese economy was incorporated in and exploited by the colonial capitalist regime.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recently, {{a growing}} bozdy of {{literature}} {{has created a}} widespread impression that financial statements have lost their value-relevance because of a shift from traditional <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy</b> into a high technology, service-oriented economy. In particular, the claim is that financial statements are less relevant in assessing the fundamental value of high technology, service-oriented firms/activities, which are by nature knowledge-intensive. These conclusions are based on past studies that examine the association between accounting numbers (i. e., earnings and book values) and stock prices and show that, in general, the association between accounting information and stock prices has been declining, over time. These findings have been interpreted {{to be the result}} of a decline in value relevance of accounting. We examine the predictive content of stock prices and accounting information, as against the contemporaneous association between accounting information and stock prices. We find that while both the predictive content of earnings and prices declined over time, the predictive content of price signals declined by even more. Our analysis suggests that the declining association could be the consequence of increased noise in stock prices over time resulting from increases in trading volume driven by non-information based trades, and not just...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{urbanization}} of drone warfare and the securitization of the “surplus population”. Defined as a bloc of humanity rendered as structurally unnecessary to a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy,</b> the surplus population is an emerging {{target for the}} post-welfare security state. If we now live {{in an age of}} a permanent conflict with uncertain geographies, then it is at least partly fueled by this endemic crisis {{at the heart of the}} capitalist world system. Of key significance is the contradictory nature of the surplus population. The “security threat” generated by replacing masses of workers with nonhumans is increasingly managed by policing humans with robots, drones, and other apparatuses. In other words, the surplus population is both the outcome and target of contemporary capitalist technics. The emerging “dronification of state violence” across a post- 9 ∕ 11 battlespace has seen police drones deployed to the urban spaces of cities in Europe and North America. The drone, with its ability to swarm in the streets of densely packed urban environments, crystallizes a more intimate and invasive form of state power. The project of an atmospheric, dronified form of policing not only embodies the technologization of state security but also entrenches the logic of a permanent, urbanized manhunt. The paper concludes by discussing the rise of the dronepolis : the city of the drone...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} about the sources of growth in income in Australia {{and the effects of}} {{structural}} change on the distribution of income between labour and capital. The main objective is to find an explanation for the fall in the labour share of income in Australia in the 2000 s. Key points 	The labour share of income fell by 4 or more percentage points in the 2000 s. 	However, labour was no worse off in the process. 	 		Labour income grew at a faster rate in the 2000 s than in the 1990 s through stronger growth in both wages and employment. 	 	 	The labour income share only fell because capital income growth accelerated even more. 	The rise in the terms of trade meant that product prices rose faster than consumer prices. While labour received a smaller share of income at product prices, the slower growth in consumer prices meant that the real value of each dollar earned was worth more in terms of its purchasing power. This purchasing power effect (which was available to all income earners) more than outweighed the apparent reduction in labour 2 ̆ 7 s share of national income. 	The large rise in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s terms of trade brought strong growth in real income —even stronger than the growth in the 2 ̆ 7 productivity decade 2 ̆ 7 of the 1990 s. 	 		This provided scope for growth in both labour and capital income to rise. 	 	 	Other high-income countries also experienced a decline in the labour income share, but driven by a different set of factors. In other countries, growth in labour income has suffered. 	The mining boom was overwhelmingly responsible for the fall in labour share in Australia: 	 		Development of mining and associated capacity added to the economy 2 ̆ 7 s capital stock, leading to more capital-intensive production overall. 		Higher output prices for minerals (and construction) reduced the real cost of labour so that growth in real wages fell behind labour productivity growth. 	 	 	The two other industries most affected by the mining boom — Construction and Manufacturing — served to increase the labour income share. 	 		In Manufacturing, a slowdown in capital income growth meant the industry contributed more to labour income than to capital income at the aggregate level. 		Construction had stronger growth in capital income than in labour income. However, because the industry is labour intensive, growth in Construction 2 ̆ 7 s labour income had a greater effect on aggregate labour income than growth in its capital income had on aggregate capital income. 	 	 	As the terms of trade now decline, the labour income share will rise. But with a more <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>economy,</b> the share is unlikely to revert fully to previous levels. 	Action to restore the old labour income share or to recover 2 ̆ 7 lost 2 ̆ 7 income share through wage rises would probably only have adverse consequences for employment and inflation and for industries already facing adjustment pressures. 	With the prospect of declining terms of trade, a focus on productivity growth will be the way to sustain growth in real wages...|$|E
