The {{use of the term}} materialistic to describe a person's personality or a society tends to have a negative or critical connotation.

Environmentalism can be considered a competing orientation to materialism.|$|E
50|$|Thin {{leaves are}} seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by {{creating}} a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag pine needle clusters in by the base. Petioles are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on trial and error. Worms excavate burrows by <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume soil for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with {{people from around the}} world such as Fritz Müller in Brazil.|$|E

5000|$|Though Carnivora is a taxon {{for species}} classification, no such {{equivalent}} exists for omnivores, as omnivores are widespread across multiple taxonomic clades. The Carnivora order {{does not include}} all carnivorous species, and not all species within the Carnivora taxon are carnivorous. It is common to find physiological carnivores consuming materials from plants or physiological herbivores <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> from animals, e.g. felines eating grass and deer eating birds. [...] From a behavioral aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For instance, it is well documented that animals such as giraffes, camels, and cattle will gnaw on bones, preferably dry bones, for particular minerals and nutrients. [...] Felines, which are usually regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestibles (e.g. hair, bones), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expressed}} {{objective of}} the constitutional project, {{as that of the}} political projects exposed short before and after, was that of modernising the nation; what in an emerging state meant little more than creating it.An important part of the national thinkers considered that the project of modernisation imposed an almost total rupture with the Spanish colonial past; since Esteban Echeverría to Sarmiento and the Generación del '80, the search for the Argentine insertion in the modern world was based in the importation of theories, practices and even people.Such a rupture demanded a certain kind of conditions and dispositions; the complementation of the European markets would benefit the merchants of the port and the higher classes, capable of <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> and symbolic luxury goods that this commerce provided, but affecting the rural and lower classes, which were displaced if their source of sustention and the productive system in which they were situated.

The problem of this view was the impossibility, for a long time of Rosas' period, of effectively developing the national state; the restoration of the order that in previous years had dissolved, in successive confrontations between the caudillos and the hegemony of the new Buenos Aires metropolis, resulted in the paralysation of the process of building a state.|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} component of human behavior, the consumer’s behavior restrictively, reflects people’s conduct {{when it comes to}} buying and / or <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> goods and services. At large, it comprises the entire conduct of the final user of material and immaterial goods. The study of the behavior of the consumer is vital for an enterprise in the motivation of the consequences that it carries along regarding all the decisions of marketing : the positioning of the brands, the segmentation of the markets, the development of new products, advertising strategies of distribution etc. The analysis of the consumer’s behavior, because of the fundamentally different nature of the acts and processes of decision that compose it, is characterized by its multidisciplinary origin. Thus, economy, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology permitted the laying of the conceptual foundations of the actual knowledge in this domain. Even though the interdisciplinary character of the consumer’s behavior investigations is recognized, there are, however, numerous points of view in the specialty literature that plead for the autonomization of this domain. This thing doesn’t impose though its separation from the marketing studies. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{indirect}} employment {{relates to}} the non-rail staff supplying the HSR system(s) with different kinds of daily <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> and energy {{on the one hand}} and that generated just thanks to existing of the system on the other. These latter are the non-rail related economic activities around and at the HSR stations such as: business services (banking, insurance, and advertising), information and retail services, research and development, higher education, tourism, and political institutions [30]. At the larger scale, these businesses have created urban (both business and housing) agglomerations around the HSR stations, which themselves have induced additional demand for the HSR services. Such development has been taking place mainly at the HSR stations already located in the larger urban agglomerations connected by the HSR lines/routes, but also within them. For example, inclusion of the city of Lille (France) in the HSR line/route Paris-Brussels has brought an enormous economic development of the city itself and its region in terms of increasing of business and touristic activities and related employment. In the UK, the substantial economic activities have been created in the cities 2  h from London area just thanks to the HSR [41].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{results from a}} recent {{research}} programme {{on the impact of}} fine sediment transport through catchments to present a case for the development of new approaches to improving the quality of salmonid spawning and incubation habitats. To aid the development of these programmes, this paper summarises the mechanisms by which fine sediment accumulation influences the availability of oxygen (O 2) to incubating salmon embryos. The results of the investigation indicate that incubation success is inhibited by: (i) the impact of fine sediment accumulation on gravel permeability and, subsequently, the rate of passage of oxygenated water through the incubation environment; (ii) reduced intragravel O 2 concentrations that occur when O 2 <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> infiltrates spawning and incubation gravels; and (iii) the impact of fine particles (clay) on the exchange of O 2 across the egg membrane. It is concluded that current granular measures of spawning and incubation habitat quality do not satisfactorily describe the complexity of factors influencing incubation success. Furthermore, an assessment of the trends in fine sediment infiltration indicates that only a small proportion of the total suspended sediment load infiltrates spawning and incubation gravels. This casts doubt over the ability of current catchment-based land use management strategies to adequately reduce fine sediment inputs. <br/...|$|E
5000|$|The {{health of}} an aquatic {{ecosystem}} is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem {{can be a}} result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen <b>consuming</b> <b>materials,</b> and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems. There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine. The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species. [...] Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} industrial viability and to find niche markets, high deposition rate and low temperature depositions compared to standard deposition conditions are two recent trends in research areas concerning thin film silicon. In situ diagnostic tools to monitor gas phase conditions are useful in quick optimization processes of deposition parameters without going into time <b>consuming</b> <b>material</b> characterizations. Optical emission spectroscopy is an efficient technique to monitor/predict growth rate and phase of the material (amorphous or nanocrystalline). However, at high growth rate conditions which are generally achieved at high chamber pressures (p), the simple correlation breaks down. We see that at high pressure condition a higher H-alpha/Si-center dot is needed for the onset of crystallinity than that is found at lower pressure conditions. Additional methods such as estimating the silane depletion from the experiment and the flux ratio of atomic hydrogen to deposited silicon atoms from simulations {{can be used for}} fine-tuning the amorphous to nanocrystalline transition regime. On the other hand, intensity of Si-center dot line loses its character as a monitoring tool for deposition rate. Moreover, the plasma changes its character when the pressure is varied, even when the pd product is kept constant. In situ diagnosis of the ion energy distribution function by a retarding field ion energy analyzer has thrown new lights on the role of hydrogen dilution for depositions at low substrate temperature conditions, namely to compensate the loss in ion energy due to lower gas temperature.

Making use of meganucleases, TALENs, or CRISPR/Cas 9 -based tools requires an initial step of pre-screening to determine the efficiency and specificity of the designed tools. This step remains time <b>consuming</b> and <b>material</b> <b>consuming.</b> Here we propose a simple, cheap, reliable, time-saving, and highly sensitive method to evaluate a given gene-editing tool based on its capacity to induce chromosomal translocations when combined with a reference engineered nuclease. In the proposed technique, designated engineered nuclease-induced translocations (ENIT), a plasmid coding for the DNA-editing tool to be tested is co-transfected into carefully chosen target cells along with that for an engineered nuclease of known specificity and efficiency. If the new enzyme efficiently cuts within the desired region, then specific chromosomal translocations will be generated between the two targeted genomic regions and be readily detectable by a one-step PCR or qPCR assay. The PCR product thus obtained can be directly sequenced, thereby determining the exact position of the double-strand breaks induced by the gene-editing tools. As a proof of concept, ENIT was successfully tested in different cell types and with different meganucleases, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas 9 -based editing tools...|$|R

However, searching for desired data elements among the thousands of available elements and harmonizing differences in terminology, data collection, and structure, is arduous and time <b>consuming.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods To speed up biobank data pooling we developed BiobankConnect, a system to semiautomatically match desired data elements to available elements by: (1) annotating the desired elements with ontology terms using BioPortal; (2) automatically expanding the query for these elements with synonyms and subclass information using OntoCAT; (3) automatically searching available elements for these expanded terms using Lucene lexical matching; and (4) shortlisting relevant matches sorted by matching score. Results We evaluated BiobankConnect using human curated matches from EU-BioSHaRE, searching for 32 desired data elements in 7461 available elements from six biobanks. We found 0. 75 precision at rank 1 and 0. 74 recall at rank 10 compared to a manually curated set of relevant matches. In addition, best matches chosen by BioSHaRE experts ranked first in 63. 0 % and in the top 10 in 98. 4 % of cases, indicating that our system {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce manual matching work. Conclusions BiobankConnect provides an easy user interface to significantly speed up the biobank harmonization process. It may also prove useful for other forms of biomedical data integration.

50|$|Bacterioplankton {{occupy a}} range of {{ecological}} niches in marine and aquatic ecosystems. They are both primary producers and primary consumers in these ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycling of elements essential for life (e.g., carbon and nitrogen fixation). Many are saprotrophic, and obtain energy by <b>consuming</b> organic <b>material</b> produced by other organisms. This material may be dissolved in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as marine snow. Many other bacterioplankton species are autotrophic, and derive energy from either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. The latter are often categorised as picophytoplankton, and include cyanobacterial groups such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Bacterioplankton play critical roles in global nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, remineralisation and methanogenesis.|$|R
