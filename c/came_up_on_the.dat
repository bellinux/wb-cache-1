She was built at Rochefort between April 1777 and January 1778, being {{launched}} on 3 September 1777. She went out to the West Indies after the French entry to the American War of Independence, and reached Martinique on 17 August 1778. On 28 August 1778 she <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 32-gun , under Captain John Stott, and after {{two and a half hours}} of fighting, captured her. Minerva was towed to Cap Français on Saint-Domingue, where she was joined shortly afterwards by the captured , which a hurricane had dismasted in late August and which the French frigates Charmante and Dédaigneuse had captured on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Mounted Division {{was joined}} {{a few hours}} later by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which had left Huj early in the morning. They <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right of the Australian Mounted Division and took over Arak el Menshiye {{extending}} the line a little further east. By the afternoon of 10 November the whole of the Desert Mounted Corps {{with the exception of the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, (still at Tel el Khuweilfe) were in line from a point a little east of Arak el Menshiye to the sea. Both the Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions reconnoitred the left half of the Ottoman line running from Qastina, roughly through Balin and Barqusya, to the neighbourhood of Bayt Jibrin in the foot hills of the Judean Hills.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} depredations from Cherbourg, the Admiralty {{despatched}} {{a number of}} warships to blockade the French coast, including the 36-gun frigate HMS Crescent under Captain James Saumarez, which was sent from Portsmouth to the Channel Islands before operating off the Cotentin. On 19 October, Saumarez learned of the French routine and took up a station close inshore near Cape Barfleur, a rocky headland on the eastern extremity of the Cotentin Peninsula which the Cherbourg raiders passed whenever leaving or entering port. At dawn on 20 October lookouts on Crescent reported two sails approaching the land from the Channel, one significantly larger than the other. Saumarez immediately ordered his ship to edge into the wind towards the strange vessels and rapidly <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> port side of the new arrivals, with the wind behind him allowing freedom of movement.|$|E

25|$|Lannes formed his {{infantry}} divisions with Marie-François Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga on {{the right}} and Louis Gabriel Suchet on the left. Kellermann's division advanced to the right front with Frédéric Henri Walther's 2nd Dragoon Division in support. When the ten-squadron Prince Constantine Uhlan Regiment attacked from the right, Kellermann ordered the division to change front. This maneuver failed and the French horsemen beat a rapid retreat behind Caffarelli's infantry. When the uhlans tried to pursue they were driven off by a volley that emptied many saddles and wounded the Russian brigadier. Kellerman pursued in echelon with his right-flank regiment leading. Anne-François-Charles Trelliard's cavalry brigade supported his left while Horace François Bastien Sébastiani's brigade of Walther's division followed behind. The Russians attacked Kellermann's lead regiment with three regiments, but they were overcome when Kellermann's other units <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left flank while Sébastiani's dragoons <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1793, lookouts on board Crescent {{reported}} sails off Cape Barfleur, on the Cotentin Peninsula, heading towards Cherbourg. Saumarez set a course to intercept, and with the wind in his favour, soon <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> port side of the two vessels which {{proved to be the}} 38-gun French frigate La Réunion and a 14-gun cutter named Espérance, returning from a raiding cruise in the Channel under the command of Captain François A.

25|$|At about 14:00 the Middlesex Yeomanry <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{left and}} took up a line north of the Umm esh Shert track in the plain which was {{continued}} by the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment to {{the bank of the}} Jordan River. The line was covered by the Berkshire Battery and the 17th Machine Gun Squadron when they arrived. At 14:45 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment and the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery , were withdrawn from the 60th (London) Division's infantry still fighting the Ottoman garrison at Shunet Nimrin, to reinforce Chaytor's force.|$|E
25|$|Next, Staines {{captured}} three Martello towers, each mounting two heavy guns. On 17 May Staines personally <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inattentive garrison of {{the first}} tower and through an interpreter informed them that he had placed powder against the tower {{and that he would}} blow them up if they did not surrender. When the French soldiers made sounds suggesting they were preparing to resist, he fired a musket through the keyhole; the frightened garrison immediately surrendered. He then took the commander from that tower to another tower to persuade its garrison too to surrender. The garrison did surrender and Staines had both towers blown up. He then captured and destroyed a third tower, all without any casualties to Cyane.|$|E

25|$|From 09:00 long {{columns of}} {{retreating}} Yildirim Army Group units, {{with guns and}} transport, were seen moving northwards through Kh. el Kofkha towards Jemmame. After watering their horses at the Wadi Sheria, the 7th Mounted Brigade, arrived at divisional headquarters at 09:00 and was immediately ordered to reinforce the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades in the centre. At 11:00 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was counter–attacked strongly {{on the right of}} the mounted infantry line, near Tel el Nejile, and was held up while the 7th Mounted Brigade, in the centre, continued to advance towards Bir el Jemameh. By about 13:00 they had nearly reached their objective, when they were heavily attacked by the Ottoman defenders covering the water supply, forcing the brigade back, and endangering its left flank. The 1st Light Horse Brigade <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western side of the 7th Mounted Brigade, and drove the Ottoman attackers back, the leading troops of 1st Light Horse Brigade, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment fought their way into Bir el Jemameh/Kh Jemmame shortly after 15:00. Here they captured the wells, cisterns and steam pumping plant intact, including the engineer in charge. While a regiment of the 1st Light Horse Brigade secured the high ground to the north overlooking Bir el Jemameh protecting the area, the remainder of the brigade and the 7th Mounted Brigade, watered all their horses. Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade occupied Tel el Nejil station after dark, when the Ottoman 53rd Division's defenders had retired. Although some water was found here in the Wadi Hesi, {{it was not possible to}} water the horses of the outpost troops which established a night outpost line, protecting Nejil.|$|E

The Presidio surrendered without a fight, as the garrison was far south in the Pueblo de Los Angeles. [...] Frémont had heard that the Mexican army was lying in ambush for him at Gaviota Pass, the only other sensible route over the mountains at that time, and had crossed the difficult muddy track on San Marcos Pass to outflank them, but this move turned out not to have been necessary.

500|$|During {{the final}} table, Moon {{eliminated}} Steve Begleiter and seasoned pro Phil Ivey.

He made it to the final two players and went heads up against Joe Cada, with Moon at 58.85 million and Cada at 135.95 million.

500|$|Anson {{was sent}} back to Britain shortly afterwards, and Lydiard rejoined his ship at Plymouth. After a period {{refitting}} Anson was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of Brest by patrolling off Black Rocks.

He made for the Lizard, but in the poor weather, <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore, with breakers ahead. Anson rolled heavily in [...] rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed. Lydiard's only option was to anchor, but early on the morning of 29 December the rising storm caused the anchor cables to part and she was driven onto the shore. Lydiard ordered the ship to be run onto a beach in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, and resolved to remain aboard to oversee the evacuation. The pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore, while Lydiard clung to the wheel to encourage them on. Eyewitnesses recorded that Lydiard had exhausted himself with the effort of organising the evacuation and clinging to the wreck in the violence of the storm.
