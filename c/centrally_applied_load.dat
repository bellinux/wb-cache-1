40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} elastic flexural buckling analysis of composite Euler-Bernoulli beams of arbitrary variable cross-section. The composite beam consists of materials in contact. Each of these materials can surround {{a finite number of}} inclusions or openings. All of the cross-section's materials are firmly bonded together. Since the cross-sectional properties of the beam vary along its axis, the coefficients of the governing differential equation are variable. The beam is subjected to a compressive <b>centrally</b> <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> together with arbitrarily axial and transverse distributed loading, while its edges are restrained by the most general linear boundary conditions. The resulting boundary value problems are solved using the analog equation method, a BEM based method. Besides the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed method, a significant advantage is that the displacements as well as the stress resultants are computed at any cross-section of the beam using the respective integral representations as mathematical formulae. Several beams are analysed to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency and wherever possible its accuracy. The influence of the boundary conditions on the buckling load is demonstrated through examples with great practical interest. The flexural buckling analysis of a homogeneous beam is treated as a special case. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the general flexuraltorsional {{buckling}} and vibration problems of composite Euler-Bernoulli beams of arbitrarily shaped cross section are solved using a boundary element method. The general {{character of the}} proposed method is verified from the formulation of all basic equations with respect to an arbitrary coordinate system, which is not restricted to the principal one. The composite beam consists of materials in contact each of which can surround {{a finite number of}} inclusions. It is subjected to a compressive <b>centrally</b> <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> together with arbitrarily transverse and/or torsional distributed or concentrated loading, while its edges are restrained by the most general linear boundary conditions. The resulting problems are (i) the flexural-torsional buckling problem, which is described by three coupled ordinary differential equations and (ii) the flexural-torsional vibration problem, which is described by three coupled partial differential equations. Both problems are solved employing a boundary integral equation approach. Besides the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed method, a significant advantage is that the method can treat composite beams of both thin and thick walled cross sections taking into account the warping along the thickness of the walls. The proposed method overcomes the shortcoming of possible thin tube theory (TTT) solution, which its utilization has been proven to be prohibitive even in thin walled homogeneous sections. Example problems of composite beams are analysed, subjected to compressive or vibratory loading, to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency and wherever possible its accuracy. Moreover, useful conclusions are drawn from the buckling and dynamic response of the beam. Copyright Â© 2007 Tech Science Press...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} general flexural-torsional linear buckling analysis of Timoshenko beams of arbitrarily shaped composite cross-section. The composite beam consists of materials in contact, each of which can surround {{a finite number of}} inclusions. The materials have different elasticity and shear moduli with same Poisson's ratio and are firmly bonded together. The beam is subjected to a compressive <b>centrally</b> <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> together with arbitrarily axial, transverse and/or torsional distributed loading, while its edges are restrained by the most general linear boundary conditions.

All basic equations are formulated with respect to the principal shear axes coordinate system, which does not coincide with the principal bending one in a nonsymmetric cross-section. To account for shear deformations, the concept of shear deformation coefficients is used. Six coupled boundary value problems are formulated with respect to the transverse displacements, to the angle of twist, to the primary warping function and to two stress functions and solved using the analog equation method, a BEM based method. Several beams are analysed to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency. The significant influence of the boundary conditions and the shear deformation effect on the buckling load are investigated through examples with great practical interest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} fourth-order Euler-Bernoulli partial {{differential}} equation having a constant elastic modulus and area moment of inertia, a variable lineal mass density g(x), and the <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> denoted by f(u), {{a function of}} transverse displacement u(t,x). The complete Lie group classification is obtained for different forms of the variable lineal mass density g(x) and <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> f(u). The equivalence transformations are constructed to simplify the determining equations for the symmetries. The principal algebra is one-dimensional and it extends to two- and three-dimensional algebras for an arbitrary <b>applied</b> <b>load,</b> general power-law, exponential, and log type of <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> for different forms of g(x). For the linear <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> case, we obtain an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. We recover the Lie symmetry classification results discussed in the literature when g(x) is constant with variable <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> f(u). For the general power-law and exponential case the group invariant solutions are derived. The similarity transformations reduce the fourth-order partial differential equation to a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. For the power-law <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> case a compatible initial-boundary value problem for the clamped and free end beam cases is formulated. We deduce the fourth-order ordinary differential equation with appropriate initial and boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Metal forming is used synonymously with deformation, {{a process}} during which an object gets changed {{due to the}} applied force.
