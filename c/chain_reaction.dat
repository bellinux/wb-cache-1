5|$|In 1939, the Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia where Zinn worked {{were the}} center of {{intensive}} research into the properties of uranium and nuclear fission, which had recently been discovered by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. At Columbia, Zinn, Enrico Fermi, Herbert L. Anderson , John R. Dunning and Leo Szilard investigated whether uranium-238 fissioned with slow neutrons, as Fermi believed, or only the uranium-235 isotope, as Niels Bohr contended. Since pure uranium-235 was not available, Fermi and Szilard chose to work with natural uranium. They were particularly interested in whether a nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> could be initiated. This would require more than one neutron to be emitted per fission on average {{in order to keep}} the <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> going. By March 1939, they established that about two were being emitted per fission on average. The delay between an atom absorbing a neutron and fission occurring would be the key to controlling a <b>chain</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> was several tons. Seven months later a breakthrough in Britain would estimate the necessary critical mass to be less than 10 kilograms, making delivery of a bomb by air a possibility.|$|E
50|$|Chemical <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> {{were first}} {{proposed}} by German chemist Max Bodenstein in 1913, and were reasonably well understood before nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> were proposed. It was understood that chemical <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> {{were responsible for}} exponentially increasing rates in reactions, such as produced in chemical explosions.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Paul Kuroda of the University of Arkansas {{postulated}} that a natural fission reactor may have once existed. Since nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> only require natural materials (such as water and uranium), {{it is possible}} to have these <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> occur where there is the right combination of materials within the Earth's crust. Kuroda's prediction was verified with the discovery of evidence of natural self-sustaining nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> in the past at Oklo in Gabon, Africa, in September 1972.|$|R

5|$|In 1970, <b>Chain</b> <b>Reaction</b> and Jam Band {{played at}} the same gig. Tyler {{immediately}} loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, {{who had been a}} drummer and backup singer in <b>Chain</b> <b>Reaction,</b> adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting he would only take part if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit {{additional}} neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> might be possible.|$|E

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E

40|$|The author {{presents}} {{some results}} {{of an attempt to}} apply the graph theory for the kinetic description of straight <b>chain</b> <b>reactions.</b> Using some classical examples already solved by help of the quasi-steady-state approximation, a critical discussion on the capabilities of the graph-treatment is brought up. The kinetic analysis of straight <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> by help of plane diagrams originates in the work of Christiansen [1]. On the other hand, beginning with the work of King and Altman [2] the graph theory was successfully applied in order to describe kinetically closed catalytic sequences [3 ÷ 6]. Taking into account that the straight <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> are also based on closed sequences, the idea of describing them by help of graph theory appears as natural. This is the reason why Temkin suggested a method to derive rate equations for catalytic and straight chain with linear mechanism reactions by help of graphs [7]. In such a theoretical frame the graphical schemes of Christiansen were transposed in graphs [8]. Detailed kinetic treatments of concrete straight <b>chain</b> <b>reactions</b> are rather difficult. This is probably due to the nonlinear character of the mechanisms associated to straight <b>chain</b> <b>reactions.</b> At least one elementary step of such reactions involves more than an activ...|$|R

5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only for maintaining the nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction,</b> {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a <b>chain</b> <b>reaction.</b> In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction.</b> The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E
