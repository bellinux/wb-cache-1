40|$|A {{wide range}} of unique {{engineering}} structural and performance properties inherent in metallic composites characterizes wear- and erosion-resistant high-temperature coatings made by thermal spraying methods. This allows their use both in manufacturing processes to enhance the wear strength of products, which have to operate under the cyclic loading, high contact pressures, corrosion and high temperatures and in product renewal. Thermal coatings contribute to the qualitative improvement of the technical level of production and product restoration using the ceramic composite materials. However, the possibility to have a significantly increased product performance, reduce their factory labour hours and materials/output ratio in manufacturing and restoration is largely dependent {{on the degree of}} the surface layer quality of products at their finishing stage, which is usually provided by different kinds of machining. When machining the plasma-sprayed thermal coatings, a removing process of the cut-off layer material is determined by its distinctive features such as a layered structure, high internal stresses, low ductility material, high tendency to the surface layer strengthening and rehardening, porosity, high abrasive properties, etc. When coatings are machined these coating properties result in specific characteristics of chip formation and conditions for formation of the billet surface layer. The chip formation of plasma-sprayed coatings was studied at micro-velocities using an experimental tool-setting microscope-based setup, created in BMSTU. The setup allowed simultaneous recording both the individual stages (phases) of the chip formation process and the operating force factors. It is found that formation of individual <b>chip</b> <b>elements</b> comes with the multiple micro-cracks that cause chipping-off the small particles of material. The emerging main crack in the cut-off layer of material leads to separation of the largest <b>chip</b> <b>element.</b> Then all the stages of <b>chip</b> <b>element</b> formation are cycled. Fluctuations of the cutting force components completely repeat all the stages of local destruction and formation of individual <b>chip</b> <b>elements.</b> Studies have shown that with increased thickness of the cut-off layer the main crack develops below the cut-off line thus significantly affecting the quality of the machined surface: emerging cracks, cavities, chips, and other defects that significantly reduce the product performance. In machining the plasma-sprayed coatings, their high tendency to strengthening and rehardening because of the cutting action has a great impact on the surface quality. This is evident as a loss of the elastic equilibrium state stability and as a destruction of the work-piece surface layer (chipping, peeling, flaking). With increasing curvature of the machined surface (e. g., decreasing radius of cylindrical billet) the surface layer is increasingly prone to destruction. Specific problems are cutting fluids used in grinding the plasma-sprayed coatings. Machining in this case comes with saturated liquid vapours formed in the surface layer of a billet under high pressure. With a pressure drop on the tool-side in cutting there is such an intensity of vaporization that micro- and macro-fractures of the machined work-piece surface can be initiated. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} model {{based on the}} finite difference method is presented to predict tool and chip temperature fields in continuous machining and time varying milling processes. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool—rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face—chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method. Later, the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time. The time varying chip is digitized into small elements with differential cutter rotation angles which are defined by the product of spindle speed and discrete time intervals. The temperature field in each differential element is modeled as a first-order dynamic system, whose time constant is identified based on the thermal properties of the tool and work material, and the initial temperature at the previous chip segment.

While it is clearly advantageous to have a high degree of integration and thus fewer off <b>chip</b> <b>elements,</b> parasitic losses due to semiconducting substrate effects can be a performance-limiting factor. Microstrip spiral inductors are key components in many high frequency circuit designs, including MMIC's, RFIC's, and mixed-signal modules. However, the losses associated with spirals fabricated in a lossy substrate environment, such as in CMOS and bipolar technologies, are not accurately modeled by the current conventional techniques. This thesis presents a complete modeling technique for spiral inductors over such 'high-loss' substrates. The quasi-static solution for single and coupled Metal-Insulator-Substrate (MIS) microstrip structures {{has led to the}} development of methods for calculating the self and mutual line parameters r, l, g, and c, which are in turn utilized in the model for the microstrip spiral inductors in the same environment. The equivalent circuit model for the spiral inductors is based on the conventional low-loss spiral models with the inclusion of frequency-dependent losses due to semiconducting substrates. The distributed model for spirals in CMOS-based RFICs incorporates inductance calculations by the Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method, augmented by inductance and resistance calculations for the so-called skin effect mode by the spectral domain technique. In addition, the capacitances and shunt conductances can be computed by a Poisson solver for layered lossy media; both network analog and spectral domain methods are also used to find the shunt admittance per unit length for the microstrip structure as a fundamental element of the spiral.

The Oxley's machining theory [36] that {{can be considered a}} purely theoretical approach, which has not yet been applied to the high speed milling process is used to model this process in order to predict the cutting forces. An experimental programme was carried out in order to study and understand the high speed milling process and to collect force data for machining of AISI 1020 plain carbon steel at speeds from 250 to 500 m/min, feed rates 0. 025 to 0. 075 mm/tooth and 0. 5 and 0. 8 mm depths of cut, using three different tool configurations with different nose radii. The model developed by Young [5] using the Oxley's machining theory, for conventional milling, was first applied to the high speed milling operation. The force predictions were satisfactory compared to the measured forces. Using this as the basis, a theoretical model was developed to predict the cutting forces in high speed milling. A smaller <b>chip</b> <b>element</b> was considered in applying the machining theory to satisfy the assumption of two dimensional deformation in the machining theory.

Experimentscalibrate and in part validate the results. Tool wear nose turning Monel 400 alloy is reported. It shows thermally activated dependence on temperature, with activation energy 53 ± 6 kJ/mol...|$|R
40|$|Serial {{powering}} is {{an elegant}} solution {{to power the}} SLHC inner trackers with a minimum volume of cables. Previously R&D on the serial powering of silicon strip detector modules had been based on discrete commercial electronics, but with the delivery of the Atlas Binary Chip Next chip in 0. 25 micron CMOS technology (ABCN- 25) and the Serial Powering Interface <b>chip</b> (SPi), custom <b>elements</b> of shunt regulators and transistors became available. These ASICs {{can be used to}} implement three complementary serial powering architectures. The features of these schemes and their performance with 10 and 20 chip ABCN- 25 hybrids will be presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{direction for}} exploiting the computational power of multi/many core chips is {{to rely on}} a massive usage of Thread Level Parallelism (TLP). We focus on the Decoupled Threaded Architecture, a hybrid dataflow architecture which efficiently uses TLP by decoupling and scheduling threads on <b>chip</b> processing <b>elements</b> in order to provide on-chip scalable performance. The DTA architecture currently lacks a specific mapping to high level languages. Our idea is to use a functional language to match this execution paradigm because we think it is very fit for this environment. We choose Haskell as our language and in particular one of the features we want to implement is the concurrency control based on Transactional Memory, which is fully supported in Haskell. The main goal of this research is twofold. First, the study of a method to unite the functional paradigm of the Haskell programming language with the DTA execution paradigm. Second, the development of a Transactional Memory model for DTA architecture based on the STM (Software Transactional Memory) API. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{an improvement in}} the layout of coplanar electrodes for electrical impedance spectroscopy. We have developed, fabricated, and tested an improved electrode layout, which improves the sensitivity of an impedance flow cytometry chip. The improved chip was experimentally tested and compared to a chip with a conventional electrode layout. The improved chip was able to discriminate 0. 5 μm beads from 1 μm {{as opposed to the}} conventional <b>chip.</b> Furthermore, finite <b>element</b> modeling was used to simulate the improvements in electrical field density and uniformity between the electrodes of the new electrode layout. Good agreement was observed between the model and the obtained experimental results...|$|R
