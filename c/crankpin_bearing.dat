50|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of crankshafts is usually increased {{by using a}} radius {{at the ends of}} each main and <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearing.</b> The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radius in most cases is rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which prevents cracks from forming.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearing</b> in high output aircraft piston engines is traced over the period 1915 - 1950 in {{a large number of}} liquid and air cooled engines of both American and European origin. The changes in bearing dimensions are characterized as dimensionless ratios and the resulting changes in the associated weights of rotating and reciprocating parts as weight densities at the <b>crankpin.</b> <b>Bearing</b> materials and developments are presented to indi-cate how they accommodated increasing bearing loads. Bearing loads are characterized by maximum unit bearing pressure and minimum oil film thickness and plotted as a function of time. Most of the data was obtained from the lit-erature but some results were calculated by the author. A technique for evaluating bearing loads is presented for bot...|$|E
40|$|When ship {{diesel engines}} are overhauled, the surface {{renovation}} of crankshaft bearings is of critical importance. Conventionally the crankshaft {{is removed from}} the engine and the subsequent build-up of bearing surfaces and grinding operations are performed in the workshop. New technology has been developed to perform crankshaft <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearing</b> surface grinding directly in the engine housing. This article outlines a further study confirming that the previously adopted grinding platform can be extended to fibre laser build-up welding technology. It is ideally suited to shipboard crankshaft surface renovation and opens up an entirely new dimension in laser build-up welding applications, which offers considerable economic benefits...|$|E
50|$|When new, the tapered Timken <b>crankpin</b> roller <b>bearings</b> {{soon became}} notorious for {{throwing}} their lubricant onto {{the underside of}} the boiler, from where it ran down to the lowest point and dripped onto the coupled wheel tyres along the way. This manufacturer's fault also applied to the Class 25 {{and was one of the}} reasons for the reputation of both classes of being slippery. Timken managed to resolve the problem before all their bearings had been replaced, but by then about two-thirds of the locomotives had already been fitted with redesigned coupling rods with SKF <b>crankpin</b> ball <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} {{the development of}} novel technological equipment for laboratory testing marine diesel engine crankshaft renovation using an in-situ laser cladding device. It outlines the technology and method devised to perform crankpin journal renovation operations directly in the engine housing, without removing the crankshaft from the engine. Firstly it describes marine crankshafts and the common faults of their main and <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearings.</b> There follows an analysis of conventional crankshaft repair methods, along with their limitations. The principles of laser cladding nozzles are then described, outlining the benefits of laser cladding technology for in-situ marine crankshaft repairs. The paper goes on to assess previous studies in field and the laser cladding repair solutions currently proposed for marine crankshafts. It also indicates the view taken by Classification Societies towards laser-cladding crankshaft repairs. The development of the in-situ prototype equipment is detailed, along with full-size prototype design steps, accompanied by the relevant analysis and considerations. In addition, appropriate calculations for the laboratory test device are given. The technological process and method {{described in this article}} are an innovative application of additive manufacturing technology to the crucial requirements of modern, ship-repair enterprises. In-situ crankshaft laser cladding is a promising technology with good financial prospects...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technology}} has been worked out, that permits to carry out one of shipboard diesel engines main and most important devices – crankshaft – repair without removing it from engine. Respectively, {{it is not necessary}} to dismount the whole engine and this innovative technology remarkably reducing the costs of repairs. However, impact of this novel grinding technology to the surface roughness parameters is not jet clear and requires addition scientific analysis. Machining technology and cutting regimes, as well as material of instrument have direct influence to the roughness of surface and consequently to the quality of whole repair. Therefore, to realise this innovation, it is necessary to carry out the additional research of grinding technological regimes impact to the crankshaft main and <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearings</b> (journals) surface formation. The present roughness researches are based on surface two dimensional roughness parameters – simple profile analysis. Nevertheless, in practice any surface has three dimensions, roughness as well. Thusly it is necessary to create new theoretical 3 -D surface model also for crankshaft bearings surfaces. This will allows analysing the full-scale impact of grinding technological regimes influence to the real three-dimensional surface. The optimal 3 -D surface roughness parameters for crankshafts are following: mean arithmetical deviation of surface RaT, and two perpendicular surface spacing parameters between the peaks Sm 1 and Sm 2. Multifactorial research shows individual significance of each technological regime and overall impact to the 3 -D parameter RaT, Sm 1 and Sm 2. Thusly it is possible to locate the most optimal and appropriate grinding technological parameters...|$|R
40|$|New {{technology}} has been developed to permit repair work {{on one of the}} main and most important components of shipboard diesel engines—the crankshaft—without removing it from engine. It is no longer necessary to dismantle the whole engine and as such, this innovative technology significantly reduces repair costs. However, the impact of this novel grinding technology on the surface roughness parameters is not yet clear and requires additional scientific analysis. Machining technology and cutting regimes, as well as the material of the tool being used, all have a direct impact on the surface texture and consequently {{on the quality of the}} repair as a whole. Therefore, to realise this innovation, it is necessary to carry out additional research into the impact of grinding technology parameters on the surface formation of the crankshaft main and <b>crankpin</b> <b>bearings</b> (journals). Current roughness research is usually restricted to two-dimensional surface roughness parameters—simple profile analysis. Nevertheless, in practice any surface has three dimensions, which give it a characteristic texture. It is therefore also necessary to create a new theoretical 3 -D surface model for crankshaft bearings surfaces. This will allow us to analyse the full-scale impact of technological grinding regimes on the actual three-dimensional surface. This study revealed that optimal 3 -D surface roughness (texture) parameters for crankshafts depend upon: the mean arithmetical deviation of the surface, RaT, and two perpendicular surface spacing parameters between the peaks Sm 1 and Sm 2. Multifactorial research shows individual significance of each technological regime and overall impact on the 3 -D parameter RaT, Sm 1 and Sm 2. The approach and methodology adopted for the experiments enabled us to identify the optimal and most appropriate grinding technology parameters...|$|R
