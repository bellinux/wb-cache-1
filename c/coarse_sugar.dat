60|$|The fazienda {{was old and}} {{somewhat}} ruinous. Its prosperity had departed, though plantations of coffee and cocoa still stretched about the rambling white house and dusky laborers' sheds, and a little <b>coarse</b> <b>sugar</b> was made chiefly {{for the sake of}} the resultant rum. Cocoa could no longer be grown there by antiquated methods at a profit, and there had of late been trouble about the labor supply. Standing where it did within easy reach of the coast, the fazienda was open to inspection, and the rulers of that colony had of late been making inquiries as to the way in which the legislation that permitted the planters to engage the negroes brought down from the bush was carried out. Indeed, its owners realized with concern that there was likely to be a change in their ruler's views.

40|$|For {{several years}} {{the authors have}} been using {{magnetic}} particle velocity gauges to study the shock loading of porous HMX (65 and 73 % TMD) of different particle sizes to determine their compaction and initiation characteristics. Because it {{has been difficult to}} separate the effects of compaction and reaction, an inert simulant was needed with properties similar to HMX. Sugar was selected as the simulant for several reasons: (1) the particle size distribution of C and H granulated sugar is similar to the coarse HMX the authors have been using (120 {micro}m average size), (2) the particle size of C and H confectioners (powdered) sugar is similar to the fine HMX in the studies (10 {micro}m average size), (3) it is an organic material, and (4) sugar was readily available. Because the densities of HMX and sugar are somewhat different, the authors chose to do the experiments on sugar compacts at 65 and 73 % TMD. As expected, no reaction was observed in the sugar experiments. Compaction wave profiles were similar to those measured earlier for the HMX, i. e., the compaction waves in the <b>coarse</b> <b>sugar</b> were quite disperse while those in the fine sugar were much sharper.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustrySajid AlaviThis study relates raw {{material}} particulate rheology to the granular flow {{in a single}} screw food extruder. Raw materials based on corn (i. e. meal, flour, and starch), wheat (i. e. farina, flour and starch), and sucrose (i. e. granulated, superfine, and powdered) were used as model particulate systems for the study. Various particulate-scale characteristics and flow parameters of these nine materials were determined using a powder rheometer. Properties such as basic flow energy, cohesion, flow function, and effective {{angle of internal friction}} were good indicators of flowability in an extruder. Corn meal exhibited lower energy requirements and a higher propensity for flow than corn flour (6. 7 mJ/g versus 10. 7 mJ/g, and “free-flowing” versus “cohesive,” according to Flow Function classifications), with wheat farina showing similar results when compared to wheat flour (5. 8 mJ/g versus 7. 9 mJ/g, and “highly free-flowing” versus “cohesive”), although both wheat systems showed lower energy requirements than their comparable corn systems. Sugar, being of a different base material and particle shape, behaved differently than these starch-based materials—flow energy decreased and propensity to flow increased as particle size decreased (51. 7 mJ/g versus 8. 0 mJ/g, and “free flowing” versus “highly free-flowing”). This large energy requirement for <b>coarse</b> <b>sugar</b> particles was attributed more to particle shape than composition, as the sharp edges of sugar can interlock and restrict movement through the sample. The starch-based results were validated in a particulate flow study involving the above model systems (corn meal, corn flour, wheat farina, and wheat flour) in a pilot-scale single screw extruder. Visualization data, obtained using a transparent plexiglass window during extrusion, confirmed that the flours exhibited higher flow energy requirements and a lower flow factor compared to coarser-particle size during extrusion, seen by the increased peak heights and barrel fill. Additionally, moisture changes were analyzed, showing an increase in energy required for starch-based materials as moisture increases and a decrease in energy for sucrose. Due to the hygroscopic nature of sucrose, moisture was absorbed more rapidly than starch products and the edges of individual particles softened, forming a soft solid. These physiochemical differences resulted in decreased energy requirements for sucrose as moisture was increased (51. 7 mJ/g to 13. 6 mJ/g), while corn meal and wheat farina yielded increased energy requirements (6. 7 mJ/g to 9. 1 mJ/g and 5. 8 mJ/g to 9. 5 mJ/g, respectively). Again, results of starch-based materials were validated using a plexiglass cover during extrusion, clearly showing an increase in barrel fill as moisture content increased for both materials, with corn meal flowing more readily than farina. Lastly, temperature of corn meal and farina was increased to show the difference in behavior of starch-based materials, where farina decreased in energy as temperature increased (14. 4 mJ/g to 12. 1 mJ/g) while corn meal energy requirements increased (12. 9 mJ/g to 17. 2 mJ/g). With the results developed from these three experiments, and validated where physically possible, it was concluded that offline powder rheometry is a useful tool for predicting the behavior of food powders. These results were then developed into a computer-simulated model to allow for virtual and visual representation of the conveying action inside an enclosed steel barrel...|$|E

Identification of the microorganisms was performed under stereomicroscopy based on colony morphology of 4904 colonies. The morphological identification was examined by biochemical tests of 94 randomly selected colonies with the macroscopic characteristic of S. mutans and S. sobrinus using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and production of hydrogen peroxide. There was no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) between morphological identification in the SB- 20 M medium and biochemical identification (biotyping). Biotyping confirmed that S. mutans and S. sobrinus colonies were correctly characterized in the SB- 20 M in 95. 8 % and 95. 5 % of the cases, respectively.

40|$|Bacterial {{responses}} to environmental changes {{rely on a}} complex network of biochemical reactions. The properties of the metabolic network determining these responses {{can be divided into}} two groups: the stoichiometric properties, given by the stoichiometry matrix, and the kinetic/thermodynamic properties, given by the rate equations of the reaction steps. The stoichiometry matrix represents the maximal metabolic capabilities of the organism, and the regulatory mechanisms based on the rate laws could be considered as being responsible for the administration of these capabilities. Post-genomic reconstruction of metabolic networks provides us with the stoichiometry matrix of particular strains of microorganisms, but the kinetic aspects of in vivo rate laws are still largely unknown. Therefore, the validity of predictions of cellular responses requiring detailed knowledge of the rate equations is difficult to assert. In this paper, we show that by applying optimisation criteria to the core stoichiometric network of the metabolism of Escherichia coli, and including information about reversibility/irreversibility only of the reaction steps, it is possible to calculate bacterial {{responses to}} growth media with different amounts of glucose and galactose. The target was the minimisation of the number of active reactions (subject to attaining a growth rate higher than a lower limit) and subsequent maximisation of the growth rate (subject to the number of active reactions being equal to the minimum previously calculated). Using this two-level target, we were able to obtain by calculation four fundamental behaviours found experimentally: inhibition of respiration at high glucose concentrations in aerobic conditions, turning on of respiration when glucose decreases, induction of galactose utilisation when the system is depleted of glucose and simultaneous use of glucose and galactose as carbon sources when both sugars are present in low concentrations. Preliminary results of the <b>coarse</b> pattern of <b>sugar</b> utilisation were also obtained with a genome-scale E. coli reconstructed network, yielding similar qualitative results...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that dietary fibre, especially soluble dietary fibre, has beneficial effects and can prevent diseases associated with the modern lifestyle. This has been explained by the viscous effects of soluble fibre, which can reduce or delay the absorption of carbohydrates and fat in the small intestine, resulting in lower blood concentrations of glucose, insulin and cholesterol. Oats, rye, sugar beet fibre and barley, all recognised for their high content of soluble fibre, were investigated in this work. The ability of fibres to form viscous solutions {{is determined by the}} concentration, solubility, the polymer molar mass and aggregate formation. The fibre releasability (solubility) and solution behaviour were analysed under physiological conditions {{to examine the effects of}} processing, the surrounding matrix and gastrointestinal conditions. Less than half of the β-glucans was released from oat bran when analysed with an in vitro method imitating gastrointestinal digestion, and the same was found regarding the release of pectin from <b>coarse</b> particles of <b>sugar</b> beet fibre. Reducing the particle size by milling improved the releasability, while mixing the milled fractions with a solid food matrix (protein, fat or starch) decreased or delayed it. The effect of food processing on barley β-glucan aggregation was studied using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation. Boiling was shown to disrupt the largest aggregates, while higher temperatures also seemed to degrade the polymer chain. Freeze-thaw cycles resulted in cryogelation, which could lead to reduced viscosity. The low pH in the in vitro gastric digestion phase also disrupted the aggregates, but this was followed by re-aggregation/gelation at the neutral pH mimicking the conditions in the small intestine. This may entrap nutrients in the aggregate or gel matrix, thereby reducing absorption. A human study was performed with oats, rye and sugar beet fibre, and mixtures of these three. Fibre-rich meals were optimised to promote high releasability of fibre and retention of aggregates. Changes in traditional biomarkers, as well as in the transcriptome, in response to the fibre-rich meals, were examined in healthy men and women. The postprandial glucose levels were lowered by rye bran, while oat bran lowered the insulin concentrations. The lowering effects may be related to fibre source, the amount of soluble and insoluble fibre and pre-processing of the fibre. In contrast, a spray-dried oat drink increased the postprandial levels of insulin, possibly due to its low fibre content in combination with certain amino acids and a high amount of carbohydrates in the liquid matrix. Women showed, on average, a more pronounced glucose lowering response than men, indicating that different amounts of dietary fibre should be recommended for men and women. Changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the intake of oat bran were investigated with microarray analysis. Gene sets and pathways related to insulin secretion were significantly suppressed in response to the oat bran meal compared with the control meal. In conclusion, many factors may influence the properties of dietary fibre. It is therefore valuable to use in vitro methods to simulate gastrointestinal digestion to characterise and optimise fibre functionality prior to testing their effects on human metabolism and the transcriptome...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the {{carbonaceous}} fraction of ambient aerosols in the Norwegian environment, with a particular focus on the water-soluble carbonaceous fraction. Studies were based on bulk and molecular analysis of the carbonaceous material, where the molecular approach was based on novel high-performance liquid chromatography/highresolution mass spectrometry time-of-flight (HPLC/HRMS-TOF) methodology developed {{as a part of}} the work of the work presented in the thesis. In the following the main findings are summarized. I. The study demonstrated that carbonaceous material was the major fraction of the ambient aerosol mass in the environments investigated, accounting for 46 - 83 % of PM 10. It was shown that parts of the population, living outside the major urban areas, could be exposed to equal (PM 10) and even higher (PM 2. 5) concentrations of combustion derived particulate organic carbon than those living in major cities due to the impact of local sources, such as residential wood burning. Emissions from residential wood burning had a profound influence on the seasonal variation of the carbonaceous material, being 3. 5 times higher during winter compared to summer at the suburban site investigated. The impact of vehicular traffic had a substantial influence on the concentrations of elemental carbon (EC). EC concentrations were up to one order of magnitude higher in the urban areas compared to the suburban area. The relative importance of water-insoluble organic carbon (WINSOC) and water-soluble organic carbon was typically dependent on the prevailing source. WINSOC, along with EC, was most abundant in areas dominated by emissions from vehicular traffic, whereas WSOC dominated in areas where residential wood burning was the prevailing source. The positive sampling artefact of organic carbon (OC) was substantial at all the sit investigated, ranging from 9 – 42 %. The results indicate that water-soluble organic carbon may account for the major part of the positive artefact. Comparing the performance of the two approaches applied, the quarts-behind-Teflon approach provided a more than twofold higher estimate (42 %) of the positive artefact than the quartz-behind-quartz approach (18 %). Converting the positive artefact of OC into organic material, 5. 3 - 26 % of PM 10 could be attributed to vaporous organic material. Failing to account for this artefact could lead to a gross overestimation of the particulate organic carbon, as well as the ambient aerosols mass. II. A novel high-performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry time-offlight (HPLC/HRMS-TOF) method for determination of the monosaccharide anhydrides (MAs) in ambient aerosols was developed. The method offers a new and valuable analytical approach for studies using MAs as tracers for biomass burning, and is less labouring and less time consuming than the currently applied methodology. In addition, this method will increase the diversity of chemical methods available for analysis of MAs, which is important for validation purposes. Finally, HPLC/HRMS and GC/MS are complementary methods, implying that there is a potential to extend the knowledge of the organic aerosol composition. III. Monosaccharide anhydrides (MAs), and in particular levoglucosan, were abundant in the environments investigated, emphasizing the importance of wood burning for residential heating as a source of ambient aerosols. Concentrations of levoglucosan in the range 10 - 1000 ng m- 3 were reported. The mean concentration of levoglucosan accounted for 2. 4 % of the PM 10 mass concentration at the suburban site investigated. The MAs were exclusively associated with fine aerosols, and exhibited a unimodal size distribution characterized by a mode with a maximum at 561 nm. It was demonstrated that the temporal variation of levoglucosan partly is a function of the ambient temperature. Based on levoglucosan measurements, 24 % of the PM 10 mass concentration at the urban site investigated was attributed to emissions from wood burning. Using the AirQUIS dispersion model the corresponding percentage was 50 %. The difference was partly attributed to the rather high emission factor used in the AirQUIS model, which seems to be based on an insufficiently documented assumption of a low burn rate characteristic for Norwegian conditions. IV. The presence of sugars and sugar-alcohols in ambient aerosols were documented in all environments investigated, confirming the ubiquity of primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP). The mean concentration of the sum of the four sugars and the three sugar-alcohols ranged between 21 - 285 ng m- 3 in PM 10 at the sites assessed. However, daily concentrations exceeding 500 ng m- 3 were observed. A seasonal pattern was observed for both sugars and sugar-alcohols, both having peak concentrations during summer and fall. In areas heavily influenced by residential wood burning during winter, the mean concentration of individual sugars was found to equal the concentrations reported during summer. Sugars and sugar-alcohols were mainly associated with <b>coarse</b> aerosols, but <b>sugars</b> in the fine mode were found to make a substantial contribution during winter, spring and early summer. It is argued that ruptured pollen may be a significant source of sugars in the fine aerosol. Moreover, in areas influenced by residential wood burning, sugars and sugar-alcohols were predominantly associated with fine aerosols. High levels of highly sugar containing honeydew were found to be deposited on the leaves and on the ground underneath the canopy of threes. However, it remains to study to what extent this is entrained into the atmosphere, and if so, what are their size distribution dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|R
