However, {{in the years}} 1856-1861 and 1870-1872, Thornton authored a significantly higher than average number of dispatches; most notably, in the years 1860 and 1861, Thornton composed eighty-eight and seventy, respectively. Since 1856, it is evident - due to the large increase of Thornton signatures and handwriting in the minute papers and dispatches - that his responsibilities had increased at the Department of Public Works. The content in dispatches and then later minute papers ranged from one- or two-page documents <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> <b>of</b> store <b>deliveries,</b> and extensions for public service appointments, and a letter of acknowledgment, to hefty fifty-page documents concerned with serious policy issues such as trade, defense and public infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|The Surabaya Glory Motor {{company was}} one of {{retailers}} in sales of spare parts and agriculture engines. The consumers it targeted as end users ranged from the middle to the lower classes, who were very sensitive to price fluctuations. To win the sale competition, the company was applying a strategy of cost leadership enabling it to set prices lower than those offered by its competitors. To secure profits despite the lower prices, it had to keep the principal costs of production down as low as possible. The research used a descriptive method to describe the problems the Surabaya Glory Motor company {{had to deal with}} in the application of a manufacturing information system. The data were gathered thought interviews, study documents, and observations. The results of the analysis indicated that the system preferred so far had led to failure to keep the <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> time agreed with buyers. Delays in obtaining confirmation of consignment dates was attributed to the lack of employees able to ensure rapid procurement of goods. Difficulty in identifying correct names of products for the compilation of a purchase order, inconsistent quality of products, frequent overstock and stockout, dualism in job descriptions lowered job satisfication among employees. Discussions {{in the course of this}} research had produced an improved design of a model of manufacturing information system suitable to support the application of the cost leadership strategy. The newly designed model was meant to help the company solve the problems it was facing. By this arrangement, data fed to the database were then queried and normalized by several stages generating a subsystem of output useful to users. The data passed into the database comprised accounting information system, industrial engineering subsystem, and manufacture Intelligence subsystem. The resultant data output consisted of subsystems of production, inventory, quality, and costs. The accounting information system consisted of letters of requests for goods, requests for purchases, purchase orders, list of purchase order numbers, and letters of return. The industrial engineering subsystem consisted of standard operational procedures, letter of job instructions, details of warehouse capacity, standards of hours per man per unit, diagram of process paces, bills of materials, coding scheme, standard criteria of evaluation, quality check sheets, and layout of production floors, Manufacturing intelligence subsystem passed into the database was made up of collections of intelligence concerning supplies, trade unions, and market surveys. Output of production subsystem comprised master production schedules, material requirement planning, letters ofjob orders, report on work results, receipts of incoming goods, and delivery schedules. The output subsystem of supplies constituted a stock card. The quality subsystem comprised packaging inspection results, quality product examination results, and quality check sheets. The cost subsystem output came out of the principal production expenses. Output of data produced by the database would reduce elements of work movement by users so that the lime needed to complete a particular task could be minimized (theory about motion and time study) and the number of employees could be reduced in addition, there would he no longer need for a large supply of essential materials (theory about just in time) as the arrival schedules of those necessities had been adjusted to the lead lime of suppliers and to the production capacity ol the company, Thus the newly designed model of manufacturing information system would prove supportive for the application by the Surabaya Glory Motor company of an improved strategy of cost leadership...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Bone-marrow derived endothelial {{progenitor}} cells (EPCs) play {{an important}} role in tumor neovasculature. Due to their tumor homing property, EPCs are regarded as promising targeted vectors for delivering therapeutic agents in cancer treatment. Consequently, non-invasive <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> targeted <b>delivery</b> via imaging is urgently needed. This study shows the development and application of a novel dual-modality probe for in vivo non-invasively tracking of the migration, homing and differentiation of EPCs. Methods: The paramagnetic/near-infrared fluorescence probe Conjugate 1 labeled EPCs were systemically transplanted into mice bearing human breast MDA-MB- 231 tumor xenografts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging were performed at different stages of tumor development. The homing of EPCs and the tumor neovascularization were further evaluated by immunofluorescence. Results: Conjugate 1 labeled EPCs can be monitored in vivo by MRI and NIR fluorescence optical imaging without altering tumor growth for up to three weeks after the systemic transplantation. Histopathological examination confirmed that EPCs were recruited into the tumor bed and then incorporated into new vessels two weeks after the transplantation. Tumor size and microvessel density was not influenced by EPCs transplantation in the first three weeks. Conclusions: This preclinical study shows the feasibility of using a MRI and NIR fluorescence optical imaging detectabl...|$|R

All studies were approved by IACUC. C. novyi-NT were labeled with hybrid iron-oxide Texas red nanoparticles. Growth of labeled and control samples were evaluated with optical density. Labeling was confirmed with confocal fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). MRI were performed using a 7 Tesla scanner with T 2 *-weighted (T 2 *W) sequence. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurements were performed for phantoms and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements performed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice (n =  12) with Panc 02 xenografts before and after percutaneous injection of iron-oxide labeled C. novyi-NT. MRI was repeated 3 and 7 days post-injection. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Prussian blue and Gram staining of tumor specimens were performed for <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> intra-tumoral <b>delivery.</b> Iron-oxide labeling had no influence upon C. novyi-NT growth. The signal intensity (SI) within T 2 *W images was significantly decreased for iron-oxide labeled C. novyi-NT phantoms compared to unlabeled controls. Under confocal fluorescence microscopy, the iron-oxide labeled C. novyi-NT exhibited a uniform red fluorescence consistent with observed regions of DAPI staining and overall labeling efficiency was 100 % (all DAPI stained C. novyi-NT exhibited red fluorescence). Within TEM images, a large number iron granules were observed within the iron-oxide labeled C. novyi-NT; these were not observed within unlabeled controls. Intra-procedural MRI measurements permitted in vivo visualization of the intra-tumoral distribution of iron-oxide labeled C. novyi-NT following percutaneous injection (depicted as punctate regions of SI reductions within T 2 *-weighted images); tumor SNR decreased significantly following intra-tumoral injection of C. novyi-NT (p< 0. 05); these SNR reductions were maintained at 3 and 7 day follow-up intervals. Prussian blue and Gram staining confirmed presence of the iron-oxide labeled anaerobes.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Confirmation</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} <b>delivery</b> {{accuracy in}} stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of lung tumors suggests {{the possibility of}} treatment margin, or aperture reduction. In this investigation, the dose delivery to lung tumors using SBRT techniques was verified, and the feasibility of normal tissue sparing via aperture reduction or altered prescription isodose line was assessed. Methods: Planned and delivered doses to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) were compared for 10 patients using planning CT and conebeam CT image. Potential for reduction in normal tissue dose were assessed using 2 alternate treatment plans – reduced PTVs and alternate prescription techniques. Plans were assessed using conformity index, homogeneity index and the ratio of 50 % / 100 % isodose volumes (R 50 %). Results: The planned and delivered mean doses were consistent to within 4 %. However, the mean dose delivered to the GTV exceeded the prescription dose (Rx) by 19 % and is consistent with our planning technique of prescribing to the 80 % isodose line. When reducing treatment margins and retaining a constant dose-volume constraint, block margins had to be increased which produced a constant effective field aperture outside of the GTV. Prescription to a lower isodose line using stereotactic-like planning techniques yielded the only method by which {{the volume of the}} prescription isodose could be affected, although this yielded increases in normal tissue dose due to the increased monitor units required. Conversely, conventional prescription techniques using wider field apertures were effective in reducing absolute values of normal tissue dose. Although dose conformity was similar across different prescription isodose lines, homogeneity index and R 50 % values were significantly different in the 60 %- 70 % prescription isodose line plans than the 80 %, 90 % prescription plans. Conclusion: Traditional margin reduction techniques did not affect a reduction in the volume of normal tissue irradiated to the prescribed dose. Prescribing to low isodose lines yields reduced volumes of the prescribed dose, but at the expense of normal tissue dose.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Communication has {{developed}} during the years and is discussed to have become a central part in marketing, since {{it can be seen}} as the process where a company try to communicate the value of a product or a service to an end consumer. A relatively new way of communication is through the use of technology and internet, which has given companies new opportunities to communicate. Today does more than 91 percent of the Swedish population have access to internet. Businesses sees the online space as an opportunity to capture customers attention, which has lead to an increase in online businesses, also called e-commerce. It is more common than ever to shop online but the phenomenon can be seen as relatively new and therefore with potential risks that can affect consumers trust towards shopping online. A few studies have been done within the field of trust in e-commerce, however are there a lack of studies that suggests what variables that contributes to trust before a purchase, during purchase and after purchase. This thesis do therefore attempt to describe what it is that contributes to the perception of trust in e-commerce and which trust variables that are important throughout the purchase process online. This thesis is a qualitative research with a descriptive design. Based on theory about trust in e- commerce and the three purchase phases was a focus group guide designed in order to obtain data from six focus groups. The sample frame consisted of three age groups, which are based on statistics of online shopping behaviour. The study showed that trust plays an essential part when shopping online and that there are several variables that contributes to trust. Before an online purchase was it shown that variables such as word of mouth, information search, web design and delivery information is important. During the online purchase was information regarding price, delivery, return and payment but also safe transaction of personal information important in order to feel trust, where the online payment seemed to matter the most.
