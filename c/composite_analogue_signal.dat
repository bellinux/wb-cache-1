40|$|Subcarrier {{multiplexing}} (SCM) is {{an attractive}} multiplexing technique to deliver broadband services over optical fibres. The majority of existing systems employ an analogue signal for optical transmission and therefore the performance of these systems are limited. This paper proposes to improve SCM system performance by converting the analogue SCM signal into a pulse time modulated signal for optical transmission. A prototype system has been built where a PAL video signal, two audio signals and a data signal form the <b>composite</b> <b>analogue</b> <b>signal.</b> The pulse time modulation techniques investigated are pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and square wave frequency modulation (SWFM). System measurements and theoretical predictions were obtained {{and they are in}} close agreement. We have improved the dynamic range and optical power budget considerably, compared to conventional systems...|$|E

CTIA/GTIA also controls Player/Missile Graphics (aka sprites) functionality including collision detection between displayed objects (Players, Missiles, and ANTIC's Playfield), display priority control over objects, and color/luminance control of all displayed objects. CTIA/GTIA outputs separate digital luminance and chrominance signals, which are mixed to form an <b>analogue</b> <b>composite</b> video <b>signal.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{rest of the}} <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were {{switched}} off permanently just after midnight on 9 September 2009. Once the digital signals were reshuffled {{to take advantage of}} the space left by the {{switched off}} <b>analogue</b> <b>signals,</b> they were then brought up to full power (digital signals were broadcast at a much lower power pre-switchover).

50|$|It was {{announced}} that Ceefax would not be replaced when the <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> was switched off in October 2012. The BBC Red Button service {{is seen as an}} alternative to Ceefax and since 2007 the number of regions with a Ceefax supported <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> had declined as digital switchover progressed across the UK. As of the end of 2011, three quarters of the UK TV regions had completed or {{were in the process of}} being switched over.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} factors affect how precise a signal is, mainly the noise present in the {{original}} signal and the noise added by processing (see signal-to-noise ratio). Fundamental physical limits such as the shot noise in components limits the resolution of <b>analogue</b> <b>signals.</b> In digital electronics additional precision is obtained by using additional digits to represent the signal. The practical limit {{in the number of}} digits is determined by the performance of the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), since digital operations can usually be performed without loss of precision. The ADC takes an <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> and changes it into a series of binary numbers. The ADC may be used in simple digital display devices, e. g., thermometers or light meters but it may also be used in digital sound recording and in data acquisition. However, a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) is used to change a digital <b>signal</b> to an <b>analogue</b> <b>signal.</b> A DAC takes a series of binary numbers and converts it to an <b>analogue</b> <b>signal.</b> It is common to find a DAC in the gain-control system of an op-amp which in turn may be used to control digital amplifiers and filters.|$|R
50|$|From {{midnight on}} 31 October 2012, <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> were {{switched}} off in Delhi and Mumbai. Pirated signals {{were available in}} parts of Delhi even after the date. In Kolkata, on 30 October 2012, the state government refused to switch off <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> citing low penetration of set-top boxes (STBs) required for receiving digital signals. The I&B Ministry did not push for switching off of <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> in Kolkata. After approximately the Centre estimated that 75% of Kolkata households had installed STBs, the ministry issued a directive to stop airing analogue channels {{in some parts of}} the city beginning 16 December and completely switch off <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> after 27 December. On 17 December 2012, the West Bengal government openly defied the directive and stated that it would not implement it. The state government then announced that it would extend the deadline to 15 January 2013. The I&B ministry had initially threatened to cancel the license of multi system operators (MSOs) in Kolkata if they did not switch off all analogue channels. However, the ministries softened their stand following a letter from MSOs, explaining how it they were sandwiched between divergent orders from the Central and State Governments.|$|R

50|$|<b>Analogue</b> <b>signals</b> {{can also}} be {{converted}} into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings. In that case the analogue video camera must be plugged directly into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then converts the <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> to digital. These cards are relatively cheap, but inevitably the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) {{in order for the}} video recordings to be saved on a continuous basis.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands {{the public}} {{broadcasters}} used PALplus until 2005 but have stopped using {{it because they}} preferred digital television (anamorphic widescreen) over PALplus. The public broadcasters and all the major commercial stations have a policy of broadcasting their own and new shows in widescreen, this isn't converted to PALplus on the <b>analogue</b> <b>signal</b> of the cable operators. As cable is the most widespread form of receiving television in the Netherlands the system isn't used anymore. Terrestrial <b>analogue</b> <b>signals</b> stopped in November 2006 in this country.|$|R
