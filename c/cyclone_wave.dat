40|$|The Pilbara {{coast is}} {{affected}} by both intense tropical cyclones directing storm surges and high waves from the N and NW, and tsunamis generated off Indonesia. Wrack lines of shell and other skeletal material commonly occur not only 2 – 5 m above Australian Height Datum (AHD) but also up to 10 m AHD. They occur in distinct bands and may be continuous for several kilometres but are usually disjunct for tens of kilometres. This study assesses the potential use of wrack lines to identify extreme high water levels preserved on the coast. Elevated wrack lines occur on open coast dunes, storm bars, cheniers and spits and along lagoonal shores. Twelve wrack line assemblages were identified for the last 2500 years, with eight reported at more than one site and ≥ 5 m AHD. Six sites contain wrack lines ≥ 8 m AHD, and three reach 10 m AHD, higher than any historical tsunami inundation in the region. Ten wrack lines are found at 5 – 8 m AHD, and extend beyond {{the upper end of}} any reported storm and <b>cyclone</b> <b>wave</b> heights.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{series of}} 2 -week {{predictions}} {{were made with}} a general circulation model for 12 winter cases selected from the period 1964 - 69. All were January cases. The same prediction model-the most sophisticated and probably the most realistic model of those we tested in 1967 -was used throughout. The model was hemispheric and had an N= 40 grid (grid size of about 270 km at midlatitudes) with nine vertical levels. A {{detailed description of the}} model’s performance is attempted by making statistical analyses of the forecast results compared with observed data. The analyses also provide useful insight into the dynamical behavior of the long waves in the middle latitude zone. The verification study reveals the practical limit of predictability with the 1967 version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. For example, the correlation coefficient between prediction and observation of the 500 -mb geopotential deviation from January normal stays above zero until the 10 th day.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in fully understanding the complex wave fields produced by intense tropical cyclones is having sufficient data to fully define the spatial wave field in such systems. Although the in situ data set is increasing, it is still quite limited and does not cover {{the full range of}} possible tropical cyclone parameters. One way to address this problem is to use remote sensing data obtained from satellites. Radar altimeters on such satellites have now been in operation for more than 25 years. Such a data set is used to investigate the wave field within tropical cyclones. The full data set consists of the over flight by an altimeter of a total of 440 tropical cyclones. As such, the data set is the most extensive ever obtained under tropical cyclone conditions. Using this data set, a parametric model for the wave field is developed. The analysis confirms that the most extreme waves are generated to the right (northern hemisphere) of the storm, where the waves generated tend to move forward with the storm. As such, they experience an extended fetch. This concept is used in conjunction with JONSWAP scaling to develop a parametric model which can be used to predict the tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>wave</b> field. This model is then used in conjunction with in situ data to provide an estimate of the wave spectrum at any point in the spatial wave field. This approach provides a very valuable approach for preliminary design and extreme value studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the {{first use of}} a stochastic cyclone model (SCM) to quantify the extreme significant wave height from tropical cyclones across the Southwest Pacific Ocean. The median extreme significant wave heights across the entire SW Pacific Ocean were 7. 5, 10 and 11 m for annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs) of 0. 1, 0. 02 and 0. 01 respectively. Maximum significant wave heights in the region were approximately 1. 5 times these values for the same AEP. Tables of extreme significant wave heights are provided for selected inhabited locations. The SCM was used to quantify {{the effects of the}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on extreme significant wave heights, and also the effects of projected climate change on cyclone intensity and frequency of occurrence. West of the International Dateline in the region of the Vanuatu archipelago, the extreme <b>cyclone</b> <b>wave</b> climate was relatively consistent during all phases of the ENSO cycle, but highest during El Niño. Cyclone formation and propagation eastward of the Dateline are more likely to occur during El Niño conditions, however these cyclones tended to be more intense, particularly during extreme El Niño events, leading to a higher long-term extreme wave climate in the eastern SW Pacific, despite the relatively low cyclone observation rate there. Simulations of climate change cyclone intensity increases of 10 – 20 % of the most intense cyclones (categories 4 and 5) along with 10 – 20 % reduction in number of cyclones indicated little change in extreme significant wave heights for low-occurrence AEPs of 1 / 20 or less. These changes were much less than induced by present-day ENSO variability, suggesting that future changes in extreme wave climate will be sensitive to climate change influences on the frequency and intensity of ENSO events. These results are significant in the light of indications that the frequency of extreme El Nino events might double in response to greenhouse warming...|$|E
40|$|Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are in {{many regions}} {{responsible}} for severe damages and {{a great number of}} casualties, resulting from the severe wind speeds, rainfall, wave heights and storm surges. The recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma are examples of the great devastation that can be caused by a single event, and of the insufficient level of preparedness that is currently present to withstand the adverse effects of such an event. Even in the U. S., which suffers relatively frequently from TCs, and has an extensive track record of historical events, the consequences of Harvey were unforeseen and destructive. Difficulties in determining extreme TC conditions, whether these are rain, wind, wave or storm surge conditions, mostly come from the fact that severe adverse effects caused by TCs are very local. This is the case because the exact track, intensity and size of the storm determine to a large extent which area is affected the most, and what the consequences are for the hydraulic conditions. Small variations in any of these parameters can greatly influence the conditions at any location. This is already the case in regions which suffer relatively often from TCs. In regions that do not suffer as regularly from TCs, data scarcity makes it even more difficult to anticipate adverse consequences. In these regions TCs are nevertheless often responsible for the most severe conditions, and the effects of such events should therefore be quantified in order be able to prepare for such conditions. For extreme <b>cyclone</b> <b>wave</b> conditions specifically, there is an additional problem of feasibly determining extreme wave conditions from cyclone wind conditions. This research presents the Tropical Cyclone Wind Statistical Estimation Tool (TCWiSE) to determine extreme TC wind speeds and focuses on the determination of its accuracy in data scarce regions. The tool was developed by applying it in a case study in the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover a brief qualitative assessment of the available TC wave models has been performed in order to identify an adequate method to determine extreme TC wave conditions from TC wind conditions...|$|E

40|$|Principal objective. Tropical {{cyclones}} periodically {{cross the}} Great Barrier Reef (GBR), generating large waves that cause structural damage to reef communities, ranging from broken corals to removal of entire sections of substrate. Over time, repeated impacts can significantly alter coral reef community structure. Thus, effective {{management of the}} GBR requires {{an understanding of the}} cyclone disturbance regime (which reefs are likely to be affected and how often). The primary objective {{of this study was to}} characterise the tropical cyclone disturbance regime in the GBR over the past three and one-half decades (1969 - 2003). Methods. The spatial distribution of cyclone damage over time across even single reefs for most of the GBR is poorly known. Though cyclone disturbance patterns operate over century time scales and 100 s of km space scales, most studies have examined single storm events across a few reefs or many storm events for a single reef. Further, detailed observations of cyclone damage to reefs in the GBR are rare. Examining the impacts of cyclones over time thus required reconstructing a likely disturbance history from what information was available. Meteorological models were used to hindcast the likely magnitude and distribution of cyclone winds from the meteorological record. This hindcast energy, along with measures of the spatial patterning of reefs, was linked statistically to field observations of reef damage to predict the distribution of cyclone disturbance of areas not surveyed. This was done for eight types (coral breakage, debris scars, soft coral stripping, trenching, sand movement, removal of intact slabs, dislodgement of massive corals, and exfoliation) and seven severities (presence versus absence of: damage of any type, damage of each type, severe damage of any type, total damage score, maximum severity of damage, total damage score across low-energy damage types, total damage score across high-energy damage types) of damage. Of these models, those that were successful were then used to predict the spatial distribution of cyclone damage of various types across the GBR for each of the 85 cyclones that passed nearby from 1969 - 2003. The timing of predicted cyclone damage was then examined at each of 24, 224 individual reef sites across the region, and trends were summarized by one-degree latitude by one-degree longitude blocks. Results and conclusions Four types / severities of <b>cyclone</b> <b>wave</b> damage (coral breakage, dislodgement of massive corals, exfoliation and severe [widespread] damage of any type) were successfully modeled using a mix of cyclone energy (maximum and duration of high winds) and reef vulnerability (geomorphologic type, slope, normal wave exposure) parameters. For these, on average, the most recent predicted cyclone damage event (measured from 2003) occurred less recently that what was typical over the entire time series. This suggests that coral communities have had more time to recover since the last cyclone disturbance than would normally be the case, which could mean that present measures of broad community structure are not indicative of past conditions (i. e. coral coverage may be higher at present than normal). Overall, the timing of predicted damage indicates that cyclone disturbance of the GBR is most likely intermediate in nature – coral communities at most reef sites would have had time to recover between subsequent cyclone disturbances only some of the time over the period 1969 - 2003. Finally, reefs in the far northern GBR were generally disturbed less frequently than elsewhere...|$|E

An offset in discrete angles creates more uniform diffusive characteristics. And, a transformed spherical coordinate system allows for more efficient grid sizes and smaller grid dependent refraction.

40|$|The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to test the validity of quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics, compared to primitive equation (PE) dynamics for modeling the effect of <b>cyclone</b> <b>waves</b> on the larger scale flow, and to study the formation of frontal cyclones and the dynamics of occluded frontogenesis. In order to extend the realism of the initial conditions over those used in earlier work of this nature and in order to include strong surface frontal zones in the initial conditions, a horizontal resolution on the order of 100 km between gridpoints is needed. In order to allow for integrations of up to two weeks simulated time and to keep the logistics and cost of the runs feasible, the horizontal domain of the models must be reduced. Based on work concerning polar lows, the tropospheric static stability was reduced and was also allowed to vary in different tropospheric layers.

40|$|The National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1 's) {{simulation}} {{of the modern}} arctic climate is evaluated by comparing a five-year seasonal cycle simulation with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global analyses. The sea level pressure (SLP), storm tracks, vertical cross section of height, 500 -hPa height, total energy budget, and moisture budget are analyzed to investigate the biases in the simulated arctic climate. The {{results show that the}} model simulates anomalously low SLP, too much storm activity, and anomalously strong baroclinicity to the west of Greenland and vice versa to the east of Greenland. This bias is mainly attributed to the model's topographic representation of Greenland. First, the broadened Greenland topography in the model distorts the path of <b>cyclone</b> <b>waves</b> over the North Atlantic Ocean. Second, the model oversimulates the ridge over Greenland, which intensifies its blocking effect and steers the <b>cyclone</b> <b>waves</b> clockwise around it and hence produces an artificial circum-Greenland trough. These biases are significantly alleviated when the horizontal resolution increases to T 42. Over the Arctic basin, the model simulates large amounts of low-level (stratus) clouds in winter and almost no stratus in summer, which is opposite to the observations. This bias is mainly due to the location of the simulated SLP features and the negative anomaly of storm activity, which prevent the transport of moisture into this region during summer but favor this transport in winter. The moisture budget analysis shows that the model's net annual precipitation (P-E) between 70 deg N and the North Pole is 6. 6 times larger than the observations and the model transports six times more moisture into this region. The bias in the advection term is attributed to the positive moisture fixer scheme and the distorted flow pattern. However, the excessive moisture transport into the Arctic basin does not solely result from the advection term. The contribution by the moisture fixer is as large as from advection. By contrast, the semi-Lagrangian transport scheme used in the CCM 2 significantly improves the moisture simulation for this region; however, globally the error is as serious as for the positive moisture fixer scheme. Finally, because the model has such serious problems in simulating the present arctic climate, its simulations of past and future climate change for this region are questionable...|$|R

First, by means of observation-based, gridded daily temperature, precipitation, and remotely sensed data, as well as utilizing a climatological rain–snow threshold (RST) temperature method, the precipitation regime of Utah was scrutinized. Second, a comprehensive synoptic analysis was conducted as an alternate means that is independent from surface observations.

Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.

First, by means of observation-based, gridded daily temperature and precipitation data and, utilizing a climatological rain-snow threshold (RST) temperature method, the breakdown of the hydroclimate regime indicates that the proportion of precipitation falling as snow has decreased by 7 % during the last half century. Meanwhile observed snow depth has decreased by 35 % across Utah - an observation supported by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo as measured from satellites. Second, a comprehensive synoptic analysis was also conducted as an alternate, yet independent means that is distinct from surface observational analysis: Weather systems that have the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number, with those leading to snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.
