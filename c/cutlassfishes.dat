50|$|Despite its {{relatively}} small size, the {{sharpnose sevengill shark}} is considered a top predator in the ecosystem it inhabits. At the Great Meteor Seamount in the eastern Atlantic, this species feeds primarily on teleosts and cephalopods, {{and to a lesser}} extent on small cartilaginous fishes. Off Tunisia, crustaceans are the second-most common prey taken after teleosts. Off Australia, this species consumes mostly teleosts, with smaller individuals taking mainly Lepidorhynchus denticulatus and larger individuals taking increasing numbers of snake mackerels and <b>cutlassfishes.</b> It is a strong-swimming species, with feeding and activity level increasing at night.

50|$|Although often {{considered}} a single highly widespread species, {{it has been}} argued that it is a species complex that includes several species with the main groups being in the Atlantic (Atlantic <b>cutlassfish),</b> East Pacific (Pacific <b>cutlassfish),</b> Indo-Pacific and Northwest Pacific (Japanese <b>cutlassfish).</b> If split, the Atlantic would retain the scientific name T. lepturus. The Northwest Pacific (Sea of Japan and East China Sea) differs in morphometrics, meristics and genetics, and is sometimes recognized as T. japonicus. Morphometric and meristic differences have also been shown in the population of the East Pacific (California to Peru), leading some to recognize it as T. nitens. Additional studies are required on the possible separation and nomenclature of the Indo-Pacific populations, but based on mtDNA there are three species in this region: T. japonicus (marginal in the region, see range above), T. lepturus (West Pacific; the species also found in the Atlantic) and the final preliminarily referred to as Trichiurus sp. 2 (Indian Ocean, and East and South China Seas). The names T. coxii and T. haumela have been used for the populations off Australia and in the Indo-Pacific, respectively, but firm evidence supporting their validity as species is lacking.|$|R

40|$|Age {{and growth}} of two species of <b>cutlassfishes,</b> Trichiurus spp. (Trichiuridae), from the South China Sea were examined. Between December 1996 and November 1997, 1495 {{specimens}} were collected from coastal waters near Hong Kong. Two species, Trichiurus lepturus and T. nanhaiensis, were harvested and ages of specimens were estimated by using transverse sections of the sagittal otoliths. Opaque growth rings were verified to have formed annually during February. Lee's phenomenon was not observed for either species, although T. lepturus tended to display reverse Lee's phenomenon. Otolith weight was linearly related to age, and accounted for about 72 % and 76 % {{of the variation in}} age (t) for T. lepturus and ir: nanhaiensis, respectively, comparable to the von Bertalanffy growth models in preanal length (PL).

40|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on two piscivore species of <b>cutlassfishes</b> (Trichiuridae) that show some degree of {{differences}} in morphology of the jaw system: Aphanopus carbo and Trichiurus lepturus. As studies dealing with myological features of A. carbo and T. lepturus are presently lacking, we first provide {{a detailed description of}} the head musculature of A. carbo and T. lepturus. Secondly, {{we focus on}} the mechanics of the mouth closing system of these trichiurids by using biomechanical modelling. More specifically, models allows us to: (1) describe the differences between how the lower jaw lever system works during mouth closure and during generating static bite force; (2) evaluate the effects of morphological change on the performance of both functions; (3) determine whether the configuration of each component of the lower jaw lever system is a compromise between both functions, or whether there is a partition of function (optimization for either hard biting or fast jaw closing) between the different parts of the jaw closing musculature; and (4) discuss the dynamical implications of having elongate jaws for capturing prey. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 152, 717 – 736.
