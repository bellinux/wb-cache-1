50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a <b>cross-wound</b> package.|$|E

During unwinding there appear {{forces in the}} yarn that are approximately proportional to {{the square of the}} unwinding velocity. During unwind the yarn tension is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross wound packages, where the yarn is being withdrawn with a high velocity {{in the direction of the}} package axis. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension does not exceed a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn still can break sometimes. This is why we think that a <b>cross-wound</b> package is not an ideal form of a package and that such packages are not always made without flaws...|$|E
40|$|A <b>cross-wound</b> {{electrical}} heater comprising two resistance coils wound together with opposite pitches electrically connected at their crossing points, is reported. Each element is supplied by a separate power {{supply of the}} same magnitude, and each power supply is isolated from reverse currents by a diode. Failure {{of one of the}} windings results in only a moderate change in output power...|$|E
40|$|To {{create an}} energy {{efficient}} vehicle {{there are a}} number of aspects that need to be optimized, namely; the drive train of the vehicle and energy source, aerodynamics and weight. Focusing on weight reduction, while still maintaining the desired performance and structural strength, many manufacturers are turning to advanced composites due to their superior strength to weight characteristics. Solar car racing provides a research platform that drives this innovation through technology development and efficiency. A lightweight vehicle suspension system design is being presented, together with an introduction into future testing. A suspension system is made up of a number of critical components which are dynamically loaded during standard operation due to undulating forces imposed by the road surface. Unidirectional <b>cross-wound</b> carbon fiber tubing is used for suspension and steering arms. The tubing is interfaced with small steel inserts and pivoting arm tie rod ends. Concerns within the design are the adhesive bonding of the carbon tubing to the steel inserts, and what type of tensile loading the interface can withstand. Due to forces imposed on the system during cornering and shock loading the components are required to withstand a minimum of 1. 2 times the weight of the overall vehicle, i. e. 258 kg. Tensile test results show that the mechanical properties of the adhesive joints rely somewhat on the surface characteristics and bond preparation. The target load of 258 kg was successfully obtained under static loading for two types of sample sets. The first based on the standard for describing the lap shear strength of adhesively bonded carbon fiber to aluminum, and the second based on the working component itself...|$|E
