5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> variable extent.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Ladies may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the circlet (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the Order; {{the former is}} shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment {{and a better}} seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler. As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted <b>Collar</b> <b>of</b> Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E

5|$|On {{the upright}} <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{decided to}} give the {{rhinoceros}} {{as a gift to}} the Medici Pope Leo X. The King was keen to curry favour with the Pope, to maintain the papal grants of exclusive possession to the new lands that his naval forces had been exploring in the Far East since Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India around Africa in 1498. The previous year, the Pope had been very pleased with Manuel's gift of a white elephant, also from India, which the Pope had named Hanno. Together with other precious gifts of silver plate and spices, the rhinoceros, with its new <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> green velvet decorated with flowers, embarked in December 1515 for the voyage from the Tagus to Rome. The vessel passed near Marseille in early 1516. King Francis I of France was returning from Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume in Provence, and requested a viewing of the beast. The Portuguese vessel stopped briefly at an island off Marseilles, where the rhinoceros disembarked to be beheld by the King on 24 January.|$|E
5|$|The Erpingham Gate is {{the primary}} {{entrance}} to the north section of the Close, directly opposite the west door of the cathedral. It was commissioned by Sir Thomas Erpingham, a commander in the Battle of Agincourt and was constructed between 1416 and 1425. The top of the arch contains a canopied niche which is thought originally to have been dedicated to the Five Holy Wounds of Christ, flanked by the Four Evangelists and with the Holy Trinity above, but was replaced in the 18th century with a kneeling statue of Erpingham wearing armour and surcoat with a <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> Esses and the Order of the Garter below his left knee. The rest of the gateway is decorated with the coat of arms of Erpingham and members of his family, together with his motto yenk (think) on small scrolls. It has been restored several times: first in the 18th century, then by E. W. Tristram in 1938 and again by Feilden and Mawson in 1989. It is a scheduled monument and adjoins School House and the Music School, which occupy 70 and 71 The Close respectively.|$|E
5|$|The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{is much larger}} than the female (the reeve), and has a {{breeding}} plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas.|$|E
50|$|Rank {{insignia}} for lieutenants are gold bars worn on the <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> {{the shirt}} and {{the shoulders of}} the jacket. Rank insignia for sergeants are gold chevrons worn on the <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> the shirt and embroidered chevrons worn on the upper sleeves of shirts and jackets. Tenured officers will have gold hash-marks or stars on the lower left side of their long-sleeved shirts and jackets. Each mark represents five years of service. A star represents twenty years of service.|$|R

5|$|There are 76memorials in the church. These {{include the}} 14th-century tomb of Ralph Davenport with the {{recumbent}} {{figure of a}} knight wearing plate armour with a gorget (<b>collar)</b> <b>of</b> mail (armour consisting of linked metal rings) and a conical helmet, a tomb chest of 1654, and a recumbent effigy (statue) of LadyEgerton, who died in 1599. The church also contains two sanctuary chairs and six old chests, {{one of which is}} iron-bound and dates from the 13thcentury. There is a ring of eight bells, six of which were recast in 1925 by Taylor's of Loughborough from the metal of the previous four 17th-century bells. The other two bells were added in 1998 and were also supplied by Taylors. The organ was made by J.J.Binns for King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent in 1912. It was presented to the church by Stoke City Council in 1962 and was rebuilt and installed by Reeves and Merner. The parish registers begin in 1572 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1711, but the latter are incomplete.|$|E

5000|$|RAF officer cadets wear white gorget {{patches on}} their service dress and mess dress uniforms. Very similar collar patches are worn by British army officer cadets at Sandhurst on the standup <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> their dark-blue [...] "Number One" [...] dress uniforms. These {{features}} of modern uniforms are a residual survival {{from the earlier}} practice of suspending the actual gorgets from ribbons attached to buttons on both <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> the uniform. Such buttons were often mounted {{on a patch of}} coloured cloth or gold embroidery.|$|R
