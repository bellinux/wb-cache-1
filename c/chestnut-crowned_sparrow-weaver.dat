50|$|The {{park has}} more than 300 bird species, {{more than half of}} all the bird species that have been {{recorded}} in the Gambia. Some of the park's bird species have a very local distribution and are rarely observed in other locations in the Gambia. There are 21 birds of prey, including eagle, falcon, harrier, hawk, and vulture species. There are quite a large number of birds of prey in the park during the dry season. Other bird species in the park include ten kingfisher species, the ground-hornbill, and the threatened brown-necked parrot (Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis), which breeds in the park's mangroves. Other bird species include white-fronted black-chat (Myrmecocichla albifrons), Dorst's cisticola (Cisticola guinea), Burchell's courser (Cursorius rufus), brown-rumped bunting (Emberiza affinis) and <b>chestnut-crowned</b> <b>sparrow-weaver</b> (Plocepasser superciliosus), which have restricted distributions in the Gambia. The bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), a short tailed eagle species, is the park's official symbol. The bateleur hunts for sandgrouse and pigeons in the park, and is most often seen there from July to September.|$|E
