40|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of reciprocating engines arise due to {{the application}} of periodic combustion forces in the cylinder and the associated inertial forces of rotating Abstract: This paper presents a detailed multi-body numerical nonlinear dynamic model of a single cylinder internal combustion engine. The model comprises all rigid body inertial members, support bearings, joints, couplers, and connections between the various engine components, as well as means of vibration damping. The detailed model is parameterized, thus enabling virtual prototype testing of various engine designs, as well as allowing the engine designer {{to carry out a}} comprehensive noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) investigation of engine performance. This new approach in engine design reduces the conceptual design-to-development cycle time and removes the need for extensive engine testing, which accounts for a considerable cost in engine design and development process. The model incorporates the simultaneous solution of large displacement dynamics of engine components, infinitesimal vibrations of support bearings, and the trapped air-fuel cylinder transient pressures.

50|$|The major {{differences}} of the Buick 350 {{in comparison to}} other GM V8s are Buick's deep-skirt engine block construction, the use of cast iron with increased nickel content, {{the use of an}} external oil pump, a forward-mounted distributor, under-square cylinder bore sizing, 3 in <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> <b>journals,</b> and 6.385 in connecting rods. The Buick 350 also shares an integrated aluminum timing cover, which incorporates the oil pump mechanisms as well, leaving the oil filter exposed to oncoming air for added cooling. The engine garnered a reputation as a rugged and durable engine , and some of the design characteristics of the Buick 350 are found in other Buick-designed GM engines such as the 231 CID L V6 and its 3800 descendants.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} results of comparative tests performed {{to verify the}} conformity of geometric deviation measurements of a crankshaft carried out at a test bed equipped with a system of elastic support with measurements adopted as reference values. A number of simulation tests were carried out with varied shaft support conditions using the proposed measuring system. The selection criteria were established for support parameters. Meeting these criteria guarantees that shaft elastic deflections and strains are eliminated. Consequently, such strains will not affect the estimation of geometrical deviations of the measured object. The comparative evaluation measurement of roundness profiles and values of roundness deviations of <b>main</b> <b>crankshaft</b> bearing <b>journals</b> of a marine medium speed engine was performed using a correlation calculus. The results have revealed high conformity of both determined roundness deviation values and measured profiles compared to the reference ones...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Renovation {{of marine}} diesel engine <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> and {{crankpin}} <b>journals</b> surfaces is usually done when ships engine is undergoing repairs. Often heavy {{working conditions and}} intensive wear accompanied with lubrication failures require a complete renovation of these worn-out surfaces. In {{most of the cases}} these repairs are done in the workshop, by removing crankshaft from engine and subsequently performing journal grinding. Where it is necessary also various types of build-up operations are carried out. Final technical requirements for these repairs are demanding: fine surface quality, geometrical accuracy and high surface roughness (texture) parameters have to be ensured. Although available technologies are able to deliver these results, they are very expensive, time consuming and usually can be done only in workshop conditions by highly sophisticated and expensive grinding machinery. This article describes novel technology which has been developed to perform crankshaft crankpin journal surfaces grinding operations directly in engine housing. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of laser build-up techniques and their potential applications for marine crankshaft specifics is outlined. Study confirmed that previously adopted grinding platform can be extended to laser cladding technology. It suites well shipboard crankshaft surface renovation needs and opens an entirely new industrial application dimension to the laser cladding technologies. Combination of these in-situ grinding and laser cladding technologies can bring considerable economic benefits and save the valuable marine diesel engine repair time...|$|R

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>journal</b> bearings (<b>main</b> bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> of the <b>crankshaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the cylinder head is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the cylinder head is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|R

50|$|Coolant {{passages}} {{were located}} between the cylinders. The gerotor-type oil pump was {{located at the}} bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, {{as opposed to a}} drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance. The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.|$|R

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are {{retained}} by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side.|$|R
50|$|Accommodating {{the longer}} {{swingarm}} {{was another reason}} the CBR1000RR power plant shared nothing with the 954. Shortening the engine compared to the 954 meant rejecting the conventional in-line layout. Instead, engineers positioned the CBR1000RR's <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>main</b> shaft and countershaft in a triangulated configuration, with the countershaft located below the main shaft, dramatically shortening the engine front to back, and moving the swingarm pivot closer to the crankshaft. This configuration was first successfully introduced by Yamaha with the YZF-R1 model in 1998 and inspired superbike design in the following years.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{and most}} important, the crankshaft's rod {{journals}} are physically {{farther from the}} <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> than on the original equipment. A given extension in {{the distance between the}} rod and <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> results in twice that distance in increase of piston travel. For example, in a Chrysler LA (1971-1992) 360 cubic inch (5.9 l) V8, the rod journal centerline is 1.79 in (4.55 cm) from the <b>main</b> <b>journal</b> centerline. The piston travels 3.58 in (9.1 cm) in this configuration. When this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) stroker kit, the distance between the <b>main</b> <b>journal</b> centerline and the rod journal centerline is increased to 2.00 in (5.08 cm), which results in the piston travelling 4.00 in (10.16 cm). So, the modified crankshaft with 0.21 in (0.53 cm) further distance between the <b>main</b> and rod <b>journals</b> results in 42 cubic inches (.7 [...] ) of displacement greater than the engine had before.|$|R
