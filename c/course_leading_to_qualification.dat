40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} {{on the relationship between}} education and the take-up of screening for cervical cancer, as an example of preventative health-care activity. Theoretically, education can enhance the demand for preventative health services by raising awareness of the importance of undertaking regular health check-ups and may also improve the ways in which individuals understand information regarding periodical tests, communicate with the health practitioner, and interpret results. Furthermore, education enhances the inclusion of individuals in society, improving self-efficacy and confidence. All these factors may increase service uptake. The empirical analysis uses data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and applies techniques for discrete panel data to estimate the parameters of the model. Results show that adult learning <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualifications</b> is statistically associated with an increase in the uptake of screening. The marginal effect indicates that participation in <b>courses</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualifications</b> increases the probability of having a smear test between 4. 3 and 4. 4 percentage points. This estimate is strongly robust to time-invariant selectivity bias in education and the inclusion of income, class, occupation, and parental socio-economic status. These findings enrich existing evidence on the socio-economic determinants of screening for cervical cancer and enable policy makers to better understand barriers to service uptake.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In 1997 the former Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) commissioned the first National Adult Learning Survey (NALS 1997), which explored participation {{in a wide range}} of learning activities. This was a baseline study followed by repeat surveys in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The NALS series is used by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to monitor the effectiveness of their adult learning policies and progress in meeting the National Learning Target for adult participation, which aims to reduce the proportion of non-learners found in 1997 by seven per cent, that is, to reduce this group from 26 to 24 per cent by 2002. The survey involves interviewing up to two adults in a household to ask about any learning they have been involved in over the previous three years. A fairly broad definition of learning is used, covering informal and leisure learning as well as <b>courses</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Both taught and self-directed learning are covered by the survey. Information about educational qualifications as well as standard demographic information are also collected. The first survey in the series, NALS 1997 is held at the UK Data Archive under SN: 3815, and was conducted by the National Centre for Social Research under its former name, Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR). The second survey, NALS 2000, conducted by Ipsos-RSL, is held under SN: 4578. The third survey, NALS 2002, conducted by the National Centre for Social Research is held under SN: 4455. Main Topics : The dataset includes the following information: all were asked their experience of full time continuous education and highest qualification achieved; screening for taught learning; screening for self-directed learning; details of 'other' self-directed learning; information and advice about learning; future learning and knowledge about learning initiatives; use of computer and internet; basic skills (all without basic qualifications); family learning (all with children aged 3 - 18); attitudinal questions; further demographics and re-contact. All with taught learning were asked for summary of all courses; mode of learning and use of computers for learning; motivation for doing learning and advice/information received; problems and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} an {{analysis}} of secondary statistical data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People In England (LSYPE) to investigate careers education, information, advice and guidance (CEIAG) services provided to young people {{in relation to the}} post- 16 vocational qualifications they select. Post- 16 education and training are highly differentiated in England and there is a huge range of courses and <b>qualifications</b> available <b>to</b> young people. These qualifications are not readily comparable and are of uneven value, especially those in vocational education and training (VET). In this context of confusion the Wolf Report (Wolf 2011 : 13) accused schools of “gaming”: advising students onto less demanding courses which benefit schools in their position on national league tables but which are of doubtful worth for the students themselves. To assess the impact of CEIAG for young people in England more broadly this paper reports on statistical analysis of data from the LSYPE in response to two research questions: •	What formal CEIAG do young people receive? •	What evidence is there of young people being advised onto vocational courses which they do not complete or from which progression is difficult? The LSYPE collected data from a panel of young people in seven waves between 2004 and 2010 {{on a wide range of}} topics including family environment, type of school attended and sources of advice and guidance. 15770 young people were involved in the first wave, dropping to 8682 by the final wave. The LSYPE covered a period when CEIAG services were in flux and when new VET qualifications were being introduced with much publicity. There was found to be wide discrepancy in what young people perceived to be available. That discrepancy of provision may have exacerbated the problem of disadvantaged young people selecting <b>courses</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualifications</b> which, even if they completed them, have proved to be short-lived and which have little status in higher education or the workplace. These findings are especially important given that the Education Act of 2011 has repealed the careers education duty on schools in England and moved responsibility for information advice and guidance from local authorities to schools...|$|R

In 1969, RSLIS extended its course offerings to include a specialised diploma programme directed towards national, research and academic libraries (within the framework of Section II). In 1985, the two librarianship programmes were merged into a joint library degree programme. In 1998, the school was granted university status. In 2004 the first PhD thesis in Library and Information Science was defended and in 2006 the first doctoral degree was awarded.

40|$|In <b>courses</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> {{professional}} <b>qualifications,</b> authentic {{tasks are}} the basis of learning through assessment. Problem solving and project work in professional life is almost always a collaborative process. Hence, authentic assessment tasks require students to collaborate in groups. If the experience is carefully devised and managed, group assignments present a rich environment for learning. Collaborative group work effectively fosters both discipline-specific and generic professional attributes. All too often, however, group assignments are a frustrating, even unproductive experience for students, <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> a grade {{that appears to be}} unrelated to the work they put in, and which makes no allowance for problems encountered by the group. This two year project, funded by The Carrick Foundation is a collaboration between the University of Canberra, University of NSW, College of Fine Arts (Sydney) and Macquarie University. The project investigates best practice in group assessment across a range of disciplines with the aim of developing a set of resources – a Web-based toolbox – for teachers and students undertaking collaborative projects. Dr Ian Hart, Project Manager of the Assessing Group Work project, will be visiting Hong Kong in the first three weeks of October 2006. Ian was Associate Professor and Head, Interactive Media Group at the University of Hong Kong between 1991 and 2003. He is currently a consultant in media and learning, based in Canberra. His presentation and seminar covers the following topics: * Advantages and pitfalls of collaborative assessment * Aligning learning outcomes, assessment criteria and the assessment process * Forming groups that facilitate peer learning * Facilitating developmental (formative) as well as summative assessment; * Encouraging student input to the design of assessment * Providing internal annotation of production products; and * Commonalities across a diversity of teaching contexts including online learning. published_or_final_versionCentre for Information Technology in Education, University of Hong Kon...|$|R
40|$|A {{personal}} education {{delivered in}} the form of an academic diploma at a level freely chosen by the individual and rewarded by employment at an institution appropriate to his or her competence is the only qualification expected of all entrants to teaching. The completion of a professional preparation which enables them to teach their subject or other specialism while widely required is not compulsory in all cases since exceptions can be made in subjects in which there is a shortage of teachers or in the senior classes of secondary education where the teacher’s personal or academic education is accepted as adequate for what has been described as lecturing rather than teaching. There is moreover no agreement on the form professional preparation should take regarding either the duration of courses or the place where the training is received. As a rule a command of the contents of both elements of teacher education, the personal and the professional, qualifies teachers to practice in their nation state or in their part of a federal state. The right to teach in the state schools of another country, with the mutual recognition of qualifications obtained which is allowed in member states of the European Union, is in fact something of an exception (Adams & Tulasiewicz 1995; A Guide 1991). The <b>course</b> content <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> a <b>qualification</b> in an academic discipline and the professional training enabling teachers to teach the subject in school, for example mathematics, is broadly similar the world over though allowing for greater emphasis on certain parts of the discipline in some countries, for example the teaching of mental arithmetic. There are greater differences in such school subjects as history and mother tongue education, for example in the handling of national or recent history or in the choice of readingtexts taken exclusively from amongst national classics as seen in recommendations in the current teaching programmes of the National Curriculum in England and Wales (The National Curriculum, 1995, but see also English in the National Curriculum, 1989). Even so, guidelines are expressed in more or less similar terms in the school curricula of other countries. What the national school curriculum does not normally include is an explicit trans-national dimension such as peace or European education for which the cooperation of schools and higher education institutions of different countries would be required. This is likely to be provided in cases of expected teacher and pupil mobility across national boundaries such as encouraged by the Single Europe legislation. For the emergent multilingual and multicultural school population in Europe cross-disciplinary personal and social education topics are being introduced in the curriculum (Adams et al, 1992) ...|$|R
40|$|After the Professional or Technological Baccalauréat: Wage Return at the Start of Working Life for Holders of a 2 -Year Higher Education Diploma (Bac + 2) The wage return {{professional}} or technological baccalauréat holders can expect {{depends on whether}} or not they obtain a 2 -year higher education diploma (Bac + 2). This return is calculated according to the wage supplement they can expect to receive (taking into account individual characteristics) if they continue their studies beyond the 2 -year higher education diploma, or if no further qualification is obtained. Allowing for uncertainty, stemming from the risk of diploma failure and unemployment, after three years of working Iife professional baccalauréat holders who continue their studies can hope to obtain an average salary supplement of 5. 6 % compared with those who stopped their initial training at baccalauréat level, a figure that rises to 10. 6 % for technological baccalauréat holders. However, when the differing characteristics of these two groups (Le. those who stop studying and those who continue their studies with success) are taken into account, baccalauréat holders obtaining a 2 -year higher education diploma can expect a wage supplement of just 3. 2 %. Studies have shown, however, that there is no difference between the wage return to professional baccalauréat holders pursuing further qualifications and the wage return to those who have actually studied for and obtained the 2 -year higher education diploma (around 13 %). Those who continue their studies would be rewarded with better pay in recognition of individual characteristics which are similar to those characteristics of holders of a 2 -year higher education diploma. Professional baccalauréat holders who have not continued to this level would have been weil advised to have done so, since even for <b>courses</b> not <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> a <b>qualification</b> the wage return would be 5. 2 %. These results, however, depend upon the assumption that there is sufficient information available to characterise the similarities and differences of the populations studied.

Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a Central Institution and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became Robert Gordon University. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by The Sunday Times. It was previously The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: [...] "With a graduate unemployment rate that {{is lower than the}} most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year". RGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at Garthdee and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to Robert Gordon's College, and the building now functions as the school's Science and Technology Centre. The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the dubious distinction of having two universities but no student bar.Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: Gray's School of Art, founded in 1886, {{which is one of the}} oldest established colleges of art in the UK.
