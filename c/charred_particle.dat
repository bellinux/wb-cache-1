Four 14 -C dates for the sequence {{show that it}} reaches back almost {{to the beginning of}} the Holocene. The immigration of the various tree species took place somewhat earlier than further west.

40|$|The transboundary Lake Prespa and its {{watershed}} enclose {{a remarkable}} biodiversity that {{is protected by}} several national and international treaties. Situated at 849 m a. s. l., the area {{is characterized by a}} transitional climate and the closed nature of the basin controls Lake Prespa’s modern hydrology. An 18 m-long sediment sequence was retrieved from a distal location, away from stream inflow, where preliminary hydroacoustic investigations suggested undisturbed sedimentation. Consequently, the sediments were dated and analyzed using palynological, sedimentological and geochemical techniques. The age model is based on AMS and ESR dating, tephrochronology and cross correlation with the Greenland ice record (NGRIP) and suggests an age of c. 92 ka cal BP for the base of the sequence. The pollen spectra allow for the zoning of the record in three major phases of vegetation development corresponding to Marine Isotope Stages 5 to 1. The forested phases of MIS 5 and MIS 1 are dominated by thermophilous and drought-sensitive trees (e. g. Quercus, Carpinus, Fagus) suggesting higher temperatures and moisture availability during their growing season. Increased lake productivity, hypolimnion anoxia and calcite precipitation are recorded in these intervals. Continuous presence of Mediterranean frost-sensitive species (e. g. Pistacia, Phillyrea) during the Holocene implies rising temperatures in late winter and spring. Sporadic occurrence of maquis pollen in MIS 5 suggest that temperature was probably limiting their expansion. Increasing fuel availability and summer aridity most likely account for a higher microscopic <b>charred</b> <b>particle</b> concentration during the Holocene (in particular after c. 5. 5 ka). However, intensifying anthropogenic activity has probably overridden climate forcing over the last c. 2 ka. Within MIS 5 and MIS 1, brief periods (centennial to millennial) of open landscape are also documented and are ascribed to colder and drier climate conditions persisting at Prespa. During MIS 3, the relatively open landscape is characterized by several deciduous trees besides Pinus. An open steppe landscape with scattered tree stands comprising mostly Pinus prevailed in MIS 4 and MIS 2. High Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae abundances point to rather cold and arid conditions at Prespa. This appears to be in agreement with low lake productivity, enhanced mixing and increased ice-cover documented for this time. However, occurrences of deciduous tree pollen throughout the Last Glacial provide evidence for the survival of several tree species in sheltered locations at Prespa or its vicinity. This study underscores the sensitivity of the Lake Prespa region to climate forcing over the Last Glacial and the Holocene. The vegetation history of the region was examined focusing on ecological processes such as immigration, competition, succession, population growth and stability. Ongoing investigations may offer further insights into the paleoenvironment and paleoclimate at Prespa. The Prespa pollen underline the potential of the region to serve as refugium over longer time scales. In spite of systematic conservation efforts over the last decades, the question of whether Prespa’s ecosystems will withstand increasing anthropogenic pressures remains open...|$|E

This study focused on tar conversion over the active <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> besides the simultaneous carbon conversion of the <b>char</b> <b>particle.</b> In the presented model, the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> was assumed a sphere surrounded by a gas film in a bulk gas composition of naphthalene, nitrogen, steam, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane. The model treated the heterogeneous gasification reaction kinetics, external and internal mass transfer and changing particle properties during gasification. In addition, the effect of different parameters on naphthalene and carbon conversion was investigated. The investigated parameters were particle size, temperature and time on stream. The gas and solid mass balance equations besides the energy balance equation were solved in the radial direction using a set of initial and boundary conditions. The model results show that the naphthalene and carbon conversion reactions were kinetically limited at the reference conditions of 850 °C bulk gas temperature and 600 μm <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> size. Further, the model calculations show that isothermal <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> can be assumed up to a bulk temperature of about 1160 °C. The variation of the physical properties and pore structure of the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> with carbon conversion affects the active surface area of the particle.

The recent literature has addressed {{the fate of}} <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> by assessing {{the relative importance of}} coal conversion associated with the entrained-flow of carbon particles in a lean-dispersed phase and the segregated flow of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in a near-wall dense-dispersed phase. Different micromechanical char–slag interaction patterns may establish, depending on the stickiness of the wall layer and of the impinging <b>char</b> <b>particle.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} use the tool of the physical modelling, to give a contribution in the development of a phenomenological scenario of the fate of coal/ash particles in entrained-flow slagging coal gasifiers, which considers the establishment of a particle segregated phase in the near-wall region of the gasifier. Different scales of investigation were pursued, relevant to study the fluid dynamic conditions which lead to near-wall particle segregation, as well as the particle–wall micromechanical interactions. Montan wax was used to mimic, at atmospheric conditions, particle–wall interactions relevant in entrained-flow gasifiers.

40|$|Circulating {{fluidized}} bed {{can be applied}} in several methods of CO 2 capture. In oxy-combustion the fuel particle temperature can peak in the regions near the entrance with high oxygen concentration, being a critical factor. To study this aspect, techniques to measure fuel particle temperature have been developed mainly based of thermocouples, where it is usually assumed that the thermocouple {{does not affect the}} movement of the fuel particle, although there is no rigorous evidence. In the present paper this aspect is studied by comparing the temperature of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> with and without an embedded thermocouple (with 0. 25 and 0. 5 mm sheath diameters). <b>Char</b> <b>particles</b> (10 mm) are burnt in a laboratory {{fluidized bed}} made in quartz, allowing visual observation of the particles. The surface temperature is measured by pyrometry coupled to a digital camera {{at the same time as}} the particle’s temperature is recorded by a thermocouple. The temperature of a <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> fluidized with an embedded thermocouple is shown to be higher than that of a freely fluidized <b>char</b> <b>particle,</b> and its burnout time is shorter. This is because the fluidization with a thermocouple makes the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> sink in the bed, increasing its residence time in the bubble phase compared to the freely fluidized particle. Besides, this work shows how the pyrometry technique is able to track the size and movement of a particle and its surface temperature gradients during conversion, improving the data collected with this method as compared to other measurement techniques...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{reliable}} chemical kinetics of char always plays significant {{roles in the}} modelling, design and optimization of processes during biofuel thermochemical conversions. The determination of reaction kinetics of char in the high-temperature range still highly depends on the extrapolation of results from kinetic data determined at lower temperatures due to mass and heat transfer limitations. In this work an aerosol-based method was used to investigate the reactivity of singly-distributed <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> with aerodynamic diameters between 0. 5 - 10 mm. The conversion of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in the reactor at varying temperatures and residence time was determined by comparing the particle size distributions before and after passing the reactor, using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) spectrometer. The results of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> reacted with air, CO 2 and steam indicate that the aerosol-based method {{can be used to}} determine reaction kinetics of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in the high temperature range where reaction is controlled by diffusion limitation if using conventional thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). By combining the aerosol-based method and conventional TGA, the oxidation and gasification kinetic parameters of biomass char can be derived in the temperature range of 350 - 800 ºC, and 800 - 1200 ºC respectively. The aerosol-based method shows the potential of on-line measuring the char reactivity...|$|R
40|$|A quasisteady {{model for}} single <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> combusting at {{oxy-fuel}} conditions is presented.

The main idea is to study burning characteristics of small <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> obtained from wood pyrolysis at the conditions corresponding {{to those found in}} industrial biomass furnaces (high heating conditions, larger and less dense particles compared to coal <b>char</b> <b>particles).</b> The results indicate that the particle temperature is considerably lower in O 2 /CO 2 mixtures (due to the endothermicity of the gasification reactions) than that in an O 2 /N 2 environment. For an O 2 mass fraction of 0. 3, the burnout time is found to be the same in both gasifying environments. However, at lower O 2 mass fractions, the burnout time of a particle burning in the oxy-fuel conditions is shorter than that in an O 2 /N 2 mixture...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{history of}} a <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> that was heated by a carbon dioxide laser to the ignition point was studied in the electrodynamic balance. The ignition characteristics of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> {{are an important part}} of the overall coal combustion process, and the aim of research in this area is to improve efficiency and minimize waste products and pollution in current combustors. The experiments were conducted using 158 - 210 µm diameter Spherocarb particles, and 200 - 300 µm diameter <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> from a bituminous coal. Individual charged <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> were suspended in the electrodynamic balance and heated by a 420 ms pulse of radiation from a CO_ 2 laser at a heating rate of approximately 4. 5 x 10 ^ 3 K/s. The temperature of the particle was measured with an optical pyrometer. The atmosphere in the electrodynamic balance was initially pure nitrogen. The oxygen concentration was slowly increased as successive laser pulses were applied, until the particle ignited. Upon ignition, the particle lost charge and dropped from the center of the balance. The particle temperature profile preceding ignition shows the ignition delay predicted by the general ignition condition of Semenov's thermal explosion theory. The measured temperature traces could be described well by calculations treating the particle as a sphere and using rate parameters given in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The char {{temperature}} during combustion in a {{fluidized bed}} (FB) is often measured by thermocouples due to simplicity, {{and because it}} is assumed that the thermocouple effect on the movement of the char is negligible. It is also accepted that the combustion temperature of a <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> fluidized with an embedded thermocouple is similar to a freely fluidized particle. However, few publications have given evidence of this fact. In the present article this question is dealt with by comparing the evolution of conversion and temperature of fluidized <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> with and without an embedded thermocouple. Char from beech wood, sub-bituminous and bituminous coal of an initial diameter of 10 mm is burnt in two laboratory FBs; one 2 -dimensional made of quartz with rectangular cross-section allowing visual observation and temperature tracking of the particles, and the other being 3 -dimensional with 50 mm internal diameter. The surface temperature of the <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> is followed by a recently developed visual technique, based on pyrometry coupled with a digital camera. The consumption of char is evaluated by sampling particles from the bed at different stages of conversion, analyzing the density and size of the particle. It is found that, due to the greater resistance of the particle-thermocouple to the drag of the bed, the time that the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> is in the bubble phase is 40 % longer when the thermocouple is used, leading to higher combustion rate and temperature, and consequently, shorter burnout time. Moreover, the rotation of the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> is restricted, provoking a non-homogeneous consumption of char, which enhances the size reduction of the particle along the direction perpendicular to the insertion of the hermocouple. Overall, these findings suggest that conclusions about char conversion by temperature measurements using thermocouples should be made with caution, since significant error might be committed under some operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} {{pore structure}} of chars derived from many bituminous and sub-bituminous coals can be best described by bi-modal pore size distribution. Their macropores, {{which account for}} nearly all the porosity, are interconnected spherical cavities with diameters as large 100 or 200 microns for 500 [...] 750 micron particles. Most of the internal surface area of these chars, however, is associated with micropores that are usually smaller than 30 A. In order to elucidate the effect of process conditions on the internal pore structure of coal-derived <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> and ultimately their overall reactivities, staged and sequential combustion algorithms are designed using thermogravimetric reactor equipped with in-situ video microscopy imaging (TGA/VMI). Our experiments showed that coal-derived <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> treated with higher pyrolysis heating rates have more open macropore structure than those treated with lower heating rates. At low combustion temperature where the reaction was kinetic controlled, {{the impact of the}} macropore structure on the overall reactivity of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> was insignificant since all the internal surface area associated with micropores were accessible to the oxygen. At higher combustion temperature, however, the macropore structure of the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> had a strong effect on its overall reactivity. Chars with more open macropore structure and larger macropore surface area exhibited higher reactivity. Also, combustion experiments showed that more open macropore structure and higher macropore surface area favored particle ignition, a transient phenomenon characterized by luminous flame engulfing the particle, which caused sharp increase of the overall reactivity of <b>char</b> <b>particles.</b> The development of the generalized grain model helped us to describe mathematically the mass and energy transfer during the char combustion process. The macropore structure was modeled as a network of interconnected spherical cavities. The walls separating these cavities consist of homogeneous assemblies of microporous grains made of carbonaceous material. The numerical analysis revealed that in the regime of diffusional limitation, a more open macropore structure could reduce the diffusional resistance inside the macropores. Therefore, it enhanced the accessibility of the micropores surface area to the oxygen and ultimately led to higher overall reactivity of the <b>char</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{phenomenology}} {{and proper}} design of slagging entrained-flow gasifiers requires {{the assessment of}} the fate of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> as they impinge on the wall slag layer. The relative importance of coal conversion associated with the entrained-flow of carbon particles in a lean-dispersed phase and the segregated flow of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in a near-wall dense-dispersed phase have been recently studied. In a previous study, Montagnaro and Salatino developed a phenomenological model that considers the establishment of a particle segregated phase in the near-wall region of the gasifier. It was highlighted that <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> impinging on the wall slag layer can either be entrapped inside the melt (progress of combustion/gasification is hindered), or adhere onto the slag layer’s surface (progress of combustion/gasification is still possible). In the latter case, and if the slag layer is extensively covered by <b>char</b> <b>particles,</b> a particle segregated phase may establish in the close proximity of the wall ash layer, where the excess impinging <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> that cannot be accommodated on the slag surface accumulate. This annular phase is slower than the lean particle-laden gas phase, so that the segregated <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> residence times are longer than the average gas space-time, with a positive impact on carbon burn-off. Further studies confirmed the soundness of this phenomenological framework. Particle–wall interaction occurs according to different micromechanical patterns, which depend on parameters such as particle and wall temperatures, solid/molten status of the particles and wall layer, char conversion degree, surface tension of the slag layer, particle effective stiffness and char/slag interfacial tension. Char–slag interaction patterns are hereby classified {{on the basis of the}} stickiness degree of the wall layer and of the char particle:  _the material laying on the wall (prevailingly, inorganic ash) is sticky when the wall temperature is high enough to ensure an ash molten status, generating a liquid slag layer. An additional condition for the slag layer to be sticky is that it must not be extensively covered by non sticky char particles;  _the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> is sticky when its temperature is beyond the ash melting point, and its carbon conversion degree is beyond a given threshold value, as the plastic behaviour is emphasized when the carbon content is reduced. On the basis of this classification, four interaction scenarios can be considered, namely: (i) non sticky char/ash particles impinging on a molten-slag-covered sticky wall (NSP–SW); (ii) non sticky char/ash particles impinging on a non sticky wall (NSP–NSW); (iii) molten, i. e. sticky, ash particles impinging on a non sticky wall (SP–NSW); (iv) molten sticky ash particles impinging on a sticky wall (SP–SW). This study aims at investigating near-wall particle segregation by using a lab-scale cold entrained-flow reactor.

This work illustrates how different numerical modeling approaches can be jointly used to understand segregation patterns of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in full-scale entrained-flow coal gasifiers operated in the slagging regime. A multilevel approach has been developed for this purpose. RANS-based simulations of the full-scale geometry with coal particle injection and tracking aimed to obtain the general behavior of the flow field and particle trajectories. Simulations enabled to estimate the effect of swirl and tangential flow on the bulk-to-wall <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> deposition rate.

40|$|Gasification and {{combustion}} of porous <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> {{occurs in}} many industrial applications. Reactor-scale outputs of importance depend critically on processes that {{occur at the}} particle-scale. Because <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> often possess {{a wide range of}} pore sizes and react under varying operating conditions, predictive models which can account for the numerous physical and chemical processes and time-dependent boundary conditions to which a particle is subjected are necessary. A comprehensive, transient, spherically symmetric model of a reacting, porous <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> and its surrounding boundary layer has been developed and validated. The model accounts for heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions, pore structure evolution, gas transport in and around the porous particle, thermal annealing, fragmentation and ash behavior. To model the pore structure evolution, an extension of the random pore model has been developed which allows different pore sizes to grow at different rates, depending on the instantaneous pore-scale reactant penetration at a given location within the particle. This is accomplished by incorporating pore-scale effectiveness factors, consistent with the random pore geometry, into equations for the growth of individual pore sizes. This framework allows the evolution of the char with local conversion to adapt to changes in boundary conditions (reactants, temperature) and the development of intra-particle gradients, rather than being pre-determined by the initial pore structure. The effects of char gasification reactions during oxy-combustion of pulverized coal are not fully understood. The single <b>particle</b> <b>char</b> consumption model is used with output from CFD simulations of high-volatile oxy-coal combustion to analyze representative regions and trajectories along which <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> burning occurs.

These two processes need to be both carefully controlled to achieve high gasification efficiencies: flow configurations promoting the centrifugal motion of particles enhance the separation of ashes, {{but at the same}} time unburnt <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> can in this way be transferred to the gasifier’s walls covered by a flowing molten slag layer possibly layered by previously impacted <b>char</b> <b>particles.</b> As highlighted in previous studies of this research group, different interaction mechanisms may establish upon impact of char/ash particles with the slag layer. Entrapment of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> into the slag leads to a decrease in the particle burn-off degree, while segregation of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> into a “dense-dispersed phase” upon interaction with other particles layered onto the slag phase can enhance the overall particle residence time and, thus, the conversion efficiency. Adopting numerical simulations, it has been shown that the occurrence of desired segregation phenomena is possible for both unconverted (non-sticky char) and converted (sticky ash) particles. Following this path, in this paper numerical DEM simulations of a prototype entrained-flow slagging gasifier have been developed to establish the role of the level of particle burning, and therefore of the properties relevant to particle-particle interaction (e. g. particle stickiness degree and deriving characteristics), on the distribution of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in the whole reactor. Even in presence of simplifying assumptions, the results reveal the importance to take into account the particle-particle interaction for a correct prediction of the effective residence time distribution of particles in the reactor. The effective flux of particles towards the wall slag layer appears indeed strongly dependent on the initial particle-particle contact characteristics in the region of the gasifier where the dense phase develops. In the proposed configuration of a downward gasifier, this is the result not only of the interaction among particles in the region of injection but also of the distribution pattern that establishes after the first impact of particles with the walls...|$|R
40|$|Fate of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> {{and reasons}} of char C {{stabilization}} in soils {{is not well}} understood especially due to difficulties of its quantification. In this study we showed how char C content could be estimated from elemental analysis along with its size redistribution and co-stabilization with non-char C in long-term. We studied C dynamics in the size and density fractons of soil samples from a historical collection of 80 years bare fallow (no plant input plus tillage) experiment in Versailles, France (1929, 1939, 1949, 1962, 1972, 1991, 2008 years). Coarse <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> were observed in the soil substantially contributing to total organic C. Thus, char C study in this soil was carried out as a nessessary step for estimation of non-char C dynamics. Physical fraction allowed us to follow separately the dynamics of mineral-associated and free C. We analyzed bulk soils, fractions and picked out <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> for C, N and 13 C contents. Total organic carbon concentrations in fractions pointed to char C input during 1939 - 1949 years. After that patterns of C and C/N and _ 13 C changes in all fractions suggested redistribution of char C from coarse to finer fractions. Evolution of C/N and _ 13 C suggested that all free C fractions, although enriched in char, still contained non-char C {{in the end of}} the 80 years C depletion chronosequence. Especially high proportion of non-char C was observed in the silt-size free C fraction. Linear combinations of contrasting char and non-char C C/N values allowed estimation of their proportions from the C/N evolution in the fractions. No substantial admixture of char C was observed for mineral-associated C fractions. Stable C pool in 2008 comprised of 4. 6 g C kg- 1 soil and was composed of mineral-associated C (3. 5 g C kg- 1 soil) and char-associated C (1. 1 g C kg- 1 soil). In both cases organic matter could be stabilized through adsorption and/or occlusion with solid <b>particles</b> (mineral or <b>char).</b> Stabilization capacities of different size class minerals reflected in C concentrations of fractions were 1. 2 g C kg- 1 for silt-size minerals and 19. 4 g C kg- 1 for clay-size minerals, contrastingly three orders of magnitude more C was associated with <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> or about 1. 2 kg non-char C kg- 1 sand-size char and about 1. 4 to 3. 5 kg non-char C kg- 1 silt-size char. Such a high capacity of stabilization by <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> could not be explained by adorbtion alone. In conclusion, combination of C/N and _ 13 C signature allowed estimation of char content in this soil. Total char C content (sum up of redistributed char C in free fractions) remained not significantly different in the C depletion experiment during five decades after char input. Century scale char and non-char C co-stabilization in this soil could be explained by combination of adsorption and physical protection in microaggregates constructed of mineral and <b>char</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the time}} <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in {{commercial}} FB units encounter considerably lower oxygen concentrations than that in the entrance, say between 2 % and 10 %, {{and the effects of}} the oxy-fuel atmosphere on the conversion history of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> need to be clearly treated under these conditions. In the present work, an experimental study of combustion of bituminous coal char was carried out in a laboratory FB in O 2 /CO 2 and O 2 /N 2 atmospheres under simulated FB combustor conditions at O 2 concentrations of 4 – 10 % v/v, bed temperatures of 800 – 900 °C and <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> sizes of 2 – 8 mm by continuously measuring the concentrations of O 2 and CO in the flue gas. The results indicate that the conversion of char is controlled by diffusion of O 2 in the boundary layer of the particle in O 2 /CO 2 and O 2 /N 2 environments and that the gasification of char in O 2 /CO 2 is limited by chemical kinetics. A char conversion model, taking into account the mass transfer from the bed to the particle and the gasification kinetics of char, was built, based on the experimental results and the intrinsic reactivity of char obtained in TGA tests. Simulations, carried out under the same conditions as in the FB experiments, give good agreement in terms of burnout time and instantaneous reactivity during the conversion of single particles. Simulated results prove that the low diffusivity of O 2 in CO 2 is the main reason for the decreased reaction rate of the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> in O 2 /CO 2 compared with O 2 /N 2. The contribution of gasification to the consumption of char is more notable at high bed temperature (900 °C) and coarse particles (8 mm), particularly at lower oxygen concentration (4 – 6 % v/v) ...|$|R

Compared to parent forest residues, char residues obtained from devolatilization experiments have significant smaller particle sizes. At 1200 °C, the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> underwent plastic deformation, developing a structure with smooth and compact surfaces. EDX analyses of the char surfaces revealed migration and coalescence of inorganic elements (mainly Ca, K and Si) during devolatilization processes.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a 3 -dimensional simulation {{of the effect}} of <b>particle</b> shape on <b>char</b> entrainment in a bubbling fluidised bed reactor. Three <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> of 350 μm side length but of different shapes (cube, sphere, and tetrahedron) are injected into the fluidised bed and the momentum transport from the fluidising gas and fluidised sand is modelled. Due to the fluidising conditions, reactor design and <b>particle</b> shape the <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> will either be entrained from the reactor or remain inside the bubbling bed. The sphericity of the particles is the factor that differentiates the particle motion inside the reactor and their efficient entrainment out of it. The simulation has been performed with a completely revised momentum transport model for bubble three-phase flow, taking into account the sphericity factors, and has been applied as an extension to the commercial finite volume code FLUENT 6. 3...|$|R
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} how different numerical modeling approaches can be jointly used to understand segregation patterns of <b>char</b> <b>particles</b> in full-scale entrained-flow coal gasifiers operated in the slagging regime. A multi-level {{approach has been}} developed for this purpose. Firstly, a reduced compartmental model has been developed to give indications on the solids flow rates and flux transferred to the wall slag layer. Then, RANS-based simulations of the full-scale geometry with coal particle injection and tracking aimed to obtain the general behaviour of the flow field and particle trajectories. Simulations enabled to estimate the effect of swirl and tangential flow on the bulk-to-wall <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> deposition rate. Finally, RANS results were adopted in a more detailed numerical model based on {{the solution of the}} filtered Navier-Stokes equations. In this last model, a turbulence LES approach for the Eulerian gas phase was applied. Both RANS and LES simulations have been obtained with the aid of the OpenFOAM toolkit. The equations of particles motion were solved via a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with the TrackToFace method. Simulations were performed involving a number of particles from 10 ^ 5 to 10 ^ 6, a level of detail that allowed to obtain a clear picture of the multiphase flow behaviour responsible for char deposition phenomena. This multi-level approach enabled the assessment of the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> deposition rates and the nature of char/slag interaction (segregation/entrapment) that are likely to occur in full-scale slagging gasifiers...|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for the oxidation and fragmentation of a <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> was developed. Qualitative agreement between the model simulations and experimental data observed in the literature, is found for the higher gas temperatures (1700 K). However fundamental differences {{are found in the}} particle temperature histories and burnout times at low temperature (1250 K). The role that fragmentation plays on the <b>char</b> <b>particle</b> history is incorporated into the model and the possible production of fine particulate through fragmentation is examined. A relatively large fraction of the mass of char available for fragmentation is produced early in the combustion history of the particle. Therefore, if this mechanism is important in the generation of fine particulate matter during char combustion, the simulations indicate that it would occur early in the combustion process. Due to the limited experimental data in the literature on the time resolved particle size distribution {{in the early stages of}} combustion, corroboration between model and experiment was not possible...|$|R
