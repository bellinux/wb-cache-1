40|$|Most of {{the studies}} on project {{scheduling}} problems assume that every assigned participant or every team of {{the same number of}} participants, completes tasks with an equal efficiency, but this is usually not the case for real world problems. This paper presents a more realistic and complex model with extra consideration on team efficiency which are quantitatively measured on employee-task assignment. This study demonstrates the impacts of team efficiency in a well-studied software project management problem. Moreover, this study illustrates how a heuristic optimization method, population-based incremental learning, copes with such added complexity. The experimental results show that the resulting near optimal solutions not only satisfy constraints, but also reflect the impacts of team efficiency. The findings will hopefully motivate future studies on <b>comprehensive</b> <b>understandings</b> of the quality and efficiency of team work...|$|R

25|$|The Fish Commission {{wanted to}} develop a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>understanding</b> of the {{migration}} of food fishes {{in the spring and}} autumn as they travelled to and from their summer feeding grounds, and chose to construct Grampus as a sailing ship because it wanted her to be able to remain at sea for weeks or months at a time to follow the migration continuously and investigate it completely without having to come into port for coal, as a steamer would. Grampus also had to be seaworthy enough to remain on duty and not lose contact with the migrating fish during bad weather. Finally, Grampus had to be designed and equipped to capture fish that did not swim near the surface in order to investigate fisheries completely, and she also needed to be able to capture and investigate minute life such as plankton, which supported the food fish population.|$|E

Such cooperations are coalition phenomena and the corresponding proper subsets of actors are coalitions. 1 Since coalescing partners purposefully seek influence against their adversaries, any coalition in human societies has political features. 2 Except for the more general analysis of Riker (1963), most existing lit...|$|R

25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed seismic hazard assessment of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed seismic hazard analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of earthquake risk mitigation studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as <b>comprehensive</b> <b>understanding</b> of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have put effort into developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E
25|$|The 4th {{century of}} the Christian Era marked the {{beginning}} of a pronounced geographic and linguistic divide within the Roman Empire between the Latin West and the Greek and Syriac East, and in the mid-11th century Chalcedonian Christianity suffered a major schism between the (western) Catholic Church under an increasingly powerful Roman papacy and the (eastern) Orthodox Church with its own apostolic sees and patriarchates. Orthodoxy flourished throughout the Byzantine Empire, and a great many theologians composed extensive works on Christian doctrine. Eastern theologians emphasized strongly the importance of moral transformation as deification (theosis), and the moral influence view of the atonement can be found universally in their writings. Other theories of the atonement became popular during the Byzantine period, such as the ransom theory and its complement Christus Victor. These approaches were typically espoused together with the moral influence view for a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>understanding</b> of the Cross, and thus most theologians during the Byzantine period taught several atonement theories simultaneously. Since the East-West Schism of 1054, the Orthodox Christian Churches have continued to teach the moral influence theory of the atonement in combination with other Patristic atonement theories such as the ransom theory and the Christus Victor model.|$|E

[...] This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (published in 1923) but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including acetophenone, phenylacetylene, fluorene and diphenylmethane. Conant can be considered alongside Brønsted, Lowry, Lewis, and Hammett as a developer of modern understanding of acids and bases.|$|E

Instructors adopting educational technology in their higher education teaching and learning environments {{need to be aware}} of the literature guiding implementation of TEFA and the influences of their own assessment experiences on their instructional practices. This is because researchers have established that instructors’ classroom assessment practices are influenced by their attitudes, prior experiences, knowledge, skills, and motivation related to the nature of assessment and learning (Calderhead, 1996). Meaningful learning interactions incorporating educational technology and formative assessments require appropriate structures (Sorensen & Takle, 2005). Thus, more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>understandings</b> related to influences on involvement, effects on learning, accessibility of feedback, and impacts on instructors could influence future implementations of TEFA and thus have important practice consequences and impacts on classroom teaching and learning environments.|$|R
