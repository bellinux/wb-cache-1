40|$|New {{multifocal}} phase designs {{aiming at}} expanding {{depth of focus}} in the presbyopic eye are presented. The designs consist of multiple radial or <b>angular</b> <b>zones</b> of different powers or of combined low- and high-order aberrations. Multifocal performance was evaluated {{in terms of the}} dioptric range for which the optical quality is above an appropriate threshold, as well as in terms of the area under the through-focus optical quality curves. For varying optical power designs optimal through-focus performance was found for a maximum of three to four zones. Furthermore adding more zones decreased the optical performance of the solution. <b>Angular</b> <b>zone</b> designs provided better multifocal performance (1. 95 times on average) than radial zone designs with identical number of zones and the same power range. The optimal design (angular design with three zones) surpassed by 33 % the multifocal performance of a bifocal <b>angular</b> <b>zone</b> design and by 32 % a standard multifocal phase plate with induced spherical aberration only. By using combinations of low- and high-order aberrations the through-focus range can be extended further by another 0. 5 D beyond that of the best design of varying optical power. These designs can be implemented in adaptive optics systems for testing their visual performance in subjects and converted into multifocal contact lenses, intraocular lenses, or presbyopic corneal laser ablation profiles. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

40|$|The {{influence}} of rotation on the dynamical evolution of collisional stellar systems is investigated by solving the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation in (E,J_z) -space. We find that {{large amounts of}} initial rotation drive the system into a phase of strong mass loss while it is moderately contracting. The core is rotating even faster than before although angular momentum is transported outwards. At {{the same time the}} core is heating. Given these features this phase can be associated with the gravo-gyro 'catastrophe' found by Hachisu (1979). The increase in <b>central</b> <b>angular</b> momentum levels off after about 2 - 3 initial half-mass relaxation times indicating that the source of this `catastrophe' is depleted. Finally, the <b>central</b> <b>angular</b> velocity increases again, but with a rather small power of the central density [...] the same power as for the central velocity dispersion during self-similar contraction towards the collapse. The rotation curves flatten and the ellipticity variations decrease with time, but their shapes are very similar. These results suggest the existence of a self-similar solution for a rotating cluster as well. The maximum values of rotational velocity and ellipticity occur at about the half mass radius.

Angelfish (Pterophyllum eimekei) escape in non-random trajectories when the stimulus is presented laterally, within an <b>angular</b> <b>zone</b> of approximately 30 – 120 ˚ (discriminating zone).

Angelfish correct their responses when turning towards the stimulus, suggesting that escape trajectories are modulated by sensory feedback. Re-analysis of published work on other animals, by employing circular histograms of escape trajectories, reveals multimodal patterns which are also not apparent from the linear plots.
