Univariate tests and a multiple regression model are used to test life cycle effects on key variables (i. e., confidence, self-image, other's opinions, charges, product expectations, perceived risk, frequency of usage and use of services) to the determination of overall satisfaction. The research is based on the application of personnel interviews, with a total sample of 363 consumers.

It did not help that the previous administration, led by James Buchanan, left over $20 million budget deficit at the end of Buchanan’s term in 1861 {{as a result of a}} recession in 1857 that persisted throughout Buchanan’s term. [...] More gold and silver left the nation to finance the war effort, reducing the nation’s resources in the long run, so Congress had metallic payments suspended in 1861 to stop the outflow. Lincoln and his Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, needed more loans to finance the war, but bankers, as a result of shaken public <b>confidence,</b> <b>charged</b> 24 percent in interests for the loans. [...] As a solution, the government issued “demand notes”, or federal notes requesting for a certain amount of money to be redeemed in gold or silver. In 1862, the government issued “greenbacks”, which were unbacked notes that relied on government credit to retain value by themselves without the backing of metal. [...] By the end of the war, gold was worth 1.5 greenback. This, combined with the amount of debt the government already owed, threatened the war-torn economy as it prepared to pay off its war debts.|$|R

40|$|Distributed, {{small-scale}} {{energy storage}} {{has been identified}} as a means of improving load factors for intermittent renewable generation and displacing the need for fossil-based backup. Domestic electric storage heaters operating within a smart grid offer high density, controllable energy storage at low cost, allowing the network operator to shift demand by charging heaters to dispose of excess supply. This paper reports monitoring outcomes and simulation studies on the first field trials of such a system, in which heaters are capable of responding to instructions from the grid to vary charging level at 15 -min intervals, as well as to occupant-set controls on power output. Monitoring found significant unexpected out-of-schedule power draw and under-utilisation of storage capacity. Alternative approaches to scheduling were tested using simulations, and evaluated using metrics to quantify schedule following as well as other aspects of performance to give a balanced view of system performance to the network operator. Modern insulated storage heaters are capable of supporting load shifting for up to 48 h with minimal impact on room temperatures or demand, and with high <b>confidence</b> that <b>charging</b> schedules will be followed. However, where device controllers compete with centrally generated charge scheduling, the network will experience significant out-of-schedule power draw while occupants will experience either lower temperatures or increased cost...|$|R

This paper explores the various alternative routes for laptop exports from Chongqing, China to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It selects seven available routes for laptop transportation from Chongqing to Rotterdam. The multimodal model was adopted to demonstrate alternative routes using various factors such as transport cost, transfer cost, transit time, transport distance, document charge, port congestion surcharge, customs <b>charge,</b> <b>confidence</b> index and so on. Among possible alternative routes, the results indicate that the route 6 was the fastest routes except for the air transport (route 7), while the route 1 was the cheapest and safest way. Nonetheless, route 1 may be not suitable for the laptop transport due to the importance of timeliness. The logisticians may able to utilize this research's findings to make a balance between transit time and transport cost for effective multimodal transport of laptops from Chongqing to Rotterdam...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{spatially}} inhomogeneous fixed charge distributions on the pressure-driven transport of ions through cylindrical nanopores {{have been investigated}} theoretically {{by means of an}} approximate version of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model that can be used with <b>confidence</b> for moderately <b>charged</b> nanopores with radius smaller than the Debye screening length of the system. Salt rejection rate has been computed {{as a function of the}} applied pressure difference for various one-dimensional (1 D) unipolar charge distributions and has been compared with that obtained for a homogeneously charged nanochannel with an identical average volume charge density. The ion rejection capabilities of charged nanopores can be optimized by an appropriate distribution of the fixed charge concentration. When ions are forced to enter the nanopores by the end with the lowest fixed charged concentration, the salt rejection rate exhibits a nonmonotonous variation with the applied pressure. This phenomenon has been attributed to the influence of the inhomogeneous charge distribution on the electric field that arises spontaneously so as to maintain the electroneutrality within the nanopore...|$|R

If this system cannot be rigorously adhered to in practice, (and what system can be so?) it ought to be the constant aim of good men to approach as nearly to it as possible. No system of that kind can be formed, which will not leave room fully sufficient for healing coalitions: but no coalition, which, under the specious name of independency, carries in its bosom the unreconciled principles of the original discord of parties, ever was, or will be, an healing coalition.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{sulfhydryl}} reagents on nonlinear membrane currents of frog skeletal muscle fibers {{has been studied}} using the triple Vaseline gap voltage-clamp technique. These compounds, which are known to interfere with depolarization contraction coupling, also appear to diminish intramembranous charge movement recorded with fibers polarized to- 100 mV (charge 1). This effect, however, is accompanied by changes in the fiber membrane conductance {{and in most cases}} by the appearance of an inwardly directed current in the potential range between- 60 and + 20 mV. This current is reduced by both cadmium and nifedipine and does not occur in Ca-free solution, suggesting that it is carried by calcium ions flowing through regular calcium channels that are more easily activated in the presence of SH reagent. These changes in the membrane electrical active and passive properties decrease the quality and reliability of the P/n pulse subtracting procedure normally used for charge movement measurements. These effects can be substantially reduced by cadmium ions (0. 1 mM), which has no effect on charge movement. When SH reagents are applied in the presence of cadmium, no effects are observed, indicating that this cation may protect the membrane from the reagent effects. The effects of-SH reagents can be observed by applying them in the absence of cadmium, followed by addition of the cation. Under these conditions the conductance changes are reversed and the effects of the SH reagents on charge movement can be measured with a higher degree of <b>confidence.</b> Maximum <b>charge</b> is reduced by 32 % in the presence of 1. 5 mM PCMB and by 31 % in the presence of 2 mM PHMPS.

40|$|In the {{standard}} model of particle physics (SM) the masses of the elementary particles aregenerated by the Higgs mechanism predicting {{the existence of the}} Higgs boson. Recently theCMS and ATLAS experiments at the CERN LHC reported evidence of a new particle compatiblewith the SM Higgs boson. The Higgs sector of the SM suﬀers, however, from the so-calledhierarchy problem, for which one possible solution is supersymmetry. Supersymmetric modelsthat extend the SM to contain at least two Higgs doublets, like the minimal supersymmetricstandard model (MSSM), predict the existence of a charged Higgs boson. Therefore the searchfor the charged Higgs boson has an important role for further studies of the Higgs sector of thefundamental theory of the elementary particles. This thesis describes a search for a light (H+ < t) charged Higgs boson, which can be producedin the decay of the top quark, in the CMS experiment. The study considers the fully hadronic¯ﬁnal state of top quark pair decay t¯ → H± W∓ bb, where the charged Higgs boson decays astH+ → τντ, τ → hadrons + ντ with the branching fraction ℬ (H+ → τν) ≈ 1, and the associatedW boson decays to hadrons. This process {{is one of the most}} important ones for the discoveryof the light charged Higgs boson. The analysis is also sensitive to the top quark pair decay¯t¯ → H± H∓ bb. A feature of the fully hadronic ﬁnal state is that it allows the reconstruction oftthe transverse mass of the tau-neutrino system. The challenge is, however, the identiﬁcation ofthe hadronic τ decays amongst the copious production of hadronic jets in QCD multijet eventsat the LHC. Results from the ﬁrst 2. 3 fb− 1 of the proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the CMS detector during the 2011 data gathering are presented. The analysedevents were triggered requiring a hadronically decaying τ and missing transverse energy. Atoﬄine, the events had to have in addition at least three jets, of which at least one was identiﬁedas originating from a bottom quark. The main backgrounds were measured from data. The existence of a possible signal was statistically investigated with a frequentist method employing the distribution of the transverse mass of the tau-neutrino system. The results werecombined with the other ﬁnal states analysed in CMS. No signiﬁcant evidence of signal wasobserved, and an upper limit of 2 – 3 % was established on the branching fraction ℬ (t → H+ b) atthe 95 % <b>conﬁdence</b> level for <b>charged</b> Higgs boson masses between 80 and 160 GeV/ 2, with theassumption that ℬ (H+ → τν) = 1.
