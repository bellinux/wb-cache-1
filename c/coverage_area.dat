5|$|On 30 January 2006, NBN {{adopted a}} new logo and on air graphics, {{in line with}} Nine's new logo. However, the news {{department}} did not update its graphics until 15 March. During April 2007, SP Telemedia {{announced that it would}} consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN Corporation and PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media's (now Nine Entertainment Co.) A$250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not fold it into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a regional station. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire <b>coverage</b> <b>area,</b> sparing any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation).|$|E
5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> {{was once}} served by an {{electrified}} streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower {{deck of the}} Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} sensor networks with mobile {{access points}} where data at sensor nodes are collected by multiple mobile access points. Using throughput and energy efficiency as performance measures, we address the optimal <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of and the cooperation among the mobile access points. We show {{that when the}} mobile access points do not cooperate in demodulation, disjoint <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> are optimal for throughput while completely overlapped <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> are optimal for energy efficiency. When the mobile access points decode their received packets jointly, the optimal configuration {{appears to have a}} phase transition. Specifically, in order to maximize throughput, the <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of the mobile access points should be completely overlapped when SNR is smaller than a threshold and disjoint otherwise...|$|R

The show lasted {{a year before}} WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and was renamed WB17 News at Ten. In 2004, The Inquirer formed a partnership with Philadelphia's NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU's weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|When PASS Sports' {{respective}} National Hockey League and Major League Baseball broadcast {{rights to}} the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers franchises came up for renewal, Fox Sports Net made a bid for the contracts and won them both. Fox Sports decided to push the launch date of the new channel forward {{in time for the}} beginning of the 1997–98 NHL season and 1998 MLB season; Fox Sports Detroit began broadcasting on September 17, 1997. Post-Newsweek, meanwhile, concluded that its <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> was not large enough to support two RSNs and sold the remainder of its Tigers and Pistons contracts, and the contract of sportscaster John Keating, to Fox Sports Detroit. Post-Newsweek shut down PASS Sports on October 31, 1997, leaving Fox Sports Detroit as the sole regional sports network in Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service {{forecast}} office in Gray, Maine, operates NOAA Weather Radio station KZZ41 on 162.5MHz {{from the summit}} of Mount Washington. Due to its point as the highest elevation in the Northeast and the frequency range NWR broadcasts on, the station can be heard at very far distances. It has been heard in northwest Vermont (at Vergennes), much of western Maine, and northern Massachusetts (at Dracut and Salisbury, the latter of which had clear reception). Based on the official NWS <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> map, it can be heard clearly throughout most of New Hampshire, western Maine, northeast Vermont, and portions of southern Canada. During very clear conditions, KZZ41 {{has the potential to}} reach the majority of northern Massachusetts (including some northern areas of Greater Boston and much of the North Shore) as well as the majority of Vermont and Maine.|$|E
