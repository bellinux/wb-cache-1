Obedience is our universal duty and destiny; wherein whoso will not bend must break: too early and too thoroughly we cannot be trained to know that Would, {{in this world of}} ours, is as mere zero to Should, and for most part as the smallest of fractions even to Shall. Hereby was laid for me the basis of worldly Discretion, nay of Morality itself. Let me not quarrel with my upbringing. It was rigorous, too frugal, <b>compressively</b> secluded, every way unscientific: yet in that very strictness and domestic solitude might there not lie the root of deeper earnestness, of the stem from which all noble fruit must grow? Above all, how unskilful soever, it was loving, it was well-meant, honest; whereby every deficiency was helped. My kind Mother, for as such I must ever love the good Gretchen, did me one altogether invaluable service: she taught me, less indeed by word than by act and daily reverent look and habitude, her own simple version of the Christian Faith. Andreas too attended Church; yet more like a parade-duty, for which he in the other world expected pay with arrears,--as, I trust, he has received; but my Mother, with a true woman's heart, and fine though uncultivated sense, was in the strictest acceptation Religious. How indestructibly the Good grows, and propagates itself, even among the weedy entanglements of Evil! The highest whom I knew on Earth I here saw bowed down, with awe unspeakable, before a Higher in Heaven: such things, especially in infancy, reach inwards to the very core of your being; mysteriously does a Holy of Holies build itself into visibility in the mysterious deeps; and Reverence, the divinest in man, springs forth undying from its mean envelopment of Fear.

This pioneered the construction sequence now typical for concrete segment bridges of this type. After placement of the principal cables, precast concrete tiles were placed to form the initial structure. The cables were then prestressed by loading sandbags upon the tiles, followed by final concretization of the gaps between tiles. Removal of the sandbags then <b>compressively</b> stressed the concrete structure, enhancing its stiffness and durability under load. An identical bridge was later constructed parallel to the first.The concrete segment stressed ribbon footbridge shown below carries pedestrians, bicyclists, and pipelines across the Rogue River at Grants Pass, Oregon.|$|E
5000|$|Resonant {{tunneling}} diodes {{can also}} be realized using the Si/SiGe materials system. Both hole tunneling and electron tunneling have been observed. However, the performance of Si/SiGe resonant tunneling diodes was limited due to the limited conduction band and valence band discontinuities between Si and SiGe alloys. Resonant tunneling of holes through Si/SiGe heterojunctions was attempted first because of the typically relatively larger valence band discontinuity in Si/SiGe heterojunctions than the conduction band discontinuity for (<b>compressively)</b> strained Si1−xGex layers grown on Si substrates. Negative differential resistance was only observed at low temperatures but not at room temperature. Resonant tunneling of electrons through Si/SiGe heterojunctions was obtained later, with a limited peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) of 1.2 at room temperature. Subsequent developments have realized Si/SiGe RTDs (electron tunneling) with a PVCR of 2.9 with a PCD of 4.3 kA/cm2 [...] and a PVCR of 2.43 with a PCD of 282 kA/cm2 at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{start point}} is a single steel tube of {{internal}} diameter slightly less than the desired calibre. The tube is subjected to internal pressure of sufficient magnitude to enlarge the bore {{and in the process}} the inner layers of the metal are stretched in tension beyond their elastic limit. This means that the inner layers have been stretched to a point where the steel is no longer able to return to its original shape once the internal pressure has been removed. Although the outer layers of the tube are also stretched, the degree of internal pressure applied during the process is such that they are not stretched beyond their elastic limit. The reason why this is possible is that the stress distribution through the walls of the tube is non-uniform. Its maximum value occurs in the metal adjacent to the source of pressure, decreasing markedly towards the outer layers of the tube. The strain is proportional to the stress applied within elastic limit; therefore the expansion at the outer layers is less than at the bore. Because the outer layers remain elastic they attempt to return to their original shape; however, they are prevented from doing so completely by the now permanently stretched inner layers. The effect is that the inner layers of the metal are put under compression by the outer layers {{in much the same way}} as though an outer layer of metal had been shrunk on as with a built-up gun. The next step is to subject the <b>compressively</b> strained inner layers to a low temperature heat treatment which results in the elastic limit being raised to at least the autofrettage pressure employed in the first stage of the process. Finally the elasticity of the barrel can be tested by applying internal pressure once more, but this time care is taken to ensure that the inner layers are not stretched beyond their new elastic limit. The end result is an inner surface of the gun barrel with a residual compressive stress able to counterbalance the tensile stress that would be induced when the gun is discharged. In addition the material has a higher tensile stress as a result of the heat treatment process.|$|E

Therefore, the LL components are not <b>compressively</b> sampled, but fused directly. The wavelet low-frequency coefficients of shearlet high-frequency components (LH) and the wavelet high-frequency coefficients of shearlet low-frequency components (HL) are sparser than LL components, {{so they can be}} <b>compressively</b> sampled and fused in the compressive sensing domain.

40|$|Identifying a signal’s {{origin and}} how it was {{acquired}} is an impor-tant problem for digital forensics. Recently, compressive sensing has achieved substantial attention due to its ability to accurately acquire sparse signals at rates below the Nyquist rate. The increased popularity of this signal acquisition technique gives rise to a new forensic problem: is it possible to distinguish signals that have been <b>compressively</b> sensed from traditionally sampled ones? In our previous work, we addressed this problem of differentiating between traditionally acquired and <b>compressively</b> sensed images. In this paper, we examine the problem of distinguishing traditionally sampled signals from <b>compressively</b> sensed ones for a broader class of signals. We categorize those compressive sensing applicable signals into two cases: sparse signals with noise and nearly sparse signals. For each category, we discuss the traces left in a signal by compressive sensing and propose a corresponding detection scheme. Experimental results show that both of our proposed detection schemes can be effectively used to distinguish <b>compressively</b> sensed signals from traditionally sensed signals...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} joint {{framework}} wherein lifting-based, separable, image-matched wavelets are estimated from <b>compressively</b> sensed (CS) images {{and used for}} {{the reconstruction of the}} same. Matched wavelet can be easily designed if full image is available. Also matched wavelet may provide better reconstruction results in CS application compared to standard wavelet sparsifying basis. Since in CS application, we have <b>compressively</b> sensed image instead of full image, existing methods of designing matched wavelet cannot be used. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelet from the <b>compressively</b> sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper has three significant contributions. First, lifting-based, image-matched separable wavelet is designed from <b>compressively</b> sensed images and is also used to reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample data at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced considerably without any noticeable degradation in the reconstruction performance. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy is provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to improved reconstruction performance. Compared to CS-based reconstruction using standard wavelets with Gaussian sensing matrix and with existing wavelet decomposition strategy, the proposed methodology provides faster and better image reconstruction in compressive sensing application...|$|E

40|$|Solid bitumens {{found in}} {{carbonate}} rocks of the Shiwan Dashan basin, south China, are suggested {{to have been}} matured under high pressure and moderate temperature conditions. These bitumens have differ-ent geochemical characteristics from thermally matured bitumen: very high bitumen reflectance (ROB) values and compact molecular structures (bigger size of crystal nucleus, more layer number of aromatic cycle, lower lamellar distance and so on) {{in spite of the}} chemical components reflecting lower thermal maturity. Therefore these are named as <b>compressively</b> matured bitumen. The geochemical characteristics of the <b>compressively</b> matured bitumens result from increase in its crystalline degree (grain size) under high pressures, not at high temperatures. The <b>compressively</b> matured bitumens retain chemical composi-tion, molecular evolution parameters (associated with their chemical components) and hydrocarbon-pro-ducing potential similar to those of thermally less mature bitumens. High temperature and high pressure experiments proved that pressure and temperature have similar effect on the maturation indices, such as ROB values and molecular structures. The above contrasting geochemical characteristics can be used to distinguish the <b>compressively</b> matured bitumens from thermally matured bitumens. However, the maturity estimated by the ROB val-ues of primary anisotropic bitumens in the lower Triassic (T 1) carbonate rocks of the Shiwan Dashan basin, south China, is much higher than that estimated by RO, according to the published relationships between ROB and RO.
