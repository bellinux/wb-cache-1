40|$|We {{present an}} {{universal}} way to concentrate an arbitrary $N$-particle less-entangled $W$ state into a maximally entangled $W$ state with different parity <b>check</b> <b>gates.</b> It comprises two protocols. The first protocol {{is based on}} the linear optical elements say the partial parity check gate and the second one uses the quantum nondemolition (QND) to construct the complete parity check gate. Both of which can achieve the concentration task. These protocols have several advantages. First, it can obtain a maximally entangled W state only with the help of some single photons, which greatly reduces the number of entanglement resources. Second, in the first protocol, only linear optical elements are required which is feasible with current techniques. Third, in the second protocol, it can be repeated to perform the concentration step and get a higher success probability. All these advantages make it be useful in current quantum communication and computation applications. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|An {{operating}} {{simulation mode}} based on storage volume control method for multireach canal system in series was established. In {{allusion to the}} deficiency of existing controlled volume algorithm, the improved algorithm was proposed, that is the controlled volume algorithm of whole canal pools, the simulation {{results indicate that the}} storage volume and water level of each canal pool can be accurately controlled after the improved algorithm was adopted. However, for some typical discharge demand change operating conditions of canal, if the controlled volume algorithm of whole canal pool is still adopted, then it certainly will cause some unnecessary regulation, and consequently increases the disturbed canal reaches. Therefor, the idea of controlled volume operation method of continuous canal pools was proposed, and its algorithm was designed. Through simulation to practical project, the results indicate that the new controlled volume algorithm proposed for typical operating condition can comparatively obviously reduce the number of regulated <b>check</b> <b>gates</b> and disturbed canal pools for some typical discharge demand change operating conditions of canal, thus the control efficiency of canal system was improved. The controlled volume method of operation is specially suitable for large-scale water delivery canal system which possesses complex operation requirements...|$|E
40|$|Since its genesis, Pinch Analysis is {{continuously}} evolving and {{its application}} is widening, reaching new horizons. The original concept of pinch approach was quite clear and, because of flexibility of this approach, innumerable applications {{have been developed}} in the industry. Consequently, a designer gets thoroughly muddled among these flexibilities. Hence, {{there was a need}} for a rigorous and robust model which could guide the optimisation engineer on deciding the applicability of the pinch approach and direct sequential step of procedure in predefined workflow, so that the precision of approach is ensured. Exploring the various options of a novice hands-on algorithm development that can be coded and interfaced with GUI and keeping in mind the difficulties faced by designers, an effort was made to formulate a new algorithm for the optimisation activity. As such, the work aims at easing out application hurdles and providing hands-on information to the Developer for use during preparation of new application tools.

To achieve this, intermittent <b>check</b> <b>gates</b> are provided in the algorithm, which eliminate violation of predefined basic pinch rules, design philosophy, and Engineering Standards and ensure that constraints are adequately considered.

40|$|Furrow irrigation, and {{particularly}} the use of overbank siphons, {{is the most popular}} method in the irrigated cotton industry in Australia. The proportion of the use of pressurised systems in this industry is widely expected to increase but nonetheless furrow irrigation will remain dominant for the foreseeable future. However, furrow irrigation is labour–intensive and often an inefficient method of water application. The desire to reduce labour costs is driving attempts to automate the furrow system. These efforts are mainly focussed on the in-field mode of water delivery into the furrows. This paper reviews the use of overbank siphons to deliver water to the furrows and the alternative water delivery systems, that is, pipes through the bank (PTB), bankless channels, lined head ditches and gated pipe. The potential for use of each these methods in automated systems is explored. Due to limited published data on the hydraulic design of large diameter gated layflat irrigation tubes, a study was undertaken in the Hydraulics Laboratory at the University of Southern Queensland to establish its flow characteristics under low heads and high flow rates typical in the cotton industry. The reviews demonstrate that siphons are technically difficult to automate. The techniques that have successfully been used to automate <b>check</b> <b>gates</b> in bay irrigation systems can easily be adapted to bankless channels, PTBs and lined head ditches. Large diameter gated layflat irrigation tubes with appropriate outlets can supply high flow rates at low heads and can be automated...|$|E

40|$|The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is {{designed}} to bring about 1. 9 ML of Colorado River water per year to Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties in Arizona. CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the after bay of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the fore bay of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping plants downstream lift water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a canal pool. The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the fore bay of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with battery-operated electric motors. This was intended to contain water within each canal pool, if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the <b>check</b> <b>gates</b> causes surge waves in the canal. Some additional freeboard at the downstream end of each canal pool was provided to contain these surge waves. Increases in frictional resistance in the canal have reduced the available canal freeboard from design conditions. This study evaluated the available freeboard in the canal during steady conditions and during unsteady conditions, associated with a power outage. HEC-RAS was used to determine water surface elevations and available freeboard under both steady and unsteady conditions...|$|E

It is necessary to isolate semantic structural contexts in a given design netlist in order to be able to perform flexible and intelligent checks like, for example LVS (Layout Versus Schematics), ERC (Electrical Rule <b>Checks),</b> <b>gate</b> level netlist timing analysis and others. Because of that, many different algorithms were devised to support this particular segment of chip verification.

This is not efficient and limits the application of the mentioned algorithms due to the flat netlist´s extensive size.
