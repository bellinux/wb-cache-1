5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> They compose half of the population, while {{a third of the}} residents are drug offenders. Sex offenders, who may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners who require close psychiatric or medical supervision, are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E

25|$|In law enforcement, {{the term}} pedophile is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} those accused or convicted {{of child sexual abuse}} under sociolegal definitions of child (including both prepubescent children and adolescents younger than the local age of consent); however, not all child sexual offenders are pedophiles and not all pedophiles engage in sexual abuse of children. For these reasons, researchers recommend against imprecisely describing all <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> as pedophiles.|$|E
25|$|More {{offenders}} are male than female, though the percentage varies between studies (see female <b>child</b> <b>molesters).</b> The percentage of incidents {{of sexual abuse}} by female perpetrators that come {{to the attention of}} the legal system is usually reported to be between 1% and 4%. Studies of sexual misconduct in US schools with female offenders have shown mixed results with rates between 4% to 43% of female offenders. Maletzky (1993) found that, of his sample of 4,402 convicted pedophilic offenders, 0.4% were female. Another study of a non-clinical population found that, among those in their sample that had been molested, as many as a third were molested by women.|$|E

25|$|According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker (1985) and Ward et al. (1995), {{there are}} {{generally}} large {{distinctions between the}} characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have {{a larger number of}} victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims. <b>Child</b> <b>molesters,</b> pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy {{has been}} {{associated}} with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more sexual offences. For <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> psychopathy was associated with more offences. A study on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers, in which 84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that 82.4% of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) compared to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence. Despite this, it is reported that offenders with psychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual offenders) are about 2.5 {{times more likely to be}} granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders.|$|E
25|$|While Charlie, Larry, and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's {{girlfriend and}} colleague, develop their model, Larry {{receives}} {{a phone call}} informing him that {{he is no longer}} a part of the mission. At Charlie's house, Charlie and Amita learn from Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, that a MIT professor had asked NASA to look into Larry's recent behavior. As a result of Larry's homelessness, NASA decided to pull Larry from the mission. FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) take Brendan McCrary (George Newbern), a frequent visitor in the chat room that the molesters used, into custody. When the team questions McCrary, they learn, and further investigation confirms, that McCrary joined an online group which attempts to peacefully catch <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> after his daughter was raped and murdered by one. While working on their model, Charlie tells Amita that he feels bad for being happy that Larry was not going to space, and Amita tells Charlie that he should not beat himself up over his emotions. Their analysis soon reveals that the killer's preferred houses are located in Megan's Law and Jessica's Law zones.|$|E

500|$|Foster and Geto set {{the public}} {{tone of the}} {{campaign}} battling Save Our Children and were determined not to [...] "get down in the gutter with them", refusing to run an ad showing Bryant in a revealing outfit she had worn while performing in 1971, nor run commercials {{to point out that}} <b>child</b> <b>molesters</b> were primarily heterosexual. However, they also encountered difficulty when local newspapers refused to run ads that were designed to appeal to Miami's sizable Jewish community, equating Bryant's rhetoric with the same language that many Miami citizens faced during the Holocaust. Twenty-eight of Miami's thirty-four rabbis agreed with Bryant and her campaign–the president of the Miami Beach B'nai B'rith served as an officer of the Save Our Children coalition.|$|E
500|$|The general {{attitude}} about homosexuality in Miami mirrored many other {{cities across the}} country. Though gay nightlife in the city had enjoyed the same boisterous existence as other forms of entertainment in the 1930s, by the 1950s, the city government worked to shut down as many gay bars as possible and enacted laws making homosexuality and cross-dressing illegal. From 1956 to 1966, the Johns Committee of the Florida Legislature actively sought to root out homosexuals in state employment and in public universities across the state, publishing the inflammatory [...] "Purple Pamphlet," [...] which portrayed all homosexuals as predators and a dire threat {{to the children of}} Florida. [...] In the 1960s, The Miami Herald ran several stories implying the life of area homosexuals as synonymous with pimps and <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> and CBS aired a documentary entitled [...] in 1967, warning viewers that young boys were in danger from predatory men.|$|E

[...] The Quebec Association of Bishops called this [...] "incitement to hatred", and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Raëlians.|$|E

500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with <b>child</b> <b>molesters,</b> saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Florida Atlantic University Communications {{professor}} Fred Fejes, mainstream {{newspapers and}} magazines in the 1970s were hesitant to cover the issues of homosexuality or Christian fundamentalism in detail. Media prided themselves on objective reporting without Biblical judgment {{and at the same}} time, reporting was a homophobic profession that suppressed openly gay reporters and rarely addressed topics involving homosexuality. As a result, during the 1970s fundamentalist Christians began to develop broadcasting over radio and television in the forms of The 700 Club run by Pat Robertson, PTL Club hosted by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Jerry Falwell's Old Time Gospel Hour. [...] These shows originated as praise and worship-oriented, but slowly incorporated political themes interspersed with messages of Christian faith. Bryant's appearances on the 700 Club and the PTL Club netted the Save Our Children campaign $25,000 in donations, and assured her a position as a national spokesperson for traditional Christian values. However, when addressing a secular audience, Bryant was not as successful. During debates with Kunst and Shack she rarely made points that went beyond Bible quotes, and prayed when pressed to provide statistics on homosexuals as <b>child</b> <b>molesters.</b> At another appearance, she broke into [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] to take up time after she had read a pre-written statement. As California was experiencing a drought, Bryant connected it to their tolerance of liberals and homosexuals, and suggested that other morality laws should be enforced, such as those against adultery and cohabitation out of wedlock. Mike Thompson and Robert Brake soon restricted her to primarily religious shows.|$|E
