25|$|He {{studied a}} {{question}} analogous {{to that of}} the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time intervalt. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, has no fixed point. then this is not necessarily the case.|$|E

The remaining three Shirelles recorded songs for several labels, including Bell Records, RCA, and United Artists until 1971. Afterwards, they toured singing their older songs, and participated in the filming of the 1973 documentary Let the Good Times Roll, recording two songs for it. Coley returned as lead singer in 1975, replacing Owens, who left that year to pursue a solo career. In 1982 Harris {{died of a heart}} attack in the Hyatt Regency after two performances in Atlanta, Georgia, with the group. The following year, the remaining three original members performed [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" [...] with Warwick on her album How Many Times <b>Can</b> <b>We</b> <b>Say</b> Goodbye.|$|E

In 1985, Warwick contributed her voice to the multi-Grammy Award winning charity song We Are the World, along with vocalists like Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and Ray Charles. The song spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was the year's biggest hit — certified four times Platinum in the United States alone.|$|E

Brătianu personally thanked his envoy soon after the deal was sealed: [...] "only now <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that [...] has her future ensured." [...] Celebrated by those who opposed Russia, the treaty was for long kept a secret. Besides the Premier, Carp, and Maiorescu, only eight other politicians and none of the succeeding Ambassadors to Austria were informed of Brătianu's action, down to 1914. Although the Triple Alliance regrouped Romania and Austria-Hungary, Carp opposed the Austrians for discriminating against Romania on the issue of navigation, and resented their attempts to direct Germany's foreign policies.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, The Moral Landscape, {{author and}} neuroscientist Sam Harris also argues against free will. He offers one thought {{experiment}} where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, {{of a particular}} human. Harris believes {{that it is no}} longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has [...] "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes [...] "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that we see any evidence for it in the first place?" [...] adding that [...] "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes." [...] That is, he believes there is compelling evidence of absence of free will.|$|E

2500|$|Sima {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by Confucius’s Spring and Autumn Annals, which on the surface is a succinct chronology from {{the events of the}} reigns of the twelve dukes of Lu from 722 to 484 BC. Many Chinese scholars have and still do view how Confucius ordered his chronology as the ideal example of how history should be written, especially with regards to what he chose to include and to exclude; and his choice of words as indicating moral judgements [...] Seen in this light, the Spring and Autumn Annals are a moral guide to the proper way of living. Sima took this view himself as he explained: It [...] distinguishes what is suspicious and doubtful, clarifies right and wrong, and settles points which are uncertain. It calls good good and bad bad, honours the worthy, and condemns the unworthy. It preserves states which are lost and restores the perishing family. It brings to light what was neglected and restores what was abandoned. [...] Sima saw the Shiji as being in the same tradition as he explained in his introduction to chapter 61 of the Shiji where he wrote: “Some people say 'It is Heaven’s way, without distinction of persons, to keep the good perpetually supplied. ' <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> then that Po I and Shu Ch'I were good men or not? They clung to righteousness and were pure in their deeds…yet they starved to death…Robber Chih day after day killed innocent men, making mincemeat of their flesh…But in the end he lived to a great old age. For what virtue did he deserve this? …I find myself in much perplexity. Is this so-called [...] 'Way of Heaven' right or wrong?” To resolve this theodical problem, Sima argued that while the wicked may succeed and the good may suffer in their own life-times, it is the historian who ensures that in the end good triumphs. For Sima, the writing of history was no mere antiquarian pursuit, but was rather a vital moral task as the historian would “preserve memory”, and thereby ensure the ultimate victory of good over evil. [...] Along these lines, Sima wrote: “Su Ch’in and his two brothers all achieved fame among the feudal lords as itinerant strategists. Their policies laid great stress upon stratagems and shifts of power. But because Su Ch’in died a traitor’s death, the world has united in scoffing at him and has been loath to study his policies…Su Ch’in arouse from the humblest beginnings to lead the Six States in the Vertical Alliance, and this is evidence that he possessed an intelligence surpassing the ordinary person. For this reason I have set forth this account of his deeds, arranging them in proper chronological order, so that he may not forever suffer from an evil reputation and be known for nothing else”. Such a moralizing approach to history with the historian high-guiding the good and evil to provide lessons for the present could be dangerous for the historian as it could bring down the wrath of the state onto to the historian as happened to Sima himself. As such, the historian had to tread carefully and often expressed his judgements in a circuitous way designed to fool the censor.|$|E
