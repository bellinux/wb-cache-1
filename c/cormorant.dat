5|$|<b>Cormorant</b> {{fishing is}} a {{traditional}} fishing method in which trained cormorants are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, <b>cormorant</b> fishing {{has taken place in}} Japan and China since about 960 AD.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cormorant</b> {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, <b>cormorant</b> fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of <b>cormorant</b> fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Matsuo Bashō, {{a renowned}} haiku poet in the Edo period, spent many months in Gifu, {{creating}} haiku about many things, including <b>cormorant</b> fishing. Famed comedian Charlie Chaplin {{also came to}} view <b>cormorant</b> fishing on the Nagara River twice, reportedly moved by the experience.|$|E
40|$|The {{populations of}} European great <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo) and North American double-crested <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) have {{increased}} sharply {{over the last}} decades and these piscivorous birds are suspected to deplete valuable fish stocks and compete with human fisheries. Beyond direct consumption of fish, <b>cormorants</b> are accused of injuring vast numbers of prey without eating them. Using underwater video systems, one of them mounted {{onto the back of}} tame Chinese <b>cormorants,</b> we evaluated the proportion of successful pursuits of <b>cormorants</b> on live fish. Trials were conducted with 6 great <b>cormorants</b> and 9 double-crested <b>cormorants</b> and involved a total of 676 prey pursuits. We show that, although they are regarded as highly efficient predators, <b>cormorants</b> aborted about half of their pursuits. However, detailed analysis of prey-capture behaviour in double-crested <b>cormorants</b> revealed that only 0. 4 % of the prey pursued was injured without being ingested. Further studies using miniature video systems deployed on free-ranging <b>cormorants</b> are required tocomplement our knowledge of their hunting tactics...|$|R
40|$|Migration {{patterns}} of Double-crested <b>Cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) wintering {{in the southeastern}} U. S. are poorly understood. Movement data were analyzed from 28 <b>cormorants</b> captured in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi and equipped with satellite transmitters. Four (three immature, one adult) <b>cormorants</b> did not migrate and stayed in the southeastern U. S. throughout the year. During spring, <b>cormorants</b> captured in Alabama migrated east of the Mississippi River and primarily west of the Appalachian Mountains. <b>Cormorants</b> from Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi migrated north along the Mississippi River Valley, the Missouri River Valley and/or the Ohio River Valley. The earliest departure for spring migration was 26 March, whereas the latest departure was 12 May. Adult <b>cormorants</b> departed for spring migration earlier than immature <b>cormorants.</b> The average departure date for fall migration was 1 October. Mean duration of spring migration was twelve days, and <b>cormorants</b> traveled an average of 70 km per day...|$|R

5|$|The Hawar Islands Protected Area {{provides}} valuable {{feeding and}} breeding grounds {{for a variety}} of migratory seabirds, it is an internationally recognised site for bird migration. The breeding colony of Socotra <b>cormorant</b> on Hawar Islands is the largest in the world, and the dugongs foraging around the archipelago form the second largest dugong aggregation after Australia.|$|E
40|$|Great <b>Cormorants</b> _Phalacrocorax carbo_ are {{regarded}} as visually-guided, pursuit-dive foragers, {{so it would be}} expected that they have excellent vision much like aerial predators, such as hawks which detect and pursue prey from a distance. However, my research shows that underwater the visual acuity of <b>Cormorants</b> is surprisingly poor (in fact, similar or worse than unaided humans under water) and very inferior to that of aerial predatory birds. I suggest that <b>Cormorants</b> are able to detect typical prey items only at close range and conclude that <b>cormorants</b> are not the aquatic equivalent of hawks. It seems that their efficient hunting involves the use of specialised foraging techniques which employ rapid neck extension to capture prey that <b>cormorants</b> flush from hiding places; much like the foraging techniques of herons. <b>Cormorants</b> seem to be hunting an &#x 201 c;escaping blur&#x 201 d;. Like herons, the eye movements and visual fields of <b>cormorants</b> allow visual scanning for escaping prey in a wide arc about the head. The ability of <b>cormorants</b> to see prey held in the mouth may help to aid its identification when it is brought to the surface before swallowing. |$|R
5|$|Rasmussen’s {{early work}} was largely focused on {{studies of the}} systematics, ecology and {{behaviour}} of Patagonian seabirds, notably <b>cormorants.</b> She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged <b>cormorants,</b> and used plumage and behavioural patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags.

5|$|In June 2011, nine VH-71s were {{purchased}} for $164million by Canada {{for use as}} spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 <b>Cormorant</b> search and rescue helicopter, which is also based upon the AW101. The transferred VH-71s were stripped of sensitive parts, a total of seven remained in an airworthy condition. In 2013, media reports stated Canada is studying whether up to four of the VH-71s can be certified for operational use; manufacturer AgustaWestland has openly stated {{their support for the}} regeneration initiative.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been hunted for food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured and bred as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with <b>cormorant</b> fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for quill pens and for fletching arrows.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cormorants</b> {{vanished}} in the 19th century, but have since returned and are flourishing. This {{has contributed to}} the increase in the population of sea eagles, who feed on <b>cormorants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Guanay <b>cormorants</b> Phalacrocorax bougainvilli are {{distributed}} {{mostly on the}} Pacific coast of Peru and northern Chile. A small population of around 50 pairs was described on the Patagonian Atlantic coast in the late 1960 s. Further records have revealed a progressive decrease of this population. During 1999 we looked for guanay <b>cormorants</b> at those Atlantic colonies where the species was recorded in the past. Only four individuals were detected in one colony (Punta Lobería), {{and all of them}} were mated with king <b>cormorants</b> P. albiventer. In addition, we recorded hybrids between guanay and king <b>cormorants</b> mated with pure king and imperial <b>cormorants</b> P. atriceps. Causes of the population decline are unknown. Since guanay <b>cormorants</b> inhabiting the Atlantic coast could be a genetically differentiated population, we emphasize the need for molecular studies.

5|$|Located on the {{alluvial}} plain of the Nagara River, Gifu has {{taken advantage of}} the surrounding natural resources to create both traditional industries (including Mino washi and agriculture) and tourism opportunities like <b>cormorant</b> fishing. Mount Kinka, one of the city's major symbols, is home to a nationally designated forest and Gifu Castle, a replica of Nobunaga's former castle. Gifu also hosts many festivals and events throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) {{operates}} {{a variant of}} the AW101, designated CH-149 <b>Cormorant,</b> in the air-sea rescue role. Another variant, designated VH-71 Kestrel, was being developed to serve in the US presidential transport fleet; however, the program was cancelled. Civil operators also use AW101s in roles such as passenger and VIP transportation. The type has been deployed to active combat theatres, such as in support of coalition forces during the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{visitors}} to the island are the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica baueri), grey-tailed tattler (Tringa brevipes), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres interpres), red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea). Other observed visitors include the great <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), sanderling (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 23 - 24) A {{study of}} feeding efficiency of olivaceous <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax olivaceous) {{was conducted at}} Laguna Nahuel Ruca, a coastal lagoon in the Argentine pampas. A population of thirty <b>cormorants</b> consisting of eighteen adults and twelve immatures was observed. Feeding observations were conducted between 0500 and 0700 from December 29, 1983, to February 15, 1984. Immature olivaceous <b>cormorants</b> exhibit deferred maturity demonstrated by their inferior foraging abilities. Adult <b>cormorants</b> made 3. 5 successful dives for every unsuccessful dive whereas immature <b>cormorants</b> made 1. 5 successful dives for every unsuccessful dive. In order to compensate for inefficient foraging technique, immatures made {{a greater number of}} dives by feeding for longer periods. As a result, immatures probably would not be physiologically able to obtain the additional energy required for reproduction and care of young until foraging techniques are fully developed. Delayed maturation of olivaceous <b>cormorants</b> is a device which has evolved through natural selection so that when the birds reproduce, {{they will be able to}} supply sufficient food for a maximum number of offspring...|$|R

50|$|In {{the span}} of one month, commencing in February 2014, hunters culled 11,653 double-crested <b>cormorants</b> during a {{licensed}} action in South Carolina. 1,225 permits were issued to hunters to kill <b>cormorants</b> during this period. One hunter alone reported killing 278 birds. Similar hunts occurred in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin in 2013, resulting in a combined total cull of 21,312 <b>cormorants.</b> The culling was unsuccessfully opposed by the Audubon Society.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), {{shoveller}} (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera).

The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about {{placing the}} project on hold or {{canceling}} it because of its high cost: over $13billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and taking delivery of nine VH-71s. In {{the aftermath of the}} cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold onto Canada for $164 million, where they were used as a source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 <b>Cormorant</b> search-and-rescue helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great <b>cormorant.</b> Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
40|$|Demographic information, such as {{geographic}} {{segregation of}} sexes and sex ratio data, {{is needed to}} develop, model and evaluate conservation and management strategies for wildlife. A variety of physiological, behavioral and environmental factors can influence segregation of sexes and sex ratios, many of which originate with density- dependent processes. Departure from 50 : 50 sex ratios of double-crested <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected during control efforts in breeding and wintering areas across their eastern range of the USA were evaluated using using a Z-test as well as Stouffer’s weighted Z-tests. In addition, a specifically-designed randomization {{test was used to}} evaluate density-dependent effects on primary sex ratios in <b>cormorants</b> from egg collections and colony nest count data over a 21 -year period. <b>Cormorants</b> collected from breeding colonies were strongly male-biased, whereas <b>cormorants</b> collected from feeding flocks were slightly biased toward females. <b>Cormorants</b> were partly segregated by sex on the wintering grounds, with significantly more males found in areas with intensive channel catfish aquaculture. The null hypothesis that females produced a balanced sex ratio independent of number of nesting <b>cormorants</b> was rejected: more male embryos were produced during rapid population growth, whereas at maximum nesting number more female embryos were produced. Once populations stabilized, the sex ratio was more equal. This examination of sex ratios indicates that different management methods and locations result in sex-biased culling of <b>cormorants.</b> Sex-biased culling in <b>cormorants</b> could make population reduction efforts more efficient and reduce overall take. We suggest further research to examine density-dependent effects on primary sex ratios documented here...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cormorants</b> of the {{subspecies}} Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis {{breed in}} large numbers in the Baltic Sea. They migrate to the Mediterranean region to winter and are then replaced in the Baltic by wintering individuals of the Norwegian population of the nominate subspecies carbo. <b>Cormorants</b> bred in the Baltic during prehistoric times too, but as evident from a comparison of skeletal measurements in present-day and prehistoric <b>Cormorants,</b> these individuals belonged to the nominate subspecies carbo. The Swedish sub-fossil record of the <b>Cormorants</b> available for study, does not include any re-mains small enough to suggest the presence of sinensis.

Concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, glucose, uric acid, total protein, and albumin, and the activity levels of alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase were determined in serum. Total leukocyte concentrations in these double-crested <b>cormorants</b> were higher than the limited ranges reported for <b>cormorants</b> of other species, possibly due to subclinical infection with the liver trematode Amphimerus elongatus, and to differences in species and age...|$|R
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus.

Major elements of this campaign include more dependence on locally grown food; traditional culture and arts; and activities to increase citizens’ participation in their community. In addition to slow food, Gifu also hopes to include slow industry (traditional crafts), slow education (studying quality of life), and slow tourism (represented by <b>cormorant</b> fishing).|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned <b>cormorants,</b> Cape <b>cormorants</b> and bank <b>cormorants.</b> This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|R
