25|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{are created by}} cutting pieces of {{coloured}} glass to match a drawn template and setting them into place in a mesh of lead <b>cames</b> and supporting the whole with rigid metal bars. Details such as facial features can be painted {{on the surface of}} the glass, and stains of bright yellow applied to enliven white areas. The effect is to add an appearance of brilliance and richness to a church interior, while the media lends itself to narratives. If the lead is properly maintained, stained glass is extremely durable and many windows have been in place for centuries.|$|E
25|$|His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design {{elements}} (often {{based on}} plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets and other fittings. He made innovative {{use of new}} building materials such as precast concrete blocks, glass bricks and zinc <b>cames</b> (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used Pyrex glass tubing as a major element in the Johnson Wax Headquarters. Wright {{was also one of}} the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the very first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting).|$|E

The true {{extent of the}} damage is unknown, though {{the fact that the}} lead <b>cames</b> holding the west windows together survived the conflagration intact suggests contemporary accounts of the terrible devastation may have been exaggerated. Either way, the opportunity was taken to begin a complete rebuilding of the choir and nave in the latest style. The undamaged western towers and façade were incorporated into the new works, as was the earlier crypt, effectively limiting the designers of the new building to the same general plan as its predecessor. In fact the present building is only marginally longer than Fulbert's cathedral.|$|E

25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead <b>cames</b> {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breakdown}} of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal <b>cames</b> and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, {{this is not the}} case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements. [...] For example, the <b>cames</b> that make up the matrix of a stained glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8). [...] Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing, but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare’s Church 2009).|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of stained glass was originally created to function {{as part of the}} building envelope, separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions. [...] As a result, most historic glazing that has been left in situ is subjected to a constant onslaught of harmful conditions including (but not limited to): UV light from sunlight, extreme weather conditions, indoor and outdoor man-made pollution, and biological damage caused by pests such as pigeons, bats, and various micro-organisms (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] Environmental influences also {{play a role in the}} continuing deterioration of metal <b>cames</b> and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).|$|E

50|$|Border <b>cames</b> are U-channel <b>cames</b> {{that are}} used on the outside edges of works. The {{selection}} of the metal of the came may vary depending upon the work. For instance, zinc may be a solid selection for free-hanging panels, because it is rigid, but lightweight. Architectural panels, on the other hand, are often enclosed in framing and therefore do not require a hard metal.|$|E
50|$|Zinc makes a lightweight, {{strong and}} rigid came, which {{lends itself to}} glasswork {{projects}} that don't have many curved lines, are large, or {{have a number of}} straight lines that require greater support than lead would afford.
