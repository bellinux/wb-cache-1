40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum in either naturally occurring (N-O) or experimentally induced (E-I) plaqueassociated gingivitis. Material and Methods: Thirty-seven periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated {{in real life}} conditions (N-O gingivitis) as well as after 21 days of experimental gingivitis trial (E-I gingivitis). During the experimental gingivitis trial, in one maxillary quadrant (test quadrant), gingival inflammation was induced by oral hygiene abstention, while in the contralateral (<b>control)</b> <b>quadrant,</b> oral hygiene was routinely continued. IL- 1 b concentrations in N-O and E-I gingivitis were investigated for IL- 1 B 13954 and IL- 1 B 511 gene polymorphisms. Results: (i) GCF IL- 1 b concentrations in E-I gingivitis were significantly higher compared with N-O gingivitis; (ii) an intra-individual correlation between GCF concentrations of IL- 1 b detected in N-O and E-I gingivitis was observed in control quadrants, but not in test quadrants; (iii) IL- 1 b concentration in GCF was associated with IL- 1 B 13954 genotype only at test quadrants; (iv) IL- 1 b was detectable in serum only at low levels in {{a limited number of}} subjects, without difference between gingivitis conditions.

40|$|AIM: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{validate}} a randomized, split-mouth, localized experimental gingivitis model and to identify subjects with different gingivitis susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In each of 96 healthy subjects, one maxillary quadrant was randomly assigned as "test" (experimental gingivitis) and the contralateral quadrant as "control". Plaque index (PlI), gingival index (GI), gingival crevicular fluid volume (GCF), and angulated bleeding score (AngBS) were recorded in both quadrants at days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Cumulative plaque exposure (CPE), i. e. PlI over time, was calculated. Day- 21 GCF was standardized according to CPE, and residuals of GCF on CPE were calculated. Two subpopulations were then defined, based on upper and lower quartiles of GCF-residual distribution and were, respectively, identified as "high-responder" (HR; n= 24) and "low-responder" (LR; n= 24). RESULTS: At test quadrants, all parameters significantly increased throughout the trial, while in <b>control</b> <b>quadrants,</b> PlI, GI, and AngBS remained low. Significant differences were noted between test and <b>control</b> <b>quadrants</b> on days 7, 14, and 21 for all parameters. Significant increases in GI, AngBS, and GCF were observed in test quadrants {{over the course of the}} study in both HR and LR groups. Significant differences were noted between HR and LR groups for all gingivitis parameters on day 21 in test quadrants, without any significant differences in PlI or CPE between the groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the microbiological profile and the calprotectin expression in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in spontaneous and experimentally induced gingival inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated in real life conditions (N-O gingivitis) as well as after 21 days of experimental gingivitis trial (E-I gingivitis). During the experimental gingivitis trial, in one maxillary quadrant (test quadrant), gingival inflammation was induced by oral hygiene abstention, while in the contralateral (<b>control)</b> <b>quadrant,</b> oral hygiene was routinely continued. RESULTS: The {{results of the study}} showed that (1) the microbiological profile of quadrants where gingival inflammation was experimentally induced (i. e., E-I test quadrants) differed significantly from that of either quadrants where gingival inflammation was controlled by proper plaque control (i. e., E-I control quadrants) or quadrants with N-O gingivitis, and (2) GCF calprotectin was significantly higher at E-I test quadrants compared to either E-I control quadrants or quadrants with N-O gingivitis. A positive intrasubject correlation was found between GCF concentration of calprotectin at sites presenting N-O and E-I gingivitis. CONCLUSIONS: N-O and E-I gingivitis showed a different microbiological profile of the subgingival environment. GCF calprotectin is a reliable marker of gingival inflammation, and its concentration in N-O gingivitis is correlated with its expression in E-I gingivitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The modality of plaque accumulation seems to affect the subgingival microbiological profile associated with a gingivitis condition. Calprotectin levels in GCF may be regarded as a promising marker of the individual susceptibility to develop gingival inflammation in response to experimentally induced plaque accumulation...|$|E

Ethical approval and study registration (Reg no: 14 / 9 / 6) was finalized prior to commencement of the study. A split mouth randomised control trial was performed on 25 participants (who presented at the Oral Medicine and Periodontology Department of the University of the Western Cape) diagnosed with active, chronic periodontitis. In order to standardise the split mouth design the quadrants 1 & 4 were assessed together as a set and quadrants 2 & 3 were assessed as a set. A set of these quadrants were randomly assigned to either the test or control quadrants after conventional management was performed in all four quadrants. The base line bacterial colony collection (Micro-IDent®- 11, Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) and the clinical parameters were assessed prior to the commencement of conventional management and were reassessed at the 6 week re-evaluation visit. The set of test quadrants were treated with the diode laser {{as an adjunct to}} the preceding conventional management. The <b>control</b> <b>quadrant</b> only received the conventional management. Evaluation of the results demonstrated that the diode laser produced no statistical decrease in the bacterial parameters in the periodontal pockets and resulted in a statistical increase of C. showae (Cs) and T. denticola (Td).

40|$|Future {{solar sail}} missions, such as NASA's Solar Polar Imager Vision, will require sails with {{dimensions}} {{on the order}} of 50 - 500 m. We are examining a square sail design with moving mass (trim control mass, TCM) and quadrant rotation primary actuators plus pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs) at the mast tips for backup attitude <b>control.</b> <b>Quadrant</b> rotation is achieved via roll stabilizer bars (RSB) at the mast tips. At these sizes, given the gossamer nature of the sail supporting structures, flexible modes may be low enough to interact with the control system, especially as these actuators are located on the flexible structure itself and not on the rigid core. This paper develops a practical analysis of the flexible interactions using state-space systems and modal data from finite element models of the system. Torsion and bending of the masts during maneuvers could significantly affect the function of the actuators while activation of the membrane modes could adversely affect the thrust vector direction and magnitude. Analysis of the RSB and TCM dynamics for developing high-fidelity simulations is included. For control analysis of the flexible system, standard finite-element models of the flexible sail body are loaded and the modal data is used to create a modal coordinate state-space system. Key parameters include which modes to include, which nodes are of interest for force inputs and displacement outputs, connecting nodes through which external forces and torques are applied from the flex body to the core, any nominal momentum in the system, and any steady rates. The system is linearized about the nominal attitude and rate. The state-space plant can then be analyzed with a state-space controller, and Bode, Nyquist, step and impulse responses generated. The approach is general for any rigid core with a flexible appendage. This paper develops a compensator for a simple two-mass flex system and extrapolates the results to the solar sail. A finite element model of the 20 m solar sail by ATK Space Systems, recently validated in ground tests, is used to demonstrate the sail analysis approach...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is a multifactorial, {{inflammatory disease}} that, when left untreated, {{results in the}} destruction of tooth-supporting structures including adjacent bone. Laser therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical therapy for treatment of moderate-severe chronic periodontitis has been increasingly advocated yet controversial and experimental evidence has not yet convincingly supported the use of laser treatment. Objective: The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical {{study was to examine the}} clinical efficacy of laser therapy (Er,Cr:YSGG) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in comparison to conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy alone 3 months after therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis. Materials & Methods: Eighteen matched and paired quadrants were evaluated in five patients and randomly treated by SRP alone (control group) or by SRP + Laser (test group). Clinical measurements (PPD, CAL, REC, BOP, PI) were recorded before treatment at baseline and at 3 months following treatment. Subgingival plaque samples of one patient were taken at baseline and 3 months after treatment and were evaluated for changes using DGGE. Results: Non-surgical treatment and subsequent healing and follow-up was uneventful in all cases. Baseline values for PD, REC, CAL, BOP and PI were not significantly different between the test and control groups (p< 0. 05) and baseline quadrant means for PD, REC and CAL for the test and <b>control</b> treated <b>quadrants</b> presented with similar measures of 3. 7 1. 7 mm and 3. 6 1. 5 mm, 0. 3 0. 9 mm and 0. 3 0. 6 mm, 4. 1 2. 0 mm and 3. 8 1. 7 mm, respectively. Values for PD, REC, CAL, BOP and PI improved significantly 3 months after treatment in both test and control groups. Three month analysis of laser treated quadrants revealed a mean PD reduction of 0. 8 1. 3 mm, a mean REC increase of 0. 3 0. 7 mm, and a mean gain in CAL of 0. 5 1. 4 mm. Evaluation of <b>control</b> <b>quadrants</b> at 3 months revealed a mean PD reduction of 0. 6 1. 1 mm, a mean REC increase of 0. 2 0. 7 mm, and a mean gain in CAL of 0. 3 1. 4 mm.

40|$|Background: White spots {{can appear}} on teeth during fixed brace {{treatment}} because of early decay around the brace attachments. Fluoride is effective at reducing decay in susceptible individuals and is routinely prescribed in various different forms to patients during orthodontic treatment. Objectives: To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of fluoride in preventing white spots during orthodontic treatment and to compare the different modes of delivery of fluoride. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group’s Trials Register (to 22 August 2002); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 1980 to week July 2003). Authors of trials were contacted for further data. Selection criteria: Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: a randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trial, involving the use of a fluoride containing product compared with no use or use of a non-fluoride control and enamel demineralisation was assessed during or after orthodontic treatment. Data collection and analysis: Six reviewers independently, in duplicate, extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in {{the presence or absence of}} white spots between experimental and control patients for parallel design studies, and between experimental and <b>control</b> <b>quadrants,</b> for split mouth design studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken for the items assessed for quality and publication bias.

Patients were asked to assess the subjective preference of the type of treatment with Visual Analogue Scale (Vas) especially designed and immediately administered after the treatment. Probing pocket depth and plaque index had a parallel improvement in both groups, while the bleeding on probing improved significantly in test group. The majority of patients (23 to 30, 76, 6 %) has expressed preference with VAS for the treatment with new tips. The new tips created for periodontal maintaining can be really advantageous in terms of reduction of plaque and bleeding indexes; the main point in favor of these tips is the reduction of the discomfort for the patient. Finally this approach tends to be less time consuming than a manual instrumentation method...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because {{of their}} {{capability}} of secreting proteinases, macrophages {{play a central}} role in the growth and rupture of aneurysms. Noninvasive imaging of macrophages therefore may yield valuable information about the pathogenesis of aneurysm disease. We studied uptake of the macrophage-specific contrast agent ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) in the walls of aneurysms and normal-sized aortas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients with an aortic and five patients with an iliac aneurysm and 11 age-matched controls were identified in a database of 239 patients who underwent evaluations for the staging of prostate cancer. USPIO-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced MDCT were performed for all patients. The presence of USPIO was assessed with an iron-sensitive MRI sequence. Quantification consisted of counting the number of quadrants with USPIO-induced subendothelial signal voids. A chi-square test was used to analyze the significance of the difference between the number of USPIO-positive quadrants in the aneurysm group and that in the control group. RESULTS: The number of USPIO-positive quadrants was significantly higher in the aneurysm than in the <b>control</b> group: 158 <b>quadrants</b> (4. 2 %) in the aneurysm group and 13 quadrants (0. 4 %) in the control group (p < 0. 001). Two abdominal aortic aneurysms accounted for 90 % (154 / 171) of all USPIO-positive quadrants. CONCLUSION: USPIO uptake is limited or absent in the wall of normal-sized aortas and most aneurysms. However, individual abdominal aortic aneurysms exhibit high levels of USPIO uptake, indicative of extensive macrophage infiltration in the aneurysm wall. Future research should focus on the predictive value of USPIO uptake for growth and rupture of aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Aim Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a {{key role}} in the tissue {{destruction}} characteristic of chronic periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of MMP and TIMP polymorphisms with chronic periodontitis in two populations. Material and Methods A total of 34 polymorphisms spanning 12 MMP and 2 TIMP genes were genotyped in 401 individuals from Brazil (99 cases with chronic periodontitis and 302 controls), and 274 individuals from the US (70 cases and 204 controls). Individuals were considered cases if presenting at least three teeth exhibiting sites of clinical attachment loss = 5 mm in two different <b>quadrants.</b> <b>Controls</b> were characterized by absence of clinical attachment loss and no sites with probing depth > 3 mm. MMP 3 and TIMP 1 mRNA expression was evaluated in healthy and diseased periodontal tissues. Results TIMP 1 showed association with chronic periodontitis in the Brazilian population (for rs 5906435, p = 0. 0004), whereas MMP 3 showed association in the US population (for rs 679620, p = 0. 0003; and rs 650108, p = 0. 002) and in the Brazilian population (for rs 639752, p = 0. 005). MMP 3 and TIMP 1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in diseased tissues when compared to control tissues. Conclusions Our results further support a role for variations in MMP 3 in chronic periodontitis and report a novel association with TIMP 1. These genes may be considered additional candidate genes for chronic periodontitis.

5000|$|A {{controlled}} experiment often compares {{the results obtained}} from experimental samples against control samples, which are practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect whose effect is being tested (the independent variable). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group (treatment group); and the one receiving the placebo or regular treatment would be the control one. In many laboratory experiments it is good practice to have several replicate samples for the test being performed and have both a positive control and a negative control. The results from replicate samples can often be averaged, or {{if one of the}} replicates is obviously inconsistent with the results from the other samples, it can be discarded as being the result of an experimental error (some step of the test procedure may have been mistakenly omitted for that sample). Most often, tests are done in duplicate or triplicate. A positive control is a procedure similar to the actual experimental test but is known from previous experience to give a positive result. A negative control is known to give a negative result. The positive control confirms that the basic conditions of the experiment were able to produce a positive result, even if none of the actual experimental samples produce a positive result. The negative control demonstrates the base-line result obtained when a test does not produce a measurable positive result. Most often the value of the negative control is treated as a [...] "background" [...] value to subtract from the test sample results. Sometimes the positive <b>control</b> takes the <b>quadrant</b> of a standard curve.|$|R
40|$|PT. Waru Buana is {{a company}} running in wood {{processing}} industry sector, the main product is flooring. The raw material is jati wood both log and sawn timber. The location is in Grogolan area, Winong-Gempol Village, Pasuruan, East Java. This company uses legal and high qualified raw material from Perum Perhutani. That condition causes the price rather high, therefore that company focuses on export markets that need better quality compared with domestic markets in general still accept low qualified flooring products. This research uses descriptive method, that is performed by data collecting to answer the existing problems and performed in case study, so that the conclusion will be still related with the happening problems. Beside that to get more complete information is performed by spreading questioners and interviews to the management of that company to determine the respondents is performed purposively, that is performed by considering that the related respondents have skill and competence in observed sector. The number of respondents is five persons from {{the management of the}} company. Analysis of internal company includes the functions of production, marketing, human resources and organization, research and development and finance. Meanwhile analysis of external company includes analysis of economic, social and cultural, competitive technological and political sectors. Internal factors having been identified as strength and weakness of company are then appraised the quality and the rank by respondents by using paired comparison method, recapitulation of the result from evaluation Matrix of internal actor valuation (IFE) and for external factors having been identified as opportunity and threat, recapitulation of the result from the evaluation is managed in an evaluation Matrix External Factor Evaluation (EFE). Based on analysis of Matrix IFE and EFE above, the position of company can be determined with coordinate using Matrix Internal-External (Matrix IE). From the result of coordinate calculation by using the IE Matrix it can be known that the company's position is in <b>Quadrant</b> <b>controlled</b> by Grow and Build Strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this study to find out with an exact {{measuring}} system whether an implant-free and anatomically positioned ACL reconstruction with a Patellar tendon transplant is able to restore rotatory stability of the knee joint. Methods 20 patients with unilateral ACL rupture and an intact contralateral knee were included in this study. The ACL was reconstructed usinf the medial third of the patellar tendon. The transplant was anatomically positioned, <b>controlled</b> using the <b>quadrant</b> method on the femoral side and the impingement test on the tibial side and fixated on both sides with the implant-free press-fit-technique. The bone blocks were specifically aligned to achieve a reconstruction of both the anteromedial and posterolateral bundle. In very large joints, this corresponds to a central bundle reconstruction. Preoperative, the rotatory laxity of the injured and the contralateral intact knee were measured in 0 ° and 25 ° of flexion. These measurements were repeated postoperative. To avoid measurement errors caused by the muscular function all measurements were performed under general anesthesia. To achieve an objective and quantifiable measurement of the rotatory laxity, all tests were done using an active optoelectronical motion-analysis system (LUKOTRONIC AS 100). Results 0 ° flexion: While preoperatively, the mean rotatory laxity in the ACL-deficient knee was 14. 9 ° higher compared to the ACL-intact knee, it was 5. 9 ° less than in the intact knee after the reconstruction. 25 ° flexion: Here, the mean rotatory laxity in the ACL-deficient knee was 5. 7 ° higher preoperatively, postoperatively it was 11. 3 ° less in comparison to the intact knee. The reduction of the rotatory instability that could be achieved through the surgery was highly significant (p< 0, 001). Conclusions: If all relevant aspects of an anatomical reconstruction (form, alignment and position of the transplant) are considered, the Patellar tendon transplant fixated in press-fit-technique is able to widely restore the rotatory stability identical to the intact contralateral knee with a certain risk of overcorrection. This is relevant to the clinical practice, because this technique is completely implant-free, which makes it more attractive from an economical point of view...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compose between hand scaling with abd without the {{calculus}} solvent gel (sofscale) and ultrasonic instrumentation at clinical and SEM level. 30 patients belonging to the age group of 17 - 50 year were selected. Patients selected were subjected to three different scaling modalities namely hand scaling (control), hand scaling using sofscale (Experimental quadrant A) and ultrasonic scaling (Experimental quadrant B), in three different quadrants. Case report forms were used to document the tooth sensitivity, soft tissue pain after scaling, patient preference of instrumentation, ease of calculus removal, patient comfort, soft tissue irritation, time taken for scaling, Bleeding while scaling, pre and post operative sulcus bleeding index. In addition to the clinical criteria, the teeth treated were extracted and evaluated using the scanning electron microscope to show potential effects on cemntal surfaces. No difference in tooth sensitivity was appreciated between <b>control</b> and experimental <b>quadrant</b> A. There was a higher degree of tooth sensitivity when treated with ultrasonic. Patients in control group appreciated a higher degree of soft tissue pain. Hand scaling using softscale produced a lesser amount of pain and treatment with ultrasoincs was the least painful. Most of the patients preferred ultrasonic scaling (70 &#x 0025;) Calculus removal was easier. Hand scaling using sofscale gel results in more patient comfort when compared to hand scaling alone. There was no significant difference in patient comfort between handscaling using sofscale and ultrasonic scaling. The percentage of reduction of sulcus bleeding index showed no difference between the 3 scaling modalities SEM evaluation revealed that there was no significant difference the 3 scaling modalities in relation to residual calculus, cleaning efficiency and damage to the root surface. This study concluded that treatment with sofscale gel appears to be safe and effective method for removal calculus as this did not damage cemental surfaces, nor did it cause any damage to soft tissue.
