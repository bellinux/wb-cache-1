40|$|Model-based capital {{regulation}} {{is considered to}} be one of the key innovations of Basel II. The objective of this innovation was to make capital charges more sensitive to risk. Using data from the German credit register, and employing a difference-indifference identification strategy, we empirically investigate how the introduction of this regulation affected the quantity and the composition of bank lending. We find that <b>credit</b> <b>supplied</b> by banks that introduced the model-based approach exhibits a higher sensitivity to model-based PDs as compared with <b>credit</b> <b>supplied</b> by banks that remained under the traditional approach. Interestingly, however, we find that risk models used for regulatory purposes tend to underpredict actual default rates. There is no such prediction error in PDs for loans under the traditional approach...|$|R

50|$|The {{increase}} of <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> to private sectors was largely {{to be blamed}} for the housing bubble in the Baltic states, due to the availability of financing from foreign lenders (predominantly Scandinavian banks). Domestic banks (notably Parex Bank, a national bank in Latvia) were largely reliant on rolling their foreign loans (denominated in Euro) with large exposure to the real estate sector. The condition was further worsened due {{to the absence of}} loan-to-value ratio as well as negative real interest rate which spurred speculators to drive the market housing demand higher. The <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> was then deteriorated {{at the peak of the}} boom as both foreign and domestic banks tightened lending standards due to the higher credit risk in the region. Subsequently, real estate market were dragged down, further deteriorate credit quality, forced banks to further tighten lending standards.|$|E

50|$|Expost policy intervention: Some {{experts suggest}} that the Central Bank should provide {{downside}} insurance {{in the event of}} a liquidity crisis. This could take the form of direct provision of insurance to asset-holders against losses or a commitment to purchasing assets in the event that the asset price falls below a threshold. Such ‘Asset Purchases’ will help drive up the demand and consequently the price of the asset in question, thereby easing the liquidity shortage faced by borrowers. Alternatively, the Government could provide ‘deposit insurance’, where it guarantees that a promised return will be paid to all those who withdraw. In the framework of the Diamond Dybvig model, demand deposit contracts with government deposit insurance help achieve the optimal equilibrium if the Government imposes an optimal tax to finance the deposit insurance. Alternative mechanisms through which the Central Bank could intervene are direct injection of equity into the system {{in the event of a}} liquidity crunch or engaging in a debt for equity swap. It could also lend through the discount window or other lending facilities, providing credit to distressed financial institutions on easier terms. Ashcraft, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2010) argue that controlling the <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> through such lending facilities with low margin requirements is an important second monetary tool (in addition to the interest rate tool), which can raise asset prices, lower bond yields, and ease the funding problems in the financial system during crises. While there are such benefits of intervention, there is also costs. It is argued by many economists that if the Central Bank declares itself as a ‘Lender of Last Resort’ (LLR), this might result in a moral hazard problem, with the private sector becoming lapse and this may even exacerbate the problem. Many economists therefore assert that the LLR must only be employed in extreme cases and must be a discretion of the Government rather than a rule.|$|E
40|$|Shifts in <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> {{could have}} a bearing on house prices e. g. through {{financial}} innovations and changes in regulation independently {{of the existence of}} a bank lending channel of monetary policy. This paper assesses the responses of US house prices to an exogenous <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shock and compares them with the effects from variations in <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> associated with a bank lending channel. The contribution of the study is twofold. First, innovations in <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> are identified using a mortgage mix variable, thereby accounting for the market-based financial intermediaries. As a robustness check a survey variable of bank lending standards for mortgage loans is also used. Second, the policy-induced <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> effect on house prices is disentangled and compared with the effect from an exogenous <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shock. It is shown that in the first 3 years <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks affect house prices exogenously rather than through the bank lending channel. Monetary policy has still a large impact on house prices, even when the bank lending channel is ‘turned off’...|$|E
40|$|I use oil {{and natural}} gas shale discoveries as a natural {{experiment}} to identify whether local access to finance matters for economic outcomes. Shale discoveries lead to large un-expected personal wealth windfalls, which result in an exogenous increase in local bank deposits and a positive local <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shock. Using this shock I examine whether local <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> influences economic outcomes and how local banking market struc-ture affects the importance of <b>credit</b> <b>supply.</b> After a <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shock, the number of business establishments in industries more reliant on external finance increases 4. 6 % relative to those less reliant on external finance. This increase is more than five times higher in counties dominated by small banks relative to all other counties. After banking deregulation, the adoption of lending technology and increased securitization of loans, local <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> still matters, especially in areas dominated by small banks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} whether equity {{holdings of}} international lenders affect {{the transmission of}} <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks from developed countries to emerging markets. I exploit the 1998 Russian debt default as an exogenous <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shock to international lenders and trace out the impact on bank lending in Peru. I find that after the shock international lenders with equity holdings in Peruvian banks increased financing to banks in Peru, while international lenders without equity holdings reduced financing to banks in Peru. This effect could be driven either by differential <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> from international lenders or by heterogeneity in credit demand across banks. I control for credit demand by examining firms that have loans from both banks with international equity holders and banks without international equity holders and find evidence for the <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> explanation. The change in <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> has real effects: I find a lower bankruptcy rate among firms borrowing from banks with international equity holders than among firms borrowing from banks without international equity holders. These results suggest that equity holdings of international lenders mitigate the transmission of <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks to emerging markets. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how bank ownership influenced the <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> {{during the recent}} financial crisis in Russia, where the banking sector consists of a mix of state-controlled banks, foreign-owned banks, and domestic private banks. To estimate <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> changes, we employ an exhaustive dataset for Russian banks that covers the crisis period and apply an original approach based on stochastic frontier analysis. Our findings suggest bank ownership affected <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> during the financial crisis and that the crisis led to an overall decrease in the <b>credit</b> <b>supply.</b> Relative to domestic private banks foreign-owned banks reduced their <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> more and state-controlled banks less. This supports the hypothesis that foreign banks have a “lack of loyalty” to domestic actors during a crisis, {{as well as the}} view that an objective function of state-controlled banks leads them to support the economy during economic downturns. bank; credit policy; foreign ownership; state ownership; stochastic frontier analysis...|$|E

We identify standard macroeconomic and <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks by sign and zero restrictions. In contrast to the previous literature, different types of credit shocks are distinguished in our paper: a risk assessment and a policy shock. Our main findings are the following. First, we demonstrate that both <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> and macroeconomic shocks explain the variance of endogenous variables at roughly similar order of magnitude. Second, it is shown that <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks {{do not have a}} dominant role in the decline of the Hungarian economy over the crisis period that started in 2008, although their contribution was non-negligible. Third, the importance of unidentified shocks increased in the crisis period. Bayesian SVAR, zero and sign restrictions, <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how banking market concentration affects small businesses finance. Using the Survey of Small Business Finance, the empirical model show that bank concentration may adversely affect {{the amount of}} <b>credit</b> <b>supplied</b> to small businesses. We find that bank concentration decreases the L/C limits of firms significantly, {{while there is no}} statistically significant difference in L/C balance across banking markets. We also show that bank concentration lowers the overall debt-to-asset ratio of small firms that includes loans from nonbank institutions, suggesting that credit from non-bank institutions do not fully make up the effect of bank concentration. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> {{and demand}} shocks for the Swiss economy. Using a medium scale BVAR model {{we are able}} to take into account various interactions of housing prices, <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> and demand, interest rates and real activity measures. To identify meaningful economic shocks, we used a combination of zero and sign restrictions. Generally, the empirical analysis implies that the effects of <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks on real activity are limited, only playing a substantive role in specific episodes. Furthermore, the <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks (i. e. bank lending shocks and monetary policy shocks) explain a large fraction of housing price and credit fluctuations. Indeed, they tend to be more important for housing prices than housing demand shocks. There is further evidence that shocks related to <b>credit</b> <b>supply,</b> monetary policy shocks dominate bank lending shocks. For Switzerland as a small open economy {{it turns out to be}} very crucial to take into account foreign demand which is able to explain a substantial variation in real and financial variables...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks in the US, the euro area and Japan are {{transmitted}} to other economies. We use the recently-developed GVAR approach to model financial variables jointly with macroeconomic variables in 33 countries {{for the period}} 1983 - 2009. We experiment with inter-country links that distinguish bilateral trade, portfolio investment, foreign direct investment and banking exposures, as well as asset-side vs. liability-side financial channels. Capturing both bilateral trade and inward foreign direct investment or outward banking claim exposures in a GVAR fits the data better than using trade weights only. We use sign restrictions on the short-run impulse responses to financial shocks that {{have the effect of}} reducing <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> to the private sector. We find that negative US <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have stronger negative effects on domestic and foreign GDP, compared to <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks from the euro area and Japan. Domestic and foreign credit and equity markets respond clearly to the <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks. Exchange rate responses are consistent with a "flight to quality" to the US dollar. The UK, another international financial centre, is also responsive to the shocks. These results are robust to the exclusion of the 2007 - 09 crisis episode from the sample. <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> shocks; global VAR; international business cycles; sign restrictions; trade and financial integration...|$|E
