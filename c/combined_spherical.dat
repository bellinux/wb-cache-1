The sphere-toroid-cylinder <b>combined</b> <b>spherical</b> bulkhead has the advantages of a simple structural style, clear mechanical property and relatively low construction difficulty, resulting in great engineering applicability. In this paper, spherical bulkheads with sphere-toroid-cylinder combination are studied, and their stress strength characteristics under uniform external pressure are analyzed. The Riccati transfer matrix method {{is used for the}} calculation of spherical bulkhead structure by combining shell control equations. The paper is concerned with the stress strength analysis of the sphere-toroid-cylinder <b>combined</b> <b>spherical</b> bulkhead under external even pressure. To improve the performance of the structural strength of spherical bulkheads, the influences of parameters including sphere shell radius, toroid shell radius and boundary rigidity on the stress strength of the sphere-toroid-cylinder combined shell are discussed using the Riccati transfer matrix method. In order to depict the geometric figure and mechanical character of the bulkhead, the concept of ‘flatness’ is proposed, and the suggested range of ‘flatness’ is given. In this range, the mechanical constraints of the ring-stiffened cylinder acting on the sphere-toroid combined shell may be taken as simple support, thus simplifying the calculation of structural strength. The conclusions drawn from this paper can be used as reference points for the design of sphere-toroid-cylinder combined shell structures...|$|E

These phenomena represent qualitatively a new consequence of the interplay between gravity and electromagnetism.

40|$|Abstract. In active vision scenarios, {{the motion}} of the {{observer}} induces an apparent motion in the image plane. One approach for camera motion compensation is the use of panoramic images, representing the scene at the different positions of the camera. In this work, an approach to build spherical panoramic views from a pan-tilt camera is described, which is based on background updating techniques. Interestingly, panoramic representations allow motion detection and analysis to be performed in-dependently from camera movements. This makes easier the detection of moving objects in active tracking tasks. Additionally, the advantages of <b>combining</b> <b>spherical</b> panoramas with log-polar images is discussed.

40|$|In this thesis, Mars Global Surveyor mapping-phase {{magnetic}} {{data are}} used to derive a <b>combined</b> <b>spherical</b> harmonic model of both Martian crustal and time-dependent external magnetic fields. A 60 -degree spherical harmonic model of the crustal magnetic anomalies is first isolated, by averaging of in-shadow data over 0. 5 ° x 0. 5 ° latitude and longitude bins, and covariance analysis between multiple independent models. This model is then subtracted, separately, from day-side and night-side measurements. External residual data are expended in terms of now time-dependent 30 -degree spherical harmonics, using 1 year and 1 / 2 year periods, and with separate internal and external radial dependencies. Independent Fourier series expansions allow to validate the temporal variations of the preceding model. As a result, I obtain, along with the crustal anomaly maps, the spatial distribution of the external fields, their steady-state features, and the amplitude maps of their yearly and half a year variations, separately for day and night sides of Mars. Although the maxima of the temporal amplitudes show good correlations with the strong crustal anomalies, there are significant differences between them.

40|$|An acoustically soft {{scatterer}} {{defined by}} a closed and star shape polynomial surface of any degree disturbs the propagation of a time harmonic plane incident wave. It is demonstrated that, under the hypotheses of Schiffer's uniqueness theorem, all the generalized low-frequency moments corresponding to the capacity potential {{can be obtained from}} the scattering amplitude. An analytic algorithm is proposed that recovers the geometry of the body whenever a finite number of generalized moments generated by the leading low-frequency approximation are given. What is striking here is the fact that a surface measure generated by a potential problem is enough to recover the geometry of the scatterer. The idea here is to relate the given moments to a set of particular <b>combined</b> <b>spherical</b> moments that appear as coefficients of an algebraic linear system, whose solution provides the coefficients of the scattering surface in spherical harmonics. This is done {{with the help of an}} inner product defined over the surface of the unit sphere with respect to an unknown positive surface measure. In contrast to other existing techniques of shape reconstruction, the one proposed here does not involve the solution of any optimization problem. Instead, only some finite expansions in spherical harmonics and the solution of a linear algebraic system is involved. Tikhonov regularization is used to treat the case of inexact data.

40|$|Satellite gradiometry and its {{instrumentation}} is an ultra-sensitive {{detection technique}} {{of the space}} gravitational gradient (i. e. the Hesse tensor of the gravitational potential). Gradeometry will be of great significance in inertial navigation, gravity survey, geodynamics and earthquake prediction research. In this paper, satellite gradiometry formulated as an inverse problem of satellite geodesy is discussed from two mathematical aspects: Firstly, satellite gradiometry is considered as a continuous problem of harmonic downward continuation. The space-borne gravity gradients {{are assumed to be}} known continuously over the satellite (orbit) surface. Our purpose is to specify sufficient conditions under which uniqueness and existence can be guaranteed. It is shown that, in a spherical context, uniqueness results are obtainable by decomposition of the Hesse matrix in terms of tensor spherical harmonics. In particular, the gravitational potential is proved to be uniquely determined if second order radial derivatives are prescribed at satellite height. This information leads us to a reformulation of satellite gradiometry as a (Fredholm) pseudodifferential equation of first kind. Secondly, for a numerical realization, we assume the gravitational gradients to be known for a finite number of discrete points. The discrete problem is dealt with classical regularization methods, based on filtering techniques by means of spherical wavelets. A spherical singular integral-like approach to regularization methods is established, regularization wavelets are developed which allow the regularization in form of a multiresolution analysis. Moreover, a <b>combined</b> <b>spherical</b> harmonic and spherical regularization wavelet solution is derived as an appropriate tool in future (global and local) high-presision resolution of the earth" s gravitational potential...|$|E

We have investigated two methods of processing the signals from the 8 sectors.

In the second, multiplicative processing (MP), the 8 rf waveforms are multiplied and the resultant is demodulated to form the image.

40|$|International audienceWear {{analysis}} at the micro/nanoscale {{appears as}} a great challenge for MEMS/NEMS devices. At this scale classical post mortem analysis - like profilometry or AFM assessment - often failed because (i) the error in wear assessment owing to the elastic recovery is no longer negligible at this scale and (ii) the presence of nanometric tribolayer within the contact cannot be take into account when the contact is opened afterward. So, this paper deals with an in situ wear assessment based on a triboscopic approach where the final position z(f) of the ball is known without opening the contact because its vertical position is assessed at every instant of the process. This triboscopic assessment considers the initial approach of the surfaces z(o) and gives the wear rate by {{taking into account the}} presence of any tribolayer within the contact.
