5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E
50|$|Match cuts {{form the}} basis for <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> such as the {{ubiquitous}} use of match on action. <b>Continuity</b> <b>editing</b> smooths over the inherent discontinuity of shot changes to establish a logical coherence between shots. Even within <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> though, the match cut is a contrast both with cross-cutting between actions in two different locations that are occurring simultaneously, and with parallel editing, which draws parallels or contrasts between two different time-space locations.|$|E

Continuity differs from montage in both its production, effect and intention.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Continuity</b> <b>editing</b> is the process, in {{film and}} video creation, of {{combining}} more-or-less related shots, or different components cut from a single shot, into a sequence so as to direct the viewer's attention to a pre-existing consistency of story across both time and physical location. Often used in feature films, <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> or [...] "cutting to continuity", can be contrasted with approaches such as montage, in which the editor aims to generate, {{in the mind of}} the viewer, new associations among the various shots which can then be of entirely different subjects, or at least of subjects less closely related than would be required for the continuity approach.|$|E

In 1940 Kesten emigrated to New York and later acquired American citizenship.Throughout the Hitler years and beyond Kesten continued to write prolifically.

5000|$|Shot {{reverse shot}} is {{a feature of}} the [...] "classical" [...] Hollywood style of <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> which deemphasizes {{transitions}} between shots such that the spectator perceives one continuous action that develops linearly, chronologically, and logically.

5000|$|The devices most {{inherent}} to classical Hollywood cinema {{are those of}} <b>continuity</b> <b>editing.</b> This includes the 180-degree rule, {{one of the major}} visual-spatial elements of <b>continuity</b> <b>editing.</b> The 180-degree rule keeps with the [...] "photographed play" [...] style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and direction of action in a scene. According to the 30-degree rule, cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as jump cuts, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal continuity between shots. The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Cutting techniques in classical <b>continuity</b> <b>editing</b> serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the cross cut, which establishes the concurrence of action in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed {{in the form of the}} axial cut, which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity.|$|E

5000|$|Some films, like Alain Resnais's surreal [...] (1963), {{play with}} this technique. Cutting on action is used, instead of accentuating the {{continuity}} {{elements of the}} action, to trick and confuse the viewer.

50|$|The <b>continuity</b> <b>editing</b> {{system is}} not {{necessarily}} abandoned but instead is not needed.

50|$|<b>Continuity</b> <b>editing</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{temporal}} continuity and spatial continuity. Within each category, specific techniques will work against a sense of continuity. In other words, techniques can cause a passage to be continuous, giving the viewer a concrete physical narration to follow, or discontinuous, causing viewer disorientation, pondering, or even subliminal interpretation or reaction, as in the montage style.|$|E

After the series was canceled, Larson went on to create a relatively low-budget sequel to the series, titled Galactica 1980, which was set many years later, when the Galactica had reached Earth. This series was less successful than the original and was canceled after 10 episodes.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, {{voice-over}} {{can be used}} to aid <b>continuity</b> in <b>edited</b> {{versions of}} films, in order for the audience {{to gain a better understanding}} of what has gone on between scenes. This was done when the 1948 Joan of Arc, starring Ingrid Bergman, turned out to be far from the box-office and critical hit that was expected, and was edited down from 145 minutes to 100 minutes for its second run in theatres. The edited version, which circulated for years, used narration to conceal the fact that large chunks of the film had been cut. In the full-length version, restored in 1998 and released on DVD in 2004, the voice-over narration is heard only at the beginning of the film.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} of <b>continuity</b> <b>editing,</b> {{part of the}} classical Hollywood style, was developed by early European and American directors, in particular, D.W.

50|$|Cross-cutting is a {{technique}} which conveys an undeniable spatial discontinuity. It {{can be achieved by}} cutting back and forth between shots of spatially unrelated places.

50|$|In one study, {{observers}} {{were instructed to}} look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that {{did not appear to}} affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, {{observers were}} more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, {{they were more likely to}} describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of <b>continuity</b> errors in <b>editing.</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{differences}} between the post-classical, {{sometimes referred to as}} MTV style of editing, and the classic <b>continuity</b> way of <b>editing</b> is that the post-classical approach emphasizes less on time and space, than a film <b>edited</b> with <b>continuity</b> does. Instead of focusing on the character and the entire narrative, MTV style of editing or post-classical editing is focused on each individual set-piece [...] In films from the 1940s and 1950s, less was left to the imagination. If someone was going from one room to the next, they were shown walking out of one door, closing that door, across the way opening the next door, walking through it and ending up on the other side. Today, {{it is not uncommon to}} show someone leaving one place, and arriving at the next, without showing precisely how the character did so. Essentially, it allows the narrative to jump from one scene to another, while still telling an understandable story. MTV Style is often considered disjointed, discontinuous, with a non-linear narrative. Films edited in this style are also multi-layered, meaning they contain more than one story, within a bigger story. This style of editing makes it possible to establish what is happening at two different locations within the same time frame. All of these components which differ from the classical editing style lead to a rhythm in the films which is much faster than that of a traditional narrative pace. Fast cutting is an editing style that can make a difference in emotional impact of a film on the audience. Editing film is a way to receive a specific reaction from the audience. By making certain cuts, an editor has the ability to manipulate the audience to have a certain reaction. The quick cutting characteristic of MTV, post-classical style of editing encourages a different reaction and emotional response from the audience than classical editing.|$|R
