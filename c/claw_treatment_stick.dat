40|$|AbstractShort-term {{effects of}} {{therapeutic}} claw trimming in acutely lame cows (n= 21) with nonadvanced claw horn lesions on the endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral stress responses were investigated {{in comparison to}} regular claw trimming in nonlame control cows (n= 21). Controls were matched to lame cows by parity and stage of lactation. Lame cows suffering from typical sole ulcers or white line disease were blinded and randomly assigned to 2 treatments, receiving 15 min before interventions either ketoprofen (n= 11; 3 mg/kg of BW intramuscularly; Romefen, Merial, Lyon, France) or placebo (n= 10; saline in equivalent amount and route of administration). All cows underwent functional claw trimming in lateral recumbency on a surgical tipping table, and claw horn lesions in lame cows were conventionally treated (removal of loose horn, block on opposing claw, bandaging of affected claw). Blood samples collected 15 min before, at the end, and 24 h after claw trimming were analyzed for concentrations of cortisol, fatty acids, lactate, and glucose, and fecal samples (collected before treatment and after 24 h) for cortisol metabolites. Behavioral stress responses during functional and therapeutic claw trimming were recorded. Concentrations of blood cortisol, fatty acids, glucose, and fecal cortisol metabolites were higher in lame than in nonlame cows after <b>treatment.</b> During <b>claw</b> <b>treatment,</b> more leg movements were recorded for lame cows than nonlame cows. Pre-emptive administration of ketoprofen had no obvious effects on stress responses to therapeutic <b>claw</b> trimming. <b>Treatments</b> of <b>claw</b> horn lesions caused a significant stress and pain reaction in acutely lame cows, demonstrating the necessity of adequate pain management protocols for such interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{prevalence}} {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of digital dermatitis, interdigital hyperplasia and interdigital necrobacillosis on farms in the Netherlands. This is relevant due to the effects of lameness, a common symptom of these three diseases, on animal welfare and economic results. The data were collected within a clinical trial, required for the authorisation of a new topical treatment for digital dermatitis, set in October to December of 2013. Trained veterinary students collected data for this paper. The front and hind claws of each cow participating in the trial were inspected whilst the cow was in a trimming chute. Herds preferably contained over 100 cows, had a herd digital dermatitis prevalence level of 20 % or more, were housed in cubicle systems, were of the Holstein Friesian breed and no preventive <b>claw</b> <b>treatment</b> on herd-level was executed in the three weeks prior to the trial. After visiting four farms, the goal of inspecting at least 300 cows was met, with a total of 373 animals. Prevalence was calculated per farm and an overall prevalence was calculated after visiting all four farms for each disease. A 95 % confidence interval was calculated for each disease to establish whether the results differed significantly from values found in literature. Herd prevalence for digital dermatitis varied from 23. 0 % to 59. 3 %. For interdigital necrobacillosis, values varied from 0. 0 % to 1. 6 %. Interdigital hyperplasia varied in herd prevalence from 5. 7 % to 12. 9 %. The overall prevalence of digital dermatitis, interdigital necrobacillosis and interdigital hyperplasia was 40. 8 %, 1. 1 % and 8. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) and two adhesive systems on bond strength (BS) of repaired nanofilled composite. Materials and Methods: A hundred test specimens (8 mm diameter x 8 mm thickness) were obtained (Filtek Z 350, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) and separated in 10 groups (n= 10), according to the type of adhesive system for repair and TMF, after and before repair. Control groups: G 1 - without repair and TMF (control); G 2 - without repair+TMF. Groups repaired with total-etch adhesive system (ASB - Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, 3 M ESPE) : G 3 - repaired without TMF; G 4 - TMF before repair; G 5 - TMF after repair; G 6 - TMF before and after repair. Groups repaired with self-etch adhesive system (CLB - Clearfil Liner bond 2 V, Kuraray Dental) : G 7 - repaired without TMF; G 8 -TMF before repair; G 9 - TMF after repair; G 10 - TMF before and after repair. After <b>treatments,</b> <b>sticks</b> (1 mm(2)) were obtained and submitted to the microtensile test (0. 5 mm/mm). Failure modes were observed in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-Jeol JSM 5600 LV). Results: Statistical analysis (2 -way ANOVA, Tukey, p < 0. 05) demonstrated that G 2 presented highest BS values that differed statistically compared with those of other repaired groups submitted to TMF (p < 0. 05). Regarding control groups, G 2 presented the highest BS values, different from Cl (p= 0. 0087). Fractographic analysis demonstrated that all repaired groups showed predominantly adhesive failures regardless of the adhesive system used. Conclusions: The TMF can improve the BS of repaired composites mainly when used self-etch adhesive, which demonstrated higher BS. The timing of TMF influences the BS of the repair on composite.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first part uses economic experiments to investigate how participants choose to divide a surplus {{in the presence of}} competing focal points. The second part examines whether a monetary policy shock has asymmetric regional effects. Chapter 2 suggests a simple separation mechanism based on heterogeneity among subjects to understand how they choose equilibrium when there are competing focal points. In a Nash demand game where buyers and sellers bargain for a liter of milk, we find that some subjects choose to split the available surplus equally while others are sensitive to the frame and therefore choose the prevailing market price of the product. The choice of focal point seems to depend on subjects’ characteristics and how strong the frame is for the subject. Chapter 3 examines whether the focal point induced by a product is sensitive to experience. In a repeated Nash demand game where buyers and sellers bargain for a coca-cola, I find that a small difference in feedback affects whether average bids converge to equal-splits. When both parties can observe the opponent’s bid after each period, average bids do converge to equal-splits, but when the seller only learns if a transaction has taken place or not, average bids do not converge. Instead, around half of the subjects in this <b>treatment</b> <b>stick</b> to the prevailing market price of the product. This result remains when these sellers get to observe the buyer’s bid. The repeated choice of focal point is also affected by individual characteristics and how attached subjects are to the product. Chapter 4 investigates the effects on employment in 21 Swedish regions of a monetary policy shock using a VAR model with exogenous foreign variables for the 1993 : 1 - 2007 : 4 period. The regional impulse responses clearly indicate asymmetric effects in which employment falls significantly in some regions, while not changing significantly in others. These differences seem to stem from the interest and exchange rate channel, whereby regions with larger shares of employment in the goods sector and higher export intensity are adversely affected. In addition, there is one group of regions that, surprisingly, see increased employment in response to the same policy shock...|$|R

These were combined with farm environment and management data collected {{using a combination}} of direct observations, interviews with farmers, and milk recording data. Multilevel models were constructed for the 3 most frequently reported lesions related to lameness, namely, sole ulcers, white line disease, and digital dermatitis. Risks associated with an increased incidence of sole ulcers were parity 4 or greater, the use of roads or concrete cow tracks between the parlor and grazing, the use of lime on free stalls, and housing in free stalls with sparse bedding for 4 mo or more. The risks for white line disease were increasing parity and increasing herd size, cows at pasture by day and housed at night, and solid grooved concrete floors in yards or alleys. Solid grooved flooring was also associated with an increased risk of digital dermatitis, and cows 6 or more months after calving had a decreased risk of a first case of digital dermatitis. These results improve our understanding of the specific risks for 3 important lesions associated with bovine lameness and could be used as interventions in future clinical studies targeted at the reduction of specific lesions. ...|$|R

40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} endemic disease problems facing the dairy industry. Claw horn lesions (principally sole hemorrhage, sole ulcer, and white line disease) are some of the most prevalent conditions. Despite the fact that thousands of animals are treated for these conditions every year, experimental evidence is limited on the most effective treatment protocols. A randomized, positively controlled clinical trial was conducted to test the recovery of newly lame cows with claw horn lesions. Animals on 5 farms were locomotion scored every 2 wk. Cows were eligible for recruitment if they had 2 nonlame scores followed by a lame score and had a claw horn lesion on a single claw of a single foot. Following a therapeutic trim, enrolled cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 treatments: treatment 1 —no further treatment (positive control; TRM), treatment 2 —trim plus a block on the sound <b>claw</b> (TB), <b>treatment</b> 3 —trim plus a 3 -d course of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketoprofen (TN), treatment 4 —trim plus a block plus ketoprofen (TBN). The primary outcome measure was locomotion score 35 d after treatment, by an observer blind to treatment group. Descriptive statistics suggested that treatment groups were balanced at the time of enrollment, that is, randomization was successful. Based on a sound locomotion score (score 0) 35 d after treatment, the number of cures was 11 of 45 (24. 4 %) for TRM, 14 of 39 (35. 9 %) for TB, 12 of 42 (28. 6 %) for TN, and 23 of 41 (56. 1 %) for TBN. The difference between TBN and TRM was significant. To test for confounding imbalances between treatment groups, logistic regression models were built with 2 outcomes, either sound (score 0) or nonlame (score 0 or 1) 35 d after treatment. Compared with TRM, animals that received TBN were significantly more likely to cure to a sound outcome. Farm, treatment season, lesion diagnosis, limb affected, treatment operator, and stage of lactation were included in the final models. Our work suggests that lameness cure is maximized with NSAID treatment in addition to the common practices of therapeutic trimming and elevation of the diseased claw using a block when cows are newly and predominantly mildly lame...|$|R

Although the <b>treatment</b> of <b>claw</b> lesions in cattle is a daily activity for hoof trimmers, veterinarians, and livestock producers, there is surprisingly little information in the peer-reviewed literature on which to base strong evidence-based conclusions. As a consequence, many treatment modalities used are empirical and, in some cases, may be counterproductive to rapid lesion healing. Furthermore, many of these empirical treatment modalities fail to fully consider the underlying pathogenesis of the disease process and the implications that it has on lesion healing. For example, sole ulcers are largely a consequence of metabolic disorders and mechanical overloading. Therapeutic interventions that fail to address the weight-bearing issues are unlikely to be successful. Likewise, white line disease is believed to be predisposed by rumen acidosis and laminitis, and interventions need to include in them appropriate measures to prevent further cases through nutritional management. The goal of this review paper is to review the pathogenesis of claw lesions {{in the context of the}} published literature and allow the reader to arrive at rational treatment interventions based on the best available information. The use of an orthopedic block applied to the healthy claw of a lame foot, judicious use of bandage or wrap, careful selection of parenteral or topical therapy, and a treatment protocol to manage pain and promote recovery are key components of responsible management of lameness disorders in cattle.

This paper reports an approach to develop best practice options for controlling medium to dense infestations of bellyache bush using combinations of control methods. The efficacy of five single treatments including foliar spraying, slashing, stick raking, burning and do nothing (control) were compared against 15 combinations of these treatments over 4 successive years. Treatments were evaluated using several attributes, including plant mortality, changes in population demographics, seedling recruitment, pasture yield and cost of treatment. Foliar spraying once each year for 4 years proved the most cost-effective control strategy, with no bellyache bush plants recorded {{at the end of the}} study. Single applications of slashing, stick raking and to a lesser extent burning, when followed up with foliar spraying also led to significantly reduced densities of bellyache bush and changed the population from a growing one to a declining one.

40|$|Background: Molecular {{mechanisms}} regulating leukocyte sequestration {{into the}} tissue during endotoxemia and/or sepsis are still poorly understood. This in vivo study investigates the biological role of murine PECAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 for leukocyte sequestration into the lung, liver and striated skin muscle. Methods: Male BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with murine PECAM- 1 IgG chimera or monoclonal antibody (mAb) to VCAM- 1 (3 mg/kg body weight); controls received equivalent doses of IgG 2 a (n = 6 per group). Fifteen minutes thereafter, 2 mg/kg body weight of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin was injected intravenously. At 24 h after the endotoxin challenge, lungs, livers and striated muscle of skin were analyzed for their myeloperoxidase activity. To monitor intravital leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, fluorescence videomicroscopy {{was performed in}} the skin fold chamber model of the BALB/c mouse at 3, 8 and 24 h after injection of endotoxin. Results: Myeloperoxidase activity at 24 h after the endotoxin challenge in lungs (12, 171 +/- 2, 357 mU/g tissue), livers (2, 204 +/- 238 mU/g) and striated muscle of the skin (1, 161 +/- 110 mU/g) was significantly reduced in both treatment groups as compared to controls, with strongest attenuation in the PECAM- 1 IgG treatment group. Arteriolar leukocyte sticking at 3 h after endotoxin (230 +/- 46 cells x mm(- 2)) was significantly reduced in both <b>treatment</b> groups. Leukocyte <b>sticking</b> in postcapillary venules at 8 h after endotoxin (343 +/- 69 cells/mm(2)) was found reduced only in the VCAM- 1 -mAb-treated animals (215 +/- 53 cells/mm(2)), while it was enhanced in animals treated with PECAM- 1 IgG (572 +/- 126 cells/mm(2)). Conclusion: These data show that both PECAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 are involved in endotoxin-induced leukocyte sequestration in the lung, liver and muscle, presumably through interference with arteriolar and/or venular leukocyte sticking.

METHODS: MMP- 8 was determined in GCF from periodontitis (11 patients, 90 sites), gingivitis (10 patients, 58 sites) and healthy control (8 patients, 59 sites) sites (i) by a test stick incorporating monoclonal antibodies to two epitopes on MMP- 8 and (ii) by measuring MMP- 8 concentration by a quantitative immunofluorometric assay. Patients with adult periodontitis were treated by scaling and root planing (SRP) and received oral hygiene instructions. GCF MMP- 8 testing and clinical measurements were done before and after SRP. RESULTS: MMP- 8 GCF levels and chair-side test differentiated periodontitis from gingivitis and healthy control sites. MMP- 8 GCF levels &# 62; 1 mg/l and positive chair-side test identified especially severe periodontitis sites. A positive and negative test stick result, the outcome of which was rapidly detectable in 5 mins, in GCF correlated well with MMP- 8 immunofluorometric assay analysis from the collected GCF samples and the severity of periodontitis. Scaling and root planing reduced the MMP- 8 levels in severe periodontitis sites with positive MMP- 8 test and gingival probing pocket depth (PD) &# 62; 5 mm before <b>treatment.</b> The test <b>stick</b> result and the quantitative assay were discrepant in only 18 of the 207 sites tested, thus agreement was very good (kappa = 0. 81). With a threshold of 1 mg/l MMP- 8 activity the chair-side test provided a sensitivity of 0. 83 and specificity of 0. 96 (n = 207). CONCLUSION: The MMP- 8 test {{can be used to}} differentiate periodontitis from gingivitis and healthy sites as well as to monitor treatment of periodontitis. A reduction in GCF MMP- 8 levels and a change in test stick result provide a means to optimize patient control during maintenance of periodontal treatment...|$|R

Acute oropharyngeal stick injuries (when the incident has been less than seven days ago) and chronic oropharyngeal stick injuries (when {{it has been more}} than seven days) can be dangerous and even life threatening. The University Clinic for Companion Animals at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Utrecht therefore has a protocol for the treatment of these cases. With the combination of a literature study, a patient review of 32 client owned dogs treated for (possible) acute or chronic stick injury at the UCCA between 2004 and 2011 and an evaluation of two surveys held among the patient owners and attending veterinarians, this protocol was reviewed for suitability and usability. It turned out that the protocol was largely in agreement with the current literature and was redeemed clear and understandable by the veterinarians who treated the patients. Most veterinarians used the protocol during treatment of their patient. Twenty-five dogs made a full recovery after treatment, five dogs died or were euthanized and the in two dogs the problems still remained after initial treatment. Looking at these results and positive comments from the veterinarians, it seems the protocol is suitable for <b>treatment</b> of oropharyngeal <b>stick</b> injury and usable by veterinarians.

40|$|Nanoimprint {{lithography}} (NIL) {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the next-generation lithography techniques due to its ability to fabricate nanoscale structures with low cost and high throughput. Although both thermal and UV nanoimprint have demonstrated sub- 10 nm resolution, the adoption of NIL by industry has been very limited. The main reasons are that the density of pattern defects and low throughput cannot satisfy the stringent requirement of commercial lithographic technique. In this study, methods and material have been developed to overcome the limitations beyond conventional nanoimprint by utilizing three main factors: mold, the interface between mold and resist, and resist. In the study, we first developed a new synergistic thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography (STUV-NIL). A transparent mold is integrated with a transparent metal oxide heater, which enables resists to be cured by thermal energy and UV light spontaneously. This new STUV-NIL combines thermal and UV techniques into one module and helps throughput improvement and reducing mold-resist adhesion and hence defect generation. In the second part of this study, the thermal behavior of a polycarbonate resist was investigated by characterization of polycarbonate gratings reflow after thermal annealing. The observation of exceptional thermal stability of entangled polycarbonate polymer opens up new routes of step-and-repeat thermal nanoimprint and high resolution patterning. The adhesion characteristic between polymers and the mold is a critical factor in the demolding process. In the third part of our study, polycarbonate residual layer has been applied as an anti <b>sticking</b> <b>treatment</b> on nanoimprint molds, replacing the self-assembled monolayer currently used. It satisfies the requirements of not only low surface energy but also low reactivity for durability. Polymerizations in UV NIL are generally accompanied by shrinkage in volume, which causes serious problems such as residual stress, demolding problems and defects. Epoxy-based UV resists have a volume shrinkage in the range of 3 % to 10 %. In the fourth part of our study, spiro-orthocarbonate, which undergoes volume expansion upon cationic ring-opening polymerization, has been mixed with an epoxy monomer to adjust the volume shrinkage of the cured resist and achieve zero volume change after curing...|$|R
40|$|Background: Deodorant {{products}} {{prevent the}} growth and activity of the degrading apocrine gland bacteria living in the armpit. Common antibacterial agents in the market like triclosan and aluminum salts, {{in spite of their}} suitable antibacterial effects, increase the risk of Alzheimer′s disease, breast and prostate cancers or induce contact dermatitis. Therefore, plant extracts possessing antibacterial effects are of interest. The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the in vitro antimicrobial effects of different sage extracts against two major bacteria responsible for axillary odor, and to evaluate the deodorant effect of a silicon-based stick containing sage extracts in different densities in humans. Materials and Methods: Different fractions of methanolic extract of Salvia officinalis (sage) were evaluated on a culture of armpit skin surface of volunteers through agar microdilution antimicrobial assay. Then, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with the best antibacterial fraction was conducted on 45 female healthy volunteers. Participants were treated with a single dose in four groups, each containing 15 individuals: Group 1 (200 μg/mL), 2 (400 μg/mL), 3 (600 μg/mL) of dichloromethane sage extract, and placebo (without extract). A standard sensory evaluation method for the evaluation of deodorant efficacy was used before, and two hours, four hours, and eight hours after single application of a deodorant or placebo (ASTM method E 1207 - 87 Standard Practice for the Sensory Evaluation of Axillary Deodorancy). Results: The data were analyzed with two factors relating to densities and time. In 45 participants with a mean [± standard deviation (SD) ] age of 61. 5 ± 11. 8 years, statistically significant within-group differences were observed before and two, four, and eight hours after deodorant treatment for groups 1, 2, and 3. Groups 1, 2, and 3 had a significantly smaller odor score than placebo after two, four, and eight hours (P < 0. 001). In a comparison of different deodorant densities, the interaction effect was not significant between deodorant 200 and 400 μg/mL, but was significant between 200 and 600 and between 400 and 600 μg/mL sage extract sticks (P < 0. 001). Before running the sensory evaluation of the deodorant sticks on the subjects, a rabbit skin patch test was used to demonstrate that the formulation had no irritants. Conclusion: A single <b>treatment</b> with a <b>stick</b> deodorant containing dichloromethane sage extract of 200, 400, or 600 μg/mL concentrations was effective in reducing the axillary malodor level compared with the control, in healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates characteristics, {{factors and}} {{specific}} interventions {{in patients with}} a severe depressive episode during inpatient treatment. The introduction presents an overview over different aspects of depressive disorders as dysfunctional cognitions, the meaning of health related quality of life (HRQoL), chronicity in depressive disorders, the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in treatment of depression and different pharmacological strategies {{in the case of}} non-response. The following chapters present the results of different studies regarding the afore mentioned topics, focussing on patients with a severe depressive episode during inpatient treatment. Regarding dysfunctional cognitions we could demonstrate that they are relatively stable compared to other depressive symptoms and are associated with poorer treatment outcome even in combined treatment of antidepressant medication and CBT during inpatient treatment. Changes of dysfunctional cognitions seem to be a long-term treatment goal, especially because of their association with comorbid personality disorders and recurrent depressive disorders. In the second work we investigated how HRQoL is influenced during inpatient treatment. The inpatient treatment resulted in an increase of the SF- 12 scores, a specific questionnaire for HRQoL, although to a lower extent than depressive symptoms. Several factors negatively influence HRQoL, such as the presence of somatic and axis I psychiatric comorbiditites and a recurrent or severe depressive episode. Targeting somatic comorbidities in patients with unipolar depression seem {{to play an important role}} for HRQoL. The study presented here, identified clinical correlates and differences in treatment response of chronic MDD (cMDD) patients compared with non-chronic episodic depression. We could proof that inpatients with CD show higher symptom severity, lower response and remission rates and a longer duration of inpatient treatment, although they achieve comparable symptom reduction during treatment. These findings support the need to recognise CD and its defining characteristics as a distinct subclass of depression. Another study investigated the effects of additional cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) compared to pharmacotherapy only in acute inpatient treatment of depression in a naturalistic setting. We could verify that patients who were treated with additional CBT revealed a considerably greater reduction of depressive symptoms than in patients who received inpatient primary care only. Moreover, remission rates were significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the primary care only group. In our last trial we compared the outcome of different strategies after failure of the primary antidepressant treatment in inpatient treatment of depression. Our results indicate that changing to another pharmacological class (Lithium-Augmentation or augmentation with second generation antipsychotics) showed better <b>treatment</b> results than <b>sticking</b> to the class of antidepressants (antidepressant-switch and antidepressant combination) after primary failure in response to antidepressant monotherapy in unipolar depression...|$|R
