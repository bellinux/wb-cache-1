40|$|For {{high-quality}} {{spray painting}} of small parts, a rotary bell atomizer {{with a narrow}} spray pattern {{is used in the}} automotive industry. The required unusual high shaping air flow rate yields in an atomization process predominated by a pneumatic atomization and rather than by a rotary atomization, called hybrid bell atomizer in this article. Numerical and experimental investigation on typical high-speed rotary bell atomizers, with rotation type of high rotational speed 40000 - 60000 rpm of the bell, were already successful demonstrated. For these high-speed rotary bell atomizer for painting bigger areas the ratio between tangential velocity at the bell edge and axial shaping air velocity at the bell edge is in the range of 0. 8 and 4, depending on the process parameter. At the hybrid bell atomizer (10000 - 20000 rpm), this ratio is between 0. 2 and 0. 4. The first step of the present study includes the theoretical characterization of spray cone velocity profile using two definitions of swirl-number compared to experimental measurements of particle velocities using Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry (LDV). This study was carried out on varying shaping air settings and rotational speeds. The results show that the the swirl of the main airflow field is dominated by the secondary airflow, which is induced coaxial in an angle of 45 °. The influence of the <b>circumferential</b> <b>speed</b> of the bell cup on the swirl of the main airflow field plays a subordinate role, so the resulting spray pattern is only weakly influenced by the number of revolutions of the bell-cup.

40|$|Micro {{rotational}} {{parts are}} used in several industrial sectors. Well-known applications are micro shafts of gears, ejector pins in forming tools, pin electrodes for micro ED-drilling or micro stamping dies. Depending on the geometric complexity of micro rotational parts different process variants of micro electrical discharge machining characterized by a rotating workpiece can be used: 1. Wire Electrical Discharge Grinding (WEDG) with fine wire electrodes (50 microns). 2. Electrical Discharge Turning (EDT) with micro structured tool electrode. 3. Cylindrical Electrical Discharge Grinding (CEDG) with micro profiled disk electrode. Characteristic to these process variants is the superimposed relative motion between the rotating electrodes and the feed. This relative motion can be varied in a wide circumferential velocity range to improve the material removal process. The paper gives {{an introduction to the}} analysis of electrical, thermal, and hydrodynamic effects (amongst others: FEM and CFD results) influencing the process behavior with respect to technological requirements of micromachining. The investigations {{about the role of the}} relative movement according to the process behaviour of Micro Electrical Discharge Machining led to conclusion that several heat-conductive, hydrodynamic or pulse-electric effects must be taken into account. It has been determined, that the relative movement between both electrodes does not cause a premature break down of the spark, but leads to pulsating current. The assumption of a stationary discharge channel can be derived from this. The influence of the relative movement on the heat conduction is, however, only relevant on <b>circumferential</b> <b>speed</b> above v(ind u) = 2 m. s(exp - 1) or on discharge duration longer than t(ind e) = 10 micro s, as the FEM-simulations have shown. Optical based measurements of single discharges confirmed the tendency of decreasing crater size with rising velocity of the relative movement. In contrast, the surface roughness produced by series of discharges increases with rising speed. This result led to the further assumption, that improved flushing conditions because of the relative movement effect an increase of the power density and the process efficiency respectively. CFD simulations clarified the increase of the flow rate with rising velocity. But the dielectric fluid flows produce also a substantial change of the hydrodynamic pressure, thus a removal process free of machining forces can no longer be assumed. According to the current state of the investigations the conclusion follows, that a relative movement with high <b>circumferential</b> <b>speed</b> should be used only for removal-intensive machining operations.

The Scottish engineer A. Thom achieved a significant increase of the performance by adding so called Thom discs coaxially and equidistantly mounted on the cylinder. Investigations of the Thom disc rotors (Thom rotors) have shown a maximum of the lift to drag ratio epsilon for the circumferential cylinder velocity to freestream velocity alpha = 2. Most of the conducted experimental studies have only delivered integral force values. However, detailed insights {{in the structure of the}} flow field are still missing...|$|E
