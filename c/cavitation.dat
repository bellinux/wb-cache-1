5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused <b>cavitation,</b> a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to <b>cavitation,</b> led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of <b>cavitation,</b> similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E

This position is especially harsh due to the sudden ventricular pressure rise which drives the valve closure against a low left atrial pressure which {{is said to be}} the worst case condition thus position for <b>cavitation</b> to occur. <b>Cavitation</b> is also suspected as a contributing factor in blood cell damage and increased risk of thromboembolic complications.|$|E

40|$|The wake {{equalizing}} duct (WED) {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used energy saving devices for improving the propulsion performance of a ship; and reducing the propeller-excited vibrations and viscous resistance forces. During the last three decades considerable research and development activities have taken into place within this context. Most of these devices are used to improve propulsive efficiency, but some of them aims to improve other performance characteristics, such as <b>cavitations,</b> vibration, noise, maneuverability, etc. Marine propellers are the most common propulsion systems; nevertheless, it is possible to improve its propulsive performance using additional auxiliary propulsor devices (unconventional propulsors). Two versions of an existing ship in normal version and fitted with WED device were analyzed in order to demonstrate the influence on the WED device on the propeller <b>cavitations.</b> It was determined that the values for the pressure coefficient is 1. 98 for without WED situation and 2. 029 for WED situation. The difference is not so significant that, the conclusion is that WED device did not have influence over the <b>cavitations</b> of the propeller. Either optimization of dimension and form of WED did not help in reducing negative effects of <b>cavitations.</b> Not being a study in this paperwork, to decrease the <b>cavitations</b> we have other choices including a sound design of the propeller biased to improve the propeller behavior in <b>cavitations.</b> WED is clearly not a choice...|$|R

25|$|The <b>cavitation</b> {{phenomenon}} {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to <b>cavitation.</b> The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} <b>cavitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{temporal}} rate {{of change}} of the left ventricular, measured as a slope of the ventricular pressure curve (dP/dt) {{is regarded as the}} best indicator for <b>cavitation</b> potential. Most MHV investigated generate <b>cavitation</b> only when the dP/dt is well above the physiological range. However investigations have found that several tilting disc valves and only one bileaflet valve, the Edwards-Duromedics, generate <b>cavitation</b> within the physiological range. Investigations have repeatedly demonstrated that bileaflet valves, {{with the exception of the}} Edwards Duramedics design, cavitate only at dP/dt levels well above the physiological range.|$|E

The results show that the design of straight-through porous structure has a lot of advantages compared with other structures in terms of its good fluid dynamic characteristics that fluid flow is uniformly in the valve cartridge, the loss of pressure is lower, the impaction in expansion cartridge is smaller and impact noise of it can be reduced. Therefore, the straight-through porous structure could suppress the initiation and development of the <b>cavitations...</b>|$|R

Effect of misalignment / tilt and coning on <b>cavitations</b> region has also been investigated. The air bubbles are seen to improve the pressure distribution. It also reduces <b>cavitations</b> domain that occurs because of the centrifugal inertia force. Load carrying capacity is seen to improve but both mass flow rate and frictional power consumed decrease. Overall, the presence of air bubble improves {{the performance of the}} bearing.

25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of <b>cavitation</b> relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is <b>cavitation</b> that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is <b>cavitation</b> caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing <b>cavitation.</b> Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E

This membrane builds on the lessons learned in designing the Nozzle System and uses a pocket of air to prevent <b>cavitation</b> but does not require nozzles or compressors. While {{at the same time as}} limiting the cost of operation, this membrane provides just as much protection against <b>cavitation</b> as the nozzles do.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{automotive}} {{and aerospace}} industries {{have been the}} main {{driving force behind the}} search of new production processes which are capable of producing components with high integrity. Squeeze casting is one such novel metal processing technique which combines the advantages of both casting and forging in one operation. Squeeze casting process is suited for all melting ranges of metals varying from lead to iron. But nowadays, light weight materials like aluminium and magnesium are mostly used in the above mentioned industries. Aluminium alloy 6061 is one such futuristic material that is widely employed to produce automotive and aerospace components. In this research two sets of cylindrical components of AA 6061 were produced through squeeze casting where the first set of components was produced without employing ultrasonic <b>cavitations</b> and the second set of components was produced by employing ultrasonic <b>cavitations</b> and the components were tested for tensile strength and hardness respectively.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} multimodal imaging including volume-rendered angiographic {{and structural}} {{optical coherence tomography}} of macular telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel 2) for right-angle vein complexes, macular <b>cavitations,</b> and signs of deeper retinal vascular invasion. Retrospective review of imaging performed in a community-based retinal referral center. The eyes were scanned using optical coherence tomography using split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation techniques to derive flow information. These data were extracted and used to create volume-rendered images of the retinal vasculature with integrated structural information derived from the component optical coherence tomographic images. There were 24 eyes of 16 patients who had {{a mean age of}} 61. 8 years. Right-angle veins seemed in association with vascular proliferation external to the deep vascular plexus. The origin of a right-angle vein was surrounded by a stellate arrangement of radiating retinal vessels apparently caused by contraction of surrounding tissue in the temporal macula. <b>Cavitations</b> were found in the fovea and varied in size and configuration from one examination to the next. Many smaller <b>cavitations,</b> called microcavitations, were seen in the surrounding macula. Vascular invasion occurred into the subretinal space. There are contractile features of the tissue in the temporal macula and the number, size, and temporal variations in the <b>cavitations</b> have not been in not mentioned in previous published descriptions of MacTel 2. Vascular invasion of deeper layers occurred in the temporal macula through the outer nuclear layer.

25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, this systems uses {{a set of}} nozzles to help reduce and prevent the {{likelihood}} of <b>cavitation</b> in propellers. This system was developed by Samsung Shipping {{which is based in}} South Korea. In order to reduce the possibility of <b>cavitation</b> happening in marine propellers, a set of nozzles are placed on the hull of the ship {{directly in front of the}} propeller. These nozzles spray out compressed air over the propeller that creates “a macro bubble”. This bubble completely encompasses the propeller that is in operation. With the differing characteristics of the seawater outside of the bubble and the air inside, a zone develops that has the ability to reduce the “resonance frequency”. Due to this reduction, <b>cavitation</b> is less likely to occur during operation of a marine propeller.|$|E

40|$|Post-traumatic {{intramedullary}} myelopathies and <b>cavitations</b> {{are well}} described lesions following {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) in humans and have been described in histopathological evaluations in dogs. Human intramedullary myelopathies/cavitations are associated with severe initial SCI and deterioration of clinical signs. Canine intervertebral disc extrusions share similarities with SCI in humans. In this descriptive study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in spinal cords of dogs suffering from chronic post-traumatic myelopathies, including <b>cavitations,</b> are elucidated. An additional aim {{of the study was}} to compare diagnostic imaging and histopathological findings and identify similarities between human and canine chronic post-traumatic spinal cord lesions. Thirty-seven dogs with thoracolumbar SCI and one or more 3 Tesla MRI investigations more than 3 weeks after SCI were included. Extent of intramedullary lesions and particularly <b>cavitations</b> were evaluated and measured in sagittal and transverse MRI planes. These data were compared with clinical data. A total of 91. 9 % of study patients developed chronic intramedullary lesions, and 86. 5 % developed intramedullary <b>cavitations.</b> Paraplegia without deep pain perception at initial examination was significantly associated with longer chronic myelopathies/cavitations (P = 0. 002 /P = 0. 008), and with larger maximal cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the lesions (P = 0. 041 / 0. 005). In addition, a non-ambulatory status after decompressive surgery was also associated with the development of longer intramedullary lesions/cavitations (P< 0. 001) and larger lesion mCSA (P< 0. 001 /P = 0. 012). All dogs with negative outcome developed myelopathies/cavitations. In the group of 21 dogs with positive outcome, 3 did not develop any myelopathies, and 5 did not develop <b>cavitations.</b> Development of chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations are common findings in canine SCI. Extensive chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations reflect a severe initial SCI and negative clinical outcome. This supports the hypothesis that chronic spinal cord changes following SCI in humans share similarities with canine chronic spinal cord changes after spontaneous intervertebral disc extrusion...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a thermodynamic state of a solvent and solution separated with an elastic semipermeable membrane {{in a box}} with a constant volume and the relevance of this simple model for the water uptake in tall trees. Under moderate concentrations of a solute, the solution and solvent are under {{the positive and negative}} pressure, respectively. In the case of the soft membrane the pressure difference between the compartments with the solvent and solution is given by van't Hoff equation. A state of the negative pressure is not stable and after some time <b>cavitations</b> transform the solvent into the state of coexisting liquid and bubbles of saturated vapor. The pressure difference between the solvent and solution decreases and the membrane relaxes restoring the liquid phase in the compartment with solvent. In this way the solvent oscillates between the tensile state and the coexisting state of liquid and bubbles of saturated vapor. The xylem and phloem, the main vascular systems in trees, are coupled with ray cells. Assuming that a sap in these systems is kept under the constant volume the osmosis between the xylem and phloem with ray cells sustains the negative pressure of the xylem sap. Due to the osmosis elastic energy stored in walls of tracheary element could repair <b>cavitations.</b> In this way both water transport in tall trees and <b>cavitations</b> repair in tracheary elements are related to the osmosis under constant volume. A possible explanation of two long standing problems in tree physiology, water uptake in tall trees and <b>cavitations</b> repair, are offered within this model. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
