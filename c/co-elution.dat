40|$|Analysing {{the ratio}} of stable {{isotopes}} of carbon (13 C/ 12 C expressed as a δ 13 C) in the individual components of a sample {{may be used as}} one of the means to identify the origin of these components. This article reviews the approaches and reports on the successes and failures of source apportionment of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the use of compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA). One of the conditions for a precise and accurate analysis of isotope ratios with the use of GC-C-IRMS is obtaining well separated peaks, with no <b>co-elutions,</b> peak overlap and unresolved complex mixture (UCM). Additionally special care needs to be taken for an investigation of possible isotope fractionation effects introduced during the analytical treatment of samples. In the viewpoint of the above mentioned problems, this review discusses in detail and compares the laboratory methodologies, mainly the extraction and subsequent clean-up techniques used for environmental samples (aerosols, soil and sediments). Moreover, the strategies used for sampling of sources, the use of isotopic internal standards and the ranges for precision and accuracy are reported. JRC.

40|$|In this work, a {{methodology}} to characterise the volatile and semi-volatile compounds from marine salt by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/TOFMS) was developed. Samples from two saltpans of Aveiro, in Portugal, with diverse locations, obtained {{over three years}} (2004, 2005, and 2007) were analysed. A 50 / 30 m divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane SPME fibre was used. The volatiles present in the headspace of the solid salt samples (crystals) were equilibrated overnight at 60 C and extracted for 60 min prior to injection in the GC×GC/TOFMS. 157 compounds, distributed over the chemical groups of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, esters, furans, haloalkanes, ketones, ethers, alcohols, terpenoids, C 13 norisoprenoids, and lactones were detected across the samples. Furans, haloalkanes and ethers were identified {{for the first time}} in marine salt. The large number of <b>co-elutions</b> on the first column that were resolved by the GC×GC system revealed the complexity of marine salt volatile composition. The existence of a structured 2 D chromatographic behaviour according to volatility, in the first dimension (1 D), and primarily polarity, in the second dimension (2 D), was demonstrated, allowing more reliable identifications.

The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. <b>Co-elutions</b> came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines.

40|$|This {{research}} addresses critical chemometric {{modeling and}} data analysis functions needed {{to guide the}} design and implementation of novel meso-scale and micro-scale instrumentation that incorporates chromatographic separation with microsensor array detection. The first issue addressed relates to the fidelity of the response pattern generated by an array for a chromatographically resolved analyte to its calibrated reference pattern. A statistically rigorous decision rule was developed that accounts for the inherent variability in the array signals and permits assessments of pattern fidelity at a known rate of error. Building on this first study, a more sophisticated and robust approach to peak purity assessment based on fixed-size moving window factor analysis was adapted and evaluated by simulation. With this approach, a minority component with a peak area 0. 5 % of the primary component could be detected at a primary-peak signal-to-noise ratio as low as 20 : 1. To address problems involving partial overlap of chromatographic peaks, a self-modeling curve resolution method was applied, which entails an alternating least square algorithm coupled with evolving factor analysis. Response patterns from an array of four sensors were tested with binary <b>co-elutions</b> to evaluate the resolution of mixture components {{as a function of}} random noise, chromatographic separation, pattern similarity, and relative composition. In a separate series of studies, the advantages of multi-transducer sensor arrays over single-transducer arrays for vapor recognition were examined. Starting with a database of sensitivities to 11 vapors from 15 microsensors, it was shown by Monte Carlo simulation and principal component regression modeling that optimal MT arrays consistently outperform ST arrays of similar size, and that with judiciously selected 5 -sensor MT arrays one-third of all possible ternary vapor mixtures are reliably discriminated from their individual components and binary component mixtures, whereas none are reliably determined with any of the ST arrays. Using the same database, the limits of recognition were determined for various mixtures, revealing that, in general, mixtures cannot be recognized at relative concentration ratios exceeding 20 : 1 between two components.

40|$|A gas chromatographic {{method for}} {{analysis}} of oxygenated polar fatty acids (epoxy, hydroxy and oxo) is described. The challenge of polar fatty analysis {{in the past has}} been interferences due to <b>co-elution</b> of the various compounds present in the complex mixture. The method uses a three step SPE separation technique to fractionate the fatty acids so that each fraction is free of interfering compounds thus reducing <b>co-elution.</b> The epoxy and oxo fatty acids have been analysed in one portion. Due to the high polarity of the hydroxy fatty acids it is only possible to analyse them after silylation. The elution profile of the hydroxyl fatty acids can be simplified by hydrogenation which reduces the number of compounds allowing better chromatographic interpretation.

40|$|Branching has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the processability and properties of polymers. However, the accurate characterization of branched polymers is genuinely difficult. Branched molecules of a certain molecular weight exhibit the same hydrodynamic volumes as linear molecules of substantially lower weights. Therefore, separation by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), {{will result in the}} <b>co-elution</b> of molecules with different molecular weights and branching characteristics. Chromatographic separation of the polymer molecules in sub-μm channels, known as molecular-topology fractionation (MTF), may provide a better separation based on topological differences among sample molecules.

40|$|The {{crucial role}} of lipids in cells, tissues and body fluids is {{demonstrated}} by {{a large number of}} studies and human diseases that involve the disruption of lipid metabolic enzymes and pathways. Examples for such diseases include cancer, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Recent advances in research in the field of lipidomics has been driven by the development of new mass spectrometric (MS) tools and protocols for the identification and quantification of molecular lipid species in various biological matrices. However, the existing methods for minor sphingolipid (SL), glycerophospholipid (GP) and bile acid (BA) analysis show disadvantages like laborious sample preparation, time consuming LC-separation, high sample volumes or insufficient validation data, excluding these methods for high throughput analysis in huge clinical trials. The present work presents fast, specific, sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS methods for the analysis of SL, GL and BA species. Chromatographic-separation should provide <b>co-elution</b> of analytes and internal standards within each lipid class. The latter is of major importance to compensate for matrix effects and varying ionization efficiencies. Additionally, these methods should provide automated data analysis tools to allow high sample throughput, a prerequisite for lipid species quantification in huge clinical trials. Finally, these methods should be applied for lipid species analysis in various biological matrices, including plasma, cell homogenates and tissue samples. 1. 	A method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), bis(monoacyl) glycerophosphate (BMP) and cardiolipin (CL) species using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled with ESI-MS/MS in positive ionization mode. GL extraction was performed in the presence of butanol. HILIC showed excellent peak shapes and the isobaric compounds PG and BMP were successfully baseline-separated. Furthermore, HILIC provides <b>co-elution</b> of lipid species and their internal standards. Since many lipid species differ only by their chain length and/or saturation degree, <b>co-elution</b> may exhibit isotopic overlap which has to be corrected. Therefore, theoretically calculated isotope profiles were implemented into self programmed Excel Macros, which successfully corrected, for the first time, this complex isotopic overlap of an MS/MS experiment. 2. 	As one major achievement of this thesis, LC-MS/MS methods for the analysis of various low abundant SLs were developed. Separation of distinct SL classes and <b>co-elution</b> of analytes and internal standards was achieved by HILIC. MS/MS-analysis was either conducted in negative ionization mode for S 1 P and LPA quantification, or in positive ionization mode for the quantification of SPH and metabolites as well as for HexCer and LacCer. Since these methods use the same butanolic extraction and LC components, it is possible to analyze both sets of analytes from one extract. Treatment of fibroblasts with myriocin, which inhibits the first step of SL biosynthesis, and sphingosine-kinase inhibitor, demonstrated the importance of methods covering multiple instead of single sphingolipid metabolites. Additionally, SLs were quantified in plasma and in lipoprotein fractions prepared by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). SLs showed a specific distribution across lipoprotein classes and the SL species profiles in separated lipoproteins may help to address the origin of plasma SLs. 3. 	BA species were quantified from human plasma/serum using ESI-MS/MS in negative ionization mode. LC-separation was performed with a reversed phase-C 18 column and a gradient elution at basic pH was applied. Baseline-separation of eighteen BA species (free and conjugated) and a high sensitivity was achieved within 6. 5 min runtime. The sample preparation procedure was based on protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Validation was performed according to FDA guidelines. This method provides a valuable tool for both, routine diagnostics and the evaluation of BAs as diagnostic biomarkers in large clinical studies. ...|$|E

Tentative identification of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in maple sap and maple syrup indicated the presence of protocatechuic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, (+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, vanillin, coniferol, syringaldehyde, flavanols and dihydroflavonols related compounds. In addition, the identification by GC/MS of protocatechuic acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, coniferol and p-coumaric acid was made by comparing mass spectrum characteristics of individual peak from total ion chromatogram (TIC) to that of standard compounds. The seasonal variation of selected phenolic compounds and flavonoids present in maple sap and maple syrup was also inves...|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} Mg 2 +-dependent {{interaction}} between spinach leaf sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) and endogenous 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, {{as evidenced by}} <b>co-elution</b> during gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation. The content of 14 - 3 - 3 s associated with an SPS immunoprecipitate was inversely related to activity, and was specifically reduced when tissue was pretreated with 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide riboside, suggesting metabolite control in vivo. A synthetic phosphopeptide based on Ser- 229 was shown by surface plasmon resonance to bind a recombinant plant 14 - 3 - 3, and addition of the phosphorylated SPS- 229 peptide was found to stimulate the SPS activity of an SPS: 14 - 3 - 3 complex. Taken together, the results suggest a regulatory interaction of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins with Ser- 229 of SPS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} {{purification}} of four peptides related to enkephalins {{from the brain}} of the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. After reverse-phase HPLC purification, the sequence of the enkephalins (YGGFM, YGGFL, FM, FL) was established {{by a combination of}} automated Edman degradation, electrospray mass spectrometry measurement, and <b>co-elution</b> experiments in reverse-phase HPLC with synthetic peptides. ELISA titrations performed on each purified peptide indicated that the major amount was borne by the leucine-enkephalin. The ratio of leucine-enkephalin and methionine-enkephalin of 2 : 1 is in line with previous immunocytochemical data obtained on T. tessulatum brains. The presence of enkephalins in T. tessulatum, an animal belonging to the oldest group of coelomate metazoans (the Annelida) establishes the very ancient phylogenetic origin of opioids and their conservation in the course of evolution...|$|E
