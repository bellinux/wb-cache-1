5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E

5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with myalgia. They wrote that <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

5|$|The {{material}} of the Philomela myth {{has been used}} in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years. Over the centuries, the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful. The <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the image in artistic, literary, and musical works has reinforced this association.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Separately, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government {{announced}} on St. George's Day 2013 in a symbolic move that England's historic and traditional counties still exist. They are now recognised by the government, who will now encourage the marking and <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> such traditional county names by the existing tiers {{of local government}} and residents. A follow up announcement in April 2014 put forward an initiative in changing planning regulations, stating that 'traditional county' names can be placed on roadsigns. The same Government department also published an online map comparing the current and historic counties. The {{main body of the}} pre-1889 boundaries appear to be acknowledged, but Worcestershire's islands including Dudley and Shipston-on-Stour are omitted.|$|E
5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tolls by suggesting they {{were necessary to}} fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in Rock Springs was stabilized {{as early as}} September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|With {{extensive}} sand beaches, seabird breeding areas, {{and good}} dive {{sites in the}} Reef Observation Area {{to the south of}} the island, North Island is considered an attractive tourist site. However, all of the island's limited anchorage and jetty space is occupied by commercial fishers, so landings from private or charter boats are possible only by prior arrangement. Moreover, visitors are not permitted to camp on the island. North Island accounts for about 3.5% of private recreational boat trips to the Houtman Abrolhos and about 1% of commercial charter boat trips. The most recent tourism plan for the Houtman Abrolhos supports the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> North Island by private charter boats {{and the use of the}} airstrip for tourism purposes, but recommends against the establishment of a land-based tourist site there.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu Weekly {{found the}} story enjoyable, though noted {{that those who}} had played Destiny would get more {{enjoyment}} out of it, and praised the voice acting. They also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable, positively noting the option to auto-battle. The game ranked as the 89th all-time favorite game in a 2006 Famitsu readers poll. Japanese website Game Impress Watch found the story impressive, citing its use of time travel and the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Destinys world and lore. The gameplay, mini-games and customization options was also generally praised, with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series. RPGFan's Woojin Lee was also positive, praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate, and was pleased that an auto-battle option was included. One point that received a more mixed response was the game's music, {{with the exception of}} the opening song. In a preview for IGN, David Smith was generally positive about the game. While he disliked the art style and its low-tech look compared to its hardware, he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly relatable. He ended by hoping that Namco would put the effort into localizing the title.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Support for <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{the name}} {{has come from}} the team's owners and a {{majority}} of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Confederacy {{remained}} an independent Reichsstand of the Holy Roman Empire, {{but as it}} wasn't even obliged {{to participate in the}} Imperial Diet, this relation was degraded to a purely formal one that would lose significance throughout the 16th century. However, the Swiss still considered themselves as members of the empire with the status of imperial immediacy; the empire was still considered the foundation of all privileges, rights, or political identity as can be witnessed in the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the imperial insignia. The relations between the Habsburgs and the Confederacy were fully normalized in the Erbeinung of 1511, a renewal of the earlier Ewige Richtung of 1474 and a first Erbeinung of 1477. In that treaty, the Habsburgs finally and officially gave up all their territorial claims of old, and even designated the Confederacy the protecting power of the County of Burgundy. In the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, all members and associate states of the Confederacy would gain official full exemption from the empire and recognition as a national and political entity on their own right.|$|E
