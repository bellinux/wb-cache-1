Thus, when supply is represented linearly, regardless of the slope of the supply line, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of any linear supply curve that passes through the origin is 1 (unit elastic). The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of any linear supply curve that cuts the y-axis is greater than 1 (elastic), and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of any linear supply curve that cuts the x-axis is less than 1 (inelastic).

5000|$|Schmidt himself {{worked out}} a second, more elegant, scheme for {{producing}} the complex figure needed for the correcting plate. [...] A thin glass disk with a perfectly polished accurate flat form was placed on a heavy metal pan. The upper edge of the pan was ground at a precise angle or bevel based on the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of the particular type of glass plate that was being used. The glass plate was sealed to the ground edge of the pan, then a vacuum pump was used to exhaust the air until a particular negative pressure had been achieved. This caused the glass plate to warp slightly. The exposed side was then ground and polished to a perfect flat. When the vacuum was released, the plate sprang back until its bottom surface was again plane, while the upper surface had the correct figure. Schmidt's vacuum figuring method is rarely used today. The glass plate will usually break if bent enough to generate a curve for telescopes of focal ratio f/2.5 or faster. [...] Also, for fast focal ratios, the curve obtained is not sufficiently exact and requires additional hand correction.|$|E

5000|$|Modern (2007) watch balance {{wheels are}} usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal {{expansion}} alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> alloy such as Nivarox. [...] The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower temperature error. The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. [...] Balance wheels rotate about 1½ turns with each swing, that is, about 270° to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds {{the part of the}} spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant vibration rate of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‘free sprung’ balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight screws on the balance rim. A balance's vibration rate is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. [...] Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. [...] Audemars Piguet currently produces a movement that allows for a very high balance vibration of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). [...] The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which by WWII had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day.|$|E
