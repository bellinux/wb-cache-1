5|$|Both teams progressed {{through four}} {{elimination}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. The match was Alloa Athletic's first national cup final in its 121-year history whilst it was Inverness <b>Caledonian</b> Thistle's first since the club was founded five years beforehand in 1994. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Inverness <b>Caledonian</b> Thistle from the First Division and Alloa Athletic from the Second Division.|$|E

During their formation, tectonic movements created climatic conditions ranging from polar to desert to tropical and a resultant diversity of fossil remains.|$|E
50|$|Moreland {{topped the}} eight-team league {{finishing}} the season on 20 points, one ahead of Royal <b>Caledonians.</b> Royal <b>Caledonians</b> had finished on 21 points but were penalised 2 points and were, therefore, denied the title.|$|R
5000|$|The Ninth {{participated in}} Agricola's {{invasion}} of Caledonia (modern Scotland) in 82-3. According to Tacitus the legion narrowly escaped destruction when the <b>Caledonians</b> beyond the Forth launched a surprise attack {{at night on}} their fort. The <b>Caledonians</b> [...] "burst upon them as they were terrified in their sleep". In desperate hand-to-hand fighting the <b>Caledonians</b> entered the camp, but Agricola was able to send cavalry to relieve the legion. Seeing the relief force, [...] "the men of the Ninth Legion recovered their spirit, and sure of their safety, fought for glory", pushing back the <b>Caledonians.</b> The legion also participated in the decisive Battle of Mons Graupius.|$|R
50|$|Eumenius, the panegyrist of Constantine Chlorus, {{wrote that}} both the Picts and <b>Caledonians</b> were red haired (rutilantia). Scholars such as William Forbes Skene noted that this {{description}} matches Tacitus' description of the <b>Caledonians</b> as red haired in his Agricola.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of Pliny the Elder (79), Roman {{knowledge}} of the geography of Scotland had extended to the Hebudes (The Hebrides), Dumna (probably the Outer Hebrides), the <b>Caledonian</b> Forest, and the Caledonians.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Caledonians</b> {{are next}} {{mentioned}} in 209, {{when they are}} said to have surrendered to the emperor Septimius Severus after he personally led a military expedition north of Hadrian's Wall, in search of a glorious military victory. Herodian and Dio wrote only in passing of the campaign but describe the <b>Caledonians</b> ceding territory to Rome as being the result. Cassius Dio records that the <b>Caledonians</b> inflicted 50,000 Roman casualties due to attrition and unconventional tactics such as guerrilla warfare. Dr. Colin Martin has suggested that the Severan campaigns did not seek a battle but instead sought to destroy the fertile agricultural land of eastern Scotland and thereby bring about genocide of the <b>Caledonians</b> through starvation.|$|R
5|$|Not {{long after}} Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into {{war with the}} Kingdom of Dacia in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a {{large-scale}} strategic withdrawal of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the <b>Caledonian</b> forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120kilometres (75mi) further south. The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the <b>Caledonian</b> territories never represented {{anything more than a}} loss to the Roman treasury.|$|E

500|$|According to the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus, the <b>Caledonians</b> [...] "turned to armed resistance {{on a large}} scale", attacking Roman forts and skirmishing {{with their}} legions.

5000|$|Tacitus in his Agricola, chapter XI (c. 98 AD) {{described}} the <b>Caledonians</b> as red haired and large limbed, which he considered features of Germanic origin: “The reddish (rutilae) hair and large limbs of the <b>Caledonians</b> proclaim a German origin”. Jordanes in his Getica wrote something similar: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{report of}} the Commissioners was not binding, and the rivalry between {{supporters}} of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK, and the GPK itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the <b>Caledonian</b> Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh; moreover locomotive designs were being improved, {{and the capacity to}} haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the <b>Caledonian</b> Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK fighting on in the Lords, the <b>Caledonian</b> Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845.|$|E
5|$|A new species, Podoserpula miranda, was {{proposed}} in 2009 {{by a group}} of New <b>Caledonian</b> mycologists for a species of that South Pacific archipelago. The name was provisional (not validly published), however, as the description was in French (the code of nomenclature mandates Latin) and lacked a required designation of a type specimen. It was validly published in 2013.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the crash}} of Flight 663 was the fifth worst {{aviation}} accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States.

50|$|Even {{though the}} Romans were outnumbered in their {{campaign}} against the tribes of Britain, they often had difficulties in getting their foes to face them in open battle. The Caledonii were the last unconquered British tribe (and were never fully subdued). After many years of avoiding the fight, the <b>Caledonians</b> were forced to join battle when the Romans marched on the main granaries of the <b>Caledonians,</b> {{just as they had}} been filled from the harvest. The <b>Caledonians</b> {{had no choice but to}} fight, or starve over the next winter.|$|R

5|$|By 28 October 1850 {{the final}} section of the main line to Carlisle was {{completed}} by the GD, and trains began to run through to Carlisle; evidently the difficulty with the <b>Caledonian</b> Railway from Gretna southwards had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of British Airways Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, British <b>Caledonian</b> (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to {{investigate}} the possibility of their own Concorde operations. This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two years}} of fierce {{competition}} with British <b>Caledonian,</b> the second-largest airline in the United Kingdom at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Caledonians,</b> {{like many}} Celtic tribes in Britain, were hillfort {{builders}} and farmers who defeated and were {{defeated by the}} Romans on several occasions.

Production costs at Fountainbridge had become twice as high as those at the company's lowest-cost brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. It closed in June 2005, with the loss of 170 jobs. Production of McEwan's draught beers was transferred to the <b>Caledonian</b> Brewery with cans of McEwan's Export being produced at John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster. The McEwan's and Younger's brands added around 50,000 barrels to the production of the <b>Caledonian.</b> The last regular batch of the cask-conditioned version of McEwan's 80/- was brewed in 2006 after annual production dropped below 10,000 barrels, although the beer made a brief return in June 2011 and has since been brewed seasonally by W McEwan's Lager was reintroduced in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 84 the Romans faced the massed armies of the Caledonians at the Battle of Mons Graupius.
