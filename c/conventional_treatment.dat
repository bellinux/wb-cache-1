Homoeopathy, aromatherapy, and herbal medicine were most frequently used, most commonly for ear; nose, and throat; dermatology; musculoskeletal; infant; respiratory; and emotional/behavioural health problems. Complementary medicine was used mainly because of word-of-mouth recommendation, dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, and fear of side-effects of <b>conventional</b> <b>treatments.</b> Complementary medicine use is widespread in children; professionals {{should be aware of}} this, be alert for possible side-effects/interactions, and encourage adherence to effective <b>conventional</b> <b>treatments</b> where important...|$|R

A brief review of Absolute parallelism (AP) geometry and its parameterized version(PAP), as a wider geometry than the Riemannian one, is presented. World models constructed using alternative field theories, constructed in the AP geometry, are discussed and compared. Some points about using topology in the field of cosmology are commented. A new path equation, admitted by the PAP geometry, is used to get the effect of spin-gravity interaction on the cosmological parameters. ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>conventional</b> <b>treatment</b> {{method is}} an {{intravenous}} injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of <b>conventional</b> <b>treatment</b> in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|E
