5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the <b>crank</b> <b>handle.</b> Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, often seen {{in the works of}} those such as the German {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser. Devices depicted in Kyeser's Bellifortis include cranked windlasses (instead of spoke-wheels) for spanning siege crossbows, cranked chain of buckets for water-lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells. Kyeser also equipped the Archimedes' screws for water-raising with a <b>crank</b> <b>handle,</b> an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading. The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, seen {{in the works of}} those such as the {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser (1366after 1405). A rotary grindstone − the earliest representation thereof − which is operated by a <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> is shown in the Carolingian manuscript Utrecht Psalter; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original. A musical tract ascribed to the abbot Odo of Cluny (ca. 878−942) describes a fretted stringed instrument which was sounded by a resined wheel turned with a crank; the device later appears in two 12th century illuminated manuscripts. There are also two pictures of Fortuna cranking her wheel of destiny from this and the following century.|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} based on the proven Tatra concept of a {{backbone}} tube chassis construction with swing half axles, a modular gearbox and differential assemblies. The main advantages of the central load carrying backbone tube are its high torsion and bend strength, which protects the truck body against load stresses. The secondary advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drivetrain. Due to its torsional stiffness and use of differentials locks the vehicle had exceptional offroad capabilities. Of note was the ability to use a <b>cranking</b> <b>handle</b> to start the engine.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from its}} method of propulsion, the Djinn was a {{relatively}} conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided {{with an array of}} plexiglas panels, which provide the occupants {{with a high level of}} all-round visibility. Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the rotorcraft's single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be hand-started via a <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54 per cent of the rotorcraft's overall gross weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{was equipped}} with an uncovered tail boom, outfitted with twin fins and a rudder; both directional control and stability of the vehicle were provided via the controlled deflection of exhaust gases from the engine. As {{a consequence of the}} torque-free method of rotor propulsion, the Djinn did not require the presence of an anti-torque tail rotor. A simplistic wheel-equipped twin-skid arrangement was also present; this was retractable via the same manually-operated <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> used for engine ignition. The Djinn could also be deployed with multiple armaments. In the ground-attack role, it could be equipped with a single machine gun, which was manned from the second seat of the cockpit. For performing anti-tank warfare, the Djinn was able to equip a guided missile; when deployed in an effective manner against an adversary, the manufacturer claimed the combination to be extremely difficult for an opposing tank to sight its adversary and to defend itself during the anticipated rapid speed of engagements.|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a [...] "regular grunting sound" [...] simulating {{the roar of the}} tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.|$|E
50|$|Salad spinners {{are usually}} made from plastic and include an outer bowl with an inner {{removable}} colander or strainer basket. A cover, which fits {{around the outside}} bowl, contains a spinning mechanism that when initiated causes the inside strainer to rotate rapidly. The water is driven though the slits in the basket into the outer bowl. There {{are a number of}} different mechanisms used to operate the device, including <b>crank</b> <b>handles,</b> push buttons and pull-cords. The salad spinner is generally easy to use, though its large and rigid shape has led to criticism; the product is often considered bulky and difficult to store.|$|R
50|$|Both teams play at once. The two adults, {{dressed as}} lab assistants, <b>crank</b> <b>handles</b> {{as fast as}} they can to make it harder for the {{children}} to grab test tubes filled with blue, yellow, and red gunge. The children must still grab the tubes, make their way through the obstacle course that resembles an atom, and fill any gunge left into the correct tube to mix two colours together to make a new colour (purple, orange, or green). To help the children, a chart is placed above the course to show what two primary colours mix to make the correct secondary colour. Each correct mixing is worth 20 points, and the first child to mix all three colours together correctly (and earn 60 points) opens a vat which releases blue or yellow gunge on the matching adult.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle has two two {{cylinder}} flat 120 x 120 mm {{liquid cooled}} Benz engines (the {{same as the}} 1st Präsident passenger car), which are mounted under the frame behind the rear axle. Uniquely, the engines could be operated sequentially depending on the load requirements. No 1 engine was started via a <b>cranking</b> <b>handle</b> and had a flywheel attached and No 2 engine without the flywheel was connected via a gear clutch and started by the first engine already running. The second engine could be started or switched off anytime during the drive. Switching off the second engine cuts the fuel consumption in half.Another interesting detail is the both engines vapour cooling - coolant fumes are led to the roof condenser and the water is recycled back into the coolant tanks placed in the vehicle rear what lowers the water consumption.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{fishing reels}} are {{suspended}} {{from the bottom of}} the rod, since this position requires no wrist strength to overcome gravity while enabling the angler to cast and retrieve without changing hands. [...] The baitcasting reel's unusual mounting position atop the rod is an accident of history. [...] Baitcasting reels were originally designed to be cast when positioned atop the rod, then rotated upside-down in order to operate the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> while playing a fish or retrieving line. [...] However, in practice most anglers preferred to keep the reel atop the rod for both cast and retrieve by simply transferring the rod to the left hand for the retrieve, then reverse-winding the <b>crank</b> <b>handle.</b> [...] Because of this preference, mounting the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> on the right side of a bait casting reel (with standard clockwise <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> rotation) has become customary, though models with left-hand retrieve have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to user familiarity with the spinning reel.|$|E
2500|$|The crank {{is geared}} {{to give a}} {{negative}} mechanical advantage {{so that it can}} crank the machine at high speed. [...] Each rotation of the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> produces three rotations of the handwheel, and hence three stitches.|$|E
2500|$|Modern fly reels {{typically}} have more sophisticated disc-type drag systems made of composite materials that feature increased adjustment range, consistency, {{and resistance to}} high temperatures from drag friction. [...] Most of these fly reels also feature large-arbor spools designed to reduce line memory, maintain consistent drag and assist the quick retrieval of slack line in the event a hooked fish makes a sudden run towards the angler. [...] Most modern fly reels are ambidextrous, allowing the angler to place the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> of the reel on either the right or the left side as desired.|$|E
2500|$|Pressing {{a button}} on the rear of the reel {{disengages}} the line pickup, and the button is then released during the forward cast to allow the line to fly off the spool. The button is pressed again to stop the lure at the position desired. [...] Upon <b>cranking</b> the <b>handle,</b> the pickup pin immediately re-engages the line and spools it onto the reel.|$|R
25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window <b>crank</b> <b>handles</b> and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crank</b> or <b>handle</b> : This is the {{original}} design, and still very popular. It works through a system of gears. The <b>handle</b> or <b>crank</b> is turned in a circular motion, which rotates a gear. This is connected to another gear that turns the basket. Critics describe it as [...] "cumbersome", saying the motion is awkward. The crank style is thought to require more physical effort than the other spinning mechanisms.|$|R
2500|$|Fixed spool reels {{are cast}} by opening the bail, {{grasping}} {{the line with}} the forefinger, and then using a backward snap of the rod followed by a forward cast while releasing the line with the forefinger at the same time. [...] The forefinger is then placed {{in contact with the}} departing line and {{the leading edge of the}} spool in order to slow or stop the outward cast. [...] On the retrieve, the left hand normally operates the <b>crank</b> <b>handle,</b> while the large rotating wire cage or bail (either manually or trigger-operated) serves as the line pickup, restoring the line to its original position on the spool.|$|E
2500|$|A {{short list}} of other {{precursors}} to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical analog computers which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (<b>crank</b> <b>handle,</b> weight, wheel, water...). [...] Before common era, there are odometers and the Antikythera mechanism, an out of place, unique, geared astronomical clock, followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical clocks, geared astrolabes and followed in the 15th century by pedometers These machines were all made of toothed gears linked by some sort of carry mechanisms. [...] These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together {{by the rules of}} arithmetic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, the Mitchell Reel Company of Cluses, France {{introduced}} the Mitchell 300, a spinning reel with {{a design that}} oriented {{the face of the}} fixed spool forward in a permanently fixed position below the fishing rod. [...] The Mitchell reel was soon offered in a range of sizes for all fresh and saltwater fishing. [...] A manual line pickup was used to retrieve the cast line, which eventually developed into a wire bail design that automatically recaptured the line upon cranking the retrieve handle. [...] An anti-reverse lever prevented the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> from rotating while a fish was pulling line from the spool. [...] With the use of light lines testing from two to six pounds, modern postwar spinning reels were capable of casting lures as light as , and sometimes lighter.|$|E

40|$|Handcycling {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular, allowing for a greater mobility and for more training and sports opportunities, and therefore enhancing the social sphere of action of individuals with lower extremity impairments. Research in hand cycling however is scarce. Several determinants that affect performance during hand cycling {{have not yet been}} addressed at present. No studies have been conducted that measured and analysed the movement and muscle activation pattern, and the force generation strategies during hand cycling As well, no data are available investigating the influence of functional potential (or the impairment severity) of the user and type of handbike on the movement pattern and the mechanical efficiency during hand cycling. Nevertheless, such data can be important with regards to the optimization of performance in handbike athletes, and the prevention of propulsion related overuse injuries. Therefore the purpose of this research project focused on acquiring new scientific insights in a number of ergonomic aspects in handcycling, more particularly with respect to the influence of the crank rate, the functional potential of the handbike user, and the handbike configuration on the mechanical efficiency. In addition, the project aimed at identifying possible causal relationships between the mechanical efficiency en the force generation effectiveness on the one hand, and the movement and muscle activation pattern, and the force generation strategy on the other hand. The first study investigated the influence of crank rate in handcycling. The results indicated that the freely chosen crank rate is not necessarily the most economical, that high crank rates result in a lower mechanical efficiency at a given power output and that freely chosen crank rates increase with increasing power output levels. The second study aimed at quantifying the torque on the crank axis during handcycling, and to evaluate the consistency of the within cycle torque pattern in hand cycling in subsequent cycles, between different individuals, between different power output levels, and with respect to fatigue. The results suggested a consistent within cycle torque distribution pattern for subsequent cycles and between participants, which is minimally influenced by factors such as power output and fatigue. Thereafter, a handbike ergometer was developed that allows an adequate simulation of ergonomic conditions and mechanical characteristics of hand cycling, a continuous control of workload, the measurement of the three dimensional forces exerted on the <b>crank</b> <b>handles,</b> and the position of the <b>cranks</b> and <b>crank</b> <b>handles,</b> and the possibility to synchronize the force generation measurements with other kinesiological parameters such as kinematics and electromyography and physiological responses. This handbike ergometer was used to conduct a fourth study aiming at evaluating the impact of spinal cord injury lesion level on the force generation strategy and effectiveness. The results illustrated that the force generation effectiveness is mainly associated with the functional availability of the elbow extensors as push force generators and the wrist and finger flexors to grasp the <b>crank</b> <b>handles.</b> On the other hand, trunk strength does not seem to {{play a crucial role in}} the effectiveness of force generation during handcycling. Finally, a fifth investigation was carried out to analyze and compare the performance characteristics (mechanical efficiency and peak power output) in 2 handbike configurations: arm powered (AP) and arm trunk powered (ATP) handcycling. The results revealed that ATP handcycling allows for a higher peak power output generation, which is likely caused by a possible trunk involvement. On the other hand, mechanical efficiency was found to be lower during ATP compared to AP handcycling. Potential causes for this lower mechanical efficiency include a greater anterioposterior movement of the shoulder and a different force generation strategy, resulting in a greater muscular demand and therefore also increased energetic requirements during ATP handcycling. Further integrated investigations are necessary to provide a better insight in the relationship mechanical work-metabolic energy expenditure. The movement and muscle activation pattern, in combination with the force generation strategy during hand cycling in realistic conditions can be integrated in a mathematical model, allowing an optimization of the propulsion technique with regards to both energy expenditure and force generation. In addition, such studies allow the investigation of possible causal relationships between the low mechanical efficiency and the incidence of overuse injuries in the shoulder-arm region. As well, individual optimization is possible, taking into consideration the functional potential of the user, the configuration of the handbike and the handbike-user interface. nrpages: 169 status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Spinning reels, {{also called}} fixed spool reels, were {{in use in}} North America {{as early as the}} 1870s. [...] They were {{originally}} developed to allow the use of artificial flies, or other lures for trout or salmon, that were too light in weight to be easily cast by bait casting reels. [...] Fixed-spool or spinning reels are normally mounted below the rod; this positioning conforms to gravity, requiring no wrist strength to maintain the reel in position. [...] For right-handed persons, the spinning rod is held and cast by the strong right hand, leaving the left hand free to operate the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> mounted {{on the left side of}} the reel. [...] Invention of the fixed-spool or spinning reel solved the problem of backlash, since the reel had no rotating spool capable of overrunning and fouling the line.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{spinning}} reels do {{not suffer}} from backlash, line can occasionally be trapped underneath {{itself on the}} spool or even detach from the reel in loose loops of line. [...] Some of these issues {{can be traced to}} overfilling the spool with line, while others are due {{to the way in which}} the line is wound onto the spool by the rotating bail or pickup. [...] Various oscillating spool mechanisms have been introduced over the years in an effort to solve this problem. [...] Spinning reels also tend to have more issues with twisting of the fishing line. [...] Line twist in spinning reels can occur from the spin of an attached lure, the action of the wire bail against the line when engaged by the <b>crank</b> <b>handle,</b> or even retrieval of line that is under load (spinning reel users normally pump the rod up and down, then retrieve the slack line to avoid line twist and stress on internal components). [...] In order to minimize line twist, many anglers who use a spinning reel manually reposition the bail after each cast with the pickup nearest the rod in order to minimize line twist.|$|E
2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel with one hand, while casting the rod {{with the other}} hand. [...] The main purpose of a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your fly rod when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the spooled fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide adjustment range or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of investigations in hand cycling thus far {{were carried out}} in little realistic conditions, {{particularly with regard to}} ergonomics and mechanical characteristics such as steering and stabilization mechanisms. In addition, integrated investigations studying both the physiological and biomechanical responses during realistic maximal and submaximal hand cycling have not yet been conducted. This paper illustrates the design, the working, and the possibilities of a newly developed handbike ergometer that simulates hand cycling in realistic ergonomic and mechanical conditions with a continuous control of the workload. Built-in force transducers in both <b>crank</b> <b>handles</b> allow the registration of the orthogonal force components in three dimensions along a pre-defined X, Y, and Z-axes in function of time and/or position. Consequently, the resultant force and the forces exerted in each plane of the test person can be calculated to evaluate the forward, upward, and sideward force generation during hand cycling. The tangential, radial, and transversal forces can also be calculated to analyze the movement effectiveness. As well, eight extra channels are foreseen to allow a simultaneous and synchronized electromyography registration. The handbike ergometer is therefore a useful tool to capture data that are novel and {{at the forefront of the}} field of biomechanical analyses in hand cycling, taking into consideration the physical potential of the user, the configuration of the handbike and the handbike–user interface. status: publishe...|$|R
