40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} types of plant growth retardants on fungal gibberellin (GA) formation has been studied in cultures of Gibberella fujikuroi and Sphaceloma manihoticola. Quaternary ammonium compounds (chlormequat chloride, mepiquat chloride, Amo- 1618), triazoles (uniconazole and several experimental compounds), and the norbornanodiazetine tetcyclacis inhibited GA biosynthesis in both fungal species. Concentrations between 2 × 10 − 4 and 10 − 9 m were required for a 50 % inhibition of the production of gibberellin A 3 in Gibberella fujikuroi and of giberellin A 4 in Sphaceloma manihoticola. The formation of other prominent GAs was affected at a similar degree of intensity. Tetcyclacis was the most active compound in both fungi. Compared to the growth retardants mentioned above, the biological activity of <b>chlorphonium</b> chloride was low. The acylcyclohexanediones prohexadione and LAB 198 999 had virtually no activity. Most likely, this lack of activity is due to a rapid metabolism of the compounds in the cultures. For the triazole-type compounds and tetcyclacis, a relatively distinct correlation exists in their ability to inhibit GA formation in fungal cultures, to block ent-kaurene oxygenase in a cell-free system, and to reduce shoot growth of rice seedlings. Due to differences in their metabolic fate and species specificities, such conclusions cannot be made for the other compounds...|$|E
