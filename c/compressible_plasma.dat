40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} magnetic reconnection in {{the solar}} corona. Magnetic reconnection is the only mechanism which allows the magnetic topology of magnetized plasmas to be changed. Many of the dynamic processes in the Sun's atmosphere {{are believed to be}} driven by magnetic reconnection and studying the behaviour of such phenomena is a key step to understanding the reconnection mechanism. In Chapters 1 to 3, we discuss the physical and mathematical framework on which current magnetohydrodynamic reconnection models are based. The aim of the thesis is to investigate theoretical models of magnetic reconnection using variety of analytic and numerical techniques within the theoretical frame work of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In Chapter 4 we use a line-tied X-point collapse model for <b>compressible</b> <b>plasmas</b> to investigate the role of viscosity on the energy release mechanism. This model also provides the basis for the investigation of Chapter 5 which explores the impact of Hall currents in the transient X-point energy dissipation. Chapter 6 is concerned with how reconnection is modified in the presence of generalized Ohm's law which includes both Hall current and electron inertia contributions. In contrast to the closed X-point collapse geometry adopted for <b>compressible</b> <b>plasmas</b> previously, we find it more convenient to explore this problem using an open incompressible geometry in which plasma is continually entering and exiting the reconnection region. Specially, we find the scaling of the Hall-MHD system size analytically, rather than numerically as in the X-point problem of Chapter 5.

The stability criteria for viscous plasmas are compared with those for ideal plasmas where stability is determined by the Kelvin-Helmholtz velocity VKH as a threshold for the difference in the equilibrium velocities. Viscosity turns out to have a destabilizing influence when the viscosity coefficient takes different values at {{the two sides of the}} discontinuity.

40|$|Magnetic fields play an {{important}} role in astrophysical accretion discs, and in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. They drive jets, suppress fragmentation in star-forming clouds and can have a significant impact on the accretion rate of stars. However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic magnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing recent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent dynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic fields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for incompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly <b>compressible</b> astrophysical <b>plasmas,</b> which are characterised by strong density fluctuations and shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works not only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, <b>compressible</b> <b>plasmas,</b> as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further present new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the turbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component (B_turb) in the presence of weak and strong guide fields (B_ 0). I vary B_ 0 over 5 orders of magnitude and find that the dependence of B_turb on B_ 0 is relatively weak, and can be explained with a simple theoretical model in which the turbulence provides the energy to amplify B_turb. Finally, I discuss some important implications of magnetic fields for the structure of accretion discs, the launching of jets, and the star formation rate of interstellar clouds.

40|$|International audienceIon Larmor radius {{effects on}} guide field collisionless {{magnetic}} reconnection are investigated {{by means of}} numerical simulations based on a gyrofluid model for <b>compressible</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Compressibility along the magnetic field is seen to favour the distribution of ion guiding center density along the neutral line, rather than along the separatrices, unlike the electron density. On the other hand, increasing ion temperature reduces the intensity of ion guiding flow that develop in the direction parallel to the magnetic guide field. Numerical simulations suggest that the width of these bar-shaped layers scale linearly with the ion Larmor radius. The increase of ion temperature radius causes also a reduction of the electron parallel velocity. As a consequence, {{it is found that}} the cusp-like profiles distinctive of non-dissipative reconnection are strongly attenuated. The field structures are interpreted in terms of the behavior of the four topological invariants of the system. Two of these are seen to behave similarly to invariants of simpler models that do not account for parallel ion flow. The other two exhibit different structures, partly {{as a consequence of the}} small electron/ion mass ratio. The origin of these invariants at the gyrokinetic level is also discussed. The investigation of the field structures is complemented by an analysis of the energetics of the system...|$|R

We are, investigating hydrodynamic instabilities such as the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, at high compression at the Nova laser in a series of experiments, both in planar and in spherical geometry. In the indirect drive approach, a thermal x-ray drive is generated by focusing the Nova laser beams into a Au cylindrical radiation cavity (hohlraum). Issues in the instability evolution that we are examining are shock propagation and foil compression, RT growth of 2 D versus 3 D single-mode perturbations, drive pulse shape, perturbation location at the ablation front versus at an embedded interface, and multimode perturbation growth and nonlinear saturation. The effects of convergence on RT growth are being investigated both with hemispherical implosions of packages mounted on the hohlraum wall and with spherical implosions of capsules at the center of the hohlraum. Single-mode perturbations are pre-imposed at the ablation front of these capsules as a seed for the RT growth.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} energy of nonlinear Alfven waves in <b>compressible</b> <b>plasmas</b> may be ponderomotively coupled only to ion-acoustic quasi-modes which modulate the wave phase velocity and cause wave-front steepening. In the collisionless plasma with β= 0, {{the dynamics of}} nonlinear Alfven wave is also affected by the resonant particle-wave interactions. Upon relatively rapid evolution (compared to the particle bounce time), the quasi-stationary wave structures, identical to the so called (Alfvenic) Rotational Discontinuities, form, the emergence and dynamics of {{which has not been}} previously understood. Collisionless (Landau) dissipation of nonlinear Alfven waves is also a plausible and natural mechanism of the solar wind heating. Considering a strong, compressible, Alfvenic turbulence as an ensemble of randomly interacting Alfvenic discontinuities and nonlinear waves, it is shown that there exist two distinct phases of turbulence. What phase realizes depends on whether this collisionless damping is strong enough to provide adequate energy sink at all scales and, thus, to support a steady-state cascade of the wave energy. In long-time asymptotics, however, the particle distribution function is affected by the wave magnetic fields. In this regime of nonlinear Landau damping, resonant particles are trapped in the quasi-stationary Alfvenic discontinuities, giving rise to a formation of a plateau on the distribution function and quenching collisionless damping. Using the virial theorem for trapped particles, it is analytically demonstrated that their effect on the nonlinear dynamics of such discontinuities is non-trivial and forces a significant departure of the theory from the conventional paradigm.
