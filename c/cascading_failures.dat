40|$|Catastrophic {{disruptions}} of large, interconnected infrastructure {{systems are}} often due to <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> For example, large blackouts of electric power systems are typically caused by <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> of heavily loaded system components. We introduce the CASCADE model of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> {{of a system}} with many identical components randomly loaded. An initial disturbance causes some components to fail by exceeding their loading limit. Failure of a component causes a fixed load increase for other components. As components fail, the system becomes more loaded and <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> of further components becomes likely. The probability distribution {{of the number of}} failed components is an extended quasibinomial distribution. Explicit formulas for the extended quasibinomial distribution are derived using a recursion.

40|$|An {{effective}} way to suppress the <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk is the branch capacity upgrade, whose optimal decision making, however, may incur high computational burden.

This paper proposes a simulation data oriented approach to identify the critical branches with higher importance in <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> propagation. First, a concept of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> chain (CFC) is introduced and numerous samples of CFC are generated with an AC power flow based <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> simulator.

40|$|AbstractCascade {{failure is}} an {{interesting}} theme {{on the study of}} complex network and has attracted a lot of researchers. Examples of <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> include disease epidemics, traffic congestion, electrical power system blackouts, etc. The most common feature of <b>cascade</b> <b>failures</b> is that a local failure event results in a global failure on a larger scale. A lot of factors are considered as <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> reasons such as network interdependency or network topology. The classic literature on <b>cascade</b> <b>failure</b> includes two basic models: percolation cascade and capacity cascade. Studies in capacity cascade are found in some important domains such as power distribution systems. In these systems, if external shocks or excess loads at some nodes are propagated to other connected nodes due to failure, the domino effects often come with disastrous consequences. Thus, how to prevent this type of cascade is an important emerging issue.

40|$|A {{criticality}} {{approach to}} monitoring <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk and failure propagation in transmission systems Abstract â€” We consider {{the risk of}} <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> of electric power transmission systems as overall loading is increased. There is evidence from both abstract and power systems models of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> {{that there is a}} critical loading at which the risk of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> sharply increases. Moreover, as expected in a phase transition, at the critical loading there is a power tail in the probability distribution of blackout size. (This power tail is consistent with the empirical distribution of North American blackout sizes.) The importance of the critical loading is that it gives a reference point for determining the risk of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Indeed the risk of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> can be quantified and monitored by finding the closeness to the critical loading. This paper suggests and outlines ways of detecting the closeness to criticality from data produced from a generic blackout model. The increasing expected blackout size at criticality can be detected by computing expected blackout size at various loadings. Another approach uses branching process models of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> to interpret the closeness to the critical loading in terms of a failure propagation parameter Î». We suggest a statistic for Î» that could be applied before saturation occurs. The paper concludes with suggestions for a wider research agenda for measuring the closeness to criticality of a fixed power transmission network and for studying the complex dynamics governing the slow evolution of a transmission network.

30|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{theories}} and {{methods have been}} proposed to investigate cascading failure: {{some of them are}} based on self-organized critically (SOC) theory, including the OPA model [5], which considers the SOC of the growth of load demand and power supply, the CASCADE model [6, 7], which simulates <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> from initial disturbance and load growth, and the branching process model [8] etc.; some theories based on network topology analysis [9 â€“ 12], which analyze <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> through distinguishing the topological feature of power system, like small-world network, scale-free network and so on; pattern search strategy [13 â€“ 19], which aims to reveal <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> directly through searching failure chains in accordance with previously given strategy, etc. Among these pattern search strategies, the traditional ways can already simulate the process of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> to a certain extent. However, some problems disclosed from important procedures make them hard to fully reflect the actual process and reaction of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Firstly, the emerging prevention and control measures applied in traditional models only consider one means commonly, and the operability of measures taken is usually poor. Besides, the restriction of subsequent failure search is quite strict as well as some key factors are not considered, like the duration time of overload state and the distance to previous failures. Whatâ€™s more, the obtained data from the statistical methods can only describe some basic characteristics of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> to some extent. However, some key information such as the correlation between the former event chain and the subsequent one is difficult to be revealed.

40|$|Industry {{reliability}} rules increasingly require {{utilities to}} study and mitigate <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk in their system. Motivated by this, this paper describes how <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk, in terms of expected blackout size, varies with power system load level and pre-contingency dispatch. We used Monte Carlo sampling of random branch outages to generate contingencies, and a model of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> to estimate blackout sizes. The risk associated with different blackout sizes was separately estimated in order to separate small, medium, and large blackout risk. Results from $N- 1 $ secure models of the IEEE RTS case and a 2383 bus case indicate that blackout risk does not always increase with load level monotonically, particularly for large blackout risk. The results also show that risk is highly dependent on the method used for generator dispatch. Minimum cost methods of dispatch can result in larger long distance power transfers, which can increase <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> risk.

40|$|We give a {{comprehensive}} {{account of a}} complex systems approach to large blackouts caused by <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Instead {{of looking at the}} details of particular blackouts, we study the statistics, dynamics and risk of series of blackouts with approximate global models. North American blackout data suggests that the frequency of large blackouts is governed by a power law. This result is consistent with the power system being a complex system designed and operated near criticality. The power law makes the risk of large blackouts consequential and implies the need for nonstandard risk analysis. Power system overall load relative to operating limits is a key factor affecting the risk of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure.</b> Blackout models and an abstract model of <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> show that there are critical transitions as load is increased. Power law behavior can be observed at these transitions. The critical loads at which blackout risk sharply increases are identifiable thresholds for <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> and we discuss approaches to computing the proximity to <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> using these thresholds. Approximating <b>cascading</b> <b>failure</b> as a branching process suggests ways to compute and monitor criticality by quantifying how much failures propagate. Inspired by concepts from self-organized criticality, we suggest that power system operating margins evolve slowly to near criticality and confirm this idea using a blackout model. Mitigation of blackout risk should take care to account for counter-intuitive effects in complex self-organized critical systems. For example, suppressing small blackouts could lead the system to be operated closer to the edge and ultimately increase the risk of large blackouts. ...|$|R
