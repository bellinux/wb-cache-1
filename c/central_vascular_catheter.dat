40|$|AbstractWhether {{patients}} whose catheter tip grows Staphylococcus aureus but {{who have no}} concomitant bacteraemia should receive antimicrobials remains an unresolved issue. However, a proportion of patients with catheter tips colonized by S. aureus have no blood cultures taken because of low suspicion of sepsis {{and the meaning of}} this microbiological finding is unknown. We have analysed all catheter tips growing S. aureus during a 6 -year period and have selected patients without blood cultures taken 7 days before or after <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> removal. Patient's evolution was classified into good and poor outcome. Poor outcome was defined as S. aureus infection within 3 months after catheter withdrawal or death in the same period with no obvious cause. Patients with good and poor outcomes were compared to assess whether antimicrobial therapy influenced evolution. Sixty-seven patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria and five (7. 4 %) had a poor outcome. The administration of early anti-staphylococcal therapy had no impact on the outcome of this population (p 0. 99). The only factor independently associated with a poor outcome was the presence of clinical signs of sepsis when the catheter was removed (OR 20. 8; 95 % CI 2. 0 - 206. 1; p 0. 009). Our data suggest that patients with <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> tips colonized with S. aureus should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of ongoing infection, but if these are not present then antimicrobial therapy does not seem justified...|$|E

The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated using multiple conditional logistic regression. We identified 145 episodes of candidemia occurring in 140 patients with a median age of 80 years. Candida albicans caused 55 % of all candidemia episodes. After adjustment, candidemia was strongly associated with duration of total [duration > 7 days: OR = 20. 09; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 44 - 117. 52] and peripheral parenteral nutrition (duration > 7 days: OR = 26. 83; 95 % CI: 6. 54 - 110. 17), other <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (OR = 5. 17; 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 23. 54) and glycopeptide antibiotics (OR = 6. 45; 95 % CI: 1. 90 - 21. 91).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of invasive fungal in-fections in {{neonatal intensive care}} units (NICUs) has increased dramatical-ly {{over the past few}} decades, partly due to the increased survival rates of preterm neonates. 1 Furthermore, advances in medical technology and drug therapy, such as <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters,</b> broad-spectrum antibiotics, and parenteral nutri-tion, predispose these already immuno-compromised patients to fungal infec-tions. 2 The majority of fungal infections in preterm neonates are caused by Candi-da spp. 3 Candida spp. are commensal or-ganisms and generally cause infections only in immunocompromised individuals. With the diminished immune system of preterm infants and the aforementioned risk factors, Candida spp. can disseminate to the bloodstream. 4 Early diagnosis and the appropriate treatment are important factors in suc-cessful management of invasive fungal infections. 5 Unfortunately, blood cul-tures, the current gold standard for diag-nosis of candidiasis, demonstrate low sensitivity and there are reporting delays of approximately 48 - 72 hours. Further-more, dissemination can occur in almost every end-organ, including the central nervous system (CNS), where neurode-velopmental sequelae are severe and fre-quent. 6 In neonates, neurodevelopmental outcomes have been related to the timing of the initiation of antifungal therapy, showing improved neurodevelopment where anti-fungal therapy was started earlier. 7 Thus, timely initiation of the most effective antifungal agent available is warrant-ed to minimize dissemination of Candida spp. to other or-gans.

SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} for 48 hrs or more from October 1995 to November 1997. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We prospectively surveyed 1, 068 patients during their intensive care unit stay and for 5 days after intensive care unit discharge. We detected 554 intensive care unit-acquired infections, yielding an infection rate of 70. 7 per 1, 000 patient days. Of these, only 31 infections (5. 6 %) in 27 patients were detected after intensive care unit discharge. If postdischarge surveillance was targeted on patients who had had a <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> while in the intensive care unit, only one infected patient would have been missed, but only 554 out of 889 would have been followed up (sensitivity, 96. 2 %; specificity, 38. 7 %; negative predictive value, 99. 7 %).

Our aim was to analyse the clinical, microbiological and molecular determinants of this persistent CoNS bacteraemia. Neonates with late-onset CoNS bacteraemia were studied for a 2 -year period. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, microbiological and molecular data were compared between neonates with persistent (≥ 3 consecutive positive blood cultures) and non-persistent CoNS bacteraemia. Twenty-nine infants with persistent and 43 with non-persistent bacteraemia were identified, with no significant differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Of a total of 170 CoNS isolates, 80 showed biofilm production (54 persistent and 26 non-persistent; p 0. 013), whereas 127 were positive for the icaA and icaD genes (74 persistent and 53 non-persistent; p 0. 598). Sixty ica-positive isolates did not produce slime, whereas 13 ica-negative isolates showed biofilm production.

This study analysed episodes of MRSA bacteraemia (N = 4404) where a probable source of infection was reported between 2006 and 2009. In 2009, this information was available for one-third of reported episodes of MRSA bacteraemia. Of these, 20 % were attributed to intravascular devices and 28 % were attributed to skin and soft tissue infection. Sixty-four {{percent of the patients}} were male, and urinary tract infection was a significantly more common source of MRSA bacteraemia in males compared with females (12 % vs 3 %). Detection of bacteraemia within two days of hospital admission does not reliably discriminate between community- and hospital-associated MRSA bacteraemia as community cases are frequently associated with an invasive procedure/device. Between 2006 and 2009, there was a significant decline in the proportion of episodes of MRSA bacteraemia associated with <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 29 – 0. 61; P < 0. 001], peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (IRR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 48 – 0. 99; P = 0. 042) and surgical site infection (IRR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 25 – 0. 72; P = 0. 001), and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of episodes of MRSA bacteraemia associated with skin and soft tissue infection (IRR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 69; P = 0. 017) and attributed to contamination of the specimen (IRR 1. 96, 95 % CI 1. 25 – 3. 06; P = 0. 003).

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare CLABSI rate associated with different types of <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (CVCs) in a multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Methods. A prospective cohort study was conducted in a multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric ICU. All patients, admitted between January 1 st 2011 and February 29 th 2012, requiring a CVC were included and monitored for CLABSI (defined by CDC/NHSN criteria). CLABSI rates were calculated for each type of CVC as CLABSI episodes/ 1000 catheter-days. CLABSI rates were compared between patients with single and multiple CVCs. Results. Of the 557 patients admitted, 362 (65 %) required insertion of a CVC (4259 patient-days, 3225 catheter-days, CVC utilization ratio 0. 76). There were 14 episodes of CLABSI. CLABSI rate was lowest for umbilical catheters (0 / 1000 catheter-days), followed by short-term noncuffed and nontunneled CVCs (3. 1 / 1000 catheter-days) and peripherally inserted CVCs (8. 8 / 1000 catheter-days). Higher rates were observed with long-term cuffed and tunneled CVCs (15. 9 / 1000 catheter days) and noncuffed, nontunneled CVCs for temporary renal replacement therapy (RRT) (20. 0 / 1000 catheter days).

The case-fatality rate was 54 % among those with persistent candidemia and 3 % among those with non-persistent candidemia (p< 0. 001). Neonates with persistent candidemia {{were more likely to be}} female, have a <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> at diagnosis, and have a low platelet count. All isolated Candida species were susceptible to antifungal agents. ConclusionsPersistent candidemia is common among neonates with a Candida infection and is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Drug resistance is unlikely to explain the persistent candidemia; host-related factors seem to be more important and hence could be used to identify those at risk in order to institute appropriate preventive and treatment measures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is among}} the most {{important}} pathogens of nosocomial infections, mainly in intensive care units (ICUs), and accounts for 40 - 60 % of all healthcare-associated S. aureus infections. We evaluated the incidence of nosocomial infection by S. aureus, identified the risk factors for MRSA infection, and evaluated the effect of resistance to methicillin on mortality in patients. Methods We conducted MRSA surveillance at a university hospital in Brazil from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010, and performed a retrospective case-control matched study to evaluate the frequency of subsequent MRSA bacteremia and death among patients. We evaluated and compared the risk factors between patients with MRSA and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. Results Sepsis was {{the most common cause of}} infection (17. 7 / 1, 000 patient-days), followed by surgical site (11. 4 / 1, 000 patient-days), pneumonia (4. 1 / 1, 000 patient-days), and urinary tract infection (2. 4 / 1, 000 patient-days). The significant risk factors were time of hospitalization, use of <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> (CVC), urinary catheter, nasogastric tube, parenteral nutrition, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and previous antibiotic administration, the latter of which was the only independent risk factor for MRSA infection. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with MRSA. The number of antibiotics tested was not related to increases in the frequency of MRSA/ 1, 000 patient-days. The incidence of mortality attributable to MRSA (bloodstream infection) BSI was 50 %. Conclusions Surveillance results showed that the use of high levels of antibiotics was directly related to the development of MRSA infection, and the mortality attributable to MRSA in patients with bacteremia was significant...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Neonates {{admitted}} to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) {{have a substantial}} risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAI). A high incidence of HAI was found in Maternidade Júlio Dinis (MJD) NICU and led to changes in daily clinical practice. Objectives: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} new strategies for prevention of infection implemented in the NICU of MJD. Methods: We conducted a prospective study that included all infants {{admitted to}} the NICU of MJD during the 16 months before (group 1) and 16 months after (group 2) the protocol change, comparing the rates of infection in these two time periods. Results: 528 infants were included in group 1 and 593 in group 2, with no statistical evidence of different characteristics between them (weight, gestational age, CVC utilization rate, duration of parenteral nutrition and invasive ventilation). Overall mean infection indices decreased between the two periods: incidence -density of infection – sepsis, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis – (10, 0 vs. 6, 3; p= 0, 0007), incidence- -density of clinical plus laboratory -confirmed sepsis (9, 6 vs. 5, 9; p= 0, 0007), incidence -density of laboratory -confirmed sepsis (6, 8 vs. 4, 6; p= 0, 015), incidence rate of <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> (CVC) -associated sepsis (30, 3 vs. 22, 4; p= 0, 021) and coagulase- -negative Staphylococcus isolation rate (85, 7 % vs. 71, 1 %; p= 0, 041). Although incidence rate of laboratory -confirmed CVC- -associated sepsis decreased (22 vs. 19), the difference was not significant. Similar tendencies were observed considering very low birth weight neonates. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that an evidence- -based intervention was effective, resulting in a decrease of 37 % of the HAI in the NICU of MJD...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> {{coated with}} antiinfective {{compounds}} were evaluated {{as to their}} ability to prevent Staphylococcus aureus catheter infection in a rabbit model. Zones of inhibition of agar surface-plated S. aureus demonstrated the following hierarchy: dicloxacillin and clindamycin were each better than fusidic acid or chlorhexidine, which were better than ciprofloxacin, cefo-taxime, or cefuroxime. In vivo half-lives of inhibitory activity for clindamycin and dicloxacillin were 5. 6 and 17. 7 h, respectively, with apparent first-order kinetics. Chlorhexidine disappeared in vivo with apparent two-compartment kinetics: first-compartment t l / 2, 16. 8 h; second-com-partment t l / 2, 115. 6 h. In a rabbit model, dicloxacillin, clindarnycin, fusidic acid, and chlorhexi-dine decreased the risk of infection compared with uncoated control catheters (P <. 05). For dicloxacillin, clindamycin, and chlorhexidine, this was true even if the S. aureusinoculation was delayed 48 or 96 h after catheter implantation.

40|$|The extended-spectrum {{beta-lactamase}} (ESBL) -producing Klebsiella spp. cause worldwide {{problems in}} intensive care units. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca strains in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Budapest, Hungary and to determine the risk factors of the infections and the epidemiological features. Infections with Klebsiella spp. were analyzed retrospectively by reviewing the medical records between January 2001 and December 2005. Antibiotic susceptibility tests, isoelectric focusing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, plasmid analysis, PCR for bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) and DNA sequencing analysis were performed on ESBL-producing Klebsiella isolates. A total of 45 babies were found to be infected with non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and 39 with ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. Of the parameters analyzed, including sex, gestational age, twin pregnancy, birth weight, presence of <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter,</b> mechanical ventilator use, parenteral nutrition, polymicrobial infection, caesarean section, transfusion and mortality, we found no statistically significant difference between the ESBL and the non-ESBL groups, or between the K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca species. Further characterization of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca strains isolated between February 2001 and January 2003 revealed three distinct PFGE patterns of SHV- 5 -producing K. pneumoniae (A, B, E) and two distinct patterns of SHV- 12 -producing K. oxytoca (C,D) isolates; these had different plasmid profiles. From July to November 2005, a new SHV- 5 producing K. oxytoca (F) was isolated. The molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing organisms in a NICU over time shows substantial shifts in predominant strains. The ESBL production of the infected organisms has an impact on the survival of newborn babies with infections caused by Klebsiella spp...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE In-hospital {{transmission}} of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) among neonates remains enigmatic. We describe the epidemiology of MSSA colonization and infection in a 30 -bed neonatal ward. DESIGN Multimodal outbreak investigation SETTING A public 800 -bed tertiary care university hospital in Switzerland METHODS Investigations in 2012 - 2013, {{triggered by a}} MSSA infection cluster, included prospective MSSA infection surveillance, microbiologic screening of neonates and environment, onsite observations, and a prospective cohort study. MSSA isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and selected isolates were examined for multilocus sequence type (MLST) and virulence factors. RESULTS Among 726 in 2012, 30 (4. 1 %) patients suffered from MSSA infections including 8 (1. 1 %) with bacteremia. Among 655 admissions in 2013, 13 (2. 0 %) suffered from MSSA infections including 2 (0. 3 %) with bacteremia. Among 177 neonates screened for S. aureus carriage, overall 77 (44 %) tested positive. A predominant PFGE- 1 -ST 30 strain was identified in 6 of 30 infected neonates (20 %) and 30 of 77 colonized neonates (39 %). This persistent clone was pvl-negative, tst-positive and belonged to agr group III. We found no environmental point source. MSSA carriage was associated with <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> use but not with a particular midwife, nurse, physician, or isolette. Observed healthcare worker behavior may have propagated transmission via hands and fomites. Despite multimodal interventions, clonal transmission and colonization continued and another clone, PFGE- 6 -ST 5, became predominant. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-acquired MSSA clones represent {{a high proportion of}} MSSA colonization but not MSSA infections in neonate inpatients. In contrast to persisting MSSA, transmission infection rates decreased concurrently with interventions. It remains to be established whether eradication of hospital-acquired MSSA strains would reduce infection rates further. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2015; 00 (0) : 1 - 8...|$|E
40|$|Hospital-acquired {{infection}} affects {{hundreds of}} millions of people worldwide. It is a major global issue for patient safety. Understanding the potential risk factors is important to appreciate the local context. A matched case control study design, which is the first of its kind in the study region, was undertaken to identify risk factors in teaching hospitals of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. A matched case control study design matched with age and hospital type was used. The study was conducted in University of Gondar and Felege-Hiwot medical teaching hospital. Cases were patients who fulfilled the criteria based on CDC definition of hospital-acquired infection and controls were patients admitted to the hospital that stayed for more than 48 hours in the ward in the study period, but who did not develop infection. For one case, four controls were selected. Of 545 patients, 109 were cases and 436 were controls. Conditional logistic regression using STATA 13 was used for data analysis. The median length of stay for cases and controls was 7 and 8 days, respectively. Patients admitted in wards with the presence of medical waste container in the room had 82 % less chance of developing hospital-acquired infection (AOR 0. 18; 95 % CI, 0. 03 - 0. 98). The odds of developing hospital-acquired infection among immune deficient patients were 2. 34 times higher than their counterparts (95 % CI; 1. 17 - 4. 69). Patients received antimicrobials, <b>central</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> and surgery since admission had 8. 63, 6. 91 and 2. 35 higher odds of developing hospital-acquired infection, respectively.

In this study the use of suture-less securement did not seem to increase the risk of AVCR. However, there was a non-significant trend towards increased AVCR when using suture-less securement devices, which may reflect a ß error.
