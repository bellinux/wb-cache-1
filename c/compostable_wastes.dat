30|$|It {{is evident}} {{in this study that}} {{composted}} KW can support Corchorus production favourably like composted PM. The higher concentration of P, K, Mg and Na in composted KW than PM in this study is worthy of note. Although, composted PM had higher concentration of nitrogen and calcium than KW, the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the PM could be a major source of contaminant. Hence, usage of PM in vegetable production could contribute largely to heavy metal contamination of food crops than KW. Application of 10  t ha− 1 of composted KW and PM is suggested as soil amendment for optimum yield of Corchorus to reduce soil and food chain contamination by the toxic metals. However, while converting <b>compostable</b> <b>wastes</b> into organic fertilizer, it is imperative to investigate the potential heavy metal status of any waste to be used in production of food crops to reduce possible transfer of toxic metals to human.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} a general over {{view of the}} current municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Kolkata province, India. In order to characterize the solid waste stream in the Municipality of Kolkata, a long-term study was conducted over a 56 -week period between the winter of 2010 and the winter of 2011. In this study, percentage of components and specific weight of the MSW, the composting parameters (moisture content, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and pH), organic matter content, calorific value and heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fn, Mn, Co) of the compostable waste sorted from the mixed MSW were determined and evaluated. Kolkata city generates approximately 5114. 76 ton/d i. e., 1. 10 kg/cap-d of MSW daily. Approximately 700 ton of MSW were collected and stored in every day. Approximately 30 % of the MSW generated is <b>compostable</b> <b>wastes</b> and yearly mean moisture content, organic matter content, C/N ratio and pH of these are 46 %, 31. 81 %, 21. 6 and 8. 07, respectively, and approximately 15 % of the MSW consists of recyclable materials.

40|$|The environmental, cultural, {{socio-economic}} {{and political}} conditions of each community greatly affect the municipality's effort and decision-making in managing household wastes. Composting at home {{can be used}} as a sound method of SWM, can manage the waste at source itself thereby can increase their recycling. And vermicomposting is a viable and completely feasible option at household level, provided it is acceptable to family members to handle the worms and to remove worm-casts subsequently. In this regard, the present paper gives a methodological framework for assessing the management of urban household organic wastes using different compost models to influence the actual efficiency and effectiveness of a municipality's collection and management services. The current study also deals with the challenges of solid waste management with a focus on the segregation of <b>compostable</b> <b>wastes</b> from the non-compostable ones and their composting, recycling or disposal. The non-compostable wastes can be left for recycling and re-use by the concerned authorities. The composting behavior and the efficiency of different compost models have been dealt with, and it is concluded that vermicomposting model is the best option. Urban residents can be educated to vermicompost not only their entire kitchen wastes but also garden wastes to reduce the burden on the municipal councils. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. New technologies, social policies, and pricing schemes are {{currently}} being devised to lessen {{the environmental impacts of}} solid wastes. As with other social and eco nomic policies, these changes do not affect all segments of the population or all areas equally- an indication not only of the problems specific to waste disposal regulation, but also of at titudes about who should bear the brunt of the problem. This paper uses Nassau County in New York as a microcosm of the United States to investigate spatial variations in the management of waste disposal. Nassau County is an interesting spatial entity. From a physical standpoint it could be viewed almost as a closed system, as most ofits water supply comes from a series ofaquifers oflAng Island on which it sits. From a political and social standpoint, its governmental structure is a maze of layers. Any relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and intensity of environmental compliance might be indicative of courses that other localities across the nation may choose to follow. The disposal of solid waste is an environmental problem that must be managed every day, both at home and at the workplace. Solid waste includes "residential, commercial, and institutional wastes, construction and demolition debris, sewage sludge, <b>compostable</b> <b>wastes,</b> ash residue, and hazardous wastes " (New York State 1988, 1 - 6).

Earthworms are the bioindicators of the ecosystem. One can consider compost earthworms as bioindicators under laboratory research. Acceptances as feeding- dwelling (habit and habitat) under microlevel studies and thereafter in macro level conversions to procurable vermicompost in bulk is the wider indications of the nontoxicity range and/or acceptable limit of the inorganic components of flyash. There may be possibilities of chelating and mordanting of these components into the organic matter of the vermicompost by the enzymatic actions.

The responsibility for the waste are grounded by the Swedish law where the municipality are responsible for the collection of household waste and FTI are responsible for collecting all packages and papers that the households sorts out. A new waste regulation is under consideration where the responsibility for the household waste may change. The bulky waste from households is collected at recycling centers where the households leave it in different containers for different fractions. These recycling centers are formed different and the fractions offered in them also differ depending on in what municipality they are located. The reason for the difference seems to depend on the opportunity to recycle the fraction and cross-border cooperation does not seem to exist in any larger scale.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} urban growth posing a threat on {{sustainable}} development is poor solid waste management. The increasing amount of waste generated by rapid urbanization {{in developing countries}} is usually not properly managed and results in environmental pollution. The city of Jimma, Ethiopia, has been taken as an example in this dissertation; according to the literature, municipal solid waste management is also {{a major problem in}} other cities of east Africa. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the quantity, composition, sources of waste generated, and current disposal practices, and to investigate and recommend appropriate management technologies. The total waste generated daily in Jimma city is currently ca. 88, 000 kg, of which 54 % by weight constitutes biodegradable waste, and 46 % is non-recyclable waste. Only 25 % of the community currentlyuses municipal containers for disposal at the selected landfill site. 51 % of the households dispose their waste in individually chosen spots, 22 % use open burning and 2 % of households use private waste collectors. Asocio-economic analysis shows that higher family income and educationalstatus is associated with private or municipal waste collection and less with the application of back yard or open dumping. These insights intowaste generation and management practices in Jimma city allow making suggestions for improved collection, treatment and disposal methods. The most important conclusion is that the biodegradable waste is a major fraction of the waste, having suitable properties for valorization. An economic benefit can be obtained from this waste, at the same time avoiding the need for disposal. Two forms of valorization have been studied: composting and biogas production. Most attention has been given to composting. The effect on physical, chemical and biological properties of municipal solid waste compost of turning frequency and of the presence of non-compostable contaminants was studied. Furthermore, a decentralized community based composting scheme has been developed based on the strategy of waste leasing. In order to study the turning frequency, a fixed turning frequency is compared with a temperature-controlled turning method. The moisture content is adjusted to 50 - 60 % in all cases. The results show that a high nutrient content and moderate concentration of heavy metals with no restrictions for use in agriculture are observed in almost all cases. Interestingly, plant growth bioassays indicate that the head weight and leaf area of lettuces are slightly but not significantly higherwhen less frequently turned compost is used. In a further study on the composting strategy the effects of the presence of contaminantson compost quality is investigated. Selected contaminants, 7 % waste plastics and 2 % bottle caps, were deliberately added to sorted <b>compostable</b> <b>waste,</b> and the compost quality was compared with the quality of compost derived from non-contaminated organic waste, and compost derived from non-sorted municipal waste containing a significant fraction of organic material. It was found that the maturation time of the composting process is longer for contaminated organic waste, but the quality of the compostwas sufficient in most cases. Concentrations of heavy metals are also within the acceptable range indicated by the Belgian compost quality guidelines values except cobalt, of which the concentration is slightly higher than the standard value for compost products (Brinton, 2000). To finalize the composting study, a small scale and decentralized community composting project through the waste leasing approach is conducted for one sub city on the basis of a pilot program, in which an informally established waste collection micro-scale enterprise consisting of 20 joblessis already operating. In waste leasing, households provide the sorted waste to the composters and receive the finished product at reduced price. The sale of the product is also open for any other users as well. The income from the sale of the product is used for sustaining the service. Currently, on average 10 % (14, 000 kg) of biodegradable organic waste generated at the sub city is composted every month. The price of 1 kgof the finished product is set at 1. 5 ETB (Ethiopian Birr), which is half of the price of compost in Addis Ababa (capital of Ethiopia). The total saving of the microenterprise is thus calculated to be 31, 000 ETB ( 1, 348) per year when this project becomes fully functional at the entire city level. This will allow the microenterprise to start up and run at least one more similar project and create another source of income andjob opportunity for jobless city residents. The production of biogas from the biodegradable fraction of the municipal waste was investigated as an alternative to the composting route. The objective of this study was to estimate the potential of organic municipal solid waste generated in an urban setting in a tropical climate to produce biogas. Fivedifferent categories of waste were considered: fruit waste, food waste,yard waste, paper waste and mixed waste. These fractions were assessed for their efficiency for biogas production in a laboratory scale batch digester for a total period of eight weeks at a temperature of 20 - 30 oC. Mixed waste was found to be more efficient than other feedstocksfor biogas and methane production. Taking the total waste production inJimma into account, the total mixed organic solid waste can produce 865 x 103 m 3 (5. 4 m 3 /capita) of biogas or 537 x 103 m 3 (3. 4 m 3 /capita) of methane per year. The total caloric value of the methane production potentialfrom mixed organic municipal solid waste is many times higher than the total energy requirement of the area.

40|$|Waste {{minimization}} in campus sustainability can be {{an effective}} showcase of sustainability governance in translating the elusive concept of sustainable development in the context of Higher Education Institution into more tangible outcome of sustainable consumption, reduce environmental effect from campus activities and create conducive campus environmental for behavioral change. As part of the sustainability initiative in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, the establishment of a Green Office reveals the complexity of institutionalizing waste minimization in campuses as well as demonstrate the potential of living laboratory framework as an integrative, transformative and structural approach of the triangulation elements of Higher Education Institutions; teaching & learning, research and operation. The first part of the study begins with the science approach in develop waste profile with its’ strategic implication; i. correction on waste generation 0. 83 kg per capita per day in campus instead of 3. 47 kg per person per day received from the waste collector in 2011 and, ii. strategize and justify the campus sustainability initiatives based on waste characterization figures; 46 % <b>compostable</b> or food <b>waste</b> and 40. 6 % dry waste or recyclable items (paper 39. 7 %, followed by plastic packaging 31. 8 %, plastic bottles 17. 2 % and aluminum cans 11. 3 %) in 2011. The Green Office practices designed to minimize dry waste and provide situational and systemic changes for behavior, such as Sustainable Meeting, Saving Paper and Practicing Recycling, resulted in campus paper reduction rates of 30 % (2011), 42 % (2012) and 58 % (2013). The economic sustainability dimension from the total paper reduction consumption is 35, 089 reams, amounted saving of MYR 561. 424 or US' 130, 563 (2009 – 2013). The result equivalences with the carbon emission reduction 6047. 58 kg and the energy saving amounted 4, 414, 196. 2 GJ/t as an environmental sustainability dimension. The second part of the study, which is more on the social science approach, analyze through the participatory based approach, governance and institutionalization process of waste minimization. The process involves decentralization of solid waste management, established co-production of knowledge and co-implementation as well as effective monitoring. Those aspects contributes to the development of sustainable consumption in general and behavioral changes of the campus society. The study demonstrates and explains in detail the adoption of waste profile data resulted from research has corrected function for better management of waste minimization as to support integrated solid waste management in campus. The result discloses several challenges in introducing such a task by introducing Green Office initiative in systemic approach which reflects in waste data performance and monitoring. The scientific evidence with a combination support top down and bottom up governance approach showcase the successful of waste minimization initiatives in campus sustainability. Furthermore, the study suggests the Green Office awards and certification as to increase the competitiveness of CoR or Green Manager and involves the cleaner services in the process as to sustain the Green Office performance in the long term. This study provides a practical experience and detail process of adaptation waste minimization in the context of campus sustainability which adds to the new dimension of growing body of knowledge in waste management from the perspective of sustainability science...|$|R
