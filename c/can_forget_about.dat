He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> when to take medication or go to a doctor appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E

40|$|Fundamentally, theoretically, {{there is}} only one process {{underlying}} genetic and cultural evolution: natural selection. Organism fitness-enhancement (“adaptive significance”) is one of its practical mechanisms; group formation and maintenance is another, often but not always through fitness-enhancement; and need-fulfillment is still another. If Durham can accept that formulation, and switch from “organism-thinking” to “instruction-thinking” (Cloak, 1975 : 178), he will free himself from two handicaps: First, he <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> his worries <b>about</b> “reductionism” and “determinism” (1976 a: 100, 101). Under this general theory of natural selection, cultural evolution is biological evolution, continued by “other” (nongenetic) means. Second, he will spare himself the appearance of anthropomorphism, mentalism, and wishy-washiness attendant on his discussion of kinds of “significance,” other than adaptive “significance,” of cultural behaviors (1976 a: 102 – 106, 115) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{networks}} {{become increasingly}} large and complex the relationships and dependencies between network elements also grow in complexity and size. If an e-mail server goes off-line {{for ten minutes}} but never goes off-line again, {{it might not be}} a serious problem, and <b>can</b> be <b>forgotten</b> <b>about.</b> But if the e-mail server repeatedly goes off-line, the cause of the problem must be found. The difficulty for network operators is discovering what causes the problem – we address this issue and formalize a method to make event logs more useful to network operators. In this paper we describe how network events can be correlated across multiple network layers, and utilize the temporal and spatial aspects of the event data to more accurately correlate network events than using the event descriptions alone. Our results show that by statistically analyzing Syslog data, a relationship graph can be automatically generated that shows relationships between network elements. We then go on to discuss how such a relationship graph, in combination with event correlation, can help operators more accurately discover the root cause of problems, and identify hidden relationships and dependencies within their networks.

40|$|Veterinary {{education}} is a lifelong process. To ensure its quality, the curriculum needs to be assessed {{to make sure it}} adequately prepares students for the veterinary profession. Studies of alumni's retrospective views on their training, i. e. from the users' perspective, are a valuable tool in outcomes assessment (as part of quality assurance). These outcomes assessments are also needed for accreditation. A literature review was conducted on alumni outcomes. Most publications were on medical education, although veterinary medicine and dentistry were also addressed. Most researchers used questionnaires, based on competences, as a quantitative survey tool. Focus groups and one-to-one interviews can be used to gather more indepth information. To ensure success of quality assurance, evaluation activities should be carried out systematically and structurally, integrated in an organisation's regular work patterns. Many researchers gathered valuable information on the quality of education making use of (a combination of) questionnaires and focus groups. Some researchers involved not only alumni, but also their employers in the survey. Especially this triangulation seems to be highly effective in assessing the quality of education. Alumni assessment also has downsides though, such as lack of comparison to other educational programmes, details of the programme <b>can</b> be <b>forgotten</b> <b>about,</b> and self-evaluation is prone to be biased...|$|R
