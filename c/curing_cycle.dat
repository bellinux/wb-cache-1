A sensitivity analysis in the variability of the model parameters within the simulation was performed to characterize its effect on an optimal <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> To further account for observed batch to batch model parameter variability, a novel optimization algorithm based on Evolutionary Strategies was developed to identify a more robust <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> The control strategy for implementing the optimal <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> relies solely on the use of non-intrusive heat flux sensors.

50|$|Another Out of {{autoclave}} {{method for}} achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts {{is through the}} use of heat shrink tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. Heat shrink tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or <b>curing</b> <b>cycle.</b> When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). Heat shrink tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface. Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc. Heat shrink tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave.|$|E

At this stage, pressure is not applied, and volatiles (solvents and reaction by-products) are free to escape. The second, higher-temperature stage is for final forced consolidation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift to using more {{lightweight}} materials for the potential of fuel consumption reduction. In the Aerospace Industry, conventional metal structures are being replaced by advanced composite structures. The major advantage of an advanced composite structure is the huge {{reduction in the number of}} parts and joints required. Also composite materials provide better resistance to creep, corrosion, and fatigue. However, one cannot eliminate all the joints and attachments in an aircraft’s structure. Eliminating structural joints is impractical in present-day aircraft because of the requirements for inspection, manufacturing breaks, assembly and equipment access, and replacement of damaged structures. Currently, composite joints are overdesigned which leads to weight penalties. Understanding how to optimize the ultimate bearing strength of a composite joint by altering the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> might be beneficial to the composite joint design process. This study investigates, through numerical and experimental analysis, the mechanical behavior of double shear joints. The first task is to test Aluminum double shear joint specimens inside the double shear joint fixture at a loading rate of 0. 05 in. /min. (quasi-static). The second task is to numerically model and validate the aluminum double shear joint specimen. The third task is to test the Unidirectional MTM 49 carbon fiber pre-preg double shear composite joint specimens with two different <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> and five different loading rates (0. 05 in. /min., 0. 1 in. /min., 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.). The double shear composite joint specimens are made, using a heat press, with a quasi-isotropic laminate orientation of [0 0 + 45 - 45 + 45 - 45 90 90]s. The first <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> used is called the alternate <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is Cytec’s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> and the second <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> used is called the datasheet <b>cure</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is Umeco 2 ̆ 7 s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> The recommended datasheet <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> and an alternate <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> are both compared to see how they affect the mechanical characteristics of the matrix along with the bearing stress.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThermal, rheological, and {{mechanical}} properties of a polymer composite cured at different one-stage and two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> were studied in this dissertation. A commercial carbon-fiber prepreg, Cycom 977 - 2 UD, was used. This curing-toughened epoxy resin prepreg is formulated for autoclave or press molding. An encapsulated sample rheometer (ESR) {{was used to}} obtain its viscoelastic properties, including complex viscosity, gel time, and minimum viscosity time, as well as glass transition temperature (Tg) and pressure window time for onestage and two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to obtain the degree of cure (DOC) for one-stage and two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> The mechanical properties of interest for specimens cured at one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> were short beam shear (SBS) strength, combined loading compression (CLC) strength, CLC modulus, CLC Poisson’s ratio, open-hole compression (OHC) strength, and OHC modulus. The SBS, CLC, and OHC tests were performed at room temperature to obtain the mechanical properties. For the one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> studied, {{it was observed that}} the mechanical properties, except SBS strength, did not vary significantly; therefore, no correlation with the viscoelastic properties or the DOC was found for them. Moreover, the failure mode for OHC specimens cured at different one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> was similar. Likewise, the failure mode for CLC specimens cured at different one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> was the same. However, the failure mode for the least-cured SBS specimens was different from that of other SBS specimens. Also, the SBS strength of the least-cured specimens was significantly less than that of other specimens. The complex viscosity of the specimens cured at one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles</b> in the ESR showed a similar drop-off trend for the least-cured specimens. As such, SBS strength showed a good correlation with the complex viscosity. SBS strength showed a weaker correlation with the Tg and DOC for vii the same <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> The Tg had a strong correlation with the DOC for all one-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> No correlation between gel time and other material properties was found. A considerable improvement in SBS strength, final complex viscosity, Tg, and DOC of the least-cured specimens was observed after the dwell time was increased enough to ensure that no further curing occurred. It was also observed that for the two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles,</b> faster heat-up rates and higher first-stage dwell temperatures resulted in faster curing. The DOC for the entire <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> was modeled using the Springer-Loos cure kinetics model for one-stage and two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> The complex viscosity up to the gel time was modeled using the Kenny viscosity model for one-stage and two-stage <b>cure</b> <b>cycles.</b> The modeling results agreed well with the experimental data. The results presented in this dissertation suggest that the ESR can be used as an ex-situ cure-monitoring instrument to mimic autoclave/oven curing and, hence, eliminate the need for multiple measurement instruments. The cure time-temperature data, provided by thermocouples attached to the composite part in the autoclave/oven would be the only input to the rheometer for cure monitoring. The complex viscosity as measured by the ESR was shown to be the best viscoelastic property for monitoring the state of the material during cure for the following reasons: (a) it could be precisely measured throughout the <b>cure</b> and post-cure <b>cycles</b> using the rheometer, (b) it could reveal the important changes in the material state during cure, (c) it could be modeled by sophisticated viscosity models, and (d) it could be correlated to the mechanical properties of the composite material. Utilizing the ESR as the main ex-situ cure-monitoring instrument makes it possible to offer a new approach to curing composites. In this new approach, called Material State Management (MSM), the acceptance of cured composite materials is based on the materials’ viscoelastic properties as measured by the ESR during cure and post-cure monitoring. Moreover, knowledge of the material’s viscoelastic properties during cure can be used to improve the current cure specifications. In the MSM approach, cure process confidence limits can be prescribed based on the viscoelastic properties of the material, thus addressing the shortcomings of the current time-temperature approach to curing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{accuracy}} of adaptation of the unlined heat cured acrylic denture base to that of the Molloplast-B relined unpolymerized acrylic denture base, and Molloplast-B relined polymerized acrylic denture base. The results that relining the denture base with soft liner did not improve the adaptability of the base. There was no significant difference between the mean gap values of the molloplast-B relined base which was subjected to one <b>curing</b> <b>cycle</b> and the other molloplast-B relined base which was subjected in two curing cycles.

40|$|We {{report on}} the use of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based sensor written in a {{photonic}} crystal fiber (PCF) to monitor the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> of composite materials. The PCF under study has been specifically designed to feature a high phase modal birefringence sensitivity to transverse strain and a very low sensitivity to temperature. We exploit these particular properties to measure strain inside a composite material in the out-of-plane direction. The embedded FBG sensor has been calibrated for transverse and axial strain as well as for temperature changes. These FBGs have then been used as embedded sensors during the manufacturing of a composite material in order to monitor how strain develops inside the composite during the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle.</b> We show that our sensors allow gaining insight in the composite <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> {{in a way that would}} be very difficult to achieve with any other sensor technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical and experimental investigation of <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> effect on carbon-fiber reinforced high-temperature polymer composite structures molded by {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM). The molded composite structure consists of AS 4 - 8 harness carbon-fiber fabrics and a high-temperature polymer (Cycom 5250 - 4 -RTM). Thermal and resin cure analysis is performed {{to model the}} <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> of the VARTM process. The temperature and cure variations with time are determined by solving the three-dimensional transient energy and species equations within the composite part. Several case studies were investigated by the developed analytical model. The same cases were also experimentally investigated to determine the ultimate tensile strength for each case. This study helps in developing a science based technology for the VARTM process for the understanding of the process behavior and the effect of the <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> on the properties of the molded high-temperature polymer composites...|$|R

In this paper data is presented for two materials to support the feasibility of using mass spectrometer gas analysis techniques to enhance the knowledge of autoclave curing of composite materials and provide additional information for process control evaluation. It is expected that this technique will also be useful in working out the details involved in determining the proper <b>cure</b> <b>cycle</b> for new or experimental materials...|$|R
