5|$|On October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was {{established}} by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate {{in the development of}} the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those <b>companies</b> <b>who</b> serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 <b>companies</b> <b>who</b> are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal <b>companies,</b> <b>who</b> saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture <b>companies</b> <b>who</b> witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E

5|$|The Thorne Moors Improvement Company {{was set up}} in 1848, {{authorised}} by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act. They {{were charged}} with improving parts of the bog. Their activities increased in the 1880s, when they began to lease areas to <b>companies</b> <b>who</b> extracted the peat commercially for use as animal bedding. In order to do this, ditches had to be cut {{to begin the process of}} drainage. As the extent of the workings increased, a Dutch company cut canals in the peat. Horses pulled barges from canal paths alongside in order to remove the peat from the moors. Subsequently, a network of small railways were constructed along the canals to transport the peat.|$|E

5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B <b>companies,</b> <b>who</b> had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland.

5|$|During the 1950s, {{the main}} {{customers}} for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping <b>companies,</b> <b>who</b> flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline. By 1966, Braathens SAFE was operating seven DC-6s.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other <b>companies</b> <b>who</b> were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E
