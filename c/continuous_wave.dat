5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. <b>Continuous</b> <b>wave</b> (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using amplitude modulation (AM), and Morse code using <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{existence}} and stability of <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> in a semiconductor laser model is studied. This model was proposed by Lang and Kobayashi and has the form of two differential equations with delay. The delay time {{is assumed to be}} large. We study the existence of <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> in the Lang-Kobayashi model. A special set I depending on all parameters of the problem is built. The condition of existence of <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> is that the ”‘main parts”’ of solutions must be located on the set I. Sufficient conditions of stability and instability of <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> are found for all sufficiently large values of delay. In the case of a zero linewidth enhancement factor the necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are found. Location of stability regions on the sets I is studied. It is proved {{that in the case of}} the zero linewidth enhancement factor the number of regions of stability on the set I is less than two. Necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of stability regions on the set I are found in this case...|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} the {{neodymium}} dopant in the material varies according to its use. For <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> output, the doping is significantly lower than for pulsed lasers. The lightly doped CW rods can be optically distinguished by being less colored, almost white, while higher-doped rods are pink-purplish.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} laser is a laser that obtains its energy from a chemical reaction. Chemical lasers can achieve <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> output with power reaching to megawatt levels. They {{are used in}} industry for cutting and drilling, and in military as directed-energy weapons. The first {{chemical laser}} was co-invented by Jerome V. V. Kasper and George C. Pimentel in 1965.|$|E

40|$|Solitary wave {{propagation}} under interaction with <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> is {{studied in the}} context of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation. An analytical approach, based on the conserved quantities of the wave evolution, is used to study transverse velocity variations for the case of nonzero transverse wavenumber difference between the solitary and <b>continuous</b> <b>waves.</b> The method is applicable for any number of transverse dimensions and any kind of nonlinearity. Moreover, the presence of a coherent continuous background is shown to be responsible for the creation of solitary rings and spirals, under interaction with solitary structures with nonzero topological charge. Numerical simulations for specific cases were used to confirm the analytical results. © World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} arc {{converter}} invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator {{was one of}} the first radio transmitters that generated <b>continuous</b> <b>waves.</b> In contrast, the earlier spark-gap transmitters generated a string of damped waves. These were electrically [...] "noisy"; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently. With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within narrow frequency band, so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances. In addition, <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> could be modulated with an audio signal to carry sound. The Alexanderson alternator {{was one of the}} first transmitters to be used for AM transmission.|$|R
25|$|A Class 2 laser is {{considered}} to be safe because the blink reflex (glare aversion response to bright lights) will limit the exposure to no more than 0.25 seconds. It only applies to visible-light lasers (400–700nm). Class-2lasers are limited to 1mW <b>continuous</b> <b>wave,</b> or more if the emission time is less than 0.25 seconds or if the light is not spatially coherent. Intentional suppression of the blink reflex could lead to eye injury. Some laser pointers and measuring instruments are class2.|$|E
25|$|The first {{heterojunction}} diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers utilized aluminum {{gallium arsenide}} p-type injectors situated over n-type gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal {{and raised the}} bandgap of the p-type injector over that of the n-type layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 amperes per square centimeter. Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> operation at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>wave</b> - In {{these the}} {{transformer}} {{is driven by}} a feedback oscillator, which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary tuned circuit serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices instead of transistors {{because they are more}} robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.|$|E
30|$|The present paper {{describes}} a retrieval {{process for the}} 2 -D tsunami Green’s function from the cross-correlation of <b>continuous</b> ocean <b>waves</b> based on a first-order Born approximation. Equation (16) indicates that the derivative of the cross-correlation function for two receivers with respect to lag time gives the tsunami Green’s function including coda waves. Furthermore, we have presented numerical examples of the Green’s function retrieved from the cross-correlation function of the <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> to confirm {{the validity of the}} obtained results.|$|R

30|$|GBSAR is a {{new type}} of radar system that can {{generate}} high-range and cross-range resolution by integrating step-frequency <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> instead of impulse radar and synthetic aperture techniques.

25|$|From Warramunga onwards, the frigates were {{launched}} {{with the ability}} to carry and fire the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) as a replacement for the Sea Sparrow missile; these were quad-packed into the Mark 41 launcher for a payload of 32 missiles. Warramunga was the first ship in the world fitted with the ESSM, and the first test firing was conducted aboard on 21 January 2003. The modifications entered operational service aboard three ships in June 2004. A CEA Technologies solid-state <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> illuminator was also fitted as part of the ESSM system.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned an EPR spectra is usually directly measured {{as the first}} derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field {{is applied to the}} external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100kHz. By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. <b>Continuous</b> <b>wave</b> (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E

A total of 30 piezoelectric transducers, {{placed in a}} grid, transmitted and received <b>continuous</b> ultrasonic <b>waves</b> that were measured using a lock-in amplifier. Tomography was used to create images from the measured amplitude and phase of the <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> between all possible transducer pairs. The location of damage induced by impact hits was visible in the resulting images.

25|$|Bergen Radio {{became the}} first station to receive a vacuum tube {{transmitter}} in 1922. Because they produced <b>continuous</b> <b>wave,</b> Bergen Radio started transmitting a twice-daily audio weather forecast, {{in addition to the}} telegraphy weather forecasts. The first ships with vacuum receivers were the Norwegian America Line's Bergensfjord and Stavangerfjord. Vadsø Radio opened in 1923 and could reach the White Sea with its vacuum tube transmitters. Ålesund Radio opened in 1925, the same year as duplex operations began at Bergen with a receiver station in Fyllingsdalen. Medico services were launched out of Bergen Radio from 1923, a free service which allowed for medical diagnosis and treatment advice from physicians at Haukeland Hospital.|$|E

The ships are fitted with an Ultra Electronics Sonar Systems' Integrated Sonar System, which includes a hull-mounted sonar and a towed variable depth sonar built up from a quad directional active-passive receive array, a passive torpedo detection array and a high-powered towed sonar source. Other sensors include an Ultra Electronics Series 2500 electro-optical director, a Sagem VAMPIR IR search and track system, and Rafael Toplite stabilised target acquisition sights for each ship's Typhoons.|$|E
25|$|Although at {{the time}} of Millikan's oil-drop {{experiments}} it was becoming clear that there exist such things as subatomic particles, not everyone was convinced. Experimenting with cathode rays in 1897, J. J. Thomson had discovered negatively charged 'corpuscles', as he called them, with a charge-to-mass ratio 1840 times that of a hydrogen ion. Similar results had been found by George FitzGerald and Walter Kaufmann. Most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism, however, could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable; {{in much the same way}} that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> rather than as a stream of photons.|$|E

Pederson were able to increase the frequency of Duddell's oscillator to the radio range, and in 1902 patented the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first transmitter which could generate <b>continuous</b> <b>waves.</b> Poulsen arc wireless transmitters were used worldwide until the 1920s.|$|R

25|$|The Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) uses <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> Doppler {{to measure}} the Doppler flow profile VTI. It uses {{anthropometry}} to calculate aortic and pulmonary valve diameters and CSAs, allowing right-sided and left-sided Q measurements. In comparison to the echocardiographic method, USCOM significantly improves reproducibility and increases sensitivity of the detection of changes in flow. Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and left-sided Q measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 l/min to 18.7 l/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages {{for the development of}} physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable flow probe. This accuracy has ensured high levels of clinical use in conditions including sepsis, heart failure and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.|$|E
25|$|Transoesophageal Doppler {{includes}} two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram —which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and oesophageal Doppler monitoring—which is primarily {{used for the}} clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the oesophagus to mid-thoracic level, {{at which point the}} oesophagus lies alongside the descending thoracic aorta. Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true Q, therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.|$|E
40|$|Diffraction is a {{fundamental}} property of light propagation. Owing to this phenomenon,light diffracts out in all directions when it passes through a subwavelength slit. This imposes {{a fundamental}} limit on the transverse size of a light beam at a given distance from the aperture. We show that a subwavelength-sized beam propagating without diffractive broadening can be produced in free space by the constructive interference of multiple beams of a Fresnel source of the respective high-refraction-index waveguide. Moreover, it is shown that such a source can be constructed not only for <b>continuous</b> <b>waves,</b> but also for ultra-short (near single-cycle) pulses. The results theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of completely diffraction-free subwavelength-beam optics, for both <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> and ultra-short pulses. The approach extends operation of the near-field subwavelength-beam optics, such as near-field scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy,to the "not-too-distant" field regime (0. 5 to about 10 wavelengths) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{modulation}} {{instability of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> {{for a system}} of four coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, {{two of which are}} in the unstable regime, is studied. In earlier studies, plane or <b>continuous</b> <b>waves</b> for a system of two coupled, nonlinear Schrödinger equations is shown to exhibit modulation instability (MI), even if both modes are in the normal dispersion regime, provided that the coefficient of cross phase modulation (XPM) is larger than that of self phase modulation (SPM). Requirements for MI in this system of four coupled, nonlinear Schrödinger equations can be relaxed. MI can occur even if the magnitude of XPM is less than that of SPM, and the magnitude of instability is generally larger than that of each mode alone. The implications for parametric process and wavelength exchange in optical physics with two pump waves are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
