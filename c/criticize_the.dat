5000|$|Fassbinder's film <b>criticizes</b> <b>the</b> bloodthirst of the 1970s German {{media in}} a similar manner to The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (directed by Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta).

5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead.

5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began to <b>criticize</b> <b>the</b> foreign policies {{that he had}} seemingly helped begin.

His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E

When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly <b>criticize</b> <b>the</b> Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} <b>criticize</b> <b>the</b> president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
