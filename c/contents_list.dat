60|$|People {{say that}} thirty years before at Oxford {{he was almost}} exactly the same eager, clever little man he was when I first met him. He had come up to Balliol bristling with {{extraordinary}} degrees and prizes captured in provincial and Irish and Scotch universities--and had {{made a name for himself}} as the most formidable dealer in exact fact the rhetoricians of the Union had ever had to encounter. From Oxford he had gone on to a position in the Higher Division of the Civil Service, I think in the War Office, and had speedily made a place for himself as a political journalist. He was a particularly neat controversialist, and very full of political and sociological ideas. He had a quite astounding memory for facts and a mastery of detailed analysis, and the time afforded scope for these gifts. The later eighties were full of politico-social discussion, and he became a prominent name upon the <b>contents</b> <b>list</b> of the NINETEENTH CENTURY, the FORTNIGHTLY and CONTEMPORARY chiefly as a half sympathetic but frequently very damaging critic of the socialism of that period. He won the immense respect of every one specially interested in social and political questions, he soon achieved the limited distinction that is awarded such capacity, and at that I think he would have remained for the rest of his life if he had not encountered Altiora.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Immortal Bard" [...] is {{a science}} fiction short story by Isaac Asimov. It was first {{published}} in the May 1954 issue of Universe Science Fiction, and has since been republished in several collections and anthologies, including Earth Is Room Enough (1957) and The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986). (In Earth Is Room Enough (Panther Books Ltd. reprint 1973 edition) the title of the story is [...] "An Immortal Bard" [...] in the <b>Contents</b> <b>list</b> but [...] "The Immortal Bard" [...] on the destination page. There is a similar, but reversed variation in title with The Author's Ordeal.) Like many of his stories, it is told as a conversation, in this case between two professors at a college faculty's annual Christmas party.|$|E
5000|$|Getty and Townend {{rejected}} this lyric change, and the hymnal committee {{barred the}} hymn from the book. Mary Louise Bringle, committee chair, defended their decision saying: [...] "The song {{has been removed}} from our <b>contents</b> <b>list,</b> with deep regret over losing its otherwise poignant and powerful witness." [...] The decision to change the text arose when members of the committee found the alternate text in the Celebrating Grace Hymnal published in 2010. They assumed the songwriters had agreed to this change, but upon request of the hymn, found that the text used in the Celebrating Grace Hymnal had not been approved by the writers. Capitol CMG Publishing, managers of the song, said it is working with the Celebrating Grace Hymnal’s publisher to fix the problem.|$|E

5000|$|Longleat 258, a {{manuscript}} of Middle English poems held at Longleat House in Wiltshire, mentions in its <b>contents</b> <b>list</b> a poem whose title {{is given in}} the Latinised form [...] "De folio et flore" [...] (Of the Leaf and the Flower). Unfortunately {{the pages of the}} manuscript that contained this poem are now missing, but {{there is little doubt that}} it was [...] "The Floure and the Leafe". The poem was first published in 1598 in Thomas Speght's edition of Chaucer's works, and there are reasons for thinking that it was printed from a faulty transcript of the separated Longleat pages. In the absence of any ancient manuscript of the poem Speght's book is the only authority for the text.|$|E

Taking all three sources together this amounts to about 145 catches or rounds with a few part-songs. The <b>contents</b> <b>list</b> in all three Ravenscroft publications refer to [...] "the songs in this book". Pammelia has a running page header [...] "Canons in the unison", but the sections are headed [...] "rounds or catches of 3 (&c) voices". Deuteromelia introduces part-songs labelled as [...] "Freemens songs".
