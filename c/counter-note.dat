40|$|The {{spread of}} {{contract}} farming in rural India {{in recent years}} has provoked a polarised and often ideological debate in the literature. The dominant, micro-economic view of contract farming positions it as a ‘win-win’ for rural development, benefitting both agribusiness and small farmers. Critical observers, on the other hand, emphasise the exploitative effects on rural households, viewing contract farming as ‘win-lose’. The critical weakness of both these approaches, however, is a failure to ground interpretations of contract farming schemes in the broader agrarian contexts in which they appear. Little is known about how different households in different contexts come to engage, or not, with contract farming, and what this might mean for future livelihood pathways in spaces where contract farming operates. This thesis punctures these debates through a critical exploration of potato contract farming, rural livelihoods and agrarian change in three villages in Satara district, Maharashtra. The primary research question for this study is: how is potato contract farming incorporated into rural spaces in India, and {{what does this mean for}} patterns of advantage and disadvantage? In addressing this question, I make three core contributions. First, mainstream presumptions that contract farming engages with a homogenous, undifferentiated livelihood landscape need to be recast. In Satara, I find that patterns of agrarian differentiation are not characterised by ongoing dynamic processes of agriculture-led differentiation into classes of capitalist farmers and rural labour, as is imagined by a classical understanding of agrarian transition. Rather, the agrarian structure in my study sites is characterised by a diverse group of ‘middle farmers’, or petty commodity producers, who often struggle to reproduce themselves through a combination of on and off-farm activities. Second, I argue that firms use contract farming as an institutional solution to the procurement challenges associated with traditional agricultural markets in India. In Satara, the spread of potato contract farming is symptomatic of changing governance structures in modern agricultural value chains. My third key argument is that patterns of social and economic differentiation arising from contract farming must be understood as co-produced at the intersection of these existing livelihood landscapes and the dynamics of contract schemes. In Satara, this intersection results in a complex mosaic of winners and losers amongst rural households, meaning that contract farming cannot be easily generalised as ‘all good’ or ‘all bad’. Importantly, I argue that potato contract farming is a ‘middle farmer’ activity. However, while many middle farmers accrue some benefits, these are unevenly distributed and truncated by the powerful position of the contract firm. As a result, I argue that for most households, contract farming does not represent a viable accumulation pathway. In fact, contract farming is just one activity among many in a crowded livelihood landscape where accumulation through agriculture is increasingly difficult. Finally, rather than leading to dynamic patterns of accumulation from below, contract farming reproduces an agrarian structure of petty commodity producers who lack access to alternative livelihood opportunities. In fact, sites of accumulation and differentiation have moved off the farm, where better-off households ignore contract farming and increase their advantage through highvalue non-farm activities. This suggests that agrarian change in Satara district is intimately connected to processes of livelihood diversification and agrarian questions of labour. These findings provide an important <b>counter-note</b> to current hegemonic understandings of contract farming as a ‘win-win’ solution for rural development, emphasising the importance of situating the impacts of such schemes within the livelihood landscapes in which they operate...|$|E
