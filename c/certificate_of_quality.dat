40|$|Abstract: System {{identification}} is {{the science of}} constructing models from data. A model is never an exact description of reality, and it is desirable that the identified model comes accompanied by <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> able to describe the level of precision of the model and its domain of validity. This paper is about certified system identification. Our contention is that data contains more information than traditional identification methods can exploit, and, by looking at classical identification problems with new eyes, methods can be developed carrying precise quality guarantees that are valid under general assumptions. Taking the challenge of developing these methods {{may lead to a}} paradigm shift in many contexts in which {{identification is}} applied...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{are rarely}} {{sure of the}} exact {{standard}} that product labels and other <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> represent. We show that any such uncertainty creates a “Groucho effect” in which seeing that a product has a label leads consumers to infer that the standard for the label itself is not very demanding. Label adoption is therefore always {{less likely to be}} an equilibrium than without uncertainty over the standard, and if it is an equilibrium it is always less informative than without such uncertainty. The Groucho effect leads to an information externality so better firms are reluctant to adopt labels if worse firms adopt them. Applying the model to eco-labels, we find that industry groups, governments, and NGOs can increase label adoption by publicizing labeling criteria, by encouraging consumers to expect label adoption when there are multiple equilibria, and by setting high standards that {{are less likely to be}} devalued by low quality firms. Eco-labels, disclosure, certification, persuasion, standards...|$|R

40|$|Although {{hotels and}} other tourist {{institutions}} in Thailand {{have been making}} some sporadic attempts to incorporate specifically Thai food and beverage (F&B) elements into their overall product offering, this has rarely been attempted in a thoughtful and systematic manner. This is despite the importance of F&B in determining overall levels of customer satisfaction and the recent importance attached to incorporating ‘Thainess’ into the hotel and tourism industry nationwide. It is, therefore, rather surprising that little if any sustained effort {{has been made to}} define authenticity with respect to Thai food (bearing in mind also regional variations) or to incorporate <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> to establishments providing such authentic dishes. This paper draws on qualitative research and personal observation undertaken {{in a wide range of}} Thai hotels with a view to identifying emergent value-adding clusters in the domestic hospitality sector. It describes and categorizes the uses of Thai F&B currently and identifies shortcomings in industry vision, which leads to recommendations for both hotel and resort managers and also to those responsible for national level tourism development efforts. The paper also recognizes the problematic nature of the concepts of ‘authenticity’ in this context and attempts to reconcile differing conceptions...|$|R
