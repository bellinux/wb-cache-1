5000|$|In {{order to}} cope with the above {{described}} problems in the care-providing robot FRIEND the special vision system ROVIS (RObust machine VIsion for Service robotics) [...] was developed. The structure of ROVIS is depicted in Fig. 5. There are two main ROVIS components: hardware and object recognition and reconstruction chain. The connection between ROVIS and the overall robot control system is represented by the World Model where ROVIS stores the processed visual information. At the initialization phase of ROVIS the extrinsic camera parameters needed for 3D object reconstruction and the transformation between stereo camera and manipulator which is necessary for vision based object manipulation are calculated by the Camera <b>Calibration</b> <b>module.</b> The object recognition and reconstruction chain consists of robust algorithms for object recognition and 3D reconstruction for the purpose of reliable manipulation motion planning and grasping in unstructured environments and variable illumination conditions. Therefore, an accuracy of 5mm for the estimated 3D pose is necessary which enforces very good and precise algorithms. In ROVIS, robustness must be understood as the capability to the system to adapt to varying operational conditions and is realized through the inclusion feedback mechanisms at the image processing level and also between different hardware and software components of the vision system. A core part of the system is the automatic, closed-loop calculation of an image Region of Interest (ROI) on which vision methods are applied. By using a ROI the performance of object recognition and 3D reconstruction can be improved since the scene complexity is reduced.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mathematical {{modeling}} {{is being}} applied to increasingly complex biological systems and datasets; however, {{the process of}} analyzing and calibrating against experimental data is often challenging and a rate limiting step in model development. To address this problem, we developed a systematic methodology for calibrating quantitative models of dynamic biological processes and illustrate its utility by validating a model of TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand) -induced cell death. Results: We propose a serial framework integrating analysis and <b>calibration</b> <b>modules</b> and we compare various methods for global sensitivity analysis and global parameter estimation. First, adequacy of the network structure is checked by global sensitivity analysis to changes in concentrations of molecular species, validating that the model can reproduce qualitative features of the system behavior derived from experiments or literature surveys. Second, rate parameters are ranked by importance using gradient-based and variance-based sensitivity indices, and we systematically determine the optimal number of parameters to include in model calibration. Third, deterministic, stochastic and hybrid algorithms for global optimization are applied to estimate {{the values of the}} most important parameters by fitting to time series data. We compare the performance of these three optimization algorithms. Conclusions: Our proposed framework covers the entire process from validating a proto-model to establishing a realistic model for in silico experiments and thereby provides a generalized workflow for the construction of predictive models of complex network systems...|$|R

The system incorporates measurements from a low cost single point GPS and a triaxial solid state inertial/magnetic sensor unit. The navigation algorithm is composed of three modules running on a microcontroller: the sensor <b>calibration</b> <b>module,</b> the attitude estimator, and the velocity and position estimator. The sensor <b>calibration</b> <b>module</b> relies on a recursive least square based ellipsoid hypothesis calibration algorithm to estimate biases and scale factors of accelerometers and magnetometers without any additional calibration equipment. The attitude estimator is a low computational linear attitude fusion algorithm that effectively incorporates high frequency components of gyros and low frequency components of accelerometers and magnetometers to guarantee both accuracy and bandwidth of attitude estimation. The velocity and position estimator uses two cascaded complementary filters which fuse translational acceleration, GPS velocity, and position to improve the bandwidth of velocity and position. The designed navigation system is feasible for miniature UAVs due to its low cost, simplicity, miniaturization, and guaranteed estimation errors.

A systematic experimental platform, capable of running experiments {{on a number}} of technologies, would facilitate the design and implementation of such experiments.

This thesis discusses both the internals of the framework as well as how a platform is developed based on the framework. Additionally, two <b>calibration</b> <b>modules</b> were designed to transform the relative pointing input to absolute pointing and obtain the necessary parameters which will be applied in smoothed pointing. As a part of the deployment, the experiment module was made to provide a platform which allowed the enhanced pointing experience to be evaluated and generated proper output according to the results of the experiment task. One key achievement presented in this thesis is that the relative pointing devices are integrable with adaptive pointing and smoothed pointing which support for absolute pointing devices in general.

40|$|ABSTRACT Recent Texas {{legislation}} requkd regional “grass-mts ” {{water resources}} planning in sixteen regions. This paper describes {{one of the}} major challenges in developing a groundwater model for the Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Group (LERWPG), whose region includes 21 counties in the Southem High Plains ofTexas in which 95 percent of the groundwater demand is for irrigation. Estimation of the combination of recharge and irrigation retum flow as input to the Htgh Plains Aquifer System is an uncertain effort. Previous modeling studies published by the USGS and Texas Water Development Board had used typical annual recharge rates of approximately 0. 1 in/yr, while acknowledging that irrigation retum flow could make local rates much higher. In this project, the 1985 - 95 period was prescribed by the LERWPG for calibration of the regional model. Data provided included water table elevations disuihuted non-uniformly across region and annual county totals of inigation withdrawals. The calihration was performed using Groundwater VistasTM, a MODFLOW graphical user interface that includes two <b>calibration</b> <b>modules.</b> The calibrated parameters included hydra & conductivity, specific yield, and local recharge plus irrigation retum flow. The calibration process also included distribution of the irrigation withdrawals across each county. The results of the calibration indicated that the recharge plus retum flow values averaged 2. 75 in/yr for the calibration period, and ranged from less than 0. 5 to over 10 in/yr. These hndings si@cantly impact the fume life of the aquifer in the region and raise questions about the efficiency of &gation water management.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a guidance device for faster and more accurate targeting of multiple probes during cryoablation and other percutaneous interventions performed in closed bore magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems. The device is intended to be mounted onto a Siemens 110 mm MR loop coil that rests on the patient and contains a cable driven two-degree-of- freedom spherical mechanism that orientates the intervention probes about a remote center of motion located 15 mm above the skin entry point. A carriage, pulled by strong and low stretch cables, can position up to three intervention probes as it travels on a rotating hoop. Its motion is constrained by a custom designed roller bearing to minimize friction. A thumbscrew fastened latch allows a probe to be engaged in a guide that constrains the probe along a specific trajectory. The probe can also be disengaged from its track, freeing it to move with respiration and enabling the guide to be repositioned for another probe to be inserted. Compact MR compatible piezoelectric motors are used to actuate the system. A prototype was built from 3 D printed ABS plastic as a proof of concept. Bench level evaluation demonstrated that each component of the device performs according to the design specifications. The device performance was characterized by analyzing still images taken before and after movement, which yielded sub-degree accuracy, sub-degree repeatability near vertical position, and an incremental step resolution of at least 0. 5 degree. Upon further developments of the registration and <b>calibration</b> <b>modules</b> in 3 D slicer to interface the robot with image data, evaluation of the device in MRI will be performed. by Faye Y.
