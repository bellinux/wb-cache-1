50|$|Blinding {{as a form}} of {{punishment}} hails from very ancient times. Blinding specifically {{as a form of}} torture was recorded in ancient Persia.

Some corrosion inhibitors form a passivating coating on the surface by chemisorption. Benzotriazole is one such species used to protect copper.
