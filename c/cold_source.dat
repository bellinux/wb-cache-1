40|$|In several {{demonstration}} and commercial projects new chilled ceilings with integrated PCM as dispensed {{latent heat storage}} were installed for high efficient low exergy cooling in buildings. Different combinations of ceilings and <b>cold</b> <b>sources</b> were realized to show the main advantages of using PCMs for each combination. The {{aim of the research}} project was to develop new technologies to reduce the primary energy needs for cooling in buildings and to create the possibility to cover this energy demand with environmental heat or <b>cold</b> <b>sources.</b> Decoupling the cooling demand from the cold production and adding thermal mass to a construction material are the best approaches for this target. Both allows to shift the cold production from day to night, where most <b>cold</b> <b>sources</b> work more efficient due to lower night air temperatures.

50|$|A {{spectral}} line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line. Which {{type of line}} is observed depends {{on the type of}} material and its temperature relative to another emission source. An absorption line is produced when photons from a hot, broad spectrum source pass through a cold material. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions. By contrast, a bright, emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected {{in the presence of a}} broad spectrum from a <b>cold</b> <b>source.</b> The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is increased due to emission by the material.|$|E
40|$|We present {{infrared}} spectra of gas-phase CO 2 around 15 mum toward 14 deeply embedded massive protostars obtained with the Short Wavelength Spectrometer {{on board the}} Infrared Space Observatory. Gas-phase CO 2 has been detected toward 8 of the sources. The excitation temperature and the gas/solid ratio increase with {{the temperature of the}} warm gas. Detailed radiative transfer models show that a jump in the abundance of two orders of magnitude is present in the envelope of AFGL 2591 at T> 300 K. No such jump is seen toward the <b>colder</b> <b>source</b> NGC 7538 IRS 9. Together, these data indicate that gas-phase CO 2 shows the same evolutionary trends as CO 2 ice and other species, such as HCN, C 2 H 2, H 2 O, and CH 3 OH. The gas-phase CO 2 abundance toward <b>cold</b> <b>sources</b> can be explained by gas-phase chemistry and possible freeze-out in the outer envelope. Different chemical scenarios are proposed to explain the gas-phase CO 2 abundance of 1 - 2 x 10 (- 6) for T> 300 K and of similar to 10 (- 8) for T 300 K...|$|R

50|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its hot end and cold end {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy.

50|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{can also}} be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a <b>cold</b> <b>source,</b> which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that {{is removed from the}} cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermodynamic}} cycle {{consists of a}} linked sequence of thermodynamic processes that involve transfer of heat and work {{into and out of}} the system, while varying pressure, temperature, and other state variables within the system, and that eventually returns the system to its initial state. In the process of passing through a cycle, the working fluid (system) may convert heat from a warm source into useful work, and dispose of the remaining heat to a cold sink, thereby acting as a heat engine. Conversely, the cycle may be reversed and use work to move heat from a <b>cold</b> <b>source</b> and transfer it to a warm sink thereby acting as a heat pump. At every point in the cycle, the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, so the cycle is reversible (its entropy change is zero, as entropy is a state function).|$|E

Additionally, the building houses a gamma irradiation facility that uses spent fuel assemblies and is capable of accommodating high gamma dose experiments.
