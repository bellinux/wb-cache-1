40|$|AbstractLet C be an {{unbounded}} line-free closed convex set. The extreme {{points of}} C (ext C), the convex hull of ext C, and the closed convex hull of ext C (denoted C′) are all important sets, both in decomposition and optimization theory. Conditions for C′ to be bounded are proved which involve a certain subset of ext C, the end points of extreme rays of C which we <b>call</b> <b>terminal</b> extreme points (denoted text C). Specifically, we first show that C′ bounded implies text C ≠ Ø. Next, for C′ with interior, C′ bounded {{is equivalent to}} co (text C) bounded and C′⊆,co(text C) + L, for any line L generated by an extreme direction of C. Finally, we show that for C′ bounded with interior and co (text C) without interior, C′ may be represented as C intersected with a closed half-space...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{constructed}} a wireless information system, {{and developed a}} wireless voice communication subsystem based on Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) for underground coal mine, which employs Voice over IP (VoIP) technology and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to achieve wireless voice dispatching communications. The master control voice dispatching interface and <b>call</b> <b>terminal</b> software are also developed on the WLAN ground server side to manage and implement the voice dispatching communication. A testing system for voice communication was constructed in tunnels of an underground coal mine, which was used to actually test the wireless voice communication subsystem via a network analysis tool, named Clear Sight Analyzer. In tests, the actual flow charts of registration, call establishment and call removal were analyzed by capturing call signaling of SIP terminals, and the key performance indicators were evaluated in coal mine, including average subjective value of voice quality, packet loss rate, delay jitter, disorder packet transmission and end-to-end delay. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the wireless voice communicatio...|$|E
