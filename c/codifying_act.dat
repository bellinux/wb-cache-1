The Act is a <b>codifying</b> <b>act,</b> that is to say, it {{attempts}} to collate existing common law and present it in a statutory (i.e. “codified”) form. In the event, the Act did more than merely codify the law, and some new elements were introduced in 1906. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 has been highly influential, as it does not govern merely English Law, but dominates marine insurance worldwide through its wholesale adoption by other jurisdictions.|$|E

2500|$|While the BNA Act {{eventually}} {{resulted in}} Canada having more autonomy {{than it had}} before, {{it was far from}} full independence from the United Kingdom. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Canadian [...] "sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the Statute of Westminster, 1931" [...] long after Confederation in 1867. Defence of British North America became a Canadian responsibility. Foreign policy remained in British hands, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council remained Canada's highest court of appeal, and the constitution could be amended only in Britain. Gradually, Canada gained more autonomy, and in 1931, obtained almost full autonomy within the British Commonwealth with the Statute of Westminster. Because the provinces of Canada were unable to agree on a constitutional amending formula, this power remained with the British Parliament. In 1982, the constitution was patriated when Elizabeth II gave her royal assent to the Canada Act 1982. The Constitution of Canada is made up of a number of <b>codified</b> <b>acts</b> and uncodified traditions; one of the principal documents is the Constitution Act, 1982, which renamed the BNA Act 1867 to Constitution Act, 1867.|$|R

The symbolic value of such hoards is discussed in relation with the agricultural identity of the earliest neolithic of these regions. Hoards may be either an evolution of the previous symbolic of grindingtools from burial contexts, or an expression of the status of the house or its inhabitants, towards the social organisation of the whole village, or be assimilated as a ritual of abandonment of the village, linked with the owning of the land...|$|R
