5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene flows. Poor genetic connectedness between <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene flows from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene flows from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene flows to Sweden. Except for gene flows originating from France, and some limited gene flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

Under Kagame's presidency, {{trade between the}} two <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> grown rapidly. The volume of trade increased five-fold between 2005 and 2009, and it doubled again in the following three years, being worth US$160million in 2012. Projects completed include the renovation of the Kigali road network, funded using a Chinese government loan and undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation; the Kigali City Tower, which was built by China Civil Engineering Construction; and a pay television service operated by Star Media.|$|E

5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the Gaza Strip and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response.

5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E
