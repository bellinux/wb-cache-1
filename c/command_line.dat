5|$|Aptitude is a <b>command</b> <b>line</b> {{tool that}} {{also offers a}} text-based user interface. The program comes with {{enhancements}} such as better search on package metadata.|$|E
5|$|Inferno {{shares with}} Plan 9 the Unix {{heritage}} from Bell Labs and the Unix philosophy. Many of the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> tools in Inferno were Plan 9 tools that were translated to Limbo.|$|E
5|$|Most Python {{implementations}} (including CPython) {{include a}} read–eval–print loop (REPL), meaning they can {{function as a}} <b>command</b> <b>line</b> interpreter, for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately.|$|E
50|$|Leading and {{trailing}} blanks {{as well as}} null and {{all blank}} lines are ignored. Lines that start with an asterisk (* or $*) are treated as comments. <b>Command</b> <b>lines</b> that end with a continuation character (by default the minus-sign) are continued on the next <b>line.</b> <b>Command</b> <b>lines</b> may be up to 255 characters long.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Command</b> <b>lines</b> {{can have}} {{one or more of}} the {{following}} three prefixes: ...|$|R
50|$|Other <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> {{begin with}} an equal (=) {{followed}} by the command itself.|$|R
5|$|The {{built-in}} preference {{manager for}} Web {{is designed to}} present user only basic browser-specific settings. All the advanced configuration is done with the stand-alone GSettings configurator tools such as GNOME's default dconf (<b>command</b> <b>line)</b> and dconf-editor (graphical).|$|E
5|$|Though Plan 9 was {{supposed}} to be a further development of Unix concepts, compatibility with preexisting Unix software was never the goal for the project. Many <b>command</b> <b>line</b> utilities of Plan 9 share the names of Unix counterparts, but work differently.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of a {{graphical}} controller interface in the standard (non-server) Mac OS X distribution, it is possible to set up an Xgrid controller via the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> tools xgridctl and xgrid. Once the Xgrid controller daemon is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin tool is possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{dependency}} line may {{be followed by}} a series of TAB indented <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> which define how to transform the components (usually source files) into the target (usually the [...] "output"). If any of the prerequisites has a more recent modification time than the target, the <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> are run. The GNU Make documentation refers to the commands associated with a rule as a [...] "recipe".|$|R
50|$|Metrics {{related to}} ElastiCache {{can also be}} {{retrieved}} using <b>command</b> <b>lines.</b> It {{can be used for}} spot checks and ad hoc investigations.|$|R
5|$|The update also {{removes the}} {{graphical}} user interface for the Windows System Assessment Tool, meaning that the Windows Experience Index is no longer displayed. The <b>command</b> <b>line</b> version of the tool remains available on the system. Microsoft reportedly removed the graphical Windows Experience Index {{in order to promote}} the idea that all kinds of hardware run Windows 8 equally well.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{possible}} to access Xgrid from the <b>command</b> <b>line,</b> the Xgrid graphical user interface, a program bundled with Mac OS X Server and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all Mac OS X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of Mac OS X Server. This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with Mac OS X Server.|$|E
25|$|Lisp {{languages}} {{are often used}} with an interactive <b>command</b> <b>line,</b> which may be combined with an integrated development environment (IDE). The user types in expressions at the <b>command</b> <b>line,</b> or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp reads the entered expressions, evaluates them, and prints the result. For this reason, the Lisp <b>command</b> <b>line</b> is called a read–eval–print loop (REPL).|$|E
5000|$|A rule {{may have}} no <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> defined. The {{dependency}} line can consist solely of components that refer to targets, for example: ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{applications}} support only a CLI, {{presenting a}} CLI prompt {{to the user}} and acting upon <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> as they are entered. Some examples of CLI-only applications are: ...|$|R

25|$|They provide close {{integration}} with an underlying OS shell via <b>command</b> <b>line,</b> using the associated terminal window that permits viewing {{the results of}} executing shell commands entered on the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> (e.g., via Ctrl-O shortcut in Norton Commander).|$|E
25|$|Octave {{includes}} a Graphical User Interface (GUI) {{in addition to}} the traditional <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> Interface (CLI); see User interfaces for details.|$|E
25|$|They {{present the}} user with a two-panel {{directory}} view with a <b>command</b> <b>line</b> below. Either panel may be selected to be active; the other becomes passive. The active panel becomes the working area for delete and rename operations, while the passive panel {{serves as a}} target for copy and move operations. Panels may be shrunk, exposing the terminal window hidden behind them. Normally, only {{the last line of}} the terminal window (the <b>command</b> <b>line)</b> is visible.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> of a rule {{are usually}} {{arranged}} {{so that they}} generate the target. An example: if [...] "file.html" [...] is newer, it is converted to text. The contents of the makefile: ...|$|R
5000|$|OS inter-process communication: Most {{operating}} systems support means of inter-process communication (for example; standard streams or named pipes). <b>Command</b> <b>lines</b> from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program {{by one of}} these methods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{content of}} the {{definition}} is stored [...] "as is". Lazy evaluation is used, meaning that macros are normally expanded only when their expansions are actually required, such as when used in the <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> of a rule. An extended example: ...|$|R
25|$|CP/M's <b>command</b> <b>line</b> {{interface}} was {{patterned after}} the operating systems from Digital Equipment, such as RT-11 for the PDP-11 and OS/8 for the PDP-8.|$|E
25|$|Under Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, the {{exclamation mark}} (!) {{is not a}} valid {{filename}} character since {{it is used to}} separate multiple commands in a single <b>command</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A few programs, like WinIDAMS, need {{commands}} {{for many}} of their procedures. WinIDAMS does have an interactive menu to read in data, but then specific statistical procedures need a set of text commands. For example, the text <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> for frequencies look like this: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} examples can be {{run in a}} Ruby shell such as Interactive Ruby Shell, or {{saved in}} a file and run from the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> by typing ruby '.|$|E
25|$|On Windows computers, {{hibernation}} {{is available}} only if all hardware and device drivers are ACPI and plug-and-play–compliant. Hibernation can be invoked from the Start menu or the <b>command</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the {{commands}} available in <b>command</b> <b>line</b> interfaces can be many, complex operations {{can be performed}} using a short sequence of words and symbols. This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned, but reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or mnemonic. Also, using the <b>command</b> <b>line</b> can become slow and error-prone when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, windows, icons, menus, pointer (WIMP) interfaces present users with many widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.|$|E
5000|$|The Death Trap is a text {{adventure}} game, which {{relies on}} simple <b>command</b> <b>lines</b> from the user's input to {{progress through the}} game. As opposed to most [...] "text adventures", with only text as output, The Death Trap provides graphical feedback using still pictures.|$|R
50|$|Fortresses <b>commanding</b> <b>lines</b> of {{communication}} could be bypassed and {{would no longer}} stop an invasion. Since armies could not live off the land indefinitely, Napoleon Bonaparte always sought a quick end to any conflict by pitched battle. This military revolution was described and codified by Clausewitz.|$|R
