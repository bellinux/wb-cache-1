50|$|The major {{difference}} between the two models is how they affect the shape of the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> spectrum. Homogeneous mixing changes the shape of spectrum because the supersaturation is not the same over large and small drops. Exposing a cloud to homogeneously mixed entrained air will result in a narrower <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> spectrum, while inhomogeneous mixing does not change the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> spectrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquid water}} content (LWC) is {{the measure of the}} mass of the water in a cloud in a {{specified}} amount of dry air. It is typically measured per volume of air (g/m3) or mass of air (g/kg) (Bohren, 1998). This variable is important in figuring out which types of clouds are likely to form and is strongly linked to three other cloud microphysical variables: the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> effective radius, the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> number concentration, and the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> size distribution (Wallace, 2006). Being able to determine the cloud formations that are likely to occur is extremely useful for weather forecasting as cumulonimbus clouds are related to thunderstorms and heavy rain whereas cirrus clouds are not directly associated with precipitation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> {{effective}} radius (alternatively cloud effective radius or effective radius) is {{a weighted}} {{mean of the}} size distribution of cloud droplets. The term was defined in 1974 by James E. Hansen and Larry Travis as {{the ratio of the}} third to the second moment of a droplet size distribution to aid in the inversion of remotely sensed data. Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> particles.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{all other}} soluble aerosols, {{increasing}} normal-sized sea salts suppresses the precipitation process in warm clouds by increasing cloud droplet number concentration {{and reducing the}} cloud droplet size. Also, they invigorate precipitation in mix-phase clouds because once the suppressed smaller cloud droplets are lifted above freezing level, more latent heat content would be released due to the freezing of <b>cloud</b> <b>drops.</b> Besides that, adding giant sea salt aerosols to polluted clouds can accelerate the precipitation process because giant CCNs could be nucleated into large particles which collect other smaller <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> and grow into rain droplets. [...] <b>Cloud</b> <b>drops</b> formed on giant sea salt aerosols may grow much more rapidly by condensation that <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> formed on small soluble aerosol particles, as giant sea salt <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> may remain concentrated solution drops for long times after they are carried into <b>cloud.</b> Such <b>drops</b> may have condensational growth rates more than two times faster than drops formed on small aerosol particles, and unlike normal <b>cloud</b> <b>drops,</b> drops formed on {{the largest of the}} giant sea salt aerosols may even grow by condensation in otherwise subsaturated cloudy downdrafts.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} evolution {{hypothesis of}} Woese (1979), {{according to which}} prebiotic reactions occurred rapidly in droplets in giant atmospheric reflux columns was criticized by Scherer (1985). This paper proposes a mechanism for prebiotic chemistry in clouds that answers Scherer's concerns and supports Woese's hypothesis. According to this mechanism, rapid prebiotic chemical evolution was facilitated on the primordial earth by cycles of condensation and evaporation of <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> containing clay condensation nuclei and nonvolatile monomers. For example, amino acids supplied by, or synthesized during entry of meteorites, comets, and interplanetary dust, would have been scavenged by <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> containing clay condensation nuclei and would be polymerized within cloud systems during cycles of condensation, freezing, melting, and evaporation of <b>cloud</b> <b>drops...</b>|$|R
50|$|Homogeneous mixing is a {{model that}} assumes that the {{timescale}} for the mixing within a cloud was short compared to the evaporation timescale. This would imply that the dry, unsaturated, environmental air would be entrained throughout the cloud before it would start to evaporate the cloud droplets. The entrainment mixing that results from this model manifests as a partial evaporation of all the <b>drops</b> within the <b>cloud,</b> but {{no change in the}} number of cloud drops.A contrasting model of entrainment is inhomogeneous mixing. This model assumes that {{the time it takes to}} evaporate <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> is short compared to the mixing timescales. Therefore, the saturated air that mixes with the unsaturated environment air would completely evaporate the <b>cloud</b> <b>drops</b> within the entrained area, which would reduce the total number of <b>cloud</b> <b>drops.</b>|$|R

Hansen and Hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical, and had a refractive index and <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid. Kiyoshi Kawabata and Hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on Venus.

50|$|The {{presence}} of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) influences {{the number of}} cloud drops that form in a cloud; the more CCN there are, the more cloud droplets that will form. Changes in the CCN concentration and their associated changes in the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> distribution can redistribute the energy within a hurricane. This was known in the 1960s which lead scientists to think that hurricanes could be modified {{by the addition of}} CCN to produce less intense hurricanes. It was proposed that by seeding with silver iodide outside the eyewall would freeze the supercooled water, release more latent heat, and increase convection. This method was ultimately unsuccessful {{because of the lack of}} supercooled water in the tropical cyclone. A different approach seeds the clouds with a large number of small hygroscopic aerosols. The large number of CCN leads to smaller raindrops, less collision-coalescence, and thus less rainout. This water is convected above the freezing level, leading to warming in the upper atmosphere and greater convection.|$|E
50|$|Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) are {{a type of}} {{hazardous}} particulate that is not currently well understood, but is thought {{to make up a}} significant portion of the tropospheric aerosol or submicron atmospheric particle mass. 50,51 Aerosols effect the atmospheric radiative balance through the absorption and scattering of radiant energy, leading to shifts in weather via changes in <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> nucleation and the solar radiation budget. They are said to be formed “when the atmospheric oxidation products of volatile organic compounds undergo gas-particle transfer.”The contribution of VOCs to the levels of SOA in the atmosphere have been modeled using simulation chamber experiments to gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved. SOAs are said to be a major causative factor to the mortality rates associated with the exposure to harmful fine particulate air pollution however there is an absence of in vitro particle exposure techniques to test for toxicity. There is research currently being done to find the interaction between SOA’s and lung cells to see their potential harmful effects.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> size distribution near cloud base are initially determined by the aerosol particles that serve as CCN and by the local updraft velocity. Chemical reactions of the emitted gaseous sulfur compounds due to human activities will alter, through gas-to-particle conversion, the aerosol size distribution, total number, and its chemical composition. Recently, Boucher and Rodhe and Jones et. al have each developed parameterizations relating <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> concentration to sulfate mass or aerosol number concentration, respectively, and used them to develop estimates of the indirect forcing by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols. THese parameterizations made use of measure relationships in continental and maritime clouds. However, these relationships are inherently noisy, yielding more than a factor of 2 variation in <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> concentration for a given aerosol number (or for a given sulfate mass) concentration. The large spatial and temporal variabilities in the concentration, chemical characteristics, and size distribution of aerosols have {{made it difficult to}} develop such a parameterization from data. In this paper, our focus is to develop a means for relating the predicted anthropogenic sulfate mass to <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> number concentration over the range of expected conditions associated with continental and marine aerosol. We start with an assumed pre-existing particle size distribution and develop an approximation of the altered distribution after addition of anthropogenic sulfate.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} human {{influences}} are widely investigated. However, {{the processes of}} aerosol-cloud interactions are still not adequately known and the associated lack of knowledge causes uncertainties in climate change prediction. Therefore this study presents different approaches to investigate those interactions, in particular the Twomey-effect, which states that an increase in aerosol loading leads {{to an increase in}} <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> number density and a decrease in <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> effective radius, considering constant liquid water path. The data analysed was obtained during the ASCII campaign 2016 at Ascension Island. Cloud and aerosol measurements were done by an ultra-violet (UV) lidar during the month September 2016. The cloud microphysical properties - <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> number density and <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> effective radius - were retrieved using the cloud property inversion retrieval algorithm. The cloud effective radius varied between 1. 88 and 4. 48 μ m. The <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> number density had values in the range of 228 - 1690 cm^- 3. Furthermore, the total aerosol profiles for clear sky scenes and the aerosol profiles below clouds were retrieved, solving the boundary-value-problem using the ’Klett’ approach. For the aerosol profiles below clouds an extra factor was introduced, accounting for multiple scattering inside the clouds. The aerosol loading arrived at Ascension Island came mainly from the South (Atlantic Ocean) in the lower 1200 m or from the East (African continent, biomass burning events) above 1200 m. The aerosol-cloud interactions were examined for both the clear sky and the below cloud aerosols with the cloud properties. Both approaches gave evidence for the Twomey-effect. Those results suggest that the UV-lidar is a suitable instrument for investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions. Future projects can use those approaches to gain more knowledge over the interactions, enabling a major improvement of climate change predictions. Ascension Island Initiative 2016 (ASCII...|$|E
40|$|Direct aerosol {{radiative}} forcing facilitates {{the onset of}} Indian monsoon rainfall, based on synoptic scale fast responses acting over timescales of days to a month. Here, we examine relationships between aerosols and coincident clouds over the Indian subcontinent, using observational data from 2000 to 2009, from the core monsoon region. Season mean and daily timescales were considered. The correlation analyses of cloud properties with aerosol optical depth revealed that deficient monsoon years were characterized by more frequent and larger decreases in <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> size and ice water path, but increases in cloud top pressure, with increases in aerosol abundance. The opposite was observed during abundant monsoon years. The correlations of greater aerosol abundance, with smaller <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> size, lower evidence of ice processes and shallower cloud height, during deficient rainfall years, imply cloud inhibition; while those with larger <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> size, greater ice processes and a greater cloud vertical extent, during abundant rainfall years, suggest cloud invigoration.

40|$|The {{effects of}} solar heating {{at a variety}} of solar zenith angles (o) on the vapor depositional growth of <b>cloud</b> <b>drops,</b> and hence the {{potential}} for collection enhancement, is investigated. A large eddy simulation (LES) model is used to predict the evolution of marine stratocumulus clouds subject to changes in o. During the course of each simulation, LES output is stored for 600 parcel trajectories and is used to drive an offline microphysical model that includes the influence of radiation on drop growth. Smaller o, such as when the sun is overhead, provide strong solar heating, which tends to confine circulations to the cloud layer and leads to long in-cloud residence times for <b>cloud</b> <b>drops.</b> At larger o, when solar heating is weak, circulations are stronger and penetrate through the depth of the boundary layer, which causes much shorter in-cloud residence times for <b>cloud</b> <b>drops.</b> Simulations show that this leads to a more rapid collection process in strongly, as compared to weakly solar-heated clouds provided that the liquid water contents of each cloud are similar. When drop vapor growth includes radiative effects, three main results emerge: 1) Solar heating at smaller o (0 ° to 45 °) dominates over longwave cooling effects causing a suppression of collection for lower drop concentrations (100 to 200 cm 3). 2) At larger drop concentrations (300 cm 3) longwave cooling dominates over solar heating and collection is enhanced. 3) At large o (60 ° to 90 °), solar heating is ineffective at modifying the drop size spectrum thus allowing longwave cooling to significantly enhance collection at all drop concentrations above approximately 100 cm 3. 1...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of clouds}} in {{reflecting}} solar radiation to space and thereby reducing surface heating is {{of critical importance}} to climate. Combustion processes that produce greenhouse gases also increase cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations which in turn increase <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> concentrations and thereby cloud albedo. A calculation of cloud susceptibility, defined in this work as the increase in albedo resulting from the addition of one <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> per cubic centimeter (as cloud liquid water content remains constant), is made through satellite remote sensing of <b>cloud</b> <b>drop</b> radius and optical thickness.
