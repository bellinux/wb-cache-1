5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He {{developed}} microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the <b>camera</b> <b>shutter,</b> and no film was exposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a <b>camera</b> <b>shutter</b> key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

They dropped [...] "Bangometer" [...] canisters to measure {{the force of the}} blast, [...] but this was not used to calculate the yield at the time. Bernard Waldman was the camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast.

Jeppson of the 1st Ordnance Squadron, he {{inserted}} the Little Boy's powder bags in the Enola Gays bomb bay in flight. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored its circuits. Four other members of Project Alberta flew on the Hiroshima mission. Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew and Lawrence H.

[...] The other was inventor and club vice president Francis Blake, Jr. (18501913), believed to have substantially helped the club financially in its early years.

2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an image {{intensifier}} tube may be switched ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated image intensifier tube functions like a <b>camera</b> <b>shutter,</b> allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated image intensifier tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|E
2500|$|Data {{on target}} {{missiles}} or satellites {{were recorded in}} each radar channel by photographing a five-inch (127mm) [...] intensity-modulated oscilloscope with the <b>camera</b> <b>shutter</b> open on a 35mm film moving approximately five inches per minute. The range of an individual target was represented by its location across {{the width of the}} film, the time by a dotdash code along the length. In addition to this positional information, the target's approximate radial velocity (velocity in the direction of observation) was determined by measuring the Doppler frequency shift in the radar signal when it returned. The doppler shift was found to within 500 cycles by determining which of eighteen frequency filters covering successive bands 500 cycles per second wide passed the return signal. This measurement of radial velocity ran from -4 to -f- per second in increments of [...] All these data, together with the elevation and azimuth of the observing beam, were automatically converted to serial form, encoded in standard teleprinter code, and punched on paper tape for transmission.|$|E

60|$|I bowed as, endeavoring to {{remember}} the names that followed, I moved towards the chair beside her when she beckoned. It lay full in the light, and I noticed blank surprise in the faces turned towards me. Beatrice Haldane dropped the album, {{and for some reason}} the clear rose color surged upwards from her sister's neck. I stooped to recover the book, which lay open, and then stared at it with astonishment and indignation, for the face of the man standing beside a weary team, waist-deep in the tall grass of a slough, was unmistakably my own. I had forgotten the click of the <b>camera</b> <b>shutter</b> that hot morning.|$|E
60|$|Meeting {{the wolves}} now, as they roamed wild and free over the great range, one would hardly have {{recognized}} the little brown creatures that he saw playing about the den where the trail began. The cubs were already noble-looking brutes, larger than the largest husky dog; and the parents were taller, with longer legs and more massive heads and powerful jaws, than any great timber-wolf. A tremendous vitality thrilled in them from nose to paw tips. Their great bodies, as they lay quiet in the snow with heads raised and hind legs bent under them, were like powerful engines, tranquil under enormous pressure; and when they rose the movement was like the quick snap of a steel spring. Indeed, half the ordinary movements of Wayeeses are so quick that the eye cannot follow them. One instant a wolf would be lying flat on his side, his long legs outstretched on the moss, his eyes closed in the sleepy sunshine, his body limp as a hound's after a fox chase; the next instant, like the click and blink of a <b>camera</b> <b>shutter,</b> he would be standing alert on all four feet, questioning the passing breeze or looking intently into your eyes; and you could not imagine, much less follow, the recoil of twenty big electric muscles that at some subtle warning had snapped him automatically from one position to the other. They were all snow-white, with long thick hair and a heavy mane that added enormously to their imposing appearance; and they carried their bushy tails almost straight out as they trotted along, with a slight crook near the body,--the true wolf sign that still reappears in many collies to tell a degenerate race of a noble ancestry.|$|E

40|$|Relative pose {{estimation}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in computer vision {{and it has been}} studied for conventional global <b>shutter</b> <b>cameras</b> for decades. However, recently, a rolling <b>shutter</b> <b>camera</b> has been widely used due to its low cost imaging capability and, since the rolling <b>shutter</b> <b>camera</b> captures the image line-by-line, the relative pose estimation of a rolling <b>shutter</b> <b>camera</b> is more difficult than that of a global <b>shutter</b> <b>camera.</b> In this paper, we propose to exploit inertial measurements (gravity and angular velocity) for the rolling shutter relative pose estimation problem. The inertial measurements provide information about the partial relative rotation between two views (cameras) and the instantaneous motion that causes the rolling shutter distortion. Based on this information, we simplify the rolling shutter relative pose estimation problem and propose effective methods to solve it. Unlike the previous methods, which require 44 (linear) or 17 (nonlinear) points with the uniform rolling <b>shutter</b> <b>camera</b> model, the proposed methods require at most 9 or 11 points to estimate the relative pose between the rolling <b>shutter</b> <b>cameras.</b> Experimental results on synthetic data and the public PennCOSYVIO dataset show that the proposed methods outperform the existing methods...|$|R
