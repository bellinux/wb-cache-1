5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay <b>city</b> <b>commissioner</b> in the United States.

However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
