5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in hypopituitarism may {{be treated with}} subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E
5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay. Antibodies raised against human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
25|$|A {{pregnancy}} test {{may be used}} to detect high levels of <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin, however, the first sign of testicular cancer is usually a painless lump. Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin, so a {{pregnancy test}} is not very sensitive for making out testicular cancer.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> villus {{sampling}} are procedures {{conducted to}} assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. <b>Chorionic</b> villus sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis (<b>chorionic</b> villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, testing can be {{performed}} on the placenta (<b>chorionic</b> villus sampling) or the fluid around the fetus (amniocentesis). However, <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and amniocentesis of one in 200; a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} may {{be diagnosed}} by amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|NF II can be {{diagnosed}} with 65% accuracy prenatally with <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling or amniocentesis.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{for human}} growth hormone, known as growth hormone 1 (somatotropin; {{pituitary}} growth hormone) and growth hormone 2 (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and {{are closely related}} to human <b>chorionic</b> somatomammotropin (also known as placental lactogen) genes. GH, human <b>chorionic</b> somatomammotropin, and prolactin belong to a group of homologous hormones with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{low dose}} of human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (HCG) may be {{injected}} after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 24–36 {{hours after the}} HCG injection.|$|E
25|$|Immunostaining {{for most}} of the usual {{testicular}} germ cell tumour markers is negative (i.e. placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), vimentin, actin, desmin, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), OCT4, human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (hCG), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)).|$|E
25|$|This is {{particularly}} true for the marmoset. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their fraternal twins. 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through <b>chorionic</b> fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.|$|E
25|$|Referral for {{counseling}} in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss {{risks to the}} pregnancy (advanced maternal age, teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling).|$|E
25|$|Urine from {{pregnant}} women contains enough human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropins for commercial extraction and purification to produce hCG medication. Pregnant mare urine {{is the source}} of estrogens, namely Premarin. Urine also contains antibodies, which can be used in diagnostic antibody tests for a range of pathogens, including HIV-1.|$|E
25|$|Hormone levels (especially gonadotropins and AMH) {{can help}} confirm {{that there are}} hormonally {{functional}} testes worth attempting to rescue, as can stimulation with a few injections of human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin to elicit a rise of the testosterone level. Occasionally these tests reveal an unsuspected and more complicated intersex condition.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> villous sampling (CVS). <b>Chorionic</b> villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{research}} into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, {{it was found that}} anti-hCG antibodies prevent marmoset embryos from implanting in the endometrium of their mother's uterus.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is <b>Chorionic</b> Villus Sampling (CVS). <b>Chorionic</b> villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of <b>chorionic</b> villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis. If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. <b>Chorionic</b> villus sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{excellent}} postnatal prognosis, 99% of Turner-syndrome conceptions {{are thought to}} end in miscarriage or stillbirth, {{and as many as}} 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} germ-cell tumors, {{follow-up}} tests generally include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin. For women with stromal cancers, tests for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin are sometimes helpful. Inhibin {{can also be}} useful for monitoring the progress of sex-cord tumors, along with mullerian inhibiting substance. AFP {{can also be used}} to monitor Sertoli-Leydig tumors. In dysgerminomas, lactate dehydrogenase and its two isozymes (LDH-1 and LDH-2) are used to test for recurrence.|$|E
25|$|The major isoform of {{the human}} growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a {{molecular}} weight of 22,124 daltons. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and <b>chorionic</b> somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species, only human and Old World monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor.|$|E
25|$|Signs of a {{miscarriage}} include vaginal spotting, abdominal pain or cramping, and fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding {{can be a}} symptom of miscarriage, but many women also have bleeding in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. Bleeding during pregnancy may {{be referred to as}} a threatened miscarriage. Of those who seek clinical treatment for bleeding during pregnancy, about half will miscarry. Miscarriage may be detected during an ultrasound exam, or through serial human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (HCG) testing.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosing {{germ cell}} tumors may be {{difficult}} because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.|$|E
25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the fetus}} is an {{affected}} girl {{can be determined}} by <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{miscarriage}} include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and {{drug or alcohol}} use. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve {{checking to see if}} the cervix is open or closed, testing blood levels of human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the cause of in{{fertility}}, but may include counselling, fertility treatments, which include in vitro fertilization. According to ESHRE recommendations, couples with an estimated live birth rate of 40% or higher per year are encouraged to continue aiming for a spontaneous pregnancy. Treatment methods for infertility may be grouped as medical or complementary and alternative treatments. Some methods {{may be used in}} concert with other methods. Drugs used for both women and men include clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (hCG), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, aromatase inhibitors, and metformin.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{often can}} be made through {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and <b>chorionic</b> villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who {{have a family history of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies are now looking at determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current prenatal testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current prenatal testing methods. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of <b>chorionic</b> villi sample (CVS), amniocentesis, and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{unless the}} {{placenta}} {{can be easily}} tied off or removed, it may be preferable to leave it in place and allow for a natural regression. This process may take several months and can be monitored by clinical examination, checking human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin levels and by ultrasound scanning (in particular using doppler ultrasonography. Use of methotrexate to accelerate placental regression is controversial as {{the large amount of}} necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection, mifepristone has also be used to promote placental regression. Placental vessels have also been blocked by angiographic embolization. Complications of leaving the placenta can include residual bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction, pre-eclampsia (which may all necessitate further surgery) and failure to breast feed due to placental hormones.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} ectopic {{pregnancy}} include: pelvic inflammatory disease, often due to Chlamydia infection, tobacco smoking, prior tubal surgery, {{a history of}} infertility, {{and the use of}} assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an ectopic pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the Fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies. Implantation can also occur on the cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen. Detection of ectopic pregnancy is typically by blood tests for human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Ultrasound works best when performed from within the vagina. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage, ovarian torsion, and acute appendicitis.|$|E
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, <b>chorionic</b> villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
25|$|When the undescended testis {{is in the}} {{inguinal}} canal, hormonal {{therapy is}} sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. The most commonly used hormone therapy is human <b>chorionic</b> gonadotropin (HCG). A series of hCG injections (10 injections over 5 weeks is common) is given {{and the status of}} the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. Although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5 to 50%, probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. Hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of Leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone {{by the end of the}} injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of GnRH analogs such as nafarelin or buserelin; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. Nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated.|$|E
