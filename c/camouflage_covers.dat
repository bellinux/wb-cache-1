50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with nets, plain without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and <b>camouflage</b> <b>covers</b> were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|E

40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at [URL] paper {{presents}} {{the development of an}} ultra-wideband (300 to 3000 MHz), vertically polarized, nearly omni-directional (in azimuth) communications antenna integrated into the <b>camouflage</b> <b>cover</b> of a standard military-issue Kevlar helmet. The Helmet <b>Camouflage</b> <b>Cover</b> Antenna (referred to as the “helmet antenna”) is one of three antennas (with the combined frequency coverage from 2 to 2000 MHz) based on the antenna COMbat Wear INtegration (COMWIN) concept developed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) for the man-portable implementation of the new Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The results of computer simulations and prototype measurements for the helmet antenna are presented. The helmet antenna is conformal to the shape of the Kevlar ballistic helmet. It is constructed of conducting cloth (polyester interwoven with nickel/copper fibers) and attached as a liner to the helmet's <b>camouflage</b> <b>cover.</b> The helmet antenna is therefore visually undetectable, except for the connector {{in the back of the}} helmet. Several variants of the helmet antenna have been designed and simulated at NPS using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software, with different trade-offs between the low frequency cut-off and the maximum VSWR “ripple” within the operational band. Two prototypes, Mk I and Mk II, have been built and measured at the NPS. Measurements of the input impedance/VSWR as a function of frequency for the Mk II prototype show performance exceeding the HFSS computer model predictions. The VSWR is less than 3 : 1 for all frequencies between 300 and 3000 MHz. The presence of an operator wearing the helmet does not affect the VSWR significantl...|$|R

500|$|The book {{begins with}} a brief account of the {{physical}} causes of animal coloration.

The next seven chapters describe camouflage, both in predators and in prey. Methods of <b>camouflage</b> <b>covered</b> include background matching, resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings, self-decoration with materials from the environment, and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals. Two chapters cover warning colours, including both Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is edible, and Mullerian mimicry, where distasteful species mimic each other. A chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence, for instance in the puss moth. Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection.

The possibility of object type determination by statistical methods is demonstrated. The possibility of spectral image application for its data type identification is considered. Method. Researching was done by means of videospectral equipment for objects detection at "Fregat" substrate. The postprocessing of hyperspectral information was done with the use of math model of pattern recognition system. The vegetation indexes TCHVI (Three-Channel Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were applied for quality control of object recognition. Neumann-Pearson criterion was offered as a tool for determination of objects differences. Main Results. We have carried out analysis of the spectral characteristics of summer-typecamouflage cover (Germany). We have calculated the density distribution of vegetation indexes.

40|$|Although {{a number}} of object {{recognition}} techniques {{have been developed to}} process LADAR scanned terrain scenes, these techniques have had limited success in target discrimination in part due to low-resolution data and limits in available computation power. We present a pose-independent Automatic Target Detection and Recognition System that uses data from an airborne 3 D imaging Ladar sensor. The Automatic Target Recognition system uses geometric shape and size signatures from target models to detect and recognize targets under heavy canopy and <b>camouflage</b> <b>cover</b> in extended terrain scenes. A method for data integration was developed to register multiple scene views to obtain a more complete 3 D surface signature of a target. Automatic target detection was performed using the general approach of" 3 D cueing," which determines and ranks regions of interest within a large-scale scene based on the likelihood that they contain the respective target. Each region of interest is then passed to an ATR algorithm to accurately identify the target from among a library of target models. Automatic target recognition was performed using spin-image surface matching, a pose-independent algorithm that determines correspondences between a scene and a target of interest. Given a region of interest within a large-scale scene, the ATR algorithm either identifies the target from among a library of 10 target models or reports a "none of the above" outcome. The system performance was demonstrated on five measured scenes with targets both out in the open and under heavy canopy cover, where the target occupied between 1 to 10 % of the scene by volume. The ATR section of the system was successfully demonstrated for twelve measured data scenes with targets both out in the open andunder heavy canopy and <b>camouflage</b> <b>cover.</b> Correct target identification was also demonstrated for targets with multiple movable parts that are in arbitrary orientations. The system achieved a high recognition rate (over 99 %) along with a low false alarm rate (less than 0. 01 %) The contributions of this thesis research are: 1) I implemented a novel technique for reconstructing multiple-view 3 D Ladar scenes. 2) I demonstrated that spin-image-based detection and recognition is feasible for terrain data collected in the field with a sensor that may be used in a tactical situation and 3) I demonstrated recognition of articulated objects, with multiple movable parts. Immediate benefits of the presented work will be to the area of Automatic Target Recognition of military ground vehicles, where the vehicles of interest may include articulated components with variable position relative to the body, and come in many possible configurations. Other application areas include human detection and recognition for Homeland Security, and registration of large or extended terrain scenes. by Alexandru N. Vasile. Thesis (M. Eng.)
