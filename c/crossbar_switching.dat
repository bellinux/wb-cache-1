For large N (and the {{practical}} requirements of a phone switch are considered large) this growth was too expensive. Further, large <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches</b> had physical problems. Not only did the switch require too much space, but the metal bars containing the switch contacts would become so long that they would sag and become unreliable. Engineers also noticed that at any time, each bar of a <b>crossbar</b> <b>switch</b> was only making a single connection. The other contacts on the two bars were unused.

40|$|Abstract—Buffered <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches</b> {{are special}} <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches</b> {{with a small}} {{exclusive}} buffer at each crosspoint of the crossbar. They demonstrate unique advantages, such as vari-able length packet handling and distributed scheduling, over traditional unbuffered <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches.</b> The current main approach for buffered <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches</b> to provide perfor-mance guarantees is to emulate push-in-first-out output queued switches. However, such an approach has several drawbacks, and in particular it has difficulty in providing tight constant performance guarantees. To address the issue, we propose in this paper the guaranteed-performance asynchronous packet scheduling (GAPS) algorithm for buffered <b>crossbar</b> <b>switches.</b> GAPS intends to provide tight performance guarantees, and requires no speedup. It directly handles variable length packets without segmentation and reassembly, and makes scheduling decisions in a distributed manner. We show by theoretical analysis that GAPS achieves constant performance guarantees. We also prove that GAPS has a bounded crosspoint buffer size of 3 L, where L is the maximum packet length. Finally, we present simulation data to verify the analytical results and show the effectiveness of GAPS. Keywords-buffered crossbar switches; performance guaran-tees; speedup; I...|$|R
