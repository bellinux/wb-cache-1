5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including The <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild,</b> a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E

60|$|Thin fog drifted {{down the}} Firth when, with Whitney's help, Andrew pulled the dinghy {{up the bank}} and then stopped to look about. It was nine o'clock in the evening {{when they left the}} Rowan at anchor in the channel a hundred yards away, and he knew the tide was {{beginning}} to flow, which meant that he had {{an hour and a half}} in which to reach and return from the wreck. Everything was obscured to the east, but to the west the sky was clear, and a thin, bright moon shone in a patch <b>of</b> dusky blue. <b>The</b> sand felt harder than usual, for the night air was frosty, but <b>the</b> melancholy <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> fowl told that the salt ooze in the gutters was still unfrozen.

60|$|She {{had never}} seen the glowing, sensuous East and South, but the new West lay open before her in all its clean, {{pristine}} virility. A vast sweep of sky that was duskily purple eastward stretched overhead, a wonderful crystalline bluish green, until it changed far off on the grassland's rim to a streak of smoky red. Under it the prairie rolled back like a great silent sea. There was something that set the blood stirring in the dew-chilled air, and <b>the</b> faint smell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood smoke and <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> fowl on a distant sloo intensified <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new and unfamiliar. One could be free in that wide land, she felt; and as she thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customs, castes, and conventions to which one must submit at home, she wondered whether they were needed guides and guards or mere cramping fetters. They seemed to have none of them in western Canada.|$|R

25|$|Written as a {{frontier}} {{story about the}} gold rush, The <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> was meant for the pulp market.

Eighty years later, Linda Lewis — Young's daughter-in-law — claimed that before her death Young told her that she had been raped by Gable, and though the two had flirted on set, there had been no affair.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} two rounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, often the regular {{broadcast}} teams are mixed, due to Boomer Esiason's unavailability. During <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> card and divisional weekends, there are four games, therefore four separate crews are needed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other established crews call the less-popular games. For instance, in 2007, Dick Enberg and Dennis Green (from the Thursday night crew) <b>called</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> card games, and Marv Albert called games alongside Jim Fassel from the Sunday doubleheader team. In 2009, the teams were even more mixed - for example, Marv Albert called an opening round game with Dennis Green and a divisional playoff game with Warren Moon.|$|R
5000|$|The river {{may have}} been first <b>called</b> <b>the</b> River <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> Horses back in 1833 by {{botanist}} David Douglas. The river was given its current name in 1871. The word Marron is French and it has several meanings. One of them is [...] "domestic animal that has become wild". According to Mrs. William Allen and Mr. F. M. Buckland, a lot <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> horses roamed <b>the</b> area around the river, which is likely why the river was given the name it was in reference to <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> horses that roamed the surrounding terrain.|$|R
50|$|Bloom {{began to}} {{photograph}} wildlife in 1993 while {{on vacation in}} South Africa. In 1996 he devoted all his time to wildlife photography and spent the following two years working on his first book, In Praise of Primates, {{which was published in}} ten languages. In 2004 Untamed, an oversize book that features animals from all the world's continents, was published in ten language editions for its first printing, and in 2006 he published two monographs: Elephant! and Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild.</b> In 2006 he returned to photographing people. Living Africa, published in 2008, is a body of photographs covering several African countries, mixing photographs of wildlife, remote tribal groups and people in cities, including gold miners 3 km underground. Bloom's second book on Africa, Trading Places - <b>The</b> Merchants <b>of</b> Nairobi, features subsistence shopkeepers in <b>the</b> suburbs <b>of</b> Nairobi, including Kibera. He has also published several children's books including My Big Cats Journal (Thames & Hudson), My Favourite Animal Families (Thames & Hudson) and Les animaux racontés aux enfants (Editions de la Martinière Jeunesse). By 2010, Steve Bloom had produced eleven city centre outdoor exhibitions <b>called</b> Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild,</b> each consisting <b>of</b> up to 100 large format weather-sealed prints. Free and usually open to the public 24 hours a day, <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exhibitions was to engender awareness of habitat encroachment and global warming. The inaugural exhibition, in Birmingham, England, ran for eleven months in Centenary Square. Further exhibitions followed in Copenhagen, Leeds, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Moscow, Dublin, Oslo, Stavanger, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Tokyo and Abbeville. The Copenhagen exhibition opened on 16 May 2006 and was visited by 1,019,028 people during the first three months.|$|R
25|$|When Jack London wrote Martin Eden at age 33, he {{had already}} {{achieved}} international acclaim with The <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild,</b> The Sea-Wolf and White Fang. Despite the acclaim, London quickly became disillusioned with his fame and set sail through the South Pacific on a self-designed ketch called the Snark. On the grueling two-year voyage—as he struggled with tiredness and bowel diseases—he wrote Martin Eden, filling its pages with his frustrations, adolescent gangfights and struggles for artistic recognition. The character of Ruth Morse was modelled on Mabel Applegarth— the first love of London's life.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> {{is a short}} {{adventure}} novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character {{of the novel is}} a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.|$|E
500|$|In 1918, Long began urging Terhune {{to publish}} a book of his dog stories, though Terhune himself was not {{convinced}} at first. He considered them {{to be nothing more}} than [...] "hack writing" [...] and inferior to his other works. Even after Long convinced him of the public's love of the works, Terhune initially did nothing towards the goal. Later that year, Doubleday-Page, which had published Terhune's last novel Fortune, wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it. Wanting to escape from that publisher due to the dismal performance of Fortune, Terhune decided to follow Long's suggestion so he could use the book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation. After he collected together the twenty Lad stories he'd written so far, he reorganized them into chapters and submitted the book. He was unsurprised that it was rejected, but in the rejection letter the company referred to Alfred Ollivant's 1898 novel Owd Bob and Jack London's 1903 novel <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> as [...] "superior pieces of work". As Terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers, he became determined that Lad: A Dog would be published. E. P. Dutton's John Macrae, who was a known dog lover, found the stories [...] "simple but charming" [...] and felt the public would like them greatly.|$|E

60|$|In {{all this}} {{there had been}} {{increased}} dismay, but there had also been some comfort. It had only been at moments {{in which he had}} been subject to her softer influences that Paul had doubted as to his adherence to the letter which he had written to her, breaking off his engagement. When she told him of her wrongs and of her love; of his promise and his former devotion to her; when she assured him that she had given up everything in life for him, and threw her arms round him, looking into his eyes;--then he would almost yield. But when, what the traveller <b>called</b> <b>the</b> breeding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> cat, showed itself;--and when, having escaped from her, he thought of Hetta Carbury and of her breeding,--he was fully determined that, let his fate be what it might, it should not be that <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> husband <b>of</b> Mrs Hurtle. That he was in a mass of troubles from which {{it would be very difficult}} for him to extricate himself he was well aware;--but if it were true that Mr Hurtle was alive, that fact might help him. She certainly had declared him to be,-- not separated, or even divorced,--but dead. And if it were true also that she had fought a duel with one husband, that also ought to be a reason why a gentleman should object to become her second husband. These facts would at any rate justify himself to himself, and would enable himself to break from his engagement without thinking himself to be a false traitor.|$|R
40|$|Primate {{tourism is}} used as a tool to promote {{conservation}} of and education about primates, but research has shown that tourist behavior may negatively affect primates. There is {{a growing body of research}} quantifying various impacts of tourism on macaques, but few studies quantify what tourists bring to and gain from the experience. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was to provide such data using a survey administered to tourists as they viewed Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) at a tourist site <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> Monkeys (VWM) in Huangshan, Anhui Province, China. I hypothesized that answers would be unequally distributed among options presented for each question, particularly for those questions related to feeding or otherwise interacting with the monkeys. For example, tourists answered questions about their: experience at VWM, understandings of monkey behaviors, opinions of other tourists’ behaviors, satisfaction with park facilities, perceived likelihood of disease transmission, and whether they would enjoy feeding the monkeys. Between August 5 - 20, 2011, I distributed 376 surveys, with a response rate of 261 (60. 1 %). Chi-square analyses were run for each question. For 15 of 18 questions, answers selected significantly differed from an even distribution. The results indicated that tourists are interested in an intimate experience with the monkeys, but are not properly educated on several aspects of monkey threat behavior or disease transmission that may occur during such contact. A tourist education plan focusing on how to safely act around the monkeys could enrich tourist experiences in ways that successfully promote conservation efforts...|$|R
