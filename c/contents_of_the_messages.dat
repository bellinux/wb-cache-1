5000|$|Forensic {{linguistic}} evidence {{also played}} a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in Yorkshire. After she was reported missing, her partner received several text messages from Julie's mobile phone, such as [...] "Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out", and [...] "Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things". Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages.</b> Simmerson was eventually found guilty of Turner's murder.|$|E

50|$|Some {{features}} of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol inherited by the wave federation protocol are {{the discovery of}} IP addresses and port numbers, using Domain Name System (DNS) SRV records, and TLS authentication and encryption of connections. The XMPP transport encrypts operations at a transport level. So, it only provides cryptographic security between servers connected directly to each other. An additional layer of cryptography provides end-to-end authentication between wave providers using cryptographic signatures and certificates, allowing all wavelet providers to verify {{the properties of the}} operation. Therefore, a downstream wave provider can verify that the wave provider is not spoofing wavelet operations. It should not be able to falsely claim that a wavelet operation originated from a user on another wave provider or that it was originated in a different context. This addresses the situation where two users from different, trustworthy wave providers are participants of a wavelet that is hosted on a malicious provider. The protocol requires each participant to sign its user's operations with its own certificate. The signatures of all the operations forwarded by the host will be evaluated by the participants. This is to stop malicious hosts from altering or spoofing the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> from the user of other services. All the signatures and verifications are done by the wave providers, not the client software of the end users.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2015, the IWMF {{released}} a free mobile security app designed for journalists. The app was received critically by security experts because the app was closed-source; the IWMF has not published {{the reports of}} the audits that it claims to have done; the IWMF {{has access to the}} <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> that are sent with the app as well as the locations of its users; and because the app's privacy policy states that the IWMF reserves the right to share this data {{with a wide variety of}} third parties, respond to subpoenas and court orders from an unspecified number of jurisdictions, and to modify the privacy policy at any time without prior notice to the app's users. Reverse engineering of the app revealed that [...] "every action is logged", that the user's last locations are stored in plaintext and that the app uses an insecure encryption protocol when connecting to the IWMF's server. In response, the IWMF announced that they would release the application's source code under an open-source license. Security researchers were still critical of the IWMF's model of collecting and storing personal data unencrypted. The IWMF released the source code for the iOS and Android versions of the mobile app as well as its backend database server as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license in January 2016.|$|E

The computerized method also includes transmitting, from an authentication server, information about the plurality of virtual environments to a first computing device associated with an agent in response to user request for access to a restricted electronic messaging format associated {{with one of the}} virtual worlds. The computerized method further includes receiving, at the authentication server, an indication of authorization from the first computing device, wherein the indication of authorization includes a separate indication of authorization associated with each of the plurality of virtual environments. System and method for controlling a virtual environment of a userUnited States 11,840,647Issued August 17, 2007 A method and a system for controlling a virtual environment of a user, e.g., a child is provided. In the virtual environment, users are able to interact with other users using messages. Each message is made up of one or more items contained in a dictionary. Information is transmitted, e.g., by e mail, to an agent, e.g., a parent. The transmitted information is information that may be used to authorize the agent to control the virtual environment of the user. The virtual environment of the user is controlled by setting a level of interaction at which the user is permitted to interact with others. The messages may include pre-written messages and messages composed by a user using items contained in the dictionary. A message checker bars unsuitable combinations made up of items contained in the dictionary.

Optimal content-based routing uses dissemination trees dynamically pruned to only cover the matching subscribers. It is a complex problem that has motivated significant research efforts. This paper presents a compilation of the main algorithms for routing messages in distributed content- based publish-subscribe systems proposed and published in the last decade.

Moreover, whenever it is appropriate, the algorithms covered are also matched to similar algorithms familiar to the networking community, setting this paper apart from other surveys on the broad topic of publish/subscribe systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mobile Nodes in some {{challenging}} network scenarios {{suffer from}} intermittent connectivity and frequent partitions e. g. battlefield and disaster recovery scenarios. Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) technologies {{are designed to}} enable nodes in such environments to communicate with one another. Several application scenarios require a security design that provides fine grain access control to contents stored in storage nodes within a DTN or to <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> routed through the network. In this paper, we propose an access control scheme {{which is based on}} the Ciphertext Policy Attributed-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) approach. Our scheme provides a flexible fine-grained access control such that the encrypted contents can only be accessed by authorized users. Two unique features our scheme provide are: (i) the incorporation of dynamic attributes whose value may change over time, and (ii) the revocation feature. We also provide some performance results from our implementation. ...|$|E
