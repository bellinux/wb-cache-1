25|$|One way to {{identify}} locations of points in (or outside) a triangle {{is to place}} the triangle in an arbitrary location and orientation in the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane,</b> and to use Cartesian coordinates.

25|$|The {{point where}} the axes meet is the common origin of the two number lines and is simply called the origin. It is often labeled O and if so then the axes are called Ox and Oy. A plane with x- and y-axes defined is often {{referred}} to as the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane</b> or xy-plane. The value of x is called the x-coordinate or abscissa and the value of y is called the y-coordinate or ordinate.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rest}} frame has {{space and time}} axes that meet at right angles, the moving frame is drawn with axes that meet at an acute angle. The frames are {{actually}} equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane,</b> and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a Mercator projection of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{set forth}} {{the first great}} {{landmark}} of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry. He selected a small core of undefined terms (called common notions) and postulates (or axioms) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the Elements, it may {{be thought of as}} part of the common notions. Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is not quite the same as the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{implies a}} {{different}} definition for {{the line of}} nodes in the geometrical construction. In the proper Euler angles case it {{was defined as the}} intersection between two homologous <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes</b> (parallel when Euler angles are zero; e.g. xy and XY). In the second one, it is defined as the intersection of two non-homologous planes (perpendicular when Euler angles are zero; e.g. xy and YZ).|$|R

500|$|More generally, {{any real}} vector space of (finite) dimensionD {{can be viewed}} as the set of all D-tuples ofD realnumbers [...] on which [...] twooperations are defined: vectoraddition and {{multiplication}} by a realnumber. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vectoraddition and real-numbermultiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
500|$|The set [...] {{is called}} the index [...] set or {{parameter}} set of the stochastic process. Often this set is some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers or an interval, giving the set [...] the interpretation of time. In addition to these sets, the index set [...] can be other linearly ordered sets or more general mathematical sets, such as the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane</b> [...] or -dimensional Euclidean space, where an element [...] can represent a point in space. But in general more results and theorems are possible for stochastic processes when the index set is ordered.|$|E
500|$|The term random {{function}} {{is also used}} to refer to a stochastic or random process, [...] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. The terms stochastic process and [...] random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. If the random variables are indexed by the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>plane</b> or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be [...] vectors or other mathematical objects.|$|E

Although, Kelly formulated a complex Euclidian framework of psychological laws, axioms, and corollaries, we have concentrated on the methods that later workers took from Kelly’s original ‘RepGrid Test’. The central entity is a self-constructed concept, or set thereof, that may be represented in a matrix. As a matrix of integers can be manipulated by a large variety of statistical protocols, we explore in three studies how such matrices may be derived in relation to students` concepts of living kinds, and then how they may be analysed. Typcially, we use principal components analysis – a model-free form of factor analysis.

40|$|Human action {{recognition}} {{is an important}} yet challenging task. This paper presents a low-cost descriptor called 3 D histograms of texture (3 DHoTs) to extract discriminant features from a sequence of depth maps. 3 DHoTs are derived from projecting depth frames onto three orthogonal <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes,</b> i. e., the frontal, side, and top planes, and thus compactly characterize the salient information of a specific action, on which texture features are calculated to represent the action. Besides this fast feature descriptor, a new multi-class boosting classifier (MBC) is also proposed to efficiently exploit different kinds of features in a unified framework for action classification. Compared with the existing boosting frameworks, we add a new multi-class constraint into the objective function, which helps to maintain a better margin distribution by maximizing the mean of margin, whereas still minimizing the variance of margin. Experiments on the MSRAction 3 D, MSRGesture 3 D, MSRActivity 3 D, and UTD-MHAD data sets demonstrate that the proposed system combining 3 DHoTs and MBC is superior {{to the state of}} the art...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel human action recognition method {{based on the}} sequences of depth maps, which provide additional body shape and motion information for action recognition. First, the authors divide each depth sequence {{into a number of}} sub-sequences. All these sub-sequences are of uniform length. By controlling vague boundary (VB), they construct a VB-sequence which consists of an original sub-sequence and its adjacent sequences. Then, each depth frame in a VB-sequence is projected onto three orthogonal <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes,</b> and the absolute value of the difference between two consecutive projected maps is accumulated to form a depth motion map (DMM) to describe the dynamic feature of a VB-sequence. Finally, they concatenate the DMMs of all the VB-sequences in one video sequence to describe an action. Collectively, they call them VB division of depth model. For classification, they apply robust probabilistic collaborative representation classification. The recognition results applied to the MSR Action Pairs, MSR Gesture 3 D, MSR Action 3 D, and UTD-MHAD datasets indicate superior performance of their method over most existing methods...|$|R
40|$|A subcell {{model for}} thin wires in the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method using {{modified}} telegraphers equations {{has been developed}} by Holland et A Edelvik has previously presented an extension of their algorithm, which allows for arbitrarily located and oriented wires {{with respect to the}} Cartesian grid. This is important to be able to accurately model wires that cannot be aligned to the Cartesian grid, e. g., tilted wires and circular loop wires. Recently, a dual set of equations has been proposed for modeling of thin slots. In this paper, we show that using a similar algorithm as for thin wires we can also handle slots of arbitrary location in <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes.</b> Previous thin slot models have been susceptible for instabilities. We show that a symmetric coupling between field and slot yields a stable time-continuous field-slot system and that the fully discrete field-slot system is stable under a generalized Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition. The proposed method is demonstrated for scattering from a finite-length slot in an infinite conducting wall and a shielding enclosure including a slot. The results are in good agreement with published experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The {{formulation}} of a fully compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheric model called theModel for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A) is described. The solver is discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates a split-explicit time-integration technique {{used in many}} existing nonhydrostatic meso- and cloud-scale models. MPAS {{can be applied to}} the globe, over limited areas of the globe, and on <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes.</b> The Voronoi meshes are unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be used for regional NWP and regional climate applications. The rationales for aspects of this formulation are discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows onCartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems in the mesh-transition zones. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Intra-limb {{coordination}} {{involves the}} planning of trajectories in the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>planes.</b> This reduces computational load and the degrees of freedom for a given movement, and it constrains the limbs to act as one unit instead of sets of muscles and joints. This concept is similar to [...] "muscle synergies" [...] and [...] "coordinative structures." [...] An example of such concept is the Hogan and Flash minimum-jerk model, which predicts that the parameter that the nervous system controls is the spatial path of the hand, i.e. the end-effector (which implies that the movement is planned in the Cartesian coordinates). Other early studies showed that the end-effector follows a regularized kinematic pattern relating movement's curvature to speed and that {{the central nervous system}} is devoted to its coding.In contrast to this model, the joint-space model postulates that the motor system plans movements in joint coordinates. For this model, the controlled parameter is the position of each joint contributing to the movement. Control strategies for goal directed movement differ according to the task that the subject is assigned. This was proven by testing two different conditions: (1) subjects moved cursor in the hand to the target and (2) subjects move their free hand to the target. Each condition showed different trajectories: (1) straight path and (2) curved path.|$|R
