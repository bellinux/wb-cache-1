500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} and laceration are {{injuries to}} the lung tissue. Pulmonary laceration, in which lung tissue is torn or cut, differs from pulmonary contusion {{in that the}} former involves disruption of the macroscopic architecture of the lung, while the latter does not. When lacerations fill with blood, the result is pulmonary hematoma, a collection of blood within the lung tissue. Contusion involves hemorrhage in the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen), but a hematoma is a discrete <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> not interspersed with lung tissue. [...] A collapsed lung can result when the pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax). These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself, {{but they may be}} associated with it. [...] Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may be associated with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest, in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached {{from the rest of the}} chest wall and moves independently.|$|E

50|$|Fibrin (also called Factor Ia) is a fibrous, non-globular protein {{involved}} in the <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> It is formed {{by the action of}} the protease thrombin on fibrinogen which causes it to polymerize.

60|$|I had no pain. I {{lay in a}} bunk {{that felt}} gritty and greasy to the touch, and my hair was matted behind by a <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> I had been {{stripped}} of my clothes, and put into some coarse and rough material, the colour and condition of which I could not see for want of light. I began to cast about me, to examine {{the size of the}} bunk, which I found to be narrow, and plainly at some distance from the deck, for I laid hold upon one of the rough beams above me. By its curvature I knew it to be a knee, and thus I came to the caulked sides of the vessel, {{and for the first time}} heard the rattling thud and swish of water on the far side of it. I had no sooner made this discovery, which drew from me an involuntary groan, when a ship's lanthorn was of a sudden thrust over me, and I perceived behind it a head covered with shaggy hair and beard, and beetling brows. Never had I been in such a terrifying presence.|$|E
60|$|The {{manner in}} which my captors treated me, excited my surprise. As {{soon as it was}} light, my limbs were released, and I was {{permitted}} to walk up and down the quarter-deck to restore the circulation of the blood. A <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> with some fragments of hair, marked the spot where poor Captain Williams had fallen; and I was allowed to dash a bucket of water over the place, in order to wash away the revolting signs of the murder. For myself, a strange recklessness had taken the place of concern, and I became momentarily indifferent to my fate. I expected to die, and I am now ashamed to confess that my feelings took a direction towards revenge, rather than towards penitence for my past sins. At times, I even envied Marble, and those below, who might destroy their enemies at a swoop, by throwing a match into the magazine. I felt persuaded, indeed, it would come to that before the mate and men would submit to be the captives of such wretches as were then in possession of the deck. Smudge and his associates, however, appeared to be perfectly indifferent to this danger, of the character of which they were probably ignorant. Their scheme had been very cunningly laid; and, thus far, it was perfectly successful.|$|E

[...] "No; {{certainly}} not," [...] he answered, with emphasis. [...] "Not the very slightest reason {{in any way to}} fear it. The sanest man, coming from the very sanest and healthiest stock on earth, would almost certainly be subject to delusions under such circumstances. This is accident, not disease--circumstance, not temperament. The injury to the brain {{is the result of a}} special blow. Grief for the loss of his son, and brooding over the event, no doubt contributed to the particular shape the delusion has assumed. But the injury's the main thing. I don't doubt there's a <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> formed just here on the brain, obstructing its functions in part, and disturbing its due relations. In every other way, you say, he's a good man of business. The very apparent rationality of the delusion--the way it's been led up to by his habit of standing on cliffs, his name, his associations, his family, everything--is itself a good sign that the partial insanity is due to a local and purely accidental cause. It simulates reason as closely as possible. Dismiss the question altogether from your mind, as far as your daughter's future is concerned. Its no more likely to be inherited than a broken leg or an amputated arm is." ...|$|E

The development of Factor VII activity in blood from patients with coagulation disorders was studied by Aas (3) and Hougie (2). In addition, there are conflicting reports of Factor VII assays on serum from patients with coagulation abnor-malities (4 - 7). Such variations might be technical but could also depend upon the disorder stud-ied. Therefore, the development of increased Fac-tor VII activity during <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from var-ious patients, encompassing most known coagu-lation disorders, has been investigated. Using a standardized technique, it was found that some clotting factors are necessary for the development of increased Factor VII activity, while others ap-pear to be unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|Short-chain {{polyphosphate}} (polyP) {{is released}} from platelets upon platelet activation, {{but it is}} not clear if it contributes to thrombosis. PolyP has increased propensity to clot blood with increased polymer length and when localized onto particles, but it is unknown whether spatial localization of short-chain polyP can accelerate <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> flowing <b>blood.</b> Here, numerical simulations predicted the effect of localization <b>of</b> polyP on <b>clotting</b> under flow, and this was tested in vitro using microfluidics. Synthetic polyP was more effective at triggering <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> flowing <b>blood</b> plasma when localized on a surface than when solubilized in solution or when localized as nanoparticles, accelerating clotting at 10 – 200 fold lower concentrations, particularly at low to sub-physiological shear rates typical of where thrombosis occurs in large veins or valves. Thus, sub-micromolar concentrations of short-chain polyP can accelerate <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> flowing <b>blood</b> plasma under flow at low to sub-physiological shear rates.

5000|$|There was an {{interruption}} in {{the play}} when Lincoln arrived. The orchestra played [...] "Hail to the Chief" [...] and the audience gave a standing ovation.

[...] Leale's statement of Booth running across the stage is an enforcer of Michael Kauffman's idea in [...] "American Brutus," [...] that Booth did not break his leg from the fall from the banister, but rather from a fall off his horse as he fled. Leale, seeing this, immediately rushed to the president's box. When he arrived, he saw Lincoln slumped in his armchair supported by Mrs. Lincoln, who was weeping frantically. Leale received permission to take charge. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse: [...] "His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous." [...] He laid the president down on the floor and initially thinking that Lincoln had been stabbed in the shoulder, searched for wounds. Finding none, he further detected that Lincoln's eyes were dilated and finally found [...] "a large <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> about one inch below the superior curved line and an inch and a half to the left of the median line of the occipital bone in the back of the skull," [...] that showed that he had been shot.

50|$|From the {{examples}} given {{it may be}} seen that the origin-myths of Melanesia show clear evidence of composite origins. From small groups like the Admiralty Islands several quite different legends accounting {{for the same thing}} have been collected, and throughout the whole area a striking variety exists. In how far we are justified in attributing one set of myths to the older Papuan stratum and another to the later Melanesian layer is very difficult to say, since but little from the purer Papuan tribes of the area has as yet been recorded. Comparison with Polynesia and Indonesia suggests that the myths of the origin of the sea, of mankind as originally having had the power to renew their youth by changing skins, and of the obtaining of fire from or with the aid of snakes, were primarily Papuan, for no traces of either appear in Indonesia, and only the former is found in somewhat mutilated form in Samoa, but nowhere else in Polynesia. Other themes, however, such as the origin of human beings from eggs or from a <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> are widely known in Indonesia and also occur in western and south-western Polynesia, and would seem to be immigrant elements from the great culture stream which, passing from Indonesia eastward into the Pacific, swept with greatest strength the north-eastern and south-eastern parts of Melanesia.|$|E
50|$|Myths of {{the origin}} of men or of deities from a <b>clot</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> are of {{interest}} in their relation to other areas in Oceania. One version again comes from the Admiralty Islands. A woman, named Hi-asa, who lived alone, one day cut her finger while shaving pandanus strips. Collecting the blood from the wound in a mussel-shell, she put a cover over it and set it away; but when, after eleven days, she looked in the shell, it contained two eggs. She covered them up, and after several days they burst, one producing a man and the other a woman, who became the parents of the human race. In the neighbouring island of New Britain one account gives a similar origin for the two brothers To-Rabinana and To-Karvuvu. While an old woman was wading in the sea searching for shellfish, her arms pained her, and so, taking two sharp strips of pandanus, she scratched and cut first one arm and then the other. The two strips of pandanus, thus covered with her blood, she laid away in a heap of refuse which she intended to burn; but after a time the pile began to swell, and when she was about to set fire to it, she saw that two boys had grown from her blood—from the blood of her right arm, To-Kabinana, and from that of her left arm, To-Karvuvu. At several points in German New Guinea we find similar tales of children originating from clots of blood, although here, we must note, they are not considered as the parents of mankind.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{side effect}} is agranulocytosis, a decrease <b>of</b> white <b>blood</b> {{cells in the}} blood. Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the <b>clotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat.|$|R
