Members {{of the public}} are invited to examine this draft and provide written comment. The deadline for all written responses is Wednesday 14 August 2013. Key points: 	Small businesses feel the burden of regulation more strongly than other businesses. Almost universally, their lack of staff, time and resources present challenges in understanding and fulfilling compliance obligations. 	Small businesses primarily ‘experience’ regulation and much of its associated compliance burden through engagement with regulators in their delivery of regulation. While regulators are generally committed to effective engagement and to minimising unnecessary burdens, {{it is apparent that}} many do not have robust frameworks to ensure high level ideals consistently translate to good practices on the ground. 	Regulator culture is crucial. Those regulators noted by industry and government as having effective engagement practices have adjusted their culture by focusing on senior management priorities, training and skills of enforcement staff, performance monitoring, stakeholders feedback, and rewarding behaviour consistent with the desired practices. 	Regulators can be more responsive to small business needs and capacities in their communications. In particular: greater use of industry associations to disseminate information; tailoring information requirements around data already collected by businesses; and proactive sharing of compliance information between regulators would generally improve small business experiences with regulators. 	There is scope for increased targeting of those businesses and activities which present a higher risk to communities, and for adoption of lesser compliance cost approaches for lower risk businesses, such as less frequent inspections or less onerous reporting requirements. 	 		When done well, such targeting is likely to achieve outcomes at a lower cost than an engagement approach derived from strict application of a small business definition. 	 	 	Governments can improve engagement outcomes by ensuring the institutional and governance frameworks within which regulators operate do not inhibit adoption of leading engagement practices. This includes ensuring regulators have access to an appropriate range of compliance and enforcement tools, and resourcing to effectively deliver the policy objectives behind their regulatory responsibilities. 	 		Where regulators are inadequately resourced, either some risks to communities go unmitigated or the costs of mitigation are pushed onto those regulated (including small businesses). Governments should provide regulators with explicit guidance on regulatory priorities, given limited resources. 	 	 	Regulator discretion in compliance monitoring and enforcement must be accompanied by appropriate transparency and accountability measures with regulator guidance provided on use of discretion and, where feasible, a separation of education and enforcement roles. 	More widespread use could be made of formal cooperation arrangements between regulators to minimise the overall interaction burden on business. Lead agency models to facilitate joint compliance <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspections</b> and regulator forums to exchange views on good practice and build professional capacity are effective means of improving engagement. 	Ongoing monitoring by regulators of the effectiveness of delivery approaches and costs imposed on business is essential to improving regulator performance. Governments should require regulators to report against engagement principles and ensure low cost mediation services for the resolution of disputes, particularly with local governments...|$|E

40|$|Network {{security}} {{has been very}} crucial for the software industry. Deep packet inspection (DPI) {{is one of the}} widely used approaches in enforcing network security. Due to the high volume of network traffic, it is challenging to achieve high performance for DPI in real time. In this thesis, a new DPI framework is presented that accelerates packet header <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> payload <b>inspection</b> on graphics processing units (GPUs). Various optimizations were applied to GPU-version packet inspection, such as thread-level and block-level packet assignment, warp divergence elimination, and memory transfer optimization using pinned memory and shared memory. The performance of the pattern-matching algorithms used for DPI was analyzed by using an assorted set of characteristics such as pipeline stalls, shared memory efficiency, warp efficiency, issue slot utilization, and cache hits. The extensive characterization of the algorithms on the GPU architecture and the performance comparison among parallel pattern-matching algorithms on both the GPU and the CPU are the unique contributions of this thesis. Among the GPU-version algorithms, the Aho-Corasick algorithm and the Wu-Manber algorithm outperformed the Rabin-Karp algorithm because the Aho-Corasick and the Wu-Manber algorithms were executed only once for multiple signatures by using the tables generated before the searching phase was begun.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Petroleum products, {{which are}} {{required}} to keep the 'wheels' of industry and commerce turning, are distributed from the various refineries to their destinations throughout the country {{on a daily basis}} and the mode and extent of transportation or conveyance of these products is varied. This distribution activity predominantly takes place by means of road tanker, pipeline as well as rail tanker and quantities during transit could vary from a few hundred litres to many thousands of litres per trip. Road tanker transportation is considered to be the most vulnerable form of distribution means and this poses a high risk in terms of the potential for being involved in an accident. The risk potential associated with the road transportation of these fuels, from an environmental point of view, is aggravated due to: *The conveyance of bulk loads, *non-roadworthiness of many vehicles, *inconsistency in vehicle condition <b>checking</b> systems <b>and</b> in the application of *safety systems, *poor road conditions, *driver fatigue, *hi-jacking threats, *the level of incompetence or unsuitability of drivers, *the inconsistency in driver training programs, *the vulnerability of the tankers being subject to collision and accidents. The potential exists for road tankers involved in accidents to leak or spill large quantities of petroleum products which in turn could result in catastrophic environmental consequences (such as leaking large quantities of fuel into sewers, plantations, rivers and streams thus causing much ground and water pollution). Also, during an accident the fuel leaking from a road tanker may ignite causing it to burn for several hours before it is finally brought under control and extinguished. This may result in much air pollution as well as damage to the surrounding ecological systems. Subsequent explosions could further result in severe loss of life and associated fires which in turn could cause more environmental degradation and damage. For the purpose of this dissertation, focus was specifically placed on the introduction of internal company control measures that a "supplier” company (such as Natref (Pty) Ltd) could implement to check whether petroleum product distributors are complying with predetermined criteria aimed at reducing the potential for accidents involving road tankers. The measuring of how these controls have an effect in the bigger scheme of things in terms of reducing accidents and environmental degradation was very difficult to determine because {{it was not possible to}} extract from the distributors how many of their vehicles were actually involved in incidents during the study period. As a result it was not possible to determine whether the improved control measures had an effect on the number of accidents incurred by the vehicles that were effected by the improved application of the standards. The study thus focused primarily on the effect that the implementation of an inspection system could have in progressively reducing the number of defects found on road tankers wanting to gain access to Natrefs site as well as measuring whether an improvement in compliance to standards actually took place. This study was conducted over a period of 22 months and involved the development and implementation of a new procedure and training course, implementation of an inspection checklist, improved reporting methods as well as improved the overall environmental awareness of the employees involved in the <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> process. It is however assumed that the implementation and ongoing enforcement of the company standards has assisted in contributing towards minimising the potential for pollution exposures arising from accidents and in so doing minimising environmental degradation to a larger or lesser extent.
