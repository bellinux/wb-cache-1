50|$|Evolutionary {{dynamics}} is {{the study}} of the mathematical principles according to which biological organisms as well as cultural ideas evolve, evolved, and continue to evolve. This is mostly achieved through the mathematical discipline of population genetics, along with evolutionary game theory. Most population genetics considers changes in the frequencies of alleles at a small number of gene loci. When infinitesimal effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, one derives quantitative genetics. Traditional population genetic models deal with alleles and genotypes, and are frequently stochastic. In evolutionary game theory, developed first by John Maynard Smith, evolutionary biology concepts may take a deterministic mathematical form, with selection acting directly on inherited phenotypes. These same models can be applied to studying the evolution of human preferences and ideologies. Many variants on these models have been developed, which incorporate weak selection, mutual population structure, stochasticity, etc. These models have relevance also to the generation and maintenance of tissues in mammals, since an understanding of tissue <b>cell</b> <b>kinetics,</b> architecture, and development from adult stem cells has important implications for aging and cancer.|$|E

To achieve a mechanistic interpretation of such toxic effects, the intricate coupling between <b>cell</b> growth <b>kinetics</b> and metal partitioning dynamics at the cell-solution interface over time {{must be considered}} on a quantitative level. A formalism is elaborated to evaluate cell-surface-bound, internalized, and extracellular metal fractions in the limit where metal uptake kinetics is controlled by internalization under noncomplexing medium conditions. <b>Cell</b> growth <b>kinetics</b> is tackled using the continuous logistic equation modified to include growth inhibition by metal accumulation to intracellular or cell surface sites. The theory further includes metal-proton competition for adsorption at cell-surface binding sites, as well as possible variation of cell size during exposure to metal ions. The formalism elucidates the dramatic impacts of initial cell concentration on metal bioavailability and toxicity over time, in agreement with reported algae bioassays. It further highlights that appropriate definition of toxicity endpoints requires careful inspection of the ratio between exposure time scale and time scale of metal depletion from bulk solution. The latter depends on metal internalization-excretion rate constants, microorganism growth, {{and the extent of}} metal adsorption on nonspecific, transporter, and growth inhibitory sites.

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>kinetics.</b> Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric <b>Cell</b> <b>Kinetics</b> (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their <b>cell</b> <b>kinetics</b> program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents. We are evaluating three agents, Wnt, IGF- 1, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). (cont.) Wnt has been found to cause self-renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro. IGF- 1 also plays a role in hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal in vivo as well as in tissue maturation. Shh has been implicated in the proliferation of primitive neural cells as well as in cellular proliferation during invertebrate development. Thus far, we have found that Wnt peptide shifts the <b>cell</b> <b>kinetics</b> from asymmetric to symmetric and may reduce the generation time, whereas IGF- 1 appears only to affect generation time. Studies involving Shh are currently underway. We are also currently investigating whether Wnt acts additively or synergistically with guanine nucleotide precursors to shift cell kinetic symmetry. Discovering new SACK agents will allow us to obtain purer populations of ASCs {{that can be used to}} study properties unique to stem cells. Furthermore, the observation that Wnt shifts the kinetics of adult rat hepatic stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric implicates the involvement of similar <b>cell</b> <b>kinetics</b> symmetry mechanisms in the proliferation effect of Wnt on murine and human HSCs. by Michal Ganz.
