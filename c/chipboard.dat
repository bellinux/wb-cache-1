40|$|One {{aim of the}} European {{collective}} research project called DIPP {{is the development of}} lightweight <b>chipboards</b> made from annual and perennial plants such as hemp, sunflower, topinambur, maize and miscanthus. These lightweight particle boards are intended to be a possible cheap substitution for traditional wood-based <b>chipboards</b> used in the furniture industry. Therefore the requirements of the EN 312 of boards for interior use e. g. furniture used in a dry environment have to be fulfilled. To produce lightweight boards, either low density particles can be used or alternatively large quantities of cavities have to be introduced into these boards. In this way some agricultural plants are most suitable for the production of lightweight <b>chipboards,</b> because the stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), maize (Zea maize) and topinambur (Helianthus tuberosus) are filled with natural foam, the parenchyma cells...|$|R
40|$|Emissions during thermal {{utilization}} of wood residues were studied at two small-scale firing systems. Effects of primary technical measures on reduction of NOx, CO, PCDD/F, and PAH {{were tested in}} the flue gases of an underfeed stoker (250 kW). The organic pollutants were also analyzed in the ashes. <b>Chipboards,</b> untreated wood, and wood with preservatives (CrCuB = CCB) were applied. It was shown that an optimization of the combustion parameters for low CO and NOx-emissions did not necessarily result in the reduction of PCDD/F and PAH. At the second furnace, a pre-oven system (65 kW), effects of full and part load operation were tested without technical modifications. Here, PCDD/F and PAH concentrations in ashes and flue gases mostly increased at part load operation. Due to the decreased temperatures, concentration of CO increased. Unexpectedly NOx increased at part load operation burning <b>chipboards.</b> Using wood, regardless of whether treated with CCB preservative or not, the load {{had no effect on}} the amount of the NOx emission...|$|R

40|$|To {{accurately}} {{model the}} effect on the dynamic behavior of a floor when using glue in the joints between the <b>chipboards</b> and beams in a lightweight structure can be a daunting task. It is however important to have a model that can simulate these junctions with high fidelity. The behavior of T-junctions with different geometries and methods of adhesion has been previously investigated via measurements [1]. This investigation builds on that work and aims at developing an accurate finite element model of the junctions. The previously investigated junctions were made of <b>chipboards</b> fixed to a spruce beam using screws or a combination of screws and glue. The boards were either a single plate or two plates meeting each other on top of the beam. In this investigation different approaches of simulating the junction using the finite element method were tried. The validity of the FE models was evaluated by calibrating them with previous performed measurements in [1]. A parameter study was also performed on the models to investigate the effect of the glue on the overall performance of the structure...|$|R

To have adequate protection against accidental fire, new assessing strategies on flame spread over construction and lining materials, especially those timber <b>chipboards</b> and plastic materials commonly used, should be developed. Full-scale burning tests have been identified for such purpose. However, many resources and relatively long testing time are required. These tests might not be suitable for product development, quality control, and more importantly, selection of appropriate materials. Smaller-scale tests are proposed and two candidates are the Single Burning Item test and the Reduced-scale Model Box test. In this article, these two tests will be reviewed for use in assessing flame spread over surface, lining, and partitions.

During the cutting speed are changed auxiliary movements to determine the influence of the machining parameters on cutting power. Overall, it was concluded that with increasing moisture content of the work-piece cutting power decreases with increasing velocity displacement, density and bending strength of the board, required cutting power increases...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the Swedish {{construction}} code {{introduced in}} 1994 enabled {{the construction of}} wooden multi-storey buildings. The main issue in those is disturbing vibrations and noise propagating throughout the construction. Therefore, gaining knowledge about their behavior is of crucial importance for the industry. In this study, a mockup of a wall/floor junction was investigated by comparing both experimental and simulation (FEM) results. The mockup resembles a section of a real wooden building. It is 9. 3 m long and 3. 6 m wide. The structure was built using wooden beams as load-bearing components and <b>chipboards</b> as the floor surface. Likewise, a gypsum wall {{was placed in the}} middle surrounded by a wooden frame. The reflection and transmission properties of the structure were studied when subjected to harmonic excitations. The junction has been studied experimentally using dual-axis accelerometers attached to the T junction, post-processing the data using the scattering matrix formulation, which allows separating the transmitted and reflected wave as the wave propagates towards the junction, as well as the rate of wave conversion.

40|$|Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{is an important}} topic in building acoustics measurements {{carried out in the}} field assessing the sound insulation between rooms as well as conducted in test stands characterizing the sound insulation properties of a building element accurately. Beyond measurement method related contributions to the uncertainty budget there is the variation of the sound insulation properties of the building element itself. According to several studies conducted in the past this uncertainty due to the building element properties can be of a significant quantity. The results of a recent study show that certain aspects of workmanship have significant influence on the sound insulation characteristics of light weight building elements, e. g. timber frame partitions. The method to fasten the planking (e. g. gypsum boards, gypsum fiber boards or <b>chipboards)</b> can lead to considerable variations regarding the sound insulation characteristics and thus to influence also the single values, with variations of the sound reduction index Rw of up to 10 dB. The mounting (i. e. the arrangement of the screws) has considerable influence on the sound insulation properties of this kind of partitions. The airborne sound insulation can be significantly influenced by the number of the screws and by the degree of how firmly they are fixed. The influence of construction details, workmanship, and suggestions how to face this problem will be discussed in the paper. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and <b>chipboards.</b> Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|R
