25|$|Historically, Karaites {{refrained from}} using or {{deriving}} benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit {{during the night}} of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction</b> that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Saakashvili took office, Georgia {{suffered}} from a stagnant economy, widespread corruption by police and state officials {{to the point where}} bribery was needed for any kind of <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction,</b> high crime rates, and severe infrastructure problems, including widespread power outages, and schools and medical facilities falling into disrepair. Saakashvili set out on a massive reform program. He systematically fired politicians, public officials, and police officers suspected of corruption and significantly raised the salaries of state employees {{to the point where they}} could depend on their salaries rather than bribes for a living. Many oligarchs who had dominated the economy were arrested, with most agreeing to pay massive fines into the state budget in exchange for their freedom. Saakashvili reformed the economy by cutting red tape which had made business difficult, courting foreign investment, simplifying the tax code, launching a privatization campaign, and tackling widespread tax evasion. Due to the establishment of a functioning taxation and customs infrastructure, the state budget increased by 300% within three years. The government massively upgraded infrastructure and public services. In particular, water and power infrastructure was improved to the point where it functioned effectively, schools and hospitals were renovated, more roads were laid, and new housing developments were built.|$|E

2500|$|William Harold Fenrick of Platteville, Wisconsin, legally {{changed his}} name to Andrew Jackson Griffith and ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Grant County in November 2006. Subsequently, actor Griffith filed a lawsuit against Griffith/Fenrick, asserting that he {{violated}} trademark, copyright, and privacy laws by changing his name for the [...] "sole purpose of taking advantage of Griffith's fame in an attempt to gain votes." [...] On May 4, 2007, US District Court Judge John C.

2500|$|The {{ministry}} {{also said}} that Nova failed {{to comply with a}} [...] "cooling-off" [...] system provided for in the specified <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction</b> law. Under this system, consumers can cancel a contract without conditions if the cancellation is made within eight days from when the contract was signed. At Nova, potential students first registered their name, address and other data before finalizing their contracts. An official application to the school was made several days later, after the details of the contract are decided upon. Nova told students who wanted to quit that they could not use the cooling-off system, claiming that the day students registered their data was {{the first day of the}} contract.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} locationof the Internet user, the user's {{counterparties}} in a <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction,</b> the headquarters facilities of any involved commercial entities, {{and even the}} servers and switchesis important for tax purposes. For example, of the nine U.S. states that currently tax access in some manner, four make reference to location. [...] In each case, both the provision of service and the billing must take place within the state. Connecticut places the burden of determining whether this is so upon the Internet service provider. But in general, there is no simple way to determine location, owing largely to the Internet's lack of boundaries. Users can and routinely do access their accounts from remote locations; providers are almost always located in multiple taxing jurisdictions; and the data traffic itself, via the Internet's packet-switched architecture, is routed through myriad locations. [...] Such issues are important not only for practical reasons of determining the incidence of the tax and its enforcement, {{but also because the}} U.S. Constitution requires that a state or taxing sub-jurisdiction have [...] "nexus" [...] with the transaction in order to exert its taxing power, and that determination rests precisely upon such considerations.|$|E

2500|$|Octavian has {{similarities}} {{with the}} Middle English Breton lays and is imbued, {{like much of}} medieval romance, with the characteristics of folktale and myth. It is also a family romance, and “nurture is a particularly important theme in Octavian's treatment of the family.” [...] But like many other Middle English verse romances, its displays a flexible style {{during the course of}} its story, beginning in this case as a tale of suffering and endurance in a similar vein to the 12th-century Latin “Constance saga” from which the 14th century Middle English tale of Emaré and Geoffrey Chaucer's story of Constance derive, but ending in the more heroic vein of a chanson de geste. The middle of the romance is almost a burlesque comedy between Florent and his father Clement who, “obsessed with merchandise, is the great comic character of the romance, and he fights a long and losing battle against the boy's inability to extract the smallest financial advantage from any <b>commercial</b> <b>transaction</b> entrusted to him." [...] It is not common for the mercantile classes to be given a major role in medieval romance and “its treatment of social class distinguishes Octavian from other similar Middle English romances.” ...|$|E
