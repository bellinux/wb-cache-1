40|$|The {{microbubble}} ozonation {{was used}} to treat acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R wastewater in order to investigate the influencing factors on its performance. The effects of ozone dose, initial acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R concentration and activated carbon {{on the performance of}} microbubble ozonation treatment of acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R wastewater are investigated. The decolorization rate, TOC removal rate, pH variation and ozone utilization efficiency in the microbubble ozonation treatment are compared under different treatment conditions. The results indicate that when increasing ozone dose or decreasing initial acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R concentration, both decolorization rate and TOC removal rate of acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R wastewater increase, but ozone utilization efficiency decreases. The coal-based activated carbon shows strong catalytic activity for microbubble ozonation, which could enhance the decolorization rate and TOC removal rate of acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R wastewater. The better performance of microbubble ozonation treatment is achieved when the ozone dose is 48. 3 mg/min and the initial acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R mass concentration is 100 mg/L. Under these conditions, the decolorization efficiency reaches to 100 % after treatment for 30 min, the TOC removal efficiency reaches to 78. 0 % after treatment for 120 min, the reaction rate constant of TOC removal is 0. 015 min- 1 and the ozone utilization efficiency is higher than 99 %. With addition of the coal-based activated carbon of 5 g/L, the decolorization efficiency reaches to 100 % after treatment for 15 min, the TOC removal efficiency reaches to 91. 2 % after treatment for 120 min and the reaction rate constant of TOC removal increases to 0  037 min- 1 . The accumulation and following degradation of intermediate products of small molecule organic acid happens during treatment process, and as a result, the solution pH decreases initially and then increases. Therefore, the optimization of influencing factors for microbubble ozonation could increase both contaminant removal rate and ozone utilization efficiency, and then improve treatment performance significantly...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is unknown}} if dietary {{recommendations}} for cancer prevention are {{applicable to the}} elderly. We analyzed WCRF/AICR recommendations in cohorts of European and US adults aged 60 years and above. METHODS: Individual participant data meta-analysis including 362, 114 participants (43 % women), from seven prospective cohort studies, free from cancer at enrollment. The WCRF/AICR diet score was based on: 1) energy-dense foods and sugary drinks, 2) plant <b>foods,</b> <b>3)</b> <b>red</b> and processed meat 4) alcoholic drinks. Cox proportional hazards regression {{was used to examine}} the association between the diet score and cancer risks. Adjusted, cohort-specific hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk Advancement Periods (RAP) were calculated to quantify the time period by which the risk of cancer was postponed among those adhering to the recommendations. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11 to 15 years across cohorts, 69, 708 cancer cases were identified. Each one-point increase in the WCRF/AICR diet score [range 0 (no) to 4 (complete adherence) ] was significantly associated with a lower risk of total cancer (HR: 0. 94, 95 % CI: 0. 92 - 0. 97), cancers of the colorectum (HR: 0. 84, 95 % CI: 0. 80 - 0. 89), prostate (HR: 0. 94, 95 % CI: 0. 92 - 0. 97), but not breast or lung. Adherence to an additional component of the WCRF/AICR diet score significantly postponed the incidence of cancer at any site by 1. 6 years (RAP: - 1. 6, 95 % CI: - 4. 09 to - 2. 16). CONCLUSION: Adherence to WCRF/AICR dietary recommendations is associated with lower risk of cancer among older adults. IMPACT: Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention are applicable to the elderly...|$|R

The adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch process to observe the effect of various parameters such as contact time, dose of flocculent HA, ionic strength (NaCl) as well as adsorption kinetics and isotherm. Results showed that adsorption of acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R on flocculent HA could reach equilibrium at less than 180 min. The adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second order model (R 2 = 0. 994). The adsorption was described with Freundlich equation {{on the basis of}} value of regression coefficient (R 2 = 0. 984). The removal rate of the dye increased with the increase of the dose of flocculent HA, while it decreased with the addition of NaCl in the aqueous solution. These suggested that the adsorption mechanism was the electrostatic attraction, to form hydrogen bonds, and van der waals’ force between molecules of HA and acid <b>red</b> <b>3</b> R.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} rough set, {{proposed}} by Pawlak, provides a formal tool for knowledge discovery from imprecise and incomplete data. Dimensionality reduction (RED) {{is a crucial}} problem for rough set based data mining. Unfortunately, it proves to be a NP-hard problem. Many reduction algorithms based on heuristic information have been developed, but they are all based on Boolean space { 0, 1 } m. In this paper, we introduce the Universal RED problem model, or UniRED, which transforms the discrete attributes reduction problems on Boolean space { 0, 1 } m into continuous global optimization problems on real space E m. Based on this transformation, we develop coordinate gradient descent algorithm RED 2. 1, and coordinate direct descent algorithm <b>RED</b> <b>3.</b> 1 for attributes reduction problems. In order to investigate the robustness and efficiency of proposed algorithms, we execute our algorithm <b>RED</b> <b>3.</b> 1 on problems from UCI.

40|$|Tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV) is {{a serious}} viral infection that affects the central nervous system. It was estimated that between 1990 and 2009 a total of 169, 937 cases of TBE were recorded in Europe. TBEV belongs to genus Flavivirus that comprises over 70 viruses, {{many of them are}} important human pathogens. Most members are either transmitted by mosquitoes e. g. West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV) or ticks e. g. TBEV. Due to the extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses serological diagnosis of TBE infections is commonly difficult in areas where more than one virus type circulates. Particularly, a situation now exists in Europe, where TBEV and WNV are endemic in many countries Thus, this thesis focused on the one hand on optimization of serological test systems using recombinant envelope protein domain III (<b>rED</b> <b>3).</b> It represents domain 3 of the major antigen, the surface protein E, which additionally has been shown to induce flavivirus specific neutralizing antibodies. Therefore <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> was expressed and purified and its application as antigen in ELISA for TBEV diagnosis was verified. On the other hand a memory B-cell assay was established to analyse antiviral immunity after TBEV-vaccination. Here <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> was used as antigen to determine the frequency of <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing TBE disease and is currently recommended for all those who live and work or travel to areas of TBE endemicity. An essential requirement of any vaccine is the induction of long-term protective immunity. Several vaccines have deﬁned levels of serum antibody (as measured by ELISA, haemagglutination inhibition test, or neutralisation test) that serve as correlates or surrogates of protective immunity. But this does not take account of vaccine induced memory B cells. Although, not providing direct protection against infection, they represent an important second line of immune defence that is initiated only if pre existing antibody levels are too low to prevent infection or if the invading pathogen is able to circumvent the pre-existing antibody response. A thorough understanding of the frequencies of antigen-speciﬁc memory B cells and their relationship with the antibodies in serum serological memory is likely to be critical to give information about the long-term efficacy of vaccine as well as its correlates of protection. This thesis focuses on the establishment of a recombinant protein based ELISA and of a memory B cell assay for analysis of specific antiviral immunity after vaccination with the following two objectives: (1) Expression and purification of recombinant envelope protein domain <b>3</b> (<b>rED</b> <b>3)</b> and verification of its application as antigen in ELISA for TBEV diagnosis; (2) Establishment of a memory B cells assay using <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> for determination of frequency of <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in individuals vaccinated against TBE. In this study, TBEV- and WNV-speciﬁc antigen ED 3 was expressed in E. coli as MBP fusion proteins with C-terminal histidine tag using pMAL-c 2 x vector. By purification with amylose affinity chromatography followed by nickel affinity chromatography, highly purified TBEV <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> and WNV-rED 3 were obtained. Nevertheless, using TBEV-rED 3 protein in Western Blot unspecific reaction with serum antibodies of negative serum was detected and a differentiation between WNV infection and TBEV was impossible, probably due to the MBP moiety. However, using the purified <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> protein as antigen in ELISA, TBE virus-speciﬁc antibodies were detected specifically. Twenty-three serum samples predefined as TBEV positive were tested positive by <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based ELISA and commercial IgG ELISA. Five predefined negative serum samples were tested negative by <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based IgG ELISA as well as commercial IgG ELISA. But cross reactivity of WNV and DENV positive sera was detected in 15 of 18 sera by commercial ELISA. On the other hand, these samples were found negative in TBEV <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based ELISA. Thus, TBEV-rED 3 -based ELISA allows a differentiation of infections caused by TBE serogroup and mosquito-borne flaviviruses but not the inactivated virus based commercial ELISA. Interestingly, compared to neutralisation test the specificity of <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based ELISA obtained 100 % with a sensitivity of 91. 6 %. In contrast, the commercial ELISA obtained 100 % sensitivity but a low specificity with only 42. 8 %. In order to determine frequency of antigen-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) produced by individuals who received the vaccination against TBE, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples. Subsequently, memory B cells were activated with R 848 (Resiquimod) and human recombinant IL- 2 (hrIL- 2) for 72 hours in 37 °C, 5 % CO 2, 90 % humidity. After 72 hours of incubation, Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISPOT) detected antigen-specific memory B cells. In order to evaluate specificity of TBEV-rED 3 in ELISPOT, other antigens including WNV-rED 3, Maltose binding protein (MBP) and Influenza Nucleoprotein (NP) were included. Study subjects could be separated into two groups: last vaccination before 5 years or longer than 10 years. TBEV-rED 3 speciﬁc ASCs could be detected in 11 of 12 TBE vaccinated individuals with different vaccination history and even low serum anti-TBE antibodies levels. TBEV-rED 3 specific ASCs were found with frequency of ranging 0. 016 - 0. 188 % per total IgG ASCs and lower than frequency of Influenza-NP specific ASCs (between 0. 012 - 0. 51 %). But TBE-specific memory B cells could be maintained for more than 20 years of post-vaccination. There was a significant difference in number of ASCs between vaccinated and non-vaccinated group (p 10 years (mean of 16. 5 years) since vaccination (p> 0. 05). These finding proved that memory B cells have been stable for years and are maintained up to 25 years since last vaccination. A statistic analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant correlation between serum levels of anti-TBEV antibodies and the frequency of <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> specific IgG ASCs (p> 0. 05, Spearman’s coefficient r = 0. 36). A similar result was also indicated for influenza-vaccinated individuals (p> 0. 05, Spearman’s coefficient r = 0. 27). These findings revealed that memory B cells and plasma cells maybe play an independently role in maintaining of immunological memory. Anyway, neutralizing antibodies have been found in all vaccines (a Geometric mean titre (GMT) of 96. 04, 95 % confident interval (CI) : 52. 76 - 174. 8) and thus were maintained for a long time since last vaccination. Interestingly, the quantitative determination of specific IgG in TBE post-vaccination sera by <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based ELISA exhibits a good correlation with neutralizing antibody titres. The presence of specific antibodies in <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> -based ELISA is therefore highly predictive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies, and this correlation can probably be used in the future to establish guidelines for recommendations of booster vaccinations. Additionally, it became apparent that the number of previous booster vaccinations correlated strongly with the frequency of circulating memory B cells. As expected, individuals who received a booster increased both the specific antibody titre and frequency of antigen specific memory B cells. This suggests that immunological long-term memory induced by booster immunizations is better reflected by the circulating memory B cells than the amount of the antibody titre. Thus, memory B cells seem to be a more reliable parameter for the assessment of long-term immunity. Taken together, a highly antigenic <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> using the bacterial expression system was produced and it is a promising alternative to whole inactivated virus in ELISA. Notably, <b>rED</b> <b>3</b> was a reliable antigen for detecting antigen-specific memory B cells in individuals who have been previously TBEV vaccinated. This study provides data on immunological memory for TBE vaccination and might be useful for reconsideration of recommendations for booster dose. In conclusion, boosters of vaccination should be recommended for all individuals who live and work or travel to areas of TBE endemicity. As consequently, vaccine-induced protection is enhanced by both strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. If pace of pathogenesis is rapidly growing, pre-existing virus-specific antibodies represent the first line of defence against infection before the memory response is fully activated and implemented. They clearly function best together to efficiently protect against disease...|$|R
