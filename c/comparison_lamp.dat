This study {{has determined that}} this instrument is capable of being used for scientific research. A <b>comparison</b> <b>lamp</b> box was built {{to be used in}} conjunction with the spectrograph. A test was conducted to determine the accuracy of the grating positioning micrometer. A chart was created to allow the conversion of the micrometer readings to correlate with the position of the low-dispersion grating. To determine the scientific applicability of the spectrograph, it was used to: (1) measure the expansion rate of Nova Sagittarius 2004, (2) look for a 13. 9 -minute periodicity in the width and position of the H-alpha line of the binary star system X Persei, and (3) to measure the Doppler shift of X Persei.

50|$|By <b>comparison,</b> {{incandescent}} <b>lamps</b> have a brief warm-up when energized, {{followed by}} a cool-down period when power is removed. These delays result in smearing and blurring of detail of objects partially illuminated during the warm-up and cool-down periods.

40|$|Rapid {{identification}} of Campylobacter-positive flocks before slaughter, following freezing and heat {{treatment for the}} Campylobacter-positive carcasses at the slaughterhouses is an effective control strategy against foodborne campylobacteriosis. We evaluated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the direct screening of naturally contaminated chicken cloacal swabs for Campylobacter jejuni/Campylobacter coli to compare this assay with conventional quantitative culture methods. In a comparison study of 165 broilers, the LAMP assay showed 82. 8 % (48 / 58 by conventional culture) sensitivity, 100 % (107 / 107) specificity, 100 % (48 / 48) positive predictive value (PPV), and 91. 5 % (107 / 117) negative predictive value (NPV). In a comparison of 55 flocks, LAMP showed 90. 5 % (19 / 21) sensitivity, 100 % (34 / 34) specificity, 100 % (19 / 19) PPV, and 94. 4 % (34 / 36) NPV. In the cumulative total of 28 farm-level <b>comparisons,</b> <b>LAMP</b> showed 100 % (12 / 12) sensitivity, 100 % (16 / 16) specificity, 100 % (12 / 12) PPV, and 100 % (16 / 16) NPV. The LAMP assay required less than 90 min from {{the arrival of the}} fecal samples to final results in the laboratory. This suggests that the LAMP assay will facilitate the {{identification of}} C. jejuni/C. coli-positive broiler flocks at the farm level or in slaughterhouses before slaughtering, which would make it an effective tool in preventing the spread of Campylobacter contamination...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} and optical {{characteristics of a}} dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) based neon excimer lamp generating output in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral range (λ= 84 nm) have been investigated experimentally. We report a detailed <b>comparison</b> of <b>lamp</b> performance for both pulsed and sinusoidal voltage excitation waveforms, using otherwise identical operating conditions. The results show that pulsed voltage excitation yields a ~ 50 % increase in the overall electrical to EUV conversion efficiency compared with sinusoidal waveforms, when operating in the pressure range 500 – 900 mbar. Pulsed operation allows greater control of parameters associated with the temporal evolution of the EUV pulse shapes (risetime, instantaneous peak power). The Ne DBD based source is also found to be highly monochromatic with respect to its spectral output from the second continuum band at λ ~ 84 nm (5 nm FWHM). This continuum band dominates the spectral emission over the wavelength range 30 – 550 nm.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has examined the}} effect of the spectral power distribution of a light source upon the perception of interior spaces, noting that this can significantly affect brightness. It is expected that the impact of lamp spectrum on the brightness/illuminance relationship in these tests would be affected by chromatic adaptation. Three methods for assessing brightness were examined: side-by-side; rapid sequential; and individual presentation. The effect of lamp spectrum on brightness is attenuated with greater chromatic adaptation but it is not eliminated for every <b>lamp</b> <b>comparison</b> even after long-term adaptation. Thus to determine whether the effect of lamp spectrum on brightness is significant for the occupants of a building the lighting designer must question whether the occupant’s first impression or long-term impression of the lighting is more important. 1...|$|R

40|$|Loop {{mediated}} isothermal amplification (LAMP) is {{a highly}} efficient, selective and rapid DNA amplification technique for genetic screening of pathogens. However, despite its popularity, there is yet no mathematical model to quantify the outcome and no well-defined metric for comparing results that are available. LAMP is intrinsically complex and involves multiple pathways for gene replication, making fundamental modelling nearly intractable. To circumvent this difficulty, an alternate, empirical model is introduced that will allow one to extract a set of parameters from the concentration versus time curves. A simple recipe to deduce the time to positive, Tp- a parameter analogous to the threshold cycling time in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is also provided. These parameters {{can be regarded as}} objective and unambiguous indicators of LAMP amplification. The model is exemplified on Escherichia coli strains by using the two gene fragments responsible for vero-toxin (VT) production and tested against VT-producing (O 157 and O 45) and non-VT producing (DH 5 alpha) strains. Selective amplification of appropriate target sequences was made using well established LAMP primers and protocols, and the concentrations of the amplicons were measured using a Qubit 2. 0 fluorometer at specific intervals of time. The data is fitted to a generalized logistic function. Apart from providing precise screening indicators, representing the data with a small set of numbers offers significant advantages. It facilitates <b>comparisons</b> of <b>LAMP</b> reactions independently of the sampling technique. It also eliminates subjectivity in interpretation, simplifies data analysis, and allows easy dat...|$|R

40|$|A new {{analytical}} portable {{system is}} {{proposed for the}} direct determination of benzene vapor in the ambient air and natural gas, using differential absorption spectrometry with the direct Zeeman effect and innovative radiation sources: capillary mercury lamps with different isotopic compositions (196 Hg, 198 Hg, 202 Hg, 204 Hg, and natural isotopic mixture). Resonance emission of mercury at a wavelength of 254 nm is used as probing radiation. The differential cross section of benzene absorption in dependence on wavelength is determined by scanning of magnetic field. It is found that the sensitivity of benzene detection is enhanced three times using lamp with the mercury isotope 204 Hg in <b>comparison</b> with <b>lamp,</b> filled with the natural isotopic mixture. It is experimentally demonstrated that, when benzene content is measured at the Occupational Exposure Limit (3. 2 mg/m 3 for benzene) level, the interference from SO 2, NO 2, O 3, H 2 S and toluene can be neglected if concentration of these gases does not exceed corresponding Occupational Exposure Limits.

25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A <b>comparison</b> of incandescent <b>lamp</b> operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.|$|R

Department of Energy (DOE), to {{quantify}} the impacts of LED lamps, incandescent lamps and fluorescent benchmark lamps over a product lifecycle – i. e. to develop a sustainable design and manufacturing strategy that addresses product manufacturing, use, recycling and disposal scenarios for LED-based lighting. Based on the knowledge gained from extensive product tear-down studies of fluorescent and screw-in lighting products, lifecycle assessment tools, and accelerated lifecycle testing protocols, an interactive Sustainable LED Design Guide has been developed to aid architectural and lighting designers and engineers in making design decisions that consider three important environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and mercury emission) across all phases {{of the life of}} an LED lighting product. Critical information developed for the lifecycle analysis and product feature comparisons is the useful life of the lighting product as well as its performance. The Design Guide is available at www. ncms. org, and was developed based on operational and durability testing of a variety of lighting products including power consumption, light output, and useful life of a lamp in order to allow a more realistic <b>comparison</b> of <b>lamp</b> designs.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how sensitizer doping improves the color purity and emission stability {{of a red}} organic light-emitting diode (OLED). A device with an MADN–Alq 3 co-host emission layer was fabricated. From electroluminescence (EL) measurements, it was found {{not only that the}} residual emission from Alq 3 affected the emission color and emission stability of the device but also that the residual Alq 3 emission was reduced by the addition of Rubrene and C 6 sensitizers. Rubrene doping increased both the luminance intensity and current density of the device by a factor of 2. 0, whereas C 6 doping increased the luminance intensity by a factor of 1. 3 and the current density by a factor of 1. 2. When the current density was increased from 10 to 132 mA/cm 2, the decrease in EL efficiency was less than 10. 8 %. The variations (x,y) in the CIE coordinates were (0. 02, 0. 01) for the device doped with Rubrene and (0. 01, 0. 01) for that doped with C 6. The maximum EL efficiency was 5. 28 cd/A, and the CIE coordinates were (0. 63, 0. 36). © 2011 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 046112 jes] All rights reserved.

40|$|As {{with key}} {{photometric}} measurements, such as lumen output and efficacy, life calculations for LED light sources and conventional light sources differ considerably. Reliable comparisons between conventional and LED light sources require {{an understanding of}} these differences, and often involve some analysis of reported figures. While life testing might appear to be as straightforward as turning a unit on and seeing how long it lasts, measurement and evaluation are not so simple, especially for LED light sources. Today, life testing methods for conventional light sources — incandescents, fluorescents, high-intensity discharge lamps, low-pressure sodium lamps, and so on — are well established and well understood. The life testing method for LED light sources is relatively new and less well understood. This technical brief explains how to interpret useful life calculations for LED sources and LEDs sources incorporated into lighting fixtures, and suggests a method for making accurate <b>comparisons</b> between conventional <b>lamps</b> and LED lighting fixtures. The 200 -year-old steeple of the First Baptist Church in Beverly, Massachusetts was illuminated with incandescent floodlights, which have a rated life of around 2, 000 hours. At about six hours of use per day, the lamps burned out within a year. Since the lamps could only be replaced every seven or eight years, when scaffolding was in place for painting, the steeple was usually dark. In 2009, the steeple was renovated, and LED lighting fixtures from Philips Color Kinetics were installed. With useful life of about 50, 000 hours, these fixtures can deliver high-intensity light for over 20 years at current usage, ensuring that the steeple is continuously and brilliantly illuminated.

The reaction is carried out at 65 °C during 40 minutes. Calcein allows direct detection of amplified products with the naked eye. Inclusivity and selectivity were tested in purified DNA from Trypanosoma cruzi stocks belonging to the six discrete typing units (DTUs), in DNA from other protozoan parasites and in human DNA. Analytical sensitivity was estimated in serial dilutions of DNA samples from Sylvio X 10 (Tc I) and CL Brener (Tc VI) stocks, as well as from EDTA-treated or heparinized blood samples spiked with known amounts of cultured epimastigotes (CL Brener). LAMP sensitivity was compared after DNA extraction using commercial fiberglass columns or after "Boil & Spin" rapid preparation. Moreover, the same DNA and EDTA-blood spiked samples were subjected to standardized qPCR based on the satellite DNA sequence for comparative purposes. A panel of peripheral blood specimens belonging to Chagas disease patients, including acute, congenital, chronic and reactivated cases (N = 23), as well as seronegative controls (N = 10) were evaluated by <b>LAMP</b> in <b>comparison</b> to qPCR. <b>LAMP</b> was able to amplify DNAs from T. cruzi stocks representative of the six DTUs, whereas it did not amplify DNAs from Leishmania sp, T. brucei sp, T. rangeli KPN+ and KPN-, P. falciparum and non-infected human DNA. Analytical sensitivity was 1 x 10 - 2 fg/μL of both CL Brener and Sylvio X 10 DNAs, whereas qPCR detected up to 1 x 10 - 1 fg/μL of CL Brener DNA and 1 fg/μl of Sylvio X 10 DNA. LAMP detected 1 x 10 - 2 parasite equivalents/mL in spiked EDTA blood and 1 x 10 - 1 par. eq/mL in spiked heparinized blood using fiberglass columns for DNA extraction, whereas qPCR detected 1 x 10 - 2 par. eq. /mL in EDTA blood.
