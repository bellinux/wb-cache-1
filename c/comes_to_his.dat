25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the events}} of the Onslaught saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the Hulk and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two {{separate}} entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards' pocket universe. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk's nexus-energy to overcome the Celestials.

The New World Order in turn set the Juggernaut and the Absorbing Man against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> senses after injuring his friend, Rick Jones. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology.
