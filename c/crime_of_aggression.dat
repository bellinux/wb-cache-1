25|$|On December 14, 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 3314, which {{defined the}} <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> This {{definition}} is not binding as such under international law, {{though it may}} reflect customary international law.|$|E
25|$|Some pacifists and multilateralists are {{in favor}} of {{international}} criminal law as means to prevent and control international aggression. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over war crimes, but the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> has yet to be clearly defined in international law.|$|E
5000|$|The Court may {{exercise}} jurisdiction {{only with}} respect to <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> committed {{one year after the}} ratification or acceptance of the amendments by thirty States Parties.|$|R
50|$|While the {{amendments}} {{will come into}} force one year after being ratified, the amended text says that only <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> committed one year or more after the thirtieth ratification are within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court. Furthermore, a decision is to be taken by the Assembly of States Parties with a two-thirds majority vote after 1 January 2017 to actually exercise jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|The Review Conference {{considered}} {{amendments to}} the Rome Statute and the Statute made specific reference to reviewing the list <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> within the court's jurisdiction. The final resolution when the Rome Statute was signed specifically recommended that the review should reconsider including drug trafficking and terrorism in the list <b>of</b> <b>crimes,</b> and also agreeing on a definition <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> so that the court can exercise its jurisdiction over this crime.|$|R
25|$|The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court {{refers to}} the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> {{as one of the}} “most serious crimes of concern to the {{international}} community”, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, the Rome Statute stipulates that the ICC may not exercise its jurisdiction over the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted. At the Review Conference in June 11, 2010 a total of 111 State Parties to the Court agreed by consensus to adopt a resolution accepting the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime. The relevant amendments to the Statute, however has not been entered into force yet as of May 14, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court {{lists the}} <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> {{as one of}} the most serious crimes of concern to the {{international}} community, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute states that [...] "The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations." [...] The Assembly of States Parties of the ICC adopted such a definition at the 2010 Kampala Review Conference.|$|E
50|$|Atrocity crimes {{refer to}} the three legally defined {{international}} <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> genocide, war <b>crimes,</b> and crimes against humanity. In 2017 the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be deciding upon {{whether or not to}} include <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> within their jurisdiction; effectively adding a fourth atrocity crime. These crimes are defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment <b>of</b> the <b>Crime</b> <b>of</b> Genocide, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 Additional Protocols, and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{range of}} fact-finding {{procedures}} in the United Nations relating to serious {{violations of human rights}} and humanitarian law, as well as fact-finding on the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> genocide, war <b>crimes</b> and crimes against humanity which is carried out by the International Criminal Court. Professor Lyal S. Sunga discusses how UN human rights special procedures fact-finding can help the International Criminal Court find facts and how the two should be made complementary.|$|R
50|$|The {{right of}} conquest {{is the right}} of a conqueror to {{territory}} taken by force of arms. It was traditionally a principle of international law that has gradually given way in modern times until its proscription after World War II when the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> war <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> was first codified in the Nuremberg Principles and then finally, in 1974, as a United Nations resolution 3314.|$|R

2500|$|The International Criminal Court is a {{permanent}} tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> The Court has jurisdiction if a situation is referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council. As of May 2013, 122 states have [...] ratified or acceded to the Rome Statute that established the Court, but the PRC {{is not one of}} them. The PRC, as well its neighbouring rival India, has been critical of the Court.|$|E
2500|$|Established in The Hague in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an {{international}} tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court signed in 1998. [...] Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute {{was rejected by the}} signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC. [...] This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).|$|E
50|$|The Court's {{subject-matter}} jurisdiction means the crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted. Individuals {{can only be}} prosecuted for crimes that {{are listed in the}} Statute. The primary crimes are listed in article 5 of the Statute and defined in later articles: genocide (defined in article 6), crimes against humanity (defined in article 7), war crimes (defined in article 8), and <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> (defined in article 8 bis) (which is not yet within the jurisdiction of the Court; see below). In addition, article 70 defines offences against the administration of justice, which are also crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted.|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} dual {{conceptualization}} <b>of</b> violent <b>crime.</b> Since violent crime is both violence and <b>crime,</b> theories <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> and deviance {{are required to}} understand it. I argue that both harm-doing and rule breaking are instrumental behaviors and that a bounded rational choice approach can account for both behaviors. However, {{while some of the}} causes of harm-doing and deviance (and violent and nonviolent crime) are the same, some are different. Theories <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and deviance cannot explain why one only observes individual and group differences in violent <b>crime</b> and theories <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> and violence cannot explain why one observes differences in all types <b>of</b> <b>crimes.</b> Such theories are &ldquo;barking up the wrong tree. &rdquo...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{years of}} {{negotiations}} aimed at establishing a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals accused of genocide and other serious international crimes, such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the recently defined <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> the United Nations General Assembly convened a five-week diplomatic conference in Rome in June 1998 [...] "to finalize and adopt a convention on {{the establishment of}} an international criminal court". [...] On 17 July 1998, the Rome Statute was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining. The seven countries that voted against the treaty were Iraq, Israel, Libya, China, Qatar, Yemen, and the United States.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2006, Luis Moreno Ocampo, {{the lead}} {{prosecutor}} for the International Criminal Court, {{reported that he}} had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion. In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> because no provision had yet been adopted which [...] "defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it." [...] In a March 2007 interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.|$|E
50|$|Amendments on the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> {{were adopted}} on 11 June 2010 at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala, Uganda. The {{amendments}} were proposed by Liechtenstein, which chaired the Special Working Group on the <b>Crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aggression,</b> the committee {{directed by the}} Assembly of States Parties to form a definition for the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> which was originally absent from the Statute.|$|E
50|$|The International Criminal Court (Cour Pénale Internationale; {{commonly}} referred to as the ICC or ICCt) is a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> (although it cannot currently exercise jurisdiction over the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{invasion}} of Iraq was neither in self-defense against armed attack nor sanctioned by UN Security Council resolution authorizing {{the use of}} force by member states and thus constituted the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> war <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> according to the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in Geneva. A [...] "war waged without a clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council would constitute a flagrant violation of the prohibition of {{the use of force}}”. We note with “deep dismay that a small number of states are poised to launch an outright illegal {{invasion of}} Iraq, which amounts to a war of aggression”.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, King was {{a member}} of the American Bar Association Task Force on War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia. He {{subsequently}} influenced the charter of the International Criminal Court. When delegates from 131 nations established the criminal court in 1998, they did not initially include initiating wars <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> as a war crime. With Whitney Harris and Benjamin Ferencz, two of the other prosecutors from Nuremberg, King traveled to the convention in Rome to successfully lobby for the court's jurisdiction over the instigators of such wars. Michael Scharf described their role in Rome: [...] "They used their moral authority; they were persistent, and ultimately the delegates included a reference to the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> war <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> in the court’s statute.” ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} crimes against {{humanity}} and war crimes {{in the practice of}} the International Criminal Court, an institution established to prosecute the most serious <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> concern to the international community as a whole (which include, in addition to the two types mentioned above, genocide and <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression).</b> Prosecution <b>of</b> these <b>crimes</b> changed significantly from the military tribunals following World War II to the ad hoc tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and finally to the International Criminal Court, which was created as a permanent international institution in 1998 at the Rome Conference and became operational in 2002 after its Statute reached the required number of ratifications. The aim of this thesis is to introduce how {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes have been conceived in the practice of the International Criminal Court with respect to the development of their concept and prosecution by the previous criminal tribunals. The thesis is divided into three main chapters. In the first one, I introduce the topic, specifically the development of the idea to establish a permanent international criminal tribunal as well as its eventual establishment. Furthermore, the first chapter also includes a theoretical introduction to the jurisdiction of the International [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Social Work {{professionals}} are recognizing the problematic trend among young offenders {{who have a}} history of being cruel to animals. A sample of 118 files from a youth serving agency were examined to determine the potential relationships between demographics and background variables, selected items from the Child Behavior checklist (Achenbach, 1991), types <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> and styles <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> and animal cruelty. Reported styles <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> consisted <b>of</b> proactive <b>aggression</b> (violent youth who planned their offences) and reactive aggression (youth who commit less serious crimes and would overreact to problems). In a stepwise regression analysis of a theoretical model, two significant predictors of cruelty toward animals were found: (1) the youths' history <b>of</b> proactive <b>aggression</b> and (2) youths' exposure to physical abuse, this latter both directly, and also as a significant predictor <b>of</b> proactive <b>aggression.</b> Further education and training for children, caregivers and professionals is needed to increase awareness of the link between animal cruelty and human violence...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{contribution}} is Article 1 (F) (a), {{a section of the}} exclusion clause that has increased in both use and profile in recent years. Article 1 (F) (a) applies to individuals who may be implicated in crimes against peace (more commonly known today as <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression),</b> war <b>crimes,</b> or crimes against humanity as such crimes are defined in relevant international instruments. Where a decision maker finds that “there are serious reasons for considering that” an asylum seeker has committed one of these acts, the remainder of the Refugee Convention does not apply, and any protections to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled are consequently unavailable. Article 1 (F) (a) is a particularly important part of the exclusion clause because it applies to those who have committed acts so wrongful that the international community has agreed to standards of universal applicability. It is a provision committed to ensuring that perpetrators of the worst international crimes do not subsequently benefit from the robust international protections available to refugees. The 2013 Michigan Colloquium on Challenges in International Refugee Law brought together experts committed to articulating a principled approach to exclusion under Article 1 (F) (a). This paper was drafted as the background study for that meeting and was designed to provide general principles for study and debate. In particular, the paper calls for a revised paradigm for determining when an asylum seeker ought to be denied protection on the basis {{that he or she is}} individually responsible for the international crimes listed in Article 1 (F) (a) ...|$|R

40|$|The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) {{permits the}} ICC to {{exercise}} subject-matter jurisdiction over individuals {{who engage in}} war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggression.</b> However, under Article 13, the ICC may only exercise personal jurisdiction over persons referred by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or over nationals of a state party, or persons whose alleged criminal conduct occurred on the territory of a state party This article evaluates the interplay between principles of public international law and international criminal law in determining whether the ICC’s grant of jurisdiction under the Rome Statute is performed {{within the limits of}} international law when exercised against non-party nationals. The importance of this inquiry is ever-increasing in light of greater and more expansive breaches of international humanitarian law in the modern world, committed by nations and individuals who have refused to become parties to the Rome Statute. This paper suggests that the ICC’s grant of authority to exercise jurisdiction over non-state nationals is consistent with customary norms of international law, even where the state of nationality has not consented to the Court’s jurisdiction. This paper concludes that the ICC was established to prevent impunity by reinvigorating national institutions. It is the culmination of historical lessons that teach against non-cooperation. The Nuremburg and Tokyo tribunals along with the tribunals in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were built for the precise purpose <b>of</b> accounting for <b>crimes</b> which transcend national borders. Objections to the Rome Statute, based on national interests and sovereignty fail in light <b>of</b> the <b>crimes</b> sought to be prevented by an International Criminal Court. Without the safety net provided by international cooperation and prevention <b>of</b> <b>crimes,</b> the world risks facing the dangers it promised “never again. ...|$|R
40|$|The Principles <b>of</b> {{legality}} in <b>crimes</b> and punishments {{refer to}} the fact that an act is not considered a crime and deserves no punishment, until the legislator determines and announces thecriminal title and its penalty. In Iranian legal system, before the Islamic Revolution and also after it, the Constitution and ordinary laws have explicitly emphasized the observance of the mentionedprinciple. When there is no text {{or in the case of}} the silence or lack of law, the criminal judge is bound to issue the verdict of innocence. According to the Rome statute the court shall exercisejurisdiction over the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggressions</b> once a provision is adopted. And, according to the article 121 and 123 defending the crime and setting out, the condition under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to crimes such as provision shall be consisted of the head of the general principle the relevant provision of the charter of the United Nations. The principle of legality is set out in article 22 to 24 of the ICC statute. These norms are derived from the customary law and the national law. Article 15, International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, states that no one shall be found guilty of any criminal offence based on an act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international laws at the time when it was committed. Yet, in the context of prosecuting mass atrocities, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, international criminal law appears to be resigned to such a principle, if not openly including it. fact, that it may be considered the poor cousin of nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without law) which has attracted far greater consideration in scholarship and jurisprudence...|$|R
