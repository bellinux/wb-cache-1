50|$|Advertisements are {{measured}} using column inches. An advertisement that is 1 <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> square is 11 picas wide by 1 inch high. The <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> size for advertisements that spread {{over more than}} one column is determined by multiplying the number of inches high by number of columns. For example, an advertisement that is 3 columns wide by 6 inches high takes up 18 column inches (3 columns wide multiplied by 6 inches high).|$|E

5000|$|Newspapers sell {{advertising}} space {{on a page}} to retail advertisers, advertising agencies and other media buyers. Newspapers publish a [...] "per column inch" [...] rate based on their circulation and demographic figures. Generally, the more readers the higher the <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> rate is. Newspapers with more affluent readers {{may be able to}} command an even higher <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> rate. For most newspapers, however, the published rate is just a starting point. Sales representatives generally negotiate lower rates for frequent advertisers.|$|E

40|$|The obvious {{advantage}} of the newspaper over other methods of disseminating agricultural technologies and information necessitated this exploratory study. The broad objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the extent of agricultural news coverage by the pointer newspaper in 2009. The specific objectives were to: ascertain the <b>column</b> <b>inches</b> (space) given to major categories of news by the pointer newspaper in 2009; examine the percentage <b>column</b> <b>inches</b> (space) given to each category of agricultural news by the pointer newspapers in 2009; and. determine the relationship between <b>column</b> <b>inches</b> (space) given to agricultural and other categories of news covered by the pointer newspaper in 2009. Secondary data were obtained from the pointer newspaper main office at Asaba in 2010 for the study. Eight (8) broad categories of news and seven (7) categories of agricultural news were assessed. The <b>column</b> <b>inches</b> for each category of news were measured for each month by use of a measuring tape. It was found that sports were allocated the highest number of <b>column</b> <b>inches</b> with percentage and mean values of 25. 61 % and 2010. 35 respectively. This was followed by politics (21. 43 %; M= 1682. 18), religion (11. 49 %, M= 901. 77), foreign news (10. 08 %, M= 791. 63), business (9. 63 %, M= 760. 35), entertainment (9. 26 %, M= 727. 07), education (8. 86 %, M= 695. 47) and agriculture (3. 59 %, M= 282. 03). Agriculture was the least category of news covered by the pointer news paper. Poultry news (26. 43 %) was the most frequently reported among the categories of agricultural news in 2009. This was followed by forestry and wild life (11. 52 %), commentaries (10. 96 %), fisheries (9. 90 %), and agronomy (7. 17 %). It was found that agriculture news were the least covered by the pointer newspaper in 2009 in spite of the importance of agriculture under the present civilian government. The Pointer newspaper should devote more spaces to agricultural news in order to enhance dissemination of agricultural information to farmers in the state...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{gaining a}} {{significant}} and influential readership in the labor movement, John Swinton's Paper was never a self-supporting business venture. Swinton refused to accept financial gifts for the publication, instead relying exclusively upon subscriptions ($1 per year), newsstand sales (3 cents per copy), and paid advertising (25 cents per <b>column</b> <b>inch).</b> As early as December 1884 losses had begun to mount, a process which accelerated in 1887 when the Knights of Labor began a boycott of the publication over Swinton's perceived antagonism {{and commitment to the}} network of rival trade unions which later congealed {{under the auspices of the}} American Federation of Labor.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the cost of}} the advertisement, multiply the number of column inches by the newspaper's rate. So, if a newspaper charges $10 per <b>column</b> <b>inch,</b> the cost for the advertisement discussed above would be $180.00 (18 column inches multiplied by $10.00). Advertisements that span over more than one column also gain a small amount of extra space in between columns because they stretch across the gutters. Gutters are the empty space between columns. Gutters range from about 10 points to about 1 pica wide. In addition, most newspapers charge for an extra column if an advertisement is a double truck.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, when a brand pins all its {{advertising}} and marketing on an anniversary, it can {{give the impression that}} it doesn't have anything robust to say about its business; that the only way it is different from its competitors is that it has been going longer. ... The problem is, apart from the odd <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> in the press giving the company free PR, it is not immediately obvious what is gained through anniversary celebrations. Telling your customers you are of a certain age creates nostalgia and makes people think about your brand; on the other hand they would probably prefer you to spend money giving them a discount.

That was in spite the fact that the number of crimes reported had increased only from 345 to 363. They concluded that although the city's much publicized [...] "crime wave" [...] was largely fictitious and manufactured by the press, the coverage had a very real consequence for the administration of criminal justice.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} two widely read Nigerian {{newspapers}} (Punch and Guardian) {{to assess the}} extent of daily newspapers involvement in disseminating agricultural information. Samples of the newspapers between 2007 and 2010 were analysed for daily reportage, space allocation and types of stories published. All data collected were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Results showed that 70 %, 78. 8 %, 66. 3 % and 60 % of the newspapers evaluated did not report any agricultural issues in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Among those that reported agricultural issues, majority reported 1 - 2 stories per day representing 21. 3 %, 28. 8 %, 25 % and 36 % of total sample size in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Mean <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> allocation were 27. 43, 10. 77, 35. 89 and 27. 52 for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Total <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> allocation to the publication of agricultural issues in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 2194. 29, 861. 54, 2870. 94 and 2201. 52 respectively for all eighty (80) newspapers sampled in each year. Finally, except in 2008, the subject that attracted the highest reportage was health implications of the consumption of agricultural commodities. Judging by previous and current trends, the authors concluded that newspapers {{are not likely to}} make significant contribution to the dissemination of agricultural information for enhanced agricultural production...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{one part of}} a four part project {{undertaken}} by four journalism students in the Marquette University Graduate School. The project as a whole analyses from different angles the coverage of two political campaigns in the 1954 elections by the two major Milwaukee newspapers, the Milwaukee Journal and the Milwaukee Sentinel. The campaigns chosen were the race for Governor between the Republican incumbent, Walter Kohler, and the Democratic nominee, William Proxmire, and the race for Representative from the Fifth Congressional District between the Republican incumbent Charles Kersten, and the Democratic nominee, Henry Reuss. The part of the project presented here is a content analysis, using a statement system, of all the news stories which appeared in the Milwaukee Journal over a 48 day period concerning these two campaigns. The goal of this part was to discover evidence of the presence or lack of bias in the journal. Mr. Richard Voelkel has completed a similar study of the Milwaukee Sentinel. Mr. Robert Weber has completed a study of both papers using a <b>column</b> <b>inch</b> system of analysis. Mr. Thomas Brennan is working on a study of the editorials in both papers and on an explanation of the background. Together, these four theses will comprise the first complete and thorough report on the performance of Milwaukee newspapers in a political campaign...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [44]- 57 [i. e. 47]) This {{thesis is}} the result of a study of media portrayal of female athletes who competed in the 1984 and 1996 Olympic Games. A content analysis of Sports Illustrated feature articles was used to analyze the types of sports in which females were featured, the length of articles that feature females in sports that are socially considered sex appropriate and sex inappropriate, and the number of gender stereotypic physical descriptors used to describe female athletes as compared to male athletes. Sports Illustrated was selected as the sample base because it is the best-selling sport publication. The time period of 1996 was used because women have gained a great deal in the sport arena in the past several years, including the development of women's professional softball and basketball leagues, as well as the addition of many new women's competitions in the Olympics. As a comparison, 1984 was selected since it was more than 10 years previous the first time period, yet not so distant that the coverage of the athletes would be of a different style. The objectives of this study were to determine if female athletes are being trivialized by the sport media in two main ways: (a) by devoting less and shorter articles to females in sex inappropriate sports as compared to females in sex appropriate sports, and (b) by describing female athletes in more gender stereotypic physical terms than male athletes. A secondary objective was to determine if there was any change in the type of coverage given to female athletes between 1984 and 1996, specifically concerning the types of sports featured and the number of gender stereotypic physical descriptors per <b>column</b> <b>inch.</b> Although there were no significant changes in the type of coverage given to female athletes between 1984 and 1996, the data did indicate that female athletes continue to be described in more gender stereotypic terms than male athletes, and that females who participate in sex appropriate sports are featured more often than are females who participate in sex inappropriate sports.
