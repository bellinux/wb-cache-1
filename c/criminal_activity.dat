5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E
5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the {{behavioural}} sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal <b>criminal</b> <b>activity.</b> Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged <b>criminal</b> <b>activity,</b> the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E

The church held hearings against <b>criminal</b> <b>activity</b> and determined how those caught should be punished. In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.|$|E

Focusing on concealing the tracks of money transfers, the legalisation of {{the earnings of}} <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> and terrorism financing is being proceeded throughout a series of money transfers {{and with the help}} of other financial services. Therefore, it is crucial to mainly focus on the field of payment services providers when trying to supress these activities. For the purposes of supressing the legalisation of the earnings of <b>criminal</b> <b>activities</b> and terrorism financing the banks and other bodies on the financial market are relevant providers of the payment services. The key legal provision regulating the domain in question is the Act no. 253 / 2008 Coll.
