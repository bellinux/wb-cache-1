40|$|In {{her work}} on cheese streptococci, Miss Evans (1918) has noted the {{presence}} in Cheddar cheese of gas-forming strepto-cocci apparently similar to a streptococcus first isolated by von Freudenreich from kefir. It was observed also that the gas, which consisted entirely of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid,</b> was produced much more abundantly in some media than in others. For example, in trypsin-digested milk a relatively large amount of gas was formed while in lactose broth a much smaller volume was obtained, notwithstanding {{the fact that the}} latter medium underwent a vigorous acid fermentation. This indicated that the source of the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> might be something other than the sugar. Aside from its purely physiological interest, knowledge of the source of the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> produced by this organism is of scientific and practical importance in connection with the curing of Cheddar cheese. Van Slyke and Hart (1903) showed that <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> is given off from Cheddar cheese throughout the curing process. The lactose of cheese, however, is entirely con-sumed during the first few days; hence the source of the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> is not the sugar. The discovery by Miss Evans of the occurrence of a gas-producing streptococcus in Cheddar cheese naturally suggested that this organism might account for the evolution of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> from cheese of this type. In an effort to throw some light on this subject the work reported in this paper was undertaken...|$|E

This system must be accessible to everyone under the same conditions, and must contribute towards countryward employment and growth. The transportation sector, led by the automobile, has been cited constantly as a major contributor through human intervention to climate change.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals, {{personal}} care products and their metabolites are continuously entering the environment through many routes, especially from the effluent of sewage treatment plants. The aim of this work {{was to examine the}} fate and removal of pharmaceuticals during sewage treatment, and establish ways in which current sewage treatment technologies could be optimised to improve removal. Based on an analysis of pharmaceutical usage and environmental effects, four compounds were selected for further study (triclosan, tetracycline, carbarnazeptrine, and caffeine). Reliable analytical methods Were developed, using. HPLC-UV, to detect these compounds in sewage samples. The amounts of removal of the four compounds were quantified using laboratory sorption and biodegradation tests. Both tetracycline and triclosan were shown to be readily biodegradable, and to sorb strongly to biomass, although sorption occurred at different rates. Caffeine degraded rapidly, but did not sorb to biomass, whilst carbarnazepine did not sorb or biodegrade. Grab samples were taken before and after every major process unit at four sewage treatment plants (STPs). Although tetracycline was not detected in any samples, triclosan was measured at concentrations up to 5115 rig I- 1, caffeine was measured at concentrations up to 82, 300 ng C., and carbarnazeptne was measured at concentrations up to 1461 rig 1 - 1. This is the first time carbarnazepine and caffeine concentrations have been reported in UK sewage. The grab samples showed that a wide range of pharmaceutical effluent concentrations can be expected. The concentrations of the pharmaceuticals detected in this research were not high enough to cause immediate harm (i. e. death) to aquatic organisms. However, there is insufficient information to determine whether exposure to these low concentrations, typically around PNEC levels, may have an effect {{over a long period of}} time. Further composite sampling conducted at one STP generated data, modelled using Toxchem- 1 -, which demonstrated how variations in a wide range of parameters were correlated with the removal of pharmaceuticals. These showed that whilst sludge age may be the most important parameter, pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time, and chemical oxygen demand could have a critical effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals. Several ways of optimising sewage treatment plants have been proposed, including pH adjustments and longer HRTs to enhance sorption, as well as a novel adaptation to activated sludge tanks incorporating two WAS type bioreactors to enhance biodegradation. The effects of plant operating events, such as aeration failures, were also investigated. These showed that a typical length of aeration loss (four hours) could result in reduced pharmaceutical removal (through decreases in both sorption and biodegradation) for up to twelve hours. Overall, this work has shown that it may be possible to adapt current sewage treatment technology to improve removal of pharmaceuticals which sorb or biodegrade readily. With further research, these adaptations could become a viable alternative to tertiary treatment technologies such as ozonation, granular activated <b>carbon,</b> or chlorine <b>dioxid...</b>|$|R

The restoration of complement activity by putting together the albumin and globulin fractions does not prove, however, that each fraction contained a part of the complement, for the albumin fraction can be reactivated {{in the absence of the}} globulin fraction.

40|$|International audienceThe Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission (MAVEN) {{has been}} {{recently}} inserted around Mars. This mission {{is motivated by}} {{the study of the}} Mars atmospheric erosion rates along its history. Most of the atmospheric erosion rates occur in the upper atmosphere and therefore the understanding of the energetics, chemistry and dynamics of the Martian upper atmosphere is crucial to constrain the contribution of the different escape channels to the Martian atmospheric erosion. The atomic oxygen, produced by photodissociation of the atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid,</b> becomes the main neutral species in the upper thermosphere and low exosphere of Mars. This species is a key species for several processes in the Martian upper atmosphere. For example, the collisions between atomic oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid</b> can effectively excite the ν 2 vibrational state of CO 2 leading to an increase of the 15 µm emission which in turn leads to an increase of the thermospheric cooling rate and therefore controls the Martian temperature at the exobase. The Martian ionosphere is mainly composed by O 2 +, CO 2 +, O+ whose abundances are chemically controlled by the amount of atomic oxygen in the thermosphere. According to recent GCM simulations, cold atomic oxygen is very sensitive to the thermospheric circulation and its expected diurnal variations could be used to constrain the dynamics of the Martian upper atmosphere. Finally, thermal exospheric oxygen can be ionized and picked up by the solar wind contributing to the erosion of the Martian atmosphere. The caracterization of the atomic oxygen in the Martian upper atmosphere can be derived from its UV emission at 130. 4 nm mainly produced by resonant scattering of the solar flux. The UV spectrometer IUVS aboard the MAVEN mission routinely observes this emission at Mars. In this presentation we will present the first observations of the 130. 4 nm resonant line performed by IUVS at different altitudes and solar zenith angles, we will compare these observations to past observations performed by previous missions and discuss these first results...|$|E

40|$|Ocean {{sequestration}} {{of carbon}} dioxide {{is considered to be}} a potentially important method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (US DOE, 1999). Oceans are currently the largest atmospheric carbon dioxide sink; and certainly, enough storage capacity exists in the oceans to hold all of the CO 2 that we can emit for many years. Additionally, technologies exist that allow us to pump liquid CO 2 into the oceans at depths between one and two kilometers for extended periods of time and five times that deep for shorter durations. The biggest unknown in the ocean sequestration process, however, is the fate and transport of the carbon dioxide once it is released. It could sink or float, depending on its density and the formation of hydrate, or it could react with sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, any carbon dioxide anthropogenically introduced into the oceans will probably diffuse in the ocean water and cause a very small percent change in the total dissolved carbon concentration; however, the near-term local effects of releasing highlyconcentrated CO 2 in the ocean are not well-understood.

40|$|If {{the term}} {{geoengineering}} {{is restricted to}} deliberate manipulation of the entire global climate, the most evident possibility derives from a remarkable feature of nature. For whatever deep or arbitrary reason, sulfate molecules injected into the stratosphere can offset the radiative forcing effect of the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, with spectacular efficiency. A single kilogram of sulfate particles of appropriate size could negate the thermal impulse imparted by at least two hundred thousand and perhaps three hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide. The four order of magnitude difference means that the principal measure of global warming – average surface temperature – could be reduced by half a degree centigrade within a single year at modest cost. Volcano eruptions have demonstrated that effect. Many countries and even private organizations could almost certainly emulate what they do. There may also be alternative methods of accomplishing the same result, but those currently discussed are much more speculative. The sulfate option is the dominant immediate issue.

Built at a sufficient scale to test advanced power systems and components in an integrated fashion, the PSDF provides data necessary for commercial scale-up of these technologies. To guide future tests and commercialization of the technologies at the PSDF, a series of conceptual commercial plant designs has been completed in partnership with the DOE and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Six TRIG ™ combined cycle cases ha been developed to investigate the relative costs and benefits of oxygen-blown or air-blown gasification, of stack gas or syngas cleanup, and of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxid...</b>|$|E

However, Ethiopia does not have carbon inventories and databank to monitor and enhance carbon sequestration potential of different forests. As result, this study was conducted in Humbo forest with the overall objective of estimating the total carbon stock in woody plants and its variation along altitudinal gradients, as well as its implication for climate change mitigation. The above and below ground biomass, dead litter biomass and soil carbon were measured and estimated by using allometric equations. Trees with DBH> 2. 5 cm were measured for their height and diameter at breast height, and the result was analyzed by SPSS software, version 20. The findings of the study showed that Syzigium guineese(L.) Skeels was the most dominant and Prunus africana (Hook. f.) Kal was the least dominant one. The average carbon stock of the study area was 30. 77, 14. 46, 12. 55, and 168. 2 ton/ha, in above ground biomass, below ground biomass, dead litter, and soil, respectively. The variation of carbon pools between altitudinal gradient was not significant. The total maximum and minimum carbon stock estimated was 361. 63 and 58. 49 ton/ha, respectively, with the average value of 225. 98 ton/ha.
