5000|$|The eastern American toad may be {{confused}} with the <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad</b> in the area where they overlap, but the cranial crests in the American toad do not join to form a raised [...] "boss" [...] (bump) like they do in the <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad.</b> Its range also overlaps with the southern toad's, but in this species the cranial crests form two unique knobs.|$|E
50|$|The Wyoming Toad or Baxter's Toad (Bufo baxteri or Anaxyrus baxteri) is an {{extremely}} rare amphibian that exists only in captivity and within Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The Wyoming Toad was listed as an endangered species in 1984, and listed as extinct in the wild since 1991. Before the sharp declines occurred, this toad was classified as a subspecies of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Toad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad</b> (also Dakota toad, Anaxyrus hemiophrys) is {{a species}} of toad that ranges from the prairie regions of central Canada south to parts of United States upper midwest. It belongs to the family Bufonidae, the [...] "true" [...] toads. Its {{specific}} name {{is derived from the}} Latin word hemiophrys, meaning eyebrow, which refers to its pronounced cranial crest between and behind the eye. Anaxyrus hemiophrys displays the typical toad characteristics, they lack a tail and teeth, they have horizontal pupils and their dry skin is thick and warty.|$|E
50|$|The tadpoles of Anaxyrus hemiophrys eat plant {{debris and}} other {{nutrients}} found in the waters {{in which they were}} spawned by way of suspension feeding. Juvenile Anaxyrus hemiophrys’ dine mainly on small ground dwelling Coleoptera (beetles). The adult <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad's</b> diet is mainly insects, {{the most important of these}} being the Coleoptera (beetles) and Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies). The small amount of non-insect food they consume is mainly small spiders.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians, where {{regionally}} accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); <b>Canadian</b> <b>toads</b> (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|R
50|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} clinical aspect of this species of fly is its causation of secondary myiasis in anuran hosts. Specifically, myiasis occurs when fly larvae, also known as maggots, infest living or necrotic tissue in either humans or animals. One case of myiasis was observed in wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, in southeastern Wisconsin. The {{results of the study}} suggest that this fly is a facultative parasite of this frog and other amphibians. Previous records of L. silvarum parasitism in North America showed that myiasis is fatal to anuran hosts. However, after observations made from 1998 to 1999, infestations on Rana sylvatica(wood frog), Pseudacris maculata(boreal chorus frog), Bufo boreas boreas(boreal toad) and Bufo hemiophrys(Canadian toad) were reported. This {{is believed to be the}} first record of this parasite on boreal and <b>Canadian</b> <b>toads.</b> The most specific areas of occurrence for myiasis are in third world countries where common occurrences of misdiagnosis or no diagnosis occurs.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad</b> {{can grow}} to around 7.6 cm (3 in) in length. Fully grown adult males are usually 5.6 to 6.9 cm (2.2-2.7 in), while females {{are a little}} bigger between the ranges of 5.6 and 7.9 cm (2.2-3.1 in) and they weigh between 35 and 55 g. Their {{colouring}} is described by Cope (1886) as [...] "brown, marked on the back with a median yellowish line, and two to three rows of brown spots of medium size {{on each side of}} it." [...] Each spot has one to two tubercles in their centers which are redder in colour {{than the rest of the}} spots. He also identified two spots on the upper lip, one below the tympanum and a large spot that extends from below the parotid gland to near the front of the humerus. The parotid gland is narrow and secretes a toxin to protect it from predators. The toxins can cause irritation to the eyes and mouth and if it is ingested it can cause illness, but despite this toxin they are safe to handle.|$|E
50|$|The Wyoming Toad Anaxyrus baxteri (formerly {{known as}} Bufo baxteri), is an {{extremely}} rare amphibian restricted to the Albany County in the State of Wyoming, USA. The Toad was initially considered a subspecies of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Toad,</b> but later on, found {{out to be a}} separate species. The adult is, on average, 2.2 inches in length and the color varies from brown to gray (often with a greenish tint) accompanied with darker blotches. A very distinctive feature of the species is the 'bony hump' between the eyes as a result of fused cranial crests. The toad was a common sight in the Laramie Basin up until the population crash that occurred in the mid-1970s. The species has been critically endangered since 1984 and became totally extinct in the wild in 1991 (also listed as such under the ICUN Red List of Endangered Species). Originally, the toad occupied a geographical range of about 2330 km², and lived in floodplains or on shores of lakes & ponds, but now the species occurs only at the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is {{only a small part of}} the initial range. The population is still currently declining.|$|E
50|$|The boreal forest, or taiga, {{supports}} {{a relatively small}} range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects {{play a critical role}} as pollinators, decomposers, and {{as a part of the}} food web. Many nesting birds rely on them for food in the summer months. The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in the boreal forest including red-sided garter snake, common European adder, blue-spotted salamander, northern two-lined salamander, Siberian salamander, wood frog, northern leopard frog, boreal chorus frog, American toad, and <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad.</b> Most hibernate underground in winter. Fish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include Alaska blackfish, northern pike, walleye, longnose sucker, white sucker, various species of cisco, lake whitefish, round whitefish, pygmy whitefish, Arctic lamprey, various grayling species, brook trout (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), chum salmon, Siberian taimen, lenok and lake chub.|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of work {{remains to be done}} if the Wyoming toad is to recover {{to the point that it}} can be removed from the {{endangered}} species list. By Clay Jackson Imagine for a moment, maybe 7, 000 years ago or so, a group of Paleo-Indians had just concluded a successful hunt in the Laramie Basin, located in what is now southeast Wyoming. As they hunkered down to roast some freshly butchered bison steaks in a fire, they might have cocked their heads to one side in order to better pick up the trill choruses of Bufo baxteri-better known as the Wyoming toad. Mortenson Lake, in the Laramie Basin, southeast Wyoming, is the last-known locale of wild Bufo baxteri. It is also a current release site of captive-bred Wyoming toads. (courtesy usfws) The Wyoming toad appeared in the Laramie Basin and speciated roughly 10, 000 years ago after it was cut off from its original parental stock- the <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad</b> (B. hemiophrys) - at the close of the Pleistocene. Currently, the ranges of the two species are about 500 miles apart. The Wyoming toad, up until the early 1970 s, inhabited the floodplains of the Big and Little Laramie rivers, as well as associated small ponds and watery ditches in a small area of Albany County, Wyoming. Prelude to Extinction The Wyoming toad was first studied in 1946 by George T. Baxter, a graduate student with the University of Wyoming'...|$|E
40|$|Background: The hybrid zone {{between the}} {{primarily}} forest-dwelling American toad, Anaxyrus americanus, and the prairie-adapted <b>Canadian</b> <b>toad,</b> A. hemiophrys, in southeastern Manitoba {{is known to}} have shifted its position during the past 50 years. Hybrid zones are areas of interbreeding between species and their movement across a landscape should reflect their underlying dynamics and environmental change. However, empirical demonstrations of hybrid zone movements {{over long periods of time}} are rare. This hybrid zone is dominated by individuals of intermediate morphology and genetic composition. We sought to determine if it had continued to move and if that movement was associated with shifts in habitat, as predicted. Methodology/Principle Findings: We used variation in the toads ’ most diagnostic morphological feature, the separation between their interorbital cranial crests, to determine the geographic position of the hybrid zone center at four times between 1960 and 2009 using maximum likelihood methods. The hybrid zone center moved west by 38 km over 19 years and then east again by 10 km over the succeeding 29 years. The position of the hybrid zone did not track either the direction or the magnitude of movement of the forest-prairie habitat transition over the same time period. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first reported evidence of oscillation in the position of a hybrid zone. The back and forth movement indicates that neither species maintains a selective advantage over the other in the long term. However, the movement of the hybrid zone was not bounded by the breadth of the habitat transition. Its oscillation suggests that the hybrid zone is better described as being elastically tethered to the habitat transition...|$|E
