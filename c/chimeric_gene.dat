40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{often leads to}} phylogenetic incongruence. When “duplicative HGT” introduces a second copy of a pre-existing gene, the two copies may then engage in gene conversion, leading to phylogenetically mosiac genes. When duplicative HGT is followed by differential gene conversion among descendant lineages, as under the DH-DC model, phylogenetic analysis is further complicated. To explore the effects of DH-DC on phylogeny reconstruction, we analyzed two sets of sequences: (1) an augmented set of plant mitochondrial atp 1 sequences for which we recently published evidence of DH-DC; and (2) a set of simulated sequences for which we varied the extent of chimerism, the number of <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> and nucleotide substitution rates. We show that the phylogenetic behavior of evolutionarily <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> is highly volatile and depends on both the degree of chimerism {{and the number of}} differentially <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> present in the analysis. Furthermore, we show that the presence of <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> in gene trees can spuriously affect the phylogenetic position of purely native sequences, especially by attracting these sequences toward basal positions in trees. We propose the term “HGT turbulence” to describe these complex effects of evolutionarily <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> on phylogenetic results...|$|R

50|$|This {{method has}} been shown to {{generate}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene.</b> It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.|$|E

40|$|OmpF and OmpC {{are major}} outer {{membrane}} proteins. Although they are homologous proteins, they function differently in several respects. As {{an approach to}} elucidate the submolecular structures that determine the difference, a method was developed to construct a series of ompF-ompC <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> by in vivo homologous recombination between these two genes, which are adjacent on a plasmid. The genomic structures of these <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> were determined by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequence determination. In almost all cases, recombination took place between the corresponding homologous regions of the ompF and ompC genes.

Several F 1 populations hemizygous for the synthRBCSB 1 gene cluster gave rise to Luc+ F 2 plants at frequencies ranging from 1 to 3 x 10 (- 6). A nonuniform distribution of recombination resolution sites resulted in the biased formation of recombinant RBCS 3 B/ 1 B::LUC genes with nonchimeric exons. The positioning of {{approximately half of the}} mapped resolution sites was effectively modeled by the fractional length of identical DNA sequences. In contrast, the other mapped resolution sites fit an alternative model in which recombination resolution was stimulated by an abrupt transition from a region of relatively high sequence similarity to a region of low sequence similarity. Thus, unequal recombination between paralogous RBCSB genes on sister chromatids created an allelic series of novel <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> that effectively resulted in the diversification rather than the homogenization of the synthRBCSB 1 gene cluster...|$|R
5000|$|Chimeric genes {{can form}} through several {{different}} means. Many chimeric genes form through errors in DNA replication or DNA repair so that pieces {{of two different}} genes are inadvertently combined. [...] Chimeric genes can also form through retrotransposition where a retrotransposon accidentally copies the transcript of a gene and inserts it into the genome in a new location. Depending on where the new retrogene appears, it can recruit new exons to produce a <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene.</b> Finally, ectopic recombination, {{when there is an}} exchange between portions of the genome that are not actually related, can also produce chimeric genes.

40|$|The {{generation}} of tumor-specific lymphocytes {{and their use}} in adoptive immunotherapy {{is limited to a}} few malignancies because most spontaneous tumors are very weak or not at all immunogenic. On the other hand, many anti-tumor antibodies have been described which bind tumor-associated antigens shared among tumors of the same histology. Combining the variable regions (Fv) of an antibody with the constant regions of the T-cell receptor (TCR) chains results in <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> endowing T lymphocytes with antibody-type specificity, potentially allowing cellular adoptive immunotherapy against types of tumors not previously possible. To generalize and extend this approach to additional lymphocyte-activating molecules, we designed and constructed <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> composed of a single-chain Fv domain (scFv) of an antibody linked with gamma or zeta chains, the common signal-transducing subunits of the immunoglobulin receptor and the TCR. Such <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> containing the Fv region of an anti-trinitophenyl antibody could be expressed as functional surface receptors in a cytolytic T-cell hybridoma. They triggered interleukin 2 secretion upon encountering antigen and mediated non-major-histocompatibility-complex-restricted hapten-specific target cell lysis. Such chimeric receptors can be exploited to provide T cells and other effector lymphocytes, such as natural killer cells, with antibody-type recognition directly coupled to cellular activation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA-based gene duplicates (retrocopies) played pivotal {{roles in}} many {{physiological}} processes. Nowadays, functional retrocopies have been systematically identified in several mammals, fruit flies, plants, zebrafish and other chordates, etc. However, studies {{about this kind}} of duplication in Caenorhabditis nematodes have not been reported. Findings We identified 43, 48, 43, 9, and 42 retrocopies, of which 6, 15, 18, 3, and 13 formed <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> in C. brenneri, C. briggsae, C. elegans, C. japonica, and C. remanei, respectively. At least 5 chimeric types exist in Caenorhabditis species, of which retrocopy recruiting both N and C terminus is the commonest one. Evidences from different analyses demonstrate many retrocopies and almost all <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> may be functional in these species. About half of retrocopies in each species has coordinates in other species, and we suggest that retrocopies in closely related species may be helpful in identifying retrocopies for one certain species. Conclusions A number of retrocopies and <b>chimeric</b> <b>genes</b> exist in Caenorhabditis genomes, and some of them may be functional. The evolutionary patterns of these genes may correlate with their genomic features, such as the activity of retroelements, the high rate of mutation and deletion rate, and a large proportion of genes subject to trans-splicing. </p...|$|R

The <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> was transfected by the calcium phosphate-precipitation procedure into primary mouse mammary epithelial cells prepared from pregnant mice.

Melloul, B. Aloni, J. Calvo, D. Yaffe, and U. Nudel, EMBO J. 3 : 983 - 990, 1984) was inserted into mice by microinjection into fertilized eggs. Eleven transgenic mice carrying the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> with or without plasmid pBR 322 DNA sequences were identified. The majority of these mice transmitted the injected DNA to about 50 % of their progeny. However, in transgenic mouse CV 1, transmission to progeny was associated with amplification or deletion of the injected DNA sequences, while in transgenic mouse CV 4 transmission was distorted, probably {{as a result of}} insertional mutagenesis. Tissue-specific expression was dependent on the removal of the vector DNA sequences from the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> sequences prior to microinjection. None of the transgenic mice carrying the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> together with plasmid pBR 322 sequences expressed the introduced gene in striated muscles. In contrast, the six transgenic mice carrying the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> sequences alone expressed the inserted gene specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Moreover, expression of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> was not only tissue specific, but also developmentally regulated. Similar to the endogenous skeletal muscle actin gene, the <b>chimeric</b> <b>gene</b> was expressed at a relatively high level in cardiac muscle of neonatal mice and at a significantly lower level in adult cardiac muscle.

The activity of the ovalbumin promoter is cell-specifically repressed in these oviduct cells and the repression is relieved upon addition of steroid hormones. The - 132 to - 425 region of the ovalbumin promoter {{which is responsible for}} this negative regulation behaves as an independent functional unit containing the regulatory elements necessary for both repression (in the presence of steroid hormone antagonists) and induced derepression (in the presence of steroid hormones) of linked heterologous promoters...|$|R
