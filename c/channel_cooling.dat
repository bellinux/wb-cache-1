5000|$|The Bristol Racer was a single-engined mid-wing {{monoplane}} with, {{unusual for}} the time, a retractable undercarriage. The 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Jupiter IV radial engine was entirely enclosed within the circular-section fuselage, with an elaborate arrangement of ducts to <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> air over the cylinders. A large spinner with a central opening to admit air, constructed of laminated wood with internal wire bracing was fitted. The fuselage, which increased in diameter until {{the trailing edge of}} the wing and then tapered to a point, was built around a pair of circular steel frames to which the wing root stubs were mounted: aft of this structure it was a semi-monocoque built up from three laminations of tulipwood over hoops which were braced with radial wires. [...] The fabric-covered wings had composite steel-and-wood spars and were designed as cantilevers, without bracing wires, and were parallel-chord with raked tips and deep full-span ailerons, which accounted for about 20% of the wing's chord. The undercarriage was operated by a handcrank and chain drive, the legs being housed in channels in the fuselage and the wheels within the wing roots.|$|E
40|$|NA 62 is a Kaon physics {{experiment}} {{whose main}} objective is {{the measurement of}} the rare decay K+ ! + (BR 1011). It will be installed at the SPS accelerator at CERN, Geneva. The GigaTracKer (GTK) is a core part of the NA 62 experiment. It is a spectrometer made of three semiconductor pixel sensors placed around an achromat magnet. It precisely measures momentum, time and angle of the incoming kaon beam. The GTK setup is placed inside a vacuum chamber, with the main requirement to have minimal material to avoid beam interactions. Per GTK station a total material budget of 0. 5 %X 0 radiation length in beam direction is allowed. This translates into 150 μm of bulk silicon {{that can be used}} for cooling the readout electronics. It has to sustain a high and non-uniform beam rate and has to survive in a vacuum and high radiation environment. The dissipated heat produced by the readout electronics is estimated to be approximately 32 W. The maximum allowed operation temperature of the GTK is 5 C. A lower operation temperature allows for a longer lifetime of the GTK detector and is therefore highly desirable. To avoid a thermal run-away in vacuum a low mass cooling system based on micro <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> has been proposed. The micro channel heat sinks are produced with micro fabrication techniques. This means micro channels are etched into a silicon wafer and are closed by bonding a second wafer on top. The objective of this thesis is to design, simulate, test, construct and implement this novel thermal anchoring technique for the NA 62 GTK. Two solutions of this novel thermal achoring technique are explored: 1. a silicon micro <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> plate with a minimum thickness in the sensitive area (size of the pixel sensor) 2. a silicon micro <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> frame that will only cool the outer part of the electronics, which are exterior to the pixel sensor The silicon micro <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> plate has been chosen, by the NA 62 collaboration, as the baseline cooling solution for the GTK.

40|$|In plastic {{injection}} moulding process, <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> design is an essential factor that affects {{the quality of the}} moulded parts and the productivity of the process. Non-uniform cooling or long cooling cycle time would result if a poorly designed <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> is adopted. Due to limitations of traditional machining processes, the <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> is usually formed from straight-line drilled holes and only simple shapes are allowed, regardless of the shape complexity of the part being moulded. With the advent of rapid tooling technology, <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> in complex shapes can now be possible.

Heat transfer and aerodynamic results from preceding works are presented in Nusselt number and friction factor augmentation plots as determined experimentally. Using particle image velocimetry, the region near the dimple feature is studied in detail in the location of the entrainment and ejection of vortical packets {{into and out of the}} dimple; the downstream wake region behind each dimple is also studied to examine the effects of the local flow phenomenon that result in improved heat transfer in the areas of the channel wall not occupied by a feature.

40|$|In Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) -type {{nuclear power}} plants, the reactor is {{composed}} of 380 fuel channels and refueling is performed {{on one or two}} channels per day. At the time of refueling, the fluid force of the cooling water inside the channel is exploited. New fuel added upstream of the fuel channel is moved downstream by the fluid force of the cooling water, and the used fuel is pushed out. Through this process, refueling is completed. Among the 380 fuel channels, outer rows 1 and 2 (called the FARE channel) make the process of using only the internal fluid force impossible because of the low flow rate of the <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> water. Therefore, a Flow Assist Ram Extension (FARE) tool, a refueling aid, is used to refuel these channels in order to compensate for the insufficient fluid force. The FARE tool causes flow resistance, thus allowing the fuel to be moved down with the flow of cooling water. Although the existing FARE tool can perform refueling in Korean plants, the coolant flow rate is reduced to below 80 % of the normal flow for some time during refueling. A Flow rate below 80 % of the normal flow cause low flow rate alarm signal in the plant operation. A flow rate below 80 % of the normal flow may cause difficulties in the plant operation because of the increase in the coolant temperature of the channel. A new and improved FARE tool is needed to address the limitations of the existing FARE tool. In this study, we identified the cause of the low flow phenomena of the existing FARE tool.

40|$|System-in-a-package (SiP) aims to {{integrate}} {{all of the}} system functions within a system-level package, containing multiple ICs and other components interconnected through a high-density substrate. SiP is characterized by dividing chip functions among several smaller chips, by connecting chips {{in the first stage}} of board manufacture, and by integrating passive components in the substrate. The aim of this work is to develop enabling technologies for SiP concept. These technologies consist of exploring new substrate material (known as Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP)), process development for electroless Cu deposition, embedding active and passive components, and reliability test and modeling. The advantage of using LCP as the substrate is specifically addressed. A structure based on the SiP concept is proposed in the present work, in which both active and passive components are embedded in a flexible substrate. To evaluate substrate material for this application, their mechanical reliability, electrical performance and environmental impact were first investigated. The LCP gave the best reliability both in bending and cooling situation, better microwave performance and less dissipation factor. It is also an environmental acceptable material. A new process enabling metallization of the LCP substrate has been demonstrated. The best adhesion between deposited copper and LCP is achieved under the process condition as H 2 SO 4 etch acid, 30 second etching time, and using heat treatment after plating. Humidity test doesnt influence the adhesion so much. This adhesion is believed to have both mechanical and chemical origin. The results obtained can be used for further development of a cheap flex laminate technology. Embedding process is demonstrated and developed by experiments. The failure was observed to be located on the copper lines, and the separation of chip and adhesives. 3 D finite element method (FEM) gives stress distributions and warpage of the whole package, which has good agreements to the failure observed. The SiP structure optimization was done by the design of experiments method. Steady state and transient thermal modeling were employed, in which heat dissipation in SiP was revealed. Epoxy around the chip plays an important role to remove the heat when the thermal conductivity of the substrate is high. Thermal resistance was quantified for different copper thicknesses. Parameter studies on structure dimensions and materials properties were also made. For high power density application, <b>channel</b> <b>cooling</b> can increase the heat dissipation dramatically.

A conformal <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> can significantly improve the efficiency and the quality of production in plastic injection molding. This paper introduces an approach to generate spiral <b>channels</b> for conformal <b>cooling.</b> The <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> designed by our algorithms has very simple connectivity and can achieve effective conformal cooling for the models with complex shapes. The axial curves of <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> are constructed on a free-form surface conformal to the mold surface. With the help of boundary-distance maps, algorithms are investigated to generate evenly distributed spiral curves on the surface. The <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> derived from these spiral curves are conformal to the plastic part and introduce nearly no reduction at the rate of coolant flow. Therefore, the channels are able to achieve uniform mold cooling. Moreover, by having simple connectivity, these spiral channels can be fabricated by copper duct bending instead of expensive selective laser sintering.

In designing moulds for injection molding process, {{it is very difficult}} to achieve efficient cooling with uniform thermal distribution. Most of researchers focus on an optimisation of processing parameters to improve the warpage. However, the conformal <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> have advantages with the uniform distance between center of <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> and mould surfaces in order to get a better thermal distribution thus reducing the warpage.
