Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) that was given the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single rosewood tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} a composite of fitted rosewood pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of a pulley designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} drafted {{between the}} French and Malagasy governments did not clearly establish a French protectorate over the island, partly because recent French military setbacks in the Tonkin Campaign {{had begun to}} turn popular opinion against French colonial expansion. The Malagasy crown agreed to pay ten million francs to France to settle the dispute, a sum that was partly raised through the unpopular decision to increase fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of <b>cash</b> <b>taxes)</b> to mobilize the populace in panning for gold in the kingdom's rivers. This expense, coupled with Rainilaiarivony's removal of $50,000 in silver and gold coins from the tomb of Ranavalona I to offset the cost of purchasing arms {{in the run-up to}} the First Franco-Hova War, effectively emptied the royal treasury reserves. Capitalizing on Madagascar's weakened position, the French government then occupied the port town of Antsiranana and installed French Resident-General Le Myre de Vilers in Antananarivo, citing vague sections of the treaty as justification. The Resident-General was empowered by the French government to control international trade and foreign affairs on the island, although the monarchy's authority over internal administration was left unchallenged. Refusing to acknowledge the validity of the French interpretation of the treaty, Rainilaiarivony continued managing trade and international relations and unsuccessfully solicited assistance from the United States in maintaining the island's sovereignty. In 1894, the French government pressed Rainilaiarivony to unconditionally accept the status of Madagascar as a French protectorate. In response, Rainilaiarivony broke off all diplomatic relations with France in November 1894.|$|E

The court concentrated on procuring coastal imports, which—given the demands of campaigning and the guns' rapid deterioration in tropical conditions—became an endless task.

Royal agents also purchased guns as far afield as India and Aceh; while diplomatic approaches to Europeans typically focused on this issue.

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{relation}} between a firm's dividend policy and its strategic tax decisions. I posit that the capital market pressure associated with paying a dividend leads dividend-paying firms to seek predictable cash flows. I specifically focus on the volatility of a firm's <b>cash</b> effective <b>tax</b> rate (ETR) due to the observability, large size, variability, and periodicity of <b>cash</b> <b>tax</b> payments. Consistent with dividend payments altering a firm's strategic tax preferences, I find that firms that pay a higher dividend exhibit more predictable cash ETRs. Further, I find that the predictability of a dividend-initiating (eliminating) firm's cash ETR subsequently increases (decreases). Additionally, I find that, consistent with prior research suggesting that financially constrained firms "borrow" <b>cash</b> from their <b>tax</b> account, financial constraint moderates the positive relation between the predictability of a firm's cash ETR and its dividend payments. Importantly, my results hold for firms initiating a dividend {{in response to the}} exogenous shock of the Bush tax cuts. Finally, I also examine specific tax strategies dividend-paying firms use to help increase the predictability of their <b>cash</b> <b>tax</b> payments. My results contribute to the academic literature by examining whether, and how, dividend-paying firms alter their strategic tax decisions. Additionally, I contribute to ongoing public policy debates over the value of dividend payments by demonstrating a positive relation between dividend payments and the predictability of a firm's <b>cash</b> <b>tax</b> payments...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of Bhutan, there were small groups who were bonded labourers. They would work on the farms of the aristocratic and {{prominent}} families. In return, they would receive food, lodging and clothes. As soon as he became the King, labourers {{who worked on the}} royal lands were made into tenants and sharecroppers instead of indentured labourers. Later, similar indentured labourers were set free {{in other areas of the}} country, especially in some parts of Eastern Bhutan, where they were concentrated.In 1953, His Majesty, realising that hitherto the decision of the King and that of the high officials were binding on the country, wanted them to be shared. As a result, His Majesty opened the National Assembly of Bhutan in 1953 in Punakha dzong. For the first time elders from different gewogs were invited to voice their concerns, ideas and solutions for the future of this country. At the same time, it was a forum for His Majesty to share his larger vision for Bhutan in the years to come. After the National Assembly was established in 1953, the king drafted and devised a series of progressive laws for the Kingdom. The King brought out a holistic set of laws covering fundamental aspects of Bhutanese life such as land, livestock, marriage, inheritance, property and so forth. The Thrimzhung Chenmo (Supreme Law) was passed by the National Assembly in 1959. The laws are very organic, coherently interrelated within themselves and to the evolving reality and manifested his vision of a law-based society.Along with the promulgation of Thrimzhung Chenmo, a mechanism to implement and enforce laws was needed. His Majesty decided to open the judiciary, first with the appointment of Thrimpons (judges) in districts, and then finally to the High Court, which was set up in 1968. These administrative and social reforms were prior to any economic modernisation programmes. In 1955, he intensified the conversion of commodity taxes to <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> by assessing land for cash taxation. <b>Cash</b> <b>taxes</b> were nominal, but moving from commodity taxes to <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> was a radical step at that time.Apart from promulgation of better laws and tax reforms, the Royal Bhutan Army was formally established in 1963. Furthermore, the entitlements of all officials were converted from commodities to cash and new designations were given. His Majesty established new Ministries in 1968.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary role}} of the Timar system was to collect feudal obligations, before <b>cash</b> <b>taxes</b> became dominant. The Ottoman Empire had a {{hierarchy}} {{of different types of}} estate; a Hass was larger than a Zaim estate, which in turn was larger than a timar. In the Balkans, peasants on timars typically paid a tithe or a tax in kind, of around 10-25% of their farm produce; they were also obliged to pay other charges and perform corvee for the landlord, although these obligations may have been a lighter burden than in some contemporary Western European states. This system closely resembles the medieval Serb feudal system, which in turn inherited from the Byzantine.|$|E

This 'excess' is run through the P&L in the period when it becomes known (i.e. the quarter in which the options are exercised).
