40|$|FE {{analyses}} of backward extrusion of multiple micro-pins {{have been conducted}} {{to examine the effects}} of pin geometry, layout and spacing. The effect of friction on material flow and accuracy of pin geometry has been investigated. FE analysis was performed for a commercial grade Al 1050 as well as its ultrafine grained version produced by severe plastic deformation allowing a comparison to be made. Pin layout plays a large role in achieving uniformity of pin height. Material starvation resulted in the <b>central</b> <b>pins</b> being shorter than the surrounding pins. Simulations without the centre pin were conducted, which resulted in increased pin height uniformity. Simulations with friction resulted in a greater uniformity of pin height but required a greater load. Using stronger ultrafine grained material increased the load and reduced the pin height uniformity...|$|R

40|$|Biophysical stimulations with {{electric}} and electromagnetic fields {{have been demonstrated}} to accelerate the bone-healing rate. This study {{has been designed to}} investigate the effects of electricity directly connected with the <b>central</b> <b>pins</b> of an external fixator in an experimental osteotomy model in sheep. Thirty mg/kg of tetracycline chloride were administered on the 30 th and on the 45 th day after surgery for histomorphometric studies. Plain radiographs were obtained in standard projections every 15 days after surgery and were analyzed with a software program (Corel Photo-Paint Pro X 2, Corel Corporation, Ottawa, Canada). The specimens obtained after 60 days were examined with histological analysis. The results show that biophysical treatment with alternating electricity in combination with external fixator enhances new-bone formation. The translational value of this study, due to the similarities between ovine and human species, suggests that this treatment could be useful in speeding the bone-healing rate both in animals and humans...|$|R

50|$|Bolsters {{could be}} fixed in place, or be removable. Some {{had as many}} as five bolsters. Some designs had {{multiple}} sockets and a pair of bolsters could be moved between them. The bolsters could even be allowed to swivel around a <b>central</b> locating <b>pin,</b> and curved steel rubbing strips on the wagon deck. The design of bogie bolster wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons. The long, but relatively lightweight, bogie bolster replaced this with a single wagon.|$|R
50|$|Auxin it-self plays a <b>central</b> role in <b>PIN</b> protein {{polarity}} establishment. The {{regulation of}} PIN localisation by auxin creates a feed-back loop where PIN proteins control the directionality of auxin fluxes, and auxin in turn controls PIN proteins localisation. These interactions between auxin {{and its own}} transporters confer to the system self-organizing properties, which explains for instance phyllotaxis (the regular and geometrical arrangement of lateral organ along the stem), the formation of leaf serrations, {{and the formation of}} vascular strands.|$|R

50|$|A polarised two-pin {{unshielded}} connector, {{designed for}} connecting a loudspeaker to a power amplifier (or other device; {{many of the}} earlier shoebox style tape recorders used them), {{is known as the}} DIN 41529 loudspeaker connector. It exists as a panel-mounting female version, and line-mounted male and female versions. The male version has a <b>central</b> flat <b>pin,</b> and circular pin mounted off-centre. The circular pin is connected to the positive line (red) while the spade is connected to the negative line (black). The panel-mounting female version is available with or without an auxiliary contact that disconnects the internal speaker of the device if an external speaker connector is inserted. Most common is a three-hole female connector with one circular hole {{on either side of the}} spade hole, one of them with an aux contact and one without, which provides the option to leave the internal speaker connected by inserting the plug twisted by 180°.|$|R

5000|$|The devastation and ruination {{experienced}} by the temple over the centuries, especially the phenomenon of spoliation, has {{made it impossible to}} outline an exact plan of the temple. The two remaining columns of the doric order and three drums of a third column base were made of local carporo stone taken from the city's acropolis and were part of the long side of the peristasis of the temple, whose remains have been identified in the choir and cellars of the Monastery of San Michele, which is near the ruins alongside the [...] The columns are 8.47 metres high with a diameter of 2.05 metres and are separated by an inerval of 3.72 metres. From observation of the area of the peristasis and calculations of the relationship between its width and the interval, {{it has been suggested that}} the temple's front faced the navigable canal bridged by the , and that it had six clumns on the short sides and 13 n the long sides. Further, the very low profile of the capitals and the column drums which are stacked atop one another without a <b>central</b> <b>pin,</b> indicates that they were manufactured before the beginning of the fifth century BC.|$|E

40|$|Computer pattern {{recognition}} {{has been used}} to identify and separate acoustic emission (AE) signals that are similar in appearance but are due to different sources. Simulated joint specimens were tested in the laboratory in which a fatigue crack was grown from the edge of a <b>central</b> loading <b>pin</b> hole. The hardened steel loading pin produced fretting AE by its contact with the 7075 T 651 aluminum plate specimens during cyclic loading. The fatigue crack produced AE due to crack growth and to crack face rubbing during load cycling. The AE signals detected at two transducers mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} loading pin hole, at 2 in. and 4 in. from the fatigue crack, were digitally recorded at a 5 MHz digitization rate. The waveform features that were extracted from these AE signals and used in the {{pattern recognition}} were derived from the frequency spectral content of the waveforms. Better than 90 % separation of crack growth from crack face rubbing was achieved using frequency features of the waveforms from either transducer separately. Better than 95 % separation of fretting from crack growth or crack face rubbing, separately or combined, was achieved using the ratios of the spectral energies detected at the two transducers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the concept, design, analytical modeling and experimental prototype {{for a new}} &quot;smart connector&quot;, which provides electrical and mechanical connection between components of a system, specifically robotic modules. The connector includes plug and receptacle components. The plug has a <b>central</b> <b>pin</b> surrounded by a plurality of lamellae. The lamellae have an end connected to the base and a free end. A Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator is positioned about the lamellae of the plug for controlling {{the movement of the}} free end of the lamellae. The receptacle has a pin housing corresponding to the <b>central</b> <b>pin</b> of the plug. Additionally, the receptacle includes a plurality of lamellae for mating with the plug lamellae. Like the plug, the receptacle includes an SMA actuator for controlling movement of the receptacle lamellae. The plug lamellae and the receptacle lamellae have corresponding shoulders at the free ends for interconnecting the plug and the receptacle. In another configuration, the plug and receptacle are positioned side by side to provide a universal connector. The connector can transmit axial force through the lamellae, shear force through the receptacle and plug housings, and torque in the case of universal configuration. The disconnection can be controlled from plug and/or receptacle side(s) ...|$|E

Experimental results for standard and modified SMA connectors are presented, based on measurements with a vector network analyzer up to 18 GHz. The <b>central</b> <b>pin</b> plays an important role, as it causes a resonant signal reflection near 10 GHz when used at the manufactured length. Reduction of the length (backdrilling) shifts the resonance to higher frequencies and diminishes its amplitude. 3 Dsimulations show a good agreement between the calculated transmission parameters and measurement results.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{fuel efficiency}} and reduce emission, aluminium alloys have been increasingly used in automotive body-in-white structures for lightweighting. Due to its advantages {{over some of}} the more traditional joining technologies, self-piercing riveting (SPR) has been widely used for these lightweight structures. Research has showed that friction is a very important factor that influences both the riveting process and joint strength for SPR, but these influences have not been fully understood. In this paper, an innovative method was used to modify the local surface of the top sheet around the rivet piercing location with different impression tools (the <b>central</b> <b>pin,</b> the small ring, the medium ring and the large ring) and garnet particles to study the influence of local frictions on rivet inserting process, joint features and static lap shear strength. The results showed that the local surface textures on the aluminium sheet did not have significant influence on the rivet inserting process based on displacement-force curve analysis. The local surface textures could slightly change the joint features, especially the rivet head height, but overall this influence was not significant. The lap shear tests showed that ring impressions with garnet particles and <b>central</b> <b>pin</b> impressions on the bottom surface of the top sheet increased the static lap shear strength of the SPR joints. The results confirmed that the critical location for local friction influence on the lap shear strength was around the rivet leg piercing location...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{all major}} central banks pay or collect {{interest}} on reserves, and {{stand ready to}} use the interest rate {{as an instrument of}} monetary policy. We show that by paying an appropriate rate on reserves, the <b>central</b> bank can <b>pin</b> the price level uniquely to a target. The essential idea is to index reserves to the market interest rate, the price level, and the target price level in a way that creates a contractionary financial force if the price level is above the target and an expansionary force if below. Our payment-on-reserves policy process does not require terminal conditions like Taylor rules, exogenous fiscal surpluses like the fiscal theory of the price level, liquidity preference as in quantity theories, or local approximations as in new Keynesian models. The process accommodates liquidity services from reserves, segmented financial markets where only some institutions can hold reserves, and nominal rigidities. We believe {{it would be easy to}} implement...|$|R
