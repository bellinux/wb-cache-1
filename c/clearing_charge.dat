50|$|After hand extracting the {{bad case}} from the chamber, the <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> is removed from its special {{container}} and is hand rammed into the chamber. With the <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> sealed in the chamber, the projectile is fired out the muzzle. It is important to clear the projectile through the muzzle {{because it is not}} easy nor safe pushing a bore rod down the barrel to force a fuzed projectile back through the chamber and into the gun house. Also, if the gun has fired a number of rounds just prior to the misfire, time is critical because the barrel may be hot enough to cook off the high explosive in the projectile. This would destroy the mount.|$|E
5000|$|The VS-HCT has a {{circular}} case with vertical ribbing. The mine {{can be either}} mechanically laid or laid by hand and incorporates both electronic and mechanical arming delays. The mine's fuze has a battery-powered seismic sensor {{which is used to}} detect approaching targets, plus a magnetic sensor which triggers the mine at the optimum point. Once triggered the mine fires a <b>clearing</b> <b>charge,</b> which clears up to 100 millimeters of earth that may have been laid on top of the mine. Once the <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> has been fired, the main charge is triggered. The main charge throws a heavy metal slug upwards, which is capable of penetrating up to 175 millimeters of armour.|$|E

50|$|The HPD-1 {{consists}} of a large case with a prominent circular section at one end that contains the <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> and Misznay Schardin effect warhead, and a rectangular section that contains the batteries and seismic and magnetic sensors that the electronic fuze uses. It was developed to be laid automatically from the Matenin minelayer or by hand.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the fuse}} is {{triggered}}, a small <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> is fired that clears any debris {{that may be}} on top of the mine. A second larger charge is triggered 30 ms later, creating an Explosively Formed Penetrator capable of penetrating 70 mm of armour, using the Misznay-Schardin effect. The charge is capable of penetrating most armoured vehicles from below.|$|E
50|$|When triggered, {{the mine}} detonates a small <b>clearing</b> <b>charge,</b> which clears away any earth laid {{on top of}} the mine. It then fires the main warhead, which uses a metal liner to form a {{penetrating}} fragment which is projected into the belly of the vehicle passing over the mine. The self-forging fragment is capable of penetrating steel up to 200 millimeters thick.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> (also called, [...] "the short round") {{is a short}} case; plugged {{just above}} the wad. The {{distance}} piece between the wad and plug is left out. Its powder charge {{is less than a}} full service charge. This case is essential {{for the safety of the}} mount because it is needed to clear a gun after a misfire. Due to its importance, it is kept in a special container in the mount whenever the ship is in a combat zone. A misfire is especially dangerous in semi-fixed guns. When the breech is opened after the misfire, the faulty powder case can be extracted, but the projectile will remain jammed in the rifling. Also, all or part of the extracted case's cork plug may still be wedged in the chamber behind the projectile. This [...] "fouls" [...] the chamber because it decreases the chamber's volume. And, since Full and Reduced charge cases take up the full volume of an unfouled chamber (See loaded Semi-Fixed round drawing above), any residue left from the previously extracted case will prevent them from fully loading into the chamber. Therefore, the <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> is made short so that it will fit into a fouled chamber.|$|E
50|$|When {{the seismic}} sensor detects a {{suitable}} target the magnetic sensor is then monitored, when a vehicle {{with a mass}} of more than eight tons passes over the mine, triggering the magnetic sensor the mines warhead is triggered. First the mine detonates a <b>clearing</b> <b>charge,</b> which removes any earth {{that may have been}} laid over the mine, then it triggers the Misznay Schardin effect charge, which projects a slug of metal upwards. In testing the mine penetrated up to 100 millimeters of armour, although it can official penetrate only 70 millimeters.|$|E
50|$|Field Engineers {{employ the}} Medium Girder Bridge, {{introduced}} to the Singapore Combat Engineers in 1975. A field engineer company of around 100 men would take seven hours to construct a bridge spanning more than 50 metres. It was eventually replaced by the Foldable Longspan Bridge (FLB) in 2001, where 12 men require three hours to construct a 46-metre span of bridge. Also used is the Cobra Projection Line Charge (PLC), a man-packed portable, rocket propelled minefield lane <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> used to clear infantry lanes through minefields. Plant Engineers are known to operate commercial construction equipment such as excavators, shovels, bulldozers and cranes.|$|E

Figure 6 b shows the nanoparticle density versus the integrated charge Q (normalized by the sample surface). We observe a <b>clear</b> <b>charge</b> threshold above which density increases by two orders of magnitude. For low Q values (Q < 1 mC/cm 2), the density is low (δ ≈ 4 × 104 cm- 2), whereas for high Q values (Q > 2 mC/cm 2) the density is high (δ ≈ 1 × 107 cm- 2). Between these two regimes a <b>clear</b> transition <b>charge</b> threshold is observed at Q ≈ 1.5 mC/cm 2. We explain this behavior by the anodic oxidation of the silicon substrate, whereas the platinum is chemically inert at these voltages.|$|R

5000|$|The powder {{case is a}} brass or {{steel alloy}} {{cylinder}} closed at one end. It holds the propelling charge and a case combination primer. The charge is held packed around the primer by a wad, distance piece (not in <b>clearing</b> <b>charge),</b> and plug. When rammed in the chamber with the projectile, the Full and Reduced charge cases are designed to completely fill {{the volume of the}} chamber from the breechblock face {{to the base of the}} projectile when its rotating band is jammed into the bore's rifling. In other words, the powder case acts a rammer extension for the projectile. There are three types of powder cases: ...|$|E
50|$|The mine can be laid {{either by}} hand or by a {{mechanical}} mine laying system. Once the mine is emplaced, a pre-set arming delay {{of up to}} 60 minutes is initiated, after which the magnetic sensor activates and will trigger the mine if a target passes overhead. When the mine is triggered, a small <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> blows away any material {{that may have been}} on top of the mine, followed {{a fraction of a second}} later by detonation of the main explosive charge detonates. The main charge creates an explosively formed penetrator which is capable of penetrating the belly armour of any tank currently in existence, and generates substantial secondary blast and fragmentation effects. The mine is blast resistant and has been upgraded to be resistant to advanced demining mine countermeasures.|$|E
50|$|The MSM MK2 (also {{known as}} the PM-87) is a Finnish belly attack {{anti-tank}} mine. The mine has a circular ribbed plastic case that is tapered towards the bottom. It uses an electronic fuze with a combination magnetic and seismic fuze; it also has an anti-handling device. The mine is armed by inserting an arming pin, which completes an electronic circuit. The mine indicates that it is armed by lighting a small LED light which switches off after 10 minutes. When a vehicle approaches, vibrations travelling through the ground trigger the seismic sensor, which activates the magnetic sensor. When a vehicle passes over the mine, the warhead is triggered. First a <b>clearing</b> <b>charge</b> fire, removing up to 100 millimeters of earth {{from the top of}} the mine, then a copper-lined Misznay Schardin effect warhead is triggered. This projects a slug of copper at high velocity into the bottom of the target.|$|E
