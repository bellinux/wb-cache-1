5|$|Geoffrey Palmer as Admiral Roebuck, M's <b>contentious</b> {{military}} contact.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah's {{status as}} a {{legitimate}} political party, a terrorist group, a resistance movement, or some combination thereof is a <b>contentious</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Sharp began a {{campaign}} for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate. His opponent, attorney John U. Waring, was a notably violent and <b>contentious</b> man, frequently in court because of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprising}} moment of candour at the ZANU-PF congress in December 2014, President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip {{that the opposition}} had in fact won the <b>contentious</b> 2008 polls by an astounding 73%.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981 President Reagan {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a neutron bomb. While <b>contentious,</b> this had the desired effect of bringing the Soviets to the bargaining table, and negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe started on November 30.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} to Belgium, {{the issue of the}} monarch {{remained}} <b>contentious</b> and on 20 September 1944, shortly after the liberation, Leopold's brother Charles, Duke of Flanders was declared prince regent.|$|E
5|$|The cost of free {{allocation}} of units to emitters {{is a highly}} <b>contentious</b> subject. The Sustainability Council argued that the {{allocation of}} units to industry is highly costly to taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hutchinson (Massachusetts royal {{governor}} in the early 1770s), in his history of Massachusetts, described Shute's tenure as governor as the most <b>contentious</b> since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s.|$|E
5|$|Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII, married Catharine of Aragon in St Paul's on November 14, 1501. Chroniclers are profuse {{in their}} {{descriptions}} of the decorations of the cathedral and city on that occasion. Arthur died five months later, {{at the age of}} 15, and the marriage was later to prove <b>contentious</b> during the subsequent reign of his brother, Henry VIII.|$|E
5|$|From the {{perspective}} of the Canadian 1st Army, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations — the most notable being a highly controversial attack by the Royal Highland Regiment (Black Watch) of Canada on 25 July. This attack—the costliest single day for a Canadian battalion since the 1942 Dieppe Raid—has {{become one of the most}} <b>contentious</b> and critically analysed events in Canadian military history.|$|E
5|$|Frontier Indiana was prime ground missionary for the Second Great Awakening, with {{a never-ending}} parade of camp {{meetings}} and revivals. Baptist church records show an intense interest in private moral behavior at the weekly meetings, including drinking and proper child-rearing practices. The most <b>contentious</b> issue was antimission controversy, {{in which the}} more traditional elements denounced missionary societies as unbiblical.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Goldschmidt {{brokered}} {{agreements between}} business, labor and insurance interests {{that changed the}} state's workers' compensation regulations. Workers' compensation has been a <b>contentious</b> issue in Oregon for some time, as the state-run State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF) insures approximately 35% of the workforce. The legislature passed a law as a result. The changes were considered to benefit the insurance industry and business interests, {{at the expense of}} claimants, who were required to establish more extensively that their employers were responsible for injuries. The issue was <b>contentious</b> for some time, involving lawsuits and various efforts to modify the law. In 2000, Governor John Kitzhaber attempted to reform the system again. This led to a new law in the 2001 Legislature, which was complicated by an Oregon Supreme Court ruling that occurred during deliberations.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Lee {{bought the}} rights to the San Francisco 49ers {{football}} stadium, which was renamed to Monster Park. Citizens and local government protested that a public facility adopted a corporate name and a local ballot was passed to revert the stadium name after the four-year deal with Monster expired. The sponsorship was partially <b>contentious</b> due to a recent layoff of 120 local employees.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, {{the sale}} of uranium to India was a <b>contentious</b> issue. MPs clashed over the issue and protesters were marched from Sydney's {{convention}} centre before Prime Minister Julia Gillard's motion to remove a party ban on uranium sales to India was narrowly supported 206 votes to 185. Long-time anti-nuclear campaigner Peter Garrett MP spoke against the motion.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On the Origin of Species in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a <b>contentious</b> concept for some theists.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a resource from a string that merely named a resource emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform Resource Locator came to represent the former, and the more <b>contentious</b> Uniform Resource Name came to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{privilege}} protects <b>contentious</b> {{views expressed}} by MPs {{in the course}} of parliamentary proceedings in the interest of their constituents or the general public, and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression. Members can speak freely and express themselves frankly in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages for what they have said.|$|E
5|$|Pumice {{found at}} Tell el Dab'a in Egypt {{that matches the}} {{composition}} of the Thera eruption has been dated to 1540 BCE, closer to the traditionally-accepted date of Thera's eruption. This pumice has been <b>contentious</b> since the 1990s, as it represents the most prominent supported date to differ from the old chronology.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a <b>contentious</b> subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Football Fans Census {{revealed}} {{that no other}} team's supporters considered York to be among their club's main rivals. Traditionally, York's two main rivalries have been with Hull City and Scarborough. While York fans saw Hull as their main rival, this was not reciprocated by the East Yorkshire club, who saw Leeds United as their main rival. York also had a rivalry with Halifax Town {{and they were the}} team most local to York when the two played in the Conference. A rivalry with Luton Town developed during the club's final years in the Conference as both clubs met regularly in crucial matches, accompanied by a series of <b>contentious</b> incidents involving crowd trouble, <b>contentious</b> transfers and complaints about the behaviour of directors.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives easily {{passed the}} bill in just seven days. The most <b>contentious</b> issue was the {{inclusion}} of Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions. Section 7(a) was nearly passed into the bill, but Senator Wagner, Jerome Frank, and Leon Keyserling (another Roosevelt aide) worked to retain the section {{in order to win}} the support of the American labor movement.|$|E
5|$|The Lahaut {{assassination}} was not solved, and {{it remains}} <b>contentious</b> as the only political murder in Belgian history apart from {{the death of the}} socialist politician André Cools in 1991. Leopoldists were suspected, but no individual was prosecuted in the aftermath. An enquiry by historians Rudy Van Doorslaer and Etienne Verhoeyen named an alleged culprit. A final report, commissioned by the Belgian government, was submitted in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The ballots {{from abroad}} that were {{considered}} potentially <b>contentious</b> {{before the election}} proved to have very {{little effect on the}} result. While Peterle received more votes from abroad than Türk, both the total number of votes and the difference was smaller than expected (3693 for Peterle and 3040 for Türk).|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the novella, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of Candide {{has been written about}} voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is <b>contentious.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{military}} reform, {{which had been}} extremely <b>contentious</b> {{right up to the}} end of Leopold II's reign, continued to be important up to the outbreak of the First World War. Under the influence of pro-militarist lobbying, expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament, and a new system of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained <b>contentious,</b> with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained <b>contentious</b> and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E
5|$|With the cap {{on growth}} {{in the town of}} Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve {{increasing}} demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which {{has been the subject of}} <b>contentious</b> debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.|$|E
5|$|A less <b>contentious</b> {{standoff}} {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of Pixar's initial seven-film deal with Disney, all {{characters}} created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the <b>contentious</b> negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>contentious</b> {{financial}} {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|Besides Madison, {{four other}} {{governors}} have died while in office—John Breathitt, James Clark, John L. Helm, and William Goebel. All {{died of natural}} causes except Goebel, who is the only governor of any U.S. state to have been assassinated. Goebel lost the <b>contentious</b> 1899 gubernatorial election to William S. Taylor, but challenged the results. While the General Assembly was considering the challenge, Goebel was shot. Days later, the General Assembly decided in favor of Goebel, ousting Taylor from office and making Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in on his sick bed and died two days later. His lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a <b>contentious</b> convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E
5|$|Carroll was re-elected without {{opposition}} in 2008. In {{advance of the}} 2011 legislative session, he unsuccessfully ran for the open set of Senate Democratic floor leader, losing to R. J. Palmer of Winchester. Carroll blamed his <b>contentious</b> relationship with Senate President David L. Williams as the reason his colleagues were hesitant to choose him for the post. On November 6, 2012, he defeated Republican Frank Haynes to retain his seat for another four years. He was re-elected without {{opposition in}} 2016 from a district now comprising Anderson, Woodford, Franklin, Owen and Gallatin counties. His term expires December 31, 2019.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically <b>contentious</b> Indigenous issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly. This film is a police drama based around {{the death of an}} Indigenous man in police custody. As in Ground Zero, the subject was very topical: the movie was released {{at the same time as}} the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which had for four years been examining why so many Indigenous Australians died in police detention.|$|E
5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of <b>contentious</b> debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E
