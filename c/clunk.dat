500|$|Throughout the episode, George {{sings the}} song [...] "Master of the House" [...] from the musical Les Misérables. Les Misérables ran on Broadway for sixteen years, {{making it one}} of the longest running musicals in the history of Broadway. In {{response}} to George constantly singing [...] "Master of the House", Jerry tells him about German composer Robert Schumann, who went insane from hearing the same note over and over in his head. George also mentions Bud Abbott, an actor and comedian during the 1940s and 1950s, who was part of the Abbott and Costello duo, with Lou Costello. When Jerry and George discuss their options in the bathroom at the hotel, George suggests that they should leave to which Jerry replies [...] "he'll <b>clunk</b> our heads together like Moe"; this a reference to Moe Howard, one of The Three Stooges, who frequently clunked the heads of the other Stooges together.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Turn of the Screw was mixed. The film was praised by Matt Baylis, writing in The Express, {{as one of}} the better adaptations of James's story. The Timess David Chater, although he did not consider the film [...] "terrifying" [...] or [...] "suppurate in evil", found it [...] "never less than absorbing", suspecting this would be particularly so for viewers unfamiliar with the story. The Daily Telegraphs Simon Horsford felt that The Turn of the Screw [...] "might not work on all levels but it is an unsettling interpretation nonetheless". By contrast, Tom Sutcliffe, writing in The Independent, was unimpressed with the film, considering James's novel to have been [...] "comprehensively vandalised", while Richard Whittaker, writing in The Austin Chronicle, felt that the film was [...] "a particular and peculiar misfire" [...] from Welch. The Turn of the Screw was chosen as [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sunday Times, despite the reviewer, Victoria Segal, expressing her view that the film was [...] "far from perfect". But she added that the flaws could be overlooked, and although there are times [...] "when it grinds through the gears with a <b>clunk</b> and clatter", the [...] "spirit" [...] of James's story is retained.|$|E
2500|$|Savile {{presented}} {{a series of}} Public Information Films promoting road safety, notably [...] "Clunk Click Every Trip", which promoted the use of seatbelts, the <b>clunk</b> representing {{the sound of the}} door and the click the sound of the seatbelt fastening. It led to Savile's Saturday-night chat/variety show from 1973 on BBC1 entitled <b>Clunk,</b> Click, which in 1974 featured the UK heats of the Eurovision Song Contest featuring Olivia Newton-John. After two series, <b>Clunk,</b> Click was replaced by Jim'll Fix It, which he presented from 1975 to 1994. Savile won an award from Mary Whitehouse's National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1977 for his [...] "wholesome family entertainment". He fronted a long-running series of advertisements in the early 1980s for British Rail's InterCity 125, in which he declared [...] "This is the age of the train". Savile was twice the subject of the Thames Television series This Is Your Life - in January 1970 with Eamonn Andrews and again in December 1990 with Michael Aspel.|$|E

2500|$|An April 2011 {{review by}} MMORPG.com was {{complimentary}} of RuneScape, stating that [...] "For anyone {{looking for that}} [...] "old-school" [...] experience but with also tons of progression, refinement, and unique ideas, RuneScape is easily recommendable", but criticised the game's combat system and emphasis on grinding. [...] "...the genre feels slightly passed clicking an enemy and watching two swords <b>clunk</b> mercilessly into opposing body forms...RuneScape has grind in abundance and while this is not entirely a bad thing, it will put some players off looking for a slightly easier and more casual experience".|$|E
2500|$|Another of Lynch's {{prominent}} themes is industry, {{with repeated}} imagery of [...] "the <b>clunk</b> of machinery, {{the power of}} pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", {{as can be seen}} with the industrial wasteland in Eraserhead, the factories in The Elephant Man, the sawmill in Twin Peaks and the lawn mower in The Straight Story. Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several women interviewed said that, as teenagers, {{they had}} been sexually abused by Savile. It was also said Savile {{obtained}} access to teenage girls through television programmes such as Top of the Pops and <b>Clunk,</b> Click (1973–74), and his charity work. Savile's former colleagues said he {{made no attempt to}} hide his interest in girls from them, while another said she had walked in on him french kissing an underage girl. One woman who said Savile had sexually assaulted her when she was 14 in 1970 explained she had not pursued her complaint to police in 2008 after being told it would lead to a [...] "media circus". The founder of ChildLine, Esther Rantzen, was shown the interviews by Williams-Thomas and commented that [...] "There were always rumours that he [...] behaved very inappropriately sexually with children." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the <b>clunk</b> of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E

Above the roar of rapids far behind, and the fret of the current near at hand, the rhythmical <b>clunk,</b> <b>clunk</b> of the poles and the lap, lap of my little canoe as she breasted the ripples were the only sounds that broke the forest stillness. We were silent, as men always are to whom the woods have spoken their deepest message, and to whom the next turn of the river may bring its thrill of unexpected things.|$|E

Although nonoperative treatments are recom-mended as an initial treatment, there is a certain group of patients who do not respond to a rehabilitation program. 8 Early detection of these patients, who are unresponsive to nonoperative management, is of value to provide appro-priate treatment.
