40|$|Olive pomace oil is a {{by-product}} from {{the olive oil}} industry that is still {{being used in the}} food industry as a low value vegetable oil. <b>Crude</b> <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> needs to be refined and is blended with virgin olive oils before being used as edible oil. The detection of toxic compounds led to more restricted legislation and to the search of alternative valorisation processes, such as hydrotreating to obtain bio-hydrocarbons. Hydrotreating of olive pomace oil at moderate temperatures (from 300 to 430 C) and in presence of initial hydrogen pressure of 1. 1 MPa led to triglycerides destruction and to their conversion into a large range of organic compounds with predominance to hydrocarbons. Even without any catalyst, conversions into hydrocarbons were always higher than 90 % (v/v). Catalyst presence, such as: CoMo/Al 2 O 3, FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) or HZSM- 5 changed hydrogenated liquids composition. The highest content of alkanes was obtained with CoMo catalyst, while FCC and HZSM- 5 led to the highest contents of aromatic compounds. The results obtained showed that olive pomace oil can be efficiently converted into bio-hydrocarbons {{with a wide range of}} applications. It was also studied the effect of pyrolysing olive pomace oil prior to its hydrotreating. Pyrolysis pre-treatment seems to have favoured hydrotreating process by promoting initial cracking reactions. Thus, it was possible to increase the production of liquid compounds with a higher content of light molecules.

To improve this efficiency, a husk management decision model has been developed to cope with nonlinear husk pooling relationships over a multistage period. The convergence difficulties of mixed integer nonlinear optimisation in the decision model are dealt with by means of a novel multistage iterative linear formulation based on the first order Taylor approximation. The output accuracy and convergence of the proposed model is compared with that of a relaxed mixed integer nonlinear optimisation model.

40|$|Capítulos en librosOlive husk is a {{by-product}} obtained from the industrial process for olive oil production containing oil, olive skin and stones. This olive husk is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain <b>Olive</b> <b>Pomace</b> <b>Oil.</b> The remaining oil in the husk is chemically extracted and finally, the residual husk is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The <b>olive</b> <b>Pomace</b> <b>Oil</b> from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, husk usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own husk chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received husk is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify husk qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality husk which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality husk. These mid term pools provide husk to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the husk quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store husk with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} husk mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly husk pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending husk with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed.

Located in the skin of olives they are transferred to virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> constituting minor oil components and being significantly more concentrated in the latter. During storage of <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> {{a great variety of}} compounds are released through fermentative and hydrolytic mechanisms and TA are not an exception. In order to obtain edible <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oils</b> concentrated in these valuable components our research group has recently patented a technological strategy based upon extraction of the oil by centrifugation followed by physical refining (US 2011 / 0189320 A 1).

Also in the patent above, we describe a simple procedure to obtain the concentrates, which consists in an extraction of the filtration cake with hexane to remove the remaining oil followed by extraction with ethanol. In this study we characterize extracts obtained from oils of 2013 / 2014 season and examine their antioxidant activity by using radical scavenging measures (DPPH and ABTS) and the ferric reducing power (FRAP) test.

We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} contents of fatty acids, squalen and triglycerides and the values of some spectrophotometric parameters in a representative number of samples of refined seed oil (sunflower and soybean), refined <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> and extra virgin olive oil and to attempt the detection of possible contaminations and/or adulterations of the virgin olive oil with seed oils or residue olive oil from the differentiating parameters of each oil type was carried out. The K 270 value and the sum of the percentages of the trans-linoleic and trans-linolenic isomers allow for detection of the presence of 10 % refined residue olive oil in extra virgin olive oil. The detection of 1 % and 2 % sunflower and soybean oils respectively, in extra virgin olive oil was possible through the&# 206;&# 148;ECN 42 values and the percentages of the sum of the isomeric trans-linoleic and trans-linolenic. The three adulterations made (1 %, 2 % and 10 % refined sunflower oil, refined soybean <b>oil</b> and refined <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively, in extra virgin olive oil) were correctly differentiated by applying discriminant analysis techniques using &# 206;&# 148;ECN 42, &# 206;&# 148;K and the sum of the translinoleic and trans-linolenic isomers as variables. El objetivo de este trabajo ha sido determinar en un n&# 250;mero representativo de muestras de aceite de oliva virgen, orujo de oliva y de semillas (girasol y soja) el contenido en &# 225;cidos grasos, escualeno y triglic&# 233;ridos, y los valores de par&# 225;metros espectrofotom&# 233;tricos; asimismo, y en funci&# 243;n de los par&# 225;metros diferenciadores de cada tipo de aceite, se intent&# 243; detectar posibles contaminaciones y/o adulteraciones del aceite de oliva virgen con aceites de semillas y orujo de oliva. El valor de K 270 y la suma de los porcentajes de los is&# 243;meros trans-linoleico y trans-linol&# 233;nico permiti&# 243; detectar una presencia del 10 % de aceite de orujo refinado en aceite de oliva virgen extra. Los valores de &# 206;&# 148;ECN 42 y los porcentajes de la suma de los is&# 243;meros trans-linoleico y trans-linol&# 233;nico permiten detectar el 1 % y 2 % de aceite refinado de girasol y soja, respectivamente, en aceite de oliva virgen extra. La realizaci&# 243;n de un an&# 225;lisis discriminante con las variables &# 206;&# 148;ECN 42, &# 206;&# 148;K y la suma de los is&# 243;meros trans-linoleico y trans-linol&# 233;nico permite diferenciar correctamente las tres adulteraciones efectuadas: 1 %, 2 % y 10 % con aceite de girasol, soja y orujo de oliva refinados, respectivamente...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{extracted}} <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> (EOP) is the {{by-product of}} the <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> <b>oil</b> extraction industry, currently used in low value energy applications. In this work, it was studied the valorisation of hemicellulosic fraction {{of this material}} to development of the production of pentose-rich hydrolysates for subsequent bioconversion into xylitol. Given the high content of phenolic compounds, some high value-added, it was studied the aqueous pre-extraction (APE). The optimum conditions for APE were found at 100 ºC, 60 min and a liquid to solid ratio (LSR) of 5 g·g- 1. To obtain hemicellulosic hydrolysates, it was studied for both APE-treated and untreated EOP using dilute sulphuric acid (3. 5 %, w/w) at 130 ºC for 130 min at different LSR (3, 4 and 5). The hydrolysates obtained were detoxified using different methods which include the adsorption to NaOH and HCl activated charcoal, anionic resins, concentration by evaporation and membranes (nanofiltration). The impact of hydrolysis LSR, detoxification method and supplementation on xylitol production by the yeast D. hansenii, was evaluated. Nanofiltration was the method that enabled the highest removal of inhibitors. The highest xylitol volumetric productivity was 0. 30 g·L- 1 ·h- 1 (yield 0. 42 g·g- 1) was obtained for resin-detoxified hydrolysates (pH 5. 5). The highest yield, 0. 57 g·g- 1, was obtained for nanofiltration detoxified hydrolysates supplemented with corn steep liquor, a low-cost supplement with economic advantage...|$|R
