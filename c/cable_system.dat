The connecting ferry route predates both NY74 and VT74 and began operation in 1759 on an informal basis.

It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II to rip up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them useless to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by the army, to provide its army operators with the necessary experience. It was hauled by a powerful Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and <b>cable</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a <b>cable</b> <b>system</b> as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

5|$|The antennas at TSS serve {{more than}} thirty {{missions}} and contain both a multi-frequency uplink and L, S and X band downlink. In addition there are customer-owned reception, telemetry, tracking and control systems. TSS acts as a local user terminal for the Cospas-Sarsat system used for search and rescue. By {{using a combination of}} SvalSat and TrollSat, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay. These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. Tromsø is connected to SvalSat via the Svalbard Undersea <b>Cable</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{the rise of a}} number of {{scientific}} establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984. The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea <b>Cable</b> <b>System</b> opened, providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea <b>Cable</b> <b>System</b> started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
50|$|The network number allows {{to address}} (and {{communicate}} with) the IPX nodes {{which do not}} belong to the same network or <b>cabling</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> is a network in which a data link layer protocol can be used for communication. To allow communication between different networks, they must be connected with IPX routers. A set of interconnected networks is called an internetwork. Any Novell Netware server may serve as an IPX router. Novell also supplied stand-alone routers. Multiprotocol routers of other vendors often support IPX routing. Using different frame formats in one <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> is possible, but it works similarly as if separate <b>cabling</b> <b>systems</b> were used (i.e. different network numbers must be used for different frame formats even in the same <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> and a router must be to allow communication between nodes using different frame formats in the same <b>cabling</b> <b>system).</b>|$|R

Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel <b>cable</b> <b>system,</b> eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth.

5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the <b>cable</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia <b>Cable</b> <b>System</b> Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine <b>cable</b> <b>system</b> linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E
50|$|The Congress' {{passage of}} the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 {{authorized}} broadcast stations to demand payment from <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> that carry them.

5000|$|Because XHRIO is {{licensed}} and broadcasting from Mexico, it is {{not covered}} under US [...] "must-carry" [...] regulations from the FCC (though it is required carriage for Mexican <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> in its broadcast area).

However, US <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> were effectively required to carry XHRIO anyway, since it is operated by Entravision, which owns stations on the American side of the border.

On 13 August {{the captain of}} the Emden, Commodore Karl von Müller, persuaded Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding. The ships again coaled after their arrival at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 20 August. On 6 September Spee detached Nürnberg, along with the tender Titania, to cut the British <b>cable</b> <b>system</b> at Fanning Island. The cruiser flew a French ensign to deceive the defenders, and succeeded in destroying the station on 7 September. Nürnberg then rejoined the fleet at Christmas Island. later that day. In order to keep the German high command informed of his activities, Spee sent Nürnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. Spee chose the ship because the British were aware she had left Mexican waters, and so her presence in Hawaii would not betray the movements of the entire East Asia Squadron. She was also ordered to contact German agents to instruct them to prepare coal stocks in South America for the squadron's use. Nürnberg brought back news of the Allied conquest of the German colony at Samoa.|$|E
