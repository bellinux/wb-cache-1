It is crucial to investigate methods of anthropogenic {{greenhouse gas}} reduction. Currently, combustion of fossil fuels is {{the primary cause of}} human-produced greenhouse gases.

In order to reduce concentrations of these gases currently in the atmosphere, <b>chemical</b> <b>reforming</b> is needed. This study will investigate the effect of concentrated solar on the dry reforming of methane with carbon dioxide by synthesizing a suitable catalyst and testing within a custom experimental setup. Non-conventional Hydro-Thermal Synthesis was used for the catalyst.

The main advantage of using these discharges for ignition is efficient generation of electronically excited and radical species. In the experiments, time-resolved temperature, N 2 vibrational level populations, absolute O, H, and OH number densities, and ignition delay time are measured in premixed hydrocarbon–air, hydrogen–air, and hydrogen–oxygen–argon flows excited by repetitive nanosecond pulse discharges in plane-to-plane and point-to-point geometries. Time-resolved temperature and OH number density in lean H 2 –air, CH 4 –air, C 2 H 4 –air, and C 3 H 8 –air mixtures are measured by picosecond, broadband Coherent Antistokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) and by OH Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF). Time-resolved, spatially resolved temperature and absolute number densities of OH and H in Ar–O 2 –H 2 mixtures are measured by UV Rayleigh scattering, LIF, and Two-Photon Absorption LIF (TALIF), respectively. The results demonstrate that ignition occurs due to efficient generation of radicals in the discharge and {{provide insight into the}} kinetic mechanism of low-temperature plasma assisted ignition. Time-resolved electron density, electron temperature, and electric filed in transient nanosecond pulse discharges are measured by Thomson scattering and picosecond CARS/ 4 -wave mixing. Comparison with kinetic modeling calculations shows the need for development of a predictive low-temperature plasma/fuel chemistry model applicable to fuels C 3 and higher. Kinetics of nanosecond pulse nonequilibrium electric discharges in liquids and at liquid–vapor interfaces is of great interest for applications such as reactive nitrogen/oxygen species generation, plasma activation of water, removal of volatile organic compounds from aqueous solutions, and plasma <b>chemical</b> <b>reforming</b> of liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates. One of the main difficulties in studies of liquid/vapor phase plasma chemistry is sustaining the plasma at controlled, reproducible conditions which would lend themselves to in situ optical diagnostics. Dynamics of discharge development and kinetics of energy coupling in liquid–vapor interface plasmas remains poorly understood. Plasmachemical reactions near the vapor–surface interface may occur at high peak electric fields and low temperatures, due to rapid evaporative cooling of the liquid. Surface ionization wave discharges generated by high-voltage nanosecond pulses are studied over liquid–vapor surfaces (water and alcohols). Over a wide range of conditions, surface plasma “sheet” remains diffuse. No perturbation of the liquid surface by the discharge was detected. Products of plasma chemical reaction accumulated in the ionization wave discharge over liquid butanol/saturated butanol vapor interface are detected ex situ, using FTIR absorption spectroscopy. Reaction products identified include CO, alkanes, alkynes, aldehydes, and lighter alcohols. In situ laser diagnostics are used to measure radical species concentrations (OH LIF and H TALIF). Absolute, two-dimensional distributions of [OH] and [H] have been measured in a repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharge sustained near liquid water/saturated water vapor interface.

According to thermodynamic equilibrium, the optimum conditions of steam reforming of model pyrolysis oils compounds were around 600 °C and molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 3, to save raising excess steam in the process. Palm empty fruit bunches (PEFB) pyrolysis oil and pine pyrolysis oil were investigated as renewable feedstock for H 2 production. The experiments were carried out in a down-flow packed bed micro reactor using commercial Ni catalyst at 1 atm. The SIC of 1. 89 (moist fuel) was found {{to provide the best}} operating conditions for steam reforming of both pyrolysis oils.

High sorption enhancement effects were demonstrated in particular for pine oil. Short CLR experiments were performed tor both oils using the same Ni catalyst acting as oxygen transfer material. The oils were able to reduce the catalyst close to 90 % despite high O-content, and undergo CLR. The feasibility of steam reforming of aqueous fraction of pyrolysis oils was performed with co-reforming of ethanol using two catalysts: 'A' with a NiO loading of 18 wt% on α-alumina, and 'B' with 25 wt% NiO on γ-alumina.

However, it was found that Cu supported on commercial PURALOX transition alumina catalyst exhibited superior properties, with high degrees of ethylene conversion achievable even in the presence of aromatic compounds. Under the experimental conditions in this work, up to 90 % ethylene conversion was obtained at T = 850 degrees C in the presence of high concentrations of benzene. For the other prepared materials, the ethylene conversion was drastically reduced when monoaromatic compounds were present in the feed...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, {{after many}} years of {{deficient}} legislation, a new <b>chemical</b> regulation <b>reform</b> within the EU was created. The reform was called REACH and was to control the substitution of dangerous chemicals in i. a. the textile industry. Even though the reform is considered the most significant of its kind, it is exposed to heavy criticism of its actual leverage, due to severe adversity by the chemical industry, in the early stage of its creation, which lead to substantial concessions in its actual outcome. Meanwhile a new groundbreaking philosophy emerged. This new philosophy, name Cradle-to-␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ heavy consumption of resources, by changing the entire way we think of waste and resources.

5000|$|According to the 2014 Census, {{the median}} {{household}} income for both African-Americans and Hispanics was about $43,300. On the other hand, white household income was around $71,300. Also, over 91% of African-Americans and 86% of Hispanics live in urban areas, whereas only about 70% of whites live in urban areas. Furthermore, in April 2017, three environmental groups—Environmental Justice and Health Alliance for <b>Chemical</b> Policy <b>Reform,</b> Coming Clean, and Center for Effective Government—completed a study regarding the disproportionate spread of environmental burdens. They define [...] "fenceline zones" [...] as areas within the vicinity of U.S. chemical facilities that are at of highest risk of death or injury after a potential chemical accident. They found that the 134 million people living in [...] "fenceline zones" [...] are 75% {{more likely to be}} African-American, 60% more likely to be Latino, and 50% more likely to be classified as having low socioeconomic status. The study was meant to not underline the idea that the United States government fails to justly protect its communities and but also to push the government to update chemical safety regulations nationwide. These factors greatly contribute to the fact minority exposure to harmful air pollutants ranges from 40% to 60% higher than whites—evan as air quality is slowly improving as a whole.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chemical</b> looping steam <b>reforming</b> of {{acetic acid}} (CLSR-HAc) {{was carried out}} in a packed bed reactor at 650 °C and 1 atm using two nickel-based {{catalysts}} (‘A’ with alumina support and ‘B’ with calcium aluminate support) to study the effect of the temperature of oxidation (TOX) on the efficiency of the process and the materials properties of the catalysts upon cycling. CLSR-HAc could not be sustained with steady outputs with TOX of 600 °C for catalyst A, but it was conducted successfully at temperatures up to 800 °C, whereas with B it could be operated reaching close to equilibrium conditions over five cycles with TOX of 600 °C. CLSR-HAc can run efficiently for further cycles at the right operating conditions (S/C of 3, WHSV of 2. 5 hr- 1, TOX 800 °C, TSR 650 °C) even {{in the presence of the}} side reactions of acetic acid decomposition and coking. The yield of hydrogen produced had a minimum efficiency of 89 % compared to equilibrium values, and the acetic acid conversion was in excess of 95 % across 10 <b>chemical</b> looping steam <b>reforming</b> cycles. High purity hydrogen (> 90 % compared to equilibrium values) was also produced in this study. Chemigrams obtained from TGA-FTIR analysis indicates that two forms of carbon were formed on the catalyst during CLSR-HAc; TEM images and diffraction patterns indicate that poly graphitic carbon and amorphous carbon were formed while SEM images of the oxidised catalyst showed that the carbon was eliminated during the oxidation step of CLSR. A full carbon elemental balance of the process confers that majority of the carbon share (ca 90 %) was utilised for efficient steam reforming of acetic acid with ca 10 % of the carbon input deposited during the reduction step and subsequently burned during oxidation over the CLSR cycles...|$|R
