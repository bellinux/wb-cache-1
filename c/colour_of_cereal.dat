Considering the growing {{importance of this}} young emerging market, a study addressing {{some aspects of the}} South African child as a consumer might provide valuable information and guidelines to marketers and manufacturers, in particular, a way to attract these young consumers' attention to products that will possibly better serve their needs. Colour and graphics can be highlighted as a method to reach these consumers. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that children between the ages of three and seven years are within the preoperational stage of cognitive development and their attention is consequently fixed on only one stimulus at a time, for instance, the colour and/or graphics. Cereal is a widely acclaimed children's product of which a wide variety is available on the shelves of South African grocery outlets. However, the extent to which South African children belonging to this age group are influenced by these claimed colour and graphics is debatable. Based on these arguments the present study was driven by the question whether seven-year-old child consumers have definite colour and graphical perceptual preferences regarding the packaging design <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> products. An exploratory investigation was conducted within a South African context to meet the following objectives, to determine firstly, the association of seven-year-old children regarding <b>colour</b> and graphics <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> box packaging by exploring the perceptually preferred colours and graphics in cereal box packaging. Secondly, to determine the conceptualisation of seven-year-old children regarding <b>colour</b> and graphics <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> box packaging design through the composition <b>of</b> an ideal <b>cereal</b> box. Findings <b>of</b> this qualitative study confirmed existing perceptual preferences among child consumers that should be taken into consideration by manufacturers and marketers. Results included a tendency under child consumers to focus on personal factors when perceptually most preferred cereal box colour and graphic choices were made. This was in contrast with colour and graphical character qualities being the main criteria when perceptually least preferred cereal box design choices had to be made. It is evident that manufacturers should focus on softer, aesthetically pleasing characters on an either pink or purple background when girls are the target market, whereas boys would favour humorous, strong, aggressive characters on a background of any <b>of</b> the primary <b>colours.</b> Most significant, was regardless <b>of</b> their preferred <b>colour</b> and graphics, the most important factor was their pre-occupation with matching graphics to the background <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> the packaging. Manufacturers and marketers can use this information to package their products to be as child consumer friendly as possible, which could result in a favourable perception of and behaviour towards the trademark well into adulthood.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{regional}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption. Significant regional differences were registered with regard to output, structure and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption from the standpoint of both continents and countries of the world. The differences may be attributed to numerous natural, social and economic factors. Countries having favorable environmental and climatic conditions, enhanced social, economic, scientific technical and technological standards are leading in both world production and export <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> In addition, thanks to the high standards of living the consumption <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita in these countries is known to be comparatively low in relation to commodities of animal origin. On the other hand, underdeveloped and developing countries having unfavorable climatic conditions are known to produce a smaller part <b>of</b> the world <b>cereals</b> and to absorb a greater part of the world import <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> based commodities. Due to the lower living standard these countries are known to be considerable consumers <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita whereas the consumption of commodities of animal origin is considerably low...|$|R

40|$|How is {{a product}} that is {{essentially}} in the <b>colour</b> range <b>of</b> beige to brown presented through packaging? How do <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> package graphics enhance the product and differentiate it from its competitors? How do companies that market breakfast cereal present their products and ranges, to successfully compete for consumer choice from the supermarket shelf? In investigating these questions the use <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> in breakfast <b>cereal</b> packaging in Australia was assessed, visually and numerically, to identify colour characteristics, the most often used and the most proportionally used colours. Nineteen mixed cereals were selected; and included four brands Uncle Toby's, Kellogg's, Sanitarium and Vogel's. Visual analysis <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> packaging front face identified significant characteristics. The predominant colour reflected the content or the context <b>of</b> the <b>cereal,</b> while the brand range identity remained consistent.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods {{is directly related}} to the nature of nutrient storage in cereal grains. Most cereal nutrients, such as carbohydrates and minerals, are st ructurally bound. Processing alters the structural organization <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> grain. Results obtained from many nutritional studies indicate that the structure and physical form <b>of</b> a <b>cereal</b> food greatly influence the availability of its nutrients. Using oats and wheat as examples, this review demonstrates how microscopy contributes to understanding the relationship between cereal structures and the availability <b>of</b> nutrients in <b>cereal</b> foods. Various forms of food microscopy play important roles in revealing structural changes <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods that result from processing, cooking and enzymatic reactions. These changes directly affect the digestibility of starch, phytate and dietary fiber in oats and wheat. The present review also examines the effects of undigested fiber and phytate on the absorption of minerals in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Food Microscopy is a potential tool for studying the mineral binding property <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> bran components...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{antioxidant}} component <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> dietary fibre starting from its chemical structure, bioavailability and biological meaning. The slow and continuous release in the gut of the dietary fibre bound antioxidants could explain many health benefits <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> The soluble component <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> antioxidant dietary fibre is the most suitable vehicle to bring phenolic compounds into the lower gut. These compounds cannot be absorbed when are bound to the polysaccharide moiety, becoming available for gut microflora. Moreover, those linked to the soluble dietary fibre can be hydrolyzed by bacterial esterases and absorbed into the bloodstream where they might prevent LDL oxidation. The action of phenolic acids is combined with the prebiotic activity <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> dietary fibre which likely explains the positive action of whole grain based diet on weight management. Data of in vitro and human studies supporting this view will be illustrated...|$|R
