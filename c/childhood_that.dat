While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a <b>childhood</b> <b>that</b> could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} does the common claim <b>that</b> <b>childhood</b> is ‘socially constructed’ affect the ethical {{debate on the}} ‘intrinsic’ and ‘special’ goods of childhood? Philosophers have {{referred}} {{to this kind of}} goods in their critique of overly adult-centred and future-oriented conceptions of <b>childhood.</b> The view <b>that</b> some goods are child-specific, {{in the sense that they}} are only good for children, not for adults, seems to presuppose an understanding of what children ‘are’, and how they differ from adults. However, if the social-constructionist view is accepted, it cannot be assumed <b>that</b> <b>childhood</b> is a given. This essay claims that the social-constructionist understanding of childhood does not undermine the debate on the moral status and the goods of <b>childhood,</b> but <b>that</b> nevertheless important lessons can be drawn from the insight <b>that</b> <b>childhood,</b> as we know it, is not a natural and universal phenomeno...|$|R

30|$|There is {{a general}} consensus, among those who believe <b>that</b> <b>childhood</b> is a {{socially}} constructed notion 2, that Philippe Ariès (1914 – 1984) was the first writer who historicised the child, or the attitude towards it.

A year after Pyotr's arrival in Yekaterinoslav, the family relocated to the nearby army town of Romankovo. When Blavatsky was two years old, her younger brother, Sasha, died in another army town when no medical help could be found. In 1835, mother and daughter moved to Odessa, where Blavatsky's maternal grandfather Andrei Fadeyev, a civil administrator for the imperial authorities, had recently been posted. It was in this city that Blavatsky's sister Vera Petrovna was born.|$|E

Another study done by Anderson and Dill in 2000 found that violence in video games increases aggressive behavior in the short term although other scholars have suggested that results from this study were not consistent, and that the methodology was flawed.|$|E

25|$|Gibson {{was born}} in Omaha, Nebraska, the last of Pack and Victoria Gibson's seven {{children}} (five boys and two girls). Gibson's father died of tuberculosis three months prior to Gibson's birth, and Gibson himself was named Pack Robert Gibson in his father's honor. While he revered his father's legacy, Gibson disliked the name Pack, and later changed his first name to Robert. Despite a <b>childhood</b> <b>that</b> included health problems like rickets, and a serious case of either asthma or pneumonia when he was three, Gibson was active in sports in both informal and organized settings, particularly baseball and basketball. Gibson's brother Josh (no relation to the Negro Leagues star player), who was 15 years his senior, {{had a profound impact}} on his early life, serving as a mentor to him. Gibson played on a number of youth basketball and baseball teams his brother coached, many of which were organized through the local YMCA.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock {{was born}} on 13 August 1899 in Leytonstone, at the time part of Essex (now part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest). He was the second son and the {{youngest}} of three children of William Hitchcock (1862–1914), a greengrocer and poulterer, and Emma Jane Hitchcock (née Whelan; 1863–1942). He was named after his father's brother. Hitchcock was raised as a Roman Catholic, and sent to Salesian College, Battersea, and the Jesuit grammar school St Ignatius' College in Stamford Hill, London. His parents were both of half-English and half-Irish ancestry. He often described a lonely and sheltered <b>childhood</b> <b>that</b> was worsened by his obesity. Around age five, Hitchcock recalled that to punish him for behaving badly, his father {{sent him to the}} local police station with a note asking the officer to lock him away for five minutes. This incident implanted a lifelong fear of policemen in Hitchcock, and such harsh treatment and wrongful accusations are frequent themes in his films.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} for SRA was {{primarily in the}} form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during <b>childhood,</b> <b>that</b> may have been forgotten and recovered during therapy. With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except pseudosatanism in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse. Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic. Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism. Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse. In 95% of the adults' cases, the memories of the abuse were recovered during psychotherapy.|$|E
