[...] Tarrant replied with: [...] "The Colour of Money[...] [...] [...] [...]there are 20 cash machines, all with different amounts in them ranging up to a total of more than £25,000. You choose 10 colours and they have different amounts in them. If all 10 add up to the total of money you want, then you win. If the money is not enough, then you lose out and there's no in between. It's either £80,000 or £90,000 or whatever, or you go home with el zippo." [...] D'Arcy responded to this failure to keep to his limits by laughing and saying: [...] "That is a real test of the format!" ...|$|E
