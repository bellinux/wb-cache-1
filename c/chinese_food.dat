The Nutrient Data Laboratory expanded the number of <b>Chinese</b> <b>foods</b> in its USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference with new analytical data. This study aimed to examine the variability of sodium and order size in Chinese entrées. Eleven popular entréeswere sampled from independent restaurants in up to 12 nationwide locations and sent for nutrient analysis according to National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program protocol. Mean sodium levels ranged from 252 to 553 mg/ 100 g among the 11 entrées; differences in variability were indicated by CV's ranging from 13 % (general Tso's chicken) to 56 % (lemon chicken). The weight of an order varied among the different restaurants for each dish, creating an even greater impact on the sodium level per order. Sodium levels per order showed significant differences across four U. S. regions (p< 0. 0001). The high variability of sodium levels in prepared <b>Chinese</b> <b>foods</b> impacts the amount of sodium consumed from these foods...|$|R
