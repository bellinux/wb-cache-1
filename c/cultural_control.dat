The first documented {{use of the term}} was by Former President of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah in the 1963 preamble of the Organization of African States. [...] Nkrumah expanded the concept of neocolonialism in the book Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism (1965). In Nkrumah's estimation, traditional forms of colonialism have ended, but many African states are still subject to external political and economic control by Europeans. Neocolonialism is related to dependency theory in that they both acknowledge the financial exploitation of poor counties by the rich, but neocolonialism also includes aspects of cultural imperialism.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine if organic apple growers could minimize losses to summer diseases on apples by using cultural management strategies and/or regular sprays of liquid lime sulfur (LLS). LLS is an OMRI-approved fungicide. Diseases of concern were black rot, flyspeck, and sooty blotch. The latter two diseases appear as dark-colored blemishes on apple fruit surfaces. Although these blemishes do not directly impact edibility, apple with these surface blemishes are not acceptable to fresh fruit buyers. Black rot is a fruit decay that makes fruit inedible, and fruit with black rot can add off-flavors if they are use for juice. During 2010, field trials {{were conducted}} in a Jonamac orchard at the Geneva Experiment Station and in a block containing the cultivars Royal Court and Cameo at the Hudson Valley Lab in Highland. Trees in replicated plots received either <b>cultural</b> <b>controls</b> alone, treatment with LLS alone, {{or a combination of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>controls</b> and LLS treatments. <b>Cultural</b> <b>controls</b> included removal of fruitlet mummies that can harbor black rot inoculum and hand-thinning of fruit in June followed by light summer pruning to enhance rapid drying following rains and dews and to allow improved spray coverage. Apples were harvested at commercial maturity and evaluated for disease. Both LLS and <b>cultural</b> <b>controls</b> reduced disease incidence and severity of sooty blotch and flyspeck at both test locations, and both approaches reduced the incidence of black rot at Geneva. Neither LLS, <b>cultural</b> <b>controls,</b> nor the combination of the two approaches were consistently effective against black rot in the Hudson Valley where hot humid summers favor this disease. At Geneva, fruit treated with LLS alone or in combination with <b>cultural</b> <b>controls</b> had no more summer diseases than fruit treated with conventional fungicides. However, conventional fungicide programs generally out-performed LLS against summer diseases in the Hudson Valley. This experiment verifies that LLS sprays can be used to control flyspeck and sooty blotch on organic apple farms, but neither LLS nor the <b>cultural</b> <b>controls</b> that we tested will control black rot on cultivars such as Royal Court that are highly susceptible to this disease...|$|R

[...] If the disease is not causing much damage, <b>cultural</b> <b>control</b> alone may be sufficient. Choosing a resistant variety of plant is an effective method of minimizing the damage of P. megakarya. Breeding for resistance for either P. palmivora or P. megakarya will increase the plant's resistance to both pathogens simultaneously. Removal of infected plant parts reduces sporangial inoculum and is an effective <b>cultural</b> <b>control.</b> Weeding reduces the humidity of the surrounding air which is unfavorable for the production of sporangia. Frequently harvesting the pods reduces the amount of sporangial inoculum. Another form of <b>cultural</b> <b>control</b> is the burning of the pod husk piles to destroy additional sources of chlamydospores and sporangia. These cultural practices can limit disease caused by P. megakarya significantly.|$|E

Presence of weeds may reduce air circulation for strawberry plants [...] and create a shaded, moist environment, which would make the plants more wet and susceptible to disease. [...] Therefore, weed growth needs to be prevented, either by chemical or <b>cultural</b> <b>control</b> methods.

For example, a historic success story is that the cottony cushion scale remains innocuous in citrus production, more than 100 years after its successful suppression by the vedalia beetle.
