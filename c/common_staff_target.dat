40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{performed}} to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} how psychiatric staff, when caring for patients with psychiatric disease, experience situations that include a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach directed toward an individual client. Nine nurses were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed with a phenomenological-hermeneutic method in order to illuminate the livedexperience of applying a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach. The results revealed several meanings: shedding light on carers’ mutual relationships; being deserted by nurse colleagues; being aware of one’s own basis of evaluation, and that of others; beingjudged by the patient as good or evil; and becoming sensitive to the patient’s suffering. The comprehensive understandingwas that the nurse has a difficult choice*to focus on relations with one’s colleagues or to focus on the situation of the patient, who seems to suffer when a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach is used...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> {{approach}} in psychiatric care {{has not been}} studied explicitly before. Earlier studies in related areas of social processes in psychiatric care highlight {{the importance of the}} interaction between the patient and the carer to understanding communication patterns and attitudes. Other studies on social order and power in psychiatric care shows carers and patients as taking part in a hierarchical system in which patients are subordinate to carers. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis is to study the phenomenon of the <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> {{approach in}} psychiatric care, how it emerges, and how it is used and experienced by both carers and patients. Method: In the first study, grounded theory was applied to data from observations and interviews carried out with carers and clients in two psychiatric care group dwellings. In the second and third studies, a phenomenological hermeneutic method was used to analyse narrative interviews conducted with nine careers working on psychiatric wards and nine patients with experience of psychiatric in-care, respectively. In the fourth study, qualitative content analysis was used to analyse data obtained by a vignette method from interviews with 13 carers with experience of working in psychiatric in-care. Results: A <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach can be understood as a social process in municipality-level group dwellings and psychiatric in-care, imposed by carers on clients or patients with the aim of restoring a predetermined order desired by the carers. When the order is disturbed the carers try to restore it by adopting a common and consistent approach towards the single patient perceived as the threat to order. Barriers to the success of a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach, {{from the point of view}} of the carers, include the likelihood that colleagues will interpret situations differently, the chance that patients might succeed in dividing carers into “good” and “bad” camps, and the knowledge that the patient suffers under a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach. The patients’ experiences partly confirm those of the carers – the dominant picture is that the patient feels persecuted and suffers under a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach. However in some situations, patients can perceived the common approach as supportive and aimed to promote their recovery. Carers’ ethical reasoning about the <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach is usually applied on an individual basis; it can change depending upon the patient, the situation, and the proposed approach, as well as upon how the approach might affect other patients, staff members, or the carers themselves. Conclusions: The overall results from the four studies show that the <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach may meet carers’ needs, which under the approach take precedence over those of patients, but that the approach is more an exercise in asserting power and maintaining control than it is a therapeutic technique; that it is a difficult choice for the single carer to choose between the interests of the patient and the approval of colleagues; that the patient often suffers when a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach is used; and that carers are seldom aware of the suffering experienced by the patient being managed by such an approach. A <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach has no part in a care-strategy; it is not an intentional care-plan; instead it appears to be a way for carers who feel vulnerable and under pressure to maintain order by controlling particular patients...|$|R
50|$|These {{developments}} all {{suggested the}} TV-guided Martel {{was no longer}} competitive, {{and a series of}} studies during 1973 to 1975 came up with specifications for its replacement. This was known as Air <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> (AST) 1226 in the Air Force, and Naval <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> (NST) 6451. This called for a missile with greater range than Ship Martel, which required the switch to a jet engine. Hawker Siddeley submitted a design using the Marconi seeker and a more highly modified version of the Martel airframe. This would have the advantage of being able to be fired from any aircraft already able to fire the TV guided Martel.|$|R

40|$|Objective – To {{discover}} students’ perceptionsof information <b>commons</b> <b>staff,</b> and todetermine {{how these}} perceptions influence theuse of library resources. Design – Post-experience survey with onefollow-up interview. Setting – The University of Sheffield, a postsecondaryinstitution in England. Subjects – All undergraduate andpostgraduate students {{were invited to}} takepart. Just over 1 % of the student population, or 250 students, completed the survey. Methods – Information about the survey wassent to students’ institutional email addresses. One follow up interview was carried out viaemail using the critical incident technique. Main Results – Students do not understandthe academic roles of librarians. They areunlikely to approach library staff for academicsupport, preferring to turn to instructors, otherstudents, friends, and family. Most studentshad positive opinions about assistancereceived in the Information Commons, but asmall number reflected on previous badexperiences with staff, or on a fear of beingmade to feel foolish. The vast majority ofstudents who did not seek help in theInformation Commons stated that this wasbecause they did not require assistance. Most students do not perceive a difference between Information <b>Commons</b> <b>staff</b> and library staff. Conclusion – Students have positive views of Information <b>Commons</b> <b>staff</b> at the University of Sheffield, but have low awareness of the roles of professional librarians. Librarians need to develop partnerships with academic staff and strengthen their presence in both physical and online learning environments to promote their academic roles...|$|R

40|$|Thirteen carers {{were interviewed}} about their ethical {{reasoning}} when using a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach to restricting smoking for a psychiatric in-patient. A constructed case structure and a vignette method {{were used in}} the interviews, and manifest content analysis of the texts exposed five ethical positions adopted by the carers: ‘best for the person’, ‘best for the patient’, ‘best for others involved with the person/patient’, ‘best for me as a carer’, and ‘best according to rules and regulations’. A second manifest content analysis of language showed terms that expressed value judgments in regard to the carers’ personal experiences. Some carers argued at first from one ethical position, but when the question was changed, they argued from an opposite ethical position. Results may be understood in light of dialog philosophy; ethical reasoning during use of a <b>common</b> <b>staff</b> approach tends to focus either on relations with others or with oneself.

40|$|Abstract Background The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Zambia is {{currently}} operating {{with fewer than}} half of the health workers required to deliver basic health services. The MOH has developed a human resources for health (HRH) strategic plan to address the crisis through improved training, hiring, and retention. However, the projected success of each strategy or combination of strategies is unclear. Methods We developed a model to forecast the size of the public sector health workforce in Zambia {{over the next ten years}} to identify a combination of interventions that would expand the workforce to meet <b>staffing</b> <b>targets.</b> The key forecasting variables are training enrolment, graduation rates, public sector entry rates for graduates, and attrition of workforce staff. We model, using Excel (Office, Microsoft; 2007), the effects of changes in these variables on the projected number of doctors, clinical officers, nurses and midwives in the public sector workforce in 2018. Results With no changes to current training, hiring, and attrition conditions, the total number of doctors, clinical officers, nurses, and midwives will increase from 44 % to 59 % of the minimum necessary staff by 2018. No combination of changes in staff retention, graduation rates, and public sector entry rates of graduates by 2010, without including training expansion, is sufficient to meet <b>staffing</b> <b>targets</b> by 2018 for any cadre except midwives. Training enrolment needs to increase by a factor of between three and thirteen for doctors, three and four for clinical officers, two and three for nurses, and one and two for midwives by 2010 to reach <b>staffing</b> <b>targets</b> by 2018. Necessary enrolment increases can be held to a minimum if the rates of retention, graduation, and public sector entry increase to 100 % by 2010, but will need to increase if these rates remain at 2008 levels. Conclusions Meeting the minimum need for health workers in Zambia this decade will require an increase in health training school enrolment. Supplemental interventions targeting attrition, graduation and public sector entry rates can help close the gap. HRH modelling can help MOH policy makers determine the relative priority and level of investment needed to expand Zambia's workforce to <b>target</b> <b>staffing</b> levels. </p...|$|R
