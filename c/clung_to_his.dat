5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and {{an opportunity for a}} clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of a}} new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E
25|$|Rigdon {{lived on}} {{for many years}} in Pennsylvania and New York. He {{maintained}} his testimony of the Book of Mormon and <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> claims that he was the rightful heir to Joseph Smith. He died in Friendship, New York.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 1801 Charles Louis left Spain {{with his}} parents. After a short visit to Napoleon in Paris, {{they moved to}} Florence taking {{residence}} in the Pitti palace, the former home of the Medici family. Only {{a few months after}} settling in Florence, the Etrurian royal family was called back to Spain. It was during this trip that Charles's only sibling, Princess Maria Luisa Carlota of Parma, was born. Their visit was cut short by the death of Charles Louis' paternal grandfather, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, who had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> throne until his death on 9 October 1802, when Parma passed to France under the terms of a treaty which he had signed.|$|E

25|$|In August 1966, M'ba was {{admitted}} to the Hôpital Charles Bernard, a hospital in Paris. Despite his inability to govern, the president <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> power. Only after a long insistence by Foccart did M'ba agree to appoint Bongo as Vice President in replacement of Yembit, announcing his decision through a radio and television message recorded in his room on 14 November 1966. A constitutional reform in February 1967 legitimized Bongo as M'ba's successor. The preparations for the succession were finalized by the early legislative and presidential elections held on 19 March 1967. Since no one dared to stand on the opposition ticket, M'ba was reelected with 99.9% of the vote, while the BDG won all seats in the Assembly.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{a talented}} politician, speaker, and organizer. What made him {{remarkable}} was the stubbornness {{with which he}} <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> principles... {{became one of the}} best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the adamantine insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain must stand for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and unilateral disarmament, policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse.|$|E
500|$|Windeyer sent {{a signal}} on 27 September asking for another {{infantry}} battalion and {{a squadron of}} tanks, and Carpender agreed to ship the additional battalion. The following day Herring flew to Milne Bay to confer with Barbey about this. On takeoff from Dobodura, the B-25 Mitchell he was travelling in crashed. A flying fragment killed his chief of staff, Brigadier R. B. Sutherland, instantly. Everyone else on board escaped shaken but unscathed. The meeting was cancelled. Willoughby still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> original estimate of 350 Japanese in the Finschhafen area, but MacArthur authorised the extra battalion. [...] It was arranged that the first LST departing Lae {{on the night of}} 28/29 September would stop at G Beach and collect the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion and a platoon of the 2/13th Field Company, a total of 838 men. They were taken to Buna where they transferred to the destroyer transports USS Brooks, Gilmer, and Humphreys. The next night they made a run to Scarlet Beach. The troops were landed and 134 wounded were taken back, but surf conditions prevented the most seriously wounded from being evacuated.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his earlier}} {{agreement}} with Hitler, Röhm still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{vision of a}} new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, Röhm's success could only come at Hitler's expense. Moreover, {{it was not just}} the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared Röhm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann Göring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess, positioning themselves against Röhm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only Röhm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. Röhm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned Göring, Minister-President of Prussia. Finally in the spring of 1934, the growing rift between Röhm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, to start playing politics again. Schleicher criticised the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, Röhm Minister of Defence, Heinrich Brüning Foreign Minister and Gregor Strasser Minister of National Economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a [...] "lack of discretion" [...] that was [...] "terrifying" [...] as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested. Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with Röhm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} {{in a much more}} {{detailed}} article, Bequette wrote, [...] "He <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> story of shiny, flat objects racing over the Cascade mountains with a peculiar weaving motion 'like the tail of a Chinese kite.' ...He also described the objects as 'saucer-like' and their motion 'like fish flipping in the sun.' ... described the objects as 'flat like a pie-pan and somewhat bat-shaped'." [...] It wasn't until June 28 that Bequette first used the term [...] "flying disc" [...] (but not [...] "flying saucer").|$|E
2500|$|Long {{considered}} {{the inclusion of}} Ernest Scott's volume on Australia during the War to be an [...] "unorthodox characteristic" [...] of Bean's series, {{but by the time}} Long started planning the Second World War series there was no doubt that volumes on the [...] "Home front" [...] would be included. Like Scott's volume, these took the longest to write. The first, Paul Hasluck's The Government and the People, 1939–1941 appeared in 1952, but Hasluck was elected to as the member for Curtin at the 1949 election, and served as a cabinet minister until 1969. His ministerial duties delayed the second volume, which was not published until after Hasluck became the Governor-General. Hasluck's ability to provide an unbiased account when he was a Liberal politician did not escape critical comment, but historians tend to judge his work as [...] "fair and accurate". In the end, Hasluck's biases tended to be personal rather than partisan. He admired John Curtin as a fellow Western Australian and Robert Menzies as a fellow Liberal. Most notably, Hasluck <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> belief in parliamentary democracy despite its near demise during the war.|$|E
