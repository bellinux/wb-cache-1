40|$|The sealing {{capability}} of an elastomeric O-ring seal {{depends upon the}} contact stresses that develop between the O-ring and the surfaces with which it comes into contact. It has been suggested in the literature that leakage will occur when the pressure differential across the seal just exceeds the initial (or static) peak contact stress. The stresses that develop in compressed O-rings, in common cases of restrained and unrestrained geometries (grooved and ungrooved), are investigated using the finite element method. The analysis includes material hyperelasticity and axisymmetry. Contact stress profiles, and peak contact stresses are plotted versus squeeze, up to 32 percent. The contact width, which is {{the length of the}} O-ring that touches the retaining surfaces when viewed from the cross-section, is also determined. Expressions are derived empirically to predict the peak contact stress and the contact width. These expressions are also compared to those obtained by other researchers (who assumed plain strain conditions) and conclusions to their validity are drawn.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{parametric}} stress analysis of various configurations of rack plate stiffened multi-planar welded KK joints using the finite element method. The KK joint finds application {{in the leg}} structure of offshore Oil & Gas jack-up platforms. The rack plate is a dual purpose element of the joint because it firstly functions as a stiffener which reduces the stress concentration at the brace/chord intersection. This could be an immense contribution {{to the increase in}} fatigue life of the joint but other hot spot sites are introduced to the joint. The rack is also used for raising and lowering of the jack-up hull which gives the jack-up platform its jacking capability. Over 120 models using a combination of shell and solid elements were built and analysed within ABAQUS. Non-dimensional joint geometric parameters; β, γ and Ω were employed in the study with Ω being defined as the ratio of rack thickness to <b>chord</b> <b>diameter.</b> Stress Concentration Factors (SCFs) were calculated under applied axial and OPB (out-of-plane-bending) loading. Three critical SCF locations were identified for each load case, with each location becoming the most critical based on the combination of the non-dimensional parameters selected for the joint. This is important as careful design can shift the critical SCF from an area inaccessible to NDT to one that can be easily inspected. The SCF values extracted from the models were used to derive six parametric equations through multiple regression analysis performed using MINITAB. The equations describe the SCF at the different locations {{as a function of the}} non-dimensional ratios. The equations not only allow the rapid optimisation of multi-planar joints but also can be used to quickly identify the location of maximum stress concentration and hence the likely position of fatigue cracks. This in itself is an invaluable tool for planning NDT procedures and schedules...|$|E

40|$|Several {{peer-to-peer}} {{networks are}} based upon randomized graph topologies that permit ef-ficient greedy routing, e. g., randomized hypercubes, randomized Chord, skip-graphs and con-structions based upon small-world networks. In each of these networks, a node has out-degree O(log n), where n denotes {{the total number of}} nodes, and greedy routing is known to take O(log n) hops on average. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First we investigate the lim-itations of greedy routing and establish lower-bounds for greedy routing for these networks. The main contribution of the paper is the analysis of the Neighbor-of-Neighbor (NoN) -greedy routing. The idea behind NoN, as the name suggests, is to take a neighbor’s neighbors into ac-count for making better routing decisions. The following picture emerges: Deterministic routing networks such as hypercubes and <b>Chord</b> have <b>diameter</b> Θ(log n). This means that greedy routing is optimal in the sense that its routing distance is at most (approximately) the diameter, yet networks with average degree of O(log n) may have diameter O (lognlog logn). Randomized routing networks such as skip-graphs, randomized hypercubes, randomized Chord, and constructions based upon small-world percolation networks, have diameter Θ(log n / log log n) with high probability. In all of these networks, greedy routing fails to find short routes, requiring Ω(log n) hops with high probability. Surprisingly, the NoN-greedy routing algorithm is able to diminish route-lengths to Θ(log n / log log n) hops, which is asymptotically optimal...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} microscopy study was undertaken {{to determine the}} numbers and diameters of unmyelinated axons in the main trunk and side branches of the intestinal nerve {{at the level of}} the small intestine. Three techniques were used to determine axon diameter. These were: length of the least <b>chord</b> (D), <b>diameter</b> determined from cross sectional area (DA) and diameter determined from perimeter (DP). A measure of the degree of circularity of the axons was also made. On average, the nerve trunk contained 4729 unmyelinated axons and these outnumbered myelinated axons by 78 : 1. The mean number of unmyelinated axons in the side branches was 463. Myelinated axons were not seen in the side branches. When a test for circularity was applied to the data it was found that larger axons tended to be less circular than smaller ones and, because of these differences in the degree of circularity, DA and more particularly D were subject to a variable inaccuracy. The mean values for DA were 0. 70 micron for the nerve trunk and 0. 57 micron for the side branch; the mean values for DP were 0. 78 and 0. 66 microns respectively.

The forces and the stall control were primarily functions of the maximum angle of attack, with full control of stall possible for maximum angles of attack of 14 ◦ and less. The higher Reynolds number required relatively more blowing (higher Cq, Cμ) to control the dynamic stall. Drag was reduced for separated ﬂow, but the energy required in compressed air to achieve {{this was more than}} the savings in drag, and no cases were found in which ﬂow control resulted in a reduction in total power used.

40|$|A low Reynolds number {{wind turbine}} is {{designed}} to extract the power from wind energy on Mars. As compared to solar cells, wind turbine systems have an advantage on Mars, as they can continuously produce power during dust storms and at night. The present work specifically addresses {{the design of a}} 500 W Darrieus-type straight-bladed vertical-axis wind turbine (S-VAWT) considering the atmospheric conditions on Mars. The thin atmosphere and wind speed on Mars result in low Reynolds numbers (2000 - 80000) representing either laminar or transitional flow over airfoils, and influences the aerodynamic loads and performance of the airfoils. Therefore a transitional model is used to predict the lift and drag coefficients for transitional flows over airfoils. The transitional models used in the present work combine existing methods for predicting the onset and extent of transition, which are compatible with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.

Viscous computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to investigate the flow characteristics of a vehicle with baseline and sweptback grid fins at transonic and supersonic Mach numbers in the range 0. 817 - 2. 0, at zero angle of attack. Good agreement (within the error of 4 %) is observed for the computed drag coefficients with data available in literature.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{optimizing}} the blade design of miniature centrifugal flow fans for application in processor cooling solutions of portable power electronics. The design parameter varied is the blade chord length {{and the resulting}} fan performance is gauged by examining flow rate, pressure rise and power consumption characteristics. The former two of these are measured using a BS 848 fan characterization rig and the latter by directly measuring the power consumed. These characteristics are studied for three sets of scaled fans with diameters of 15 mm, 24 mm and 30 mm, and each set considers six individual blade chord lengths. A novel theory is put forward to explain the anticipated effect of changing this parameter {{and the results are}} analyzed in terms of the relevant dimensionless parameters: Reynolds number; <b>chord</b> length to <b>diameter</b> of fan ratio; flow coefficient; pressure coefficient and power coefficient. When these characteristic parameters are plotted against Reynolds number, similar trends are observed as the chord length is varied in all sets of scaled fans. The results show that the flow coefficient for all the miniature fans degrade at low Re values but the onset of this degradation was observed at higher Re values for longer blade chord designs. Conversely, {{it was found that the}} pressure coefficient is elevated at low Re and the onset Re for this phenomenon correlates well with the drop off in flow coefficient. Finally, the trend in power coefficient data appears to be identical to that for the flow coefficient. The derived theory is used to correlate this data for which all data points fall within 6 % of the correlation. Overall, the findings reported herein provide a good understanding of how changing the blade chord length affects the performance of miniature centrifugal fans and provides guidelines for designers to aid in selecting the optimum fan design for a specific application.

For this purpose stone samples needed adequate preparation and a glass <b>chord</b> with a <b>diameter</b> of 6 mm was built into them. During testing I have monitored pull-out force, movements and a type of fracture. Epoxy mortar, which showed the best bond strength among the tested ones, was then used in the second part of the diploma thesis, namely at shear retrofitting of a stone wall. Before retrofitting the wall, it needed adequate preparation. Perpendicular to a wall direction I have drilled holes and emptied horizontal joints between individual rows of stones to a certain depth. For placing in glass chords we have chosen epoxy system, which included basic epoxy primer, epoxy resin for impregnation, epoxy resin of middle viscosity for filling boreholes and epoxy mortar. Following cyclic shear loading of a wall and data processing, a comparison of obtained results with the test results of two non-retrofitted walls carried out through previous testing campaigns was made. For retrofitted wall maximal obtained horizontal movements were significantly bigger than for non-retrofitted ones. For non-retrofitted walls following the achieved a maximal force resistance started to decline, while for a retrofitted wall it was constantly increasing. Both non-retrofitted walls that were tested under the same boundary conditions as a retrofitted one had typical shear damages (cracks). On the other hand, a retrofitted wall at the same levels of displacement practically stayed intact...|$|R
