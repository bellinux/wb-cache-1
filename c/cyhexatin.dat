40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Reversion of {{resistance}} to the organotin (OT) acaricide <b>cyhexatin</b> was documented for the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch), by laboratory isolation of a field resistant colony. After 22 generations of no selection the colony reverted back to susceptible. Studies were conducted in 1985 and 1986 on susceptible and resistant T. urticae to test whether relative fitness differences were responsible for OT reversion. Susceptible colonies had significantly shorter developmental times. In addition, a field susceptible strain had a higher female to male sex ratio, and percent survival (egg to adult) than the field resistant strain. These differences are assumed to contribute to reversion in laboratory isolated resistant colonies. The effect of immigration on organotin resistance was also investigated. An immigration (dilution) experiment revealed that dilution {{of resistance}} allowed a moderately resistant colony to revert to susceptible in ca. three generations. In the field several tactics for managing OT resistance were investigated. Formulation differences (i. e. wettable powder verses flowable) of <b>cyhexatin</b> and fenbutatin oxide were found to have an effect on efficacy. In addition <b>cyhexatin</b> efficacy was improved when organotin selection to a population of T. urticae from southern Oregon pear was reduced by substitution of an acaricide to which mites were not cross-resistant. Abamectin (avermectin B 1) was substituted for <b>cyhexatin</b> in 1984 and 1985 in an orchard block harboring resistant mites in 1983. After two years of relaxed selection a standard organotin treatment was reapplied to the abamectin treated block. Better control was achieved with <b>cyhexatin</b> in the abamectin block than in a block that had been continuously treated with <b>cyhexatin</b> over the same two year period. This suggests that reducing selection pressure, by substituting the noncross-resistant compound, allowed resistance to revert in the field.

Sendo assim, o presente trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de subsidiar a recomendação de mistura de acaricidas no manejo da resistência de B. phoenicis a hexythiazox. Para esse propósito, foram realizados estudos para 1) avaliar a relação de resistência cruzada entre hexythiazox e <b>cyhexatin</b> em B. phoenicis; 2) 2) entender a estabilidade da resistência de B. phoenicis a hexythiazox mediante a comparação da biologia das linhagens suscetível (S) e resistente (R) ao hexythiazox em condições de laboratório e a avaliação da dinâmica da resistência em condições de campo, por um período de dois anos; e 3) avaliar a estratégia da mistura de hexythiazox com os acaricidas <b>cyhexatin</b> ou dicofol mediante a condução de estudos de persistência da atividade biológica de acaricidas sobre as linhagens S e R, além de experimentos de campo para validar essa estratégia. A estimativa da freqüência de resistência a hexythiazox foi realizada com bioensaio de contato direto sobre ovos, utilizando-se a concentração discriminatória de 18 mg de hexythiazox/L de água. A resistência cruzada entre hexythiazox e <b>cyhexatin</b> foi ausente. Não foram verificadas diferenças significativas entre as linhagens S e R, com relação aos parâmetros biológicos avaliados para a confecção das tabelas de vida e fertilidade em condições de laboratório. No entanto, a resistência de B. phoenicis a hexythiazox foi instável em condições de campo; isto é, foram verificadas reduções significativas na freqüência de resistência na ausência de pressão de seleção, tanto em talhões com baixa (60 %) freqüência de resistência. Estudos de persistência da atividade biológica de hexythiazox, utilizada na forma isolada ou em mistura com <b>cyhexatin</b> ou dicofol, evidenciaram que há discriminação na taxa instantânea de crescimento (ri) das linhagens S e R. Dicofol apresentou menor persistência do que hexythiazox e <b>cyhexatin.</b> As freqüências de resistência a hexythiazox estimadas após a utilização da mistura de hexythiazox com <b>cyhexatin</b> ou dicofol foram significativamente menores do que a freqüência estimada após a utilização de hexythiazox isoladamente; porém maiores do que as freqüências estimadas após a utilização de <b>cyhexatin</b> ou dicofol isoladamente. Apesar do controle satisfatório de B. phoenicis com a utilização da mistura em pomares com baixa freqüência de resistência a hexythiazox, essa estratégia deve ser recomendada com cautela para o manejo da resistência de B. phoenicis a hexythiazox. The {{mixture of}} hexythiazox with acaricides with adulticidal activity {{has been exploited}} for controlling Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes, 1939) in citrus groves. Therefore, this research was conducted to subsidize the recommendation of mixture of acaricides {{in the management of}} B. phoenicis resistance to hexythiazox. For this purpose, studies were undertaken 1) to evaluate cross-resistance relationship between hexythiazox and cyhexatin; 2) to understand the stability of B. phoenicis resistance to hexythiazox by comparing the life-history of susceptible (S) and resistant (R) strains of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox under laboratory conditions and by evaluating the dynamics of the resistance under field conditions, during a 2 -year period; and 3) to evaluate the strategy of the mixture of hexythiazox with <b>cyhexatin</b> or dicofol acaricides by evaluating the persistence of biological activity of the acaricides on S and R strains and conducting field experiments to validate this strategy. The frequency of resistance to hexythiazox was estimated with direct contact bioassays on eggs with the use of discriminating concentration of 18 mg of hexythiazox/L of water. There is no cross-resistance between hexythiazox and <b>cyhexatin.</b> No significant differences were observed between S and R strains in relation to biological parameters evaluated to built life and fertility tables under laboratory conditions. However, the resistance of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox was unstable under field conditions; that is, significant reductions in the frequency of resistance were observed in the absence of selection pressure, either in fields with low (60 %) frequency of resistance. Studies on persistence of biological activities of hexythiazox, used by itself or in mixture with <b>cyhexatin</b> or dicofol, showed that there is clear discrimination between S and R strains based on the instantaneous rate of increase (ri). Dicofol was less persistent than hexythiazox and <b>cyhexatin.</b> Frequencies of resistance to hexythiazox estimated following the use of mixture of hexythiazox with <b>cyhexatin</b> or dicofol were significantly lower than that with the use of hexythiazox alone; but higher than the frequencies estimated following the use of <b>cyhexatin</b> or dicofol alone. Despite of good control of B. phoenicis in citrus groves with low frequencies of resistance to hexythiazox, the mixture of acaricides must be recommended with cautious for managing the resistance of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox...|$|E

The experiment was installed in October of 2003 in a citrus orchard in Reginopolis city, state of São Paulo. The experimental design used randomized blocks, the dosages was expressed as mL c. p. / 100 L of water and the treatments were the following: spirodiclofen (20 mL); <b>cyhexatin</b> (50 mL) (used in rotation), lime sulfur (4, 000 mL) and control (without pesticide application).

Surveys were conducted every 15 days on the B. phoenicis, Iphiseioides zuluagai, and Euseius populations. The control level adopted by the B. phoenicis was 8. 3 %, and the pesticide applications were conducted using tractor-sprayers.

For this purpose topical and residual bioassay tests were performed. Probate analysis showed that this insecticide is highly toxic for both sexes. The calculated LD 50 values were less than field dose. Results of residual bioassays showed that this insecticide is highly toxic to spiders even after one month of its exposure. Negative effects of this insecticide not only reduces the biological control potential of L. terrestris but also poses a serious threat to other natural predators of agroecosystems. Key words: Agroecosystem, residual toxicity, ground spiders. Spiders are the most abundant natural predators of insects in terrestrial ecosystems and consume large number of prey without damaging the plants (Lang et al., 1999; Hanna et al., 2003). Many studies have demonstrated that spiders can significantly reduce prey densities in agricultural fields (Symondson et al., 2002; Pearce and Zalucki, 2006; Schmidt et al., 2009).

Headspace extraction was performed for 10 - 20 min at 75 or 85 degrees C (depending on the type of sample) with a 100 mu m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. Absorption curves showed that even at high temperature (75 degrees C) no equilibrium conditions were obtained for either compound. Direct aqueous SPME was also studied, but the sensitivity was 11 times lower at 25 degrees C than that observed when using headspace SPME at 75 degrees C. After 2 min desorption of the SPME fiber at 270 degrees C in the GC inlet, the organotin compounds were separated on a capillary column with a polydimethylsiloxane coating and transported into the ICP by means of a home-made heated (270 degrees C) transfer line. Monitoring of the (120) Sn(+) signal by ICP-MS during the run of the GC provided extremely low LODs for fentin in water: 2 pg L(- 1) (instrumental) and 125 pg L(- 1) (procedure) as well as a good repeatability of 8 % RSD (n = 10). For mussels and potatoes, concentrations in the range 3 - 10 and 0. 9 - 3 ng g(- 1) (dry weight, as Sn), respectively, were found...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate different citrus leprosis management tactics during seven seasons, based in pruning and acaricide applications, considering technical and economic aspects of each tactic. The trial was conducted from October 2003 to August 2010 in an orange plantation of Pera cv. located in the municipality of Reginópolis-SP, Brazil. The plants of citrus used were 12 years old and grafted onto Cleopatra tangerine. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, in a factorial scheme, made up of factors type of pruning (A), with six levels: (1) drastic pruning, (2) intermediate pruning without leprosis lesions, (3) intermediate pruning with leprosis lesions (4) light pruning, (5) without pruning and (6) replant; acaricide applications factor (B), with three levels: (1) without acaricides applications, (2) with lime sulfur applications and (3) spirodiclofen or <b>cyhexatin</b> applied in rotation; pruning factor to remove leprosis symptomatic branches (C), with two levels: (1) with pruning for removal, (2) without removal pruning. The combination of factors, with respective levels (6 x 3 x 2), resulted in 36 treatments that were repeated four times, with each parcel being made up of three plants in a row. After seven years, it was observed that the types of the pruning and remove of leprosis symptomatic branches used as single management tactic, is not sufficient to leprosis control. Therefore, the results demonstrated that for leprosis management, it is essential the association between tactics, especially the control mite vector. For ensuring the citrus production economically, the use of acaricides highly efficient is essential in B. phoenicis control. The recommendation of the type of pruning should be in function of the leprosis incidence and severity in the orchard. In orchards with low leprosis incidence and severity the light pruning is more appropriate, because it is efficient and ensures greater financial balance. However, in orchards with high leprosis incidence and severity it is indicated the severe pruning for reducing or eliminating inoculum source. Between the severe prunings, the intermediate pruning with leprosis lesions is the most relevant, because the financial return will be faster. Replant is indicated only for young orchards, because does not imply in changes onto cultural practices...|$|E

Para tanto, foram demarcadas com cola adesiva arenas de cinco centímetros de diâmetro em frutos de citros com alta infestação do ácaro. O ensaio foi delineado em parcelas inteiramente casualizadas, com oito tratamentos e quatro repetições. Em cada arena foram contados o número de ácaros adultos, jovens e ovos. Os tratamentos constaram dos seguintes acaricidas e doses em g i. a. / 100 L de água: etoxazol 110 SC (1, 1; 1, 65; 2, 75 e 5, 5); hexitiazoxi 500 PM (0, 75); {{flufenoxuron}} 100 CE (3); cihexatina 500 PM (25), aplicados diretamente sobre as arenas. Os frutos foram mantidos em câmara de germinação tipo BOD. com temperatura de 25 ± 2 ºC e fotofase de 12 horas. Diariamente, foram contados o número de ácaros adultos, jovens e ovos, com auxílio de microscópio esteroscópio. Os parâmetros avaliados foram a atividade ovicida, esterilização de fêmeas e efeito sobre formas jovens. Constatou-se que o etoxazol provocou mortalidade de formas jovens do ácaro-da-leprose superior a 95 %, nas doses a partir de 1, 1 g i. a. / 100 L de água. Ovos tratados com etoxazol, nas doses a partir de 1, 65 g i. a. / 100 L de água, apresentaram inviabilidade média de 60 %. O etoxazol apresentou efeito esterilizante sobre fêmeas nas doses a partir de 2, 75 g i. a. / 100 L de água, inviabilizando 95 % dos ovos. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate {{the activity of the}} etoxazole acaricide, on the mortality and reproduction of the citrus leprosies mite, B. phoenicis. A five centimeter diameter arena were demarcated with adhesive glue, in citrus fruits with high infestation of the mite. The design was entirely randomized plots with eight treatments and four replications. In each arena were counted the number of adults, young and eggs of B. phoenicis. The treatments consisted the following acaricides and doses in g a. i. / 100 L of water: etoxazole 110 SC (1. 1; 1. 65; 2. 75 and 5. 5); hexythiazox 500 WP (0. 75); flufenoxuron 100 EC (3); <b>cyhexatin</b> 500 WP (25), applied direct on the arenas. The fruits were mantened in germination camera type BOD., with temperature of 25 ± 2 ºC and fotofase of 12 hours. Daily were counted the number of adult mites, young and eggs. The evaluated parameters were the ovicidal activity, sterilizer effect and efficiency on young forms. All of the evaluations were accomplished under microscope stereoscope. It was verified that the etoxazol causes mortality in young forms of the citrus leprosies mite superior to 95 %, at the doses starting from of 1. 1 g a. i. / 100 L of water.
