25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional <b>correlation</b> <b>plot</b> of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E

Realizing that the correlation value cannot be reliably related to landscape difficulty, we investigate in this paper whether an interpretation of the <b>correlation</b> <b>plot</b> can yield reliable information about the behavior of the GA. Our approach is as follows. We present a generic method for constructing fitness functions which share the same fitness versus distance-to-optimum relation. Special attention is given to relations which show no local optimum in the <b>correlation</b> <b>plot,</b> as is the case for the relation induced by Horn's long path. We give an inventory of different types of GAbehavior found within a class of fitness functions with a common <b>correlation</b> <b>plot.</b> We also show that GA-behavior can be very sensitive to small modifications of the initial fitness [...] distance relation. 1 INTRODUCTION A number of summary statistics have been proposed to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{plot of the}} {{correlation}} function of a given DNA sequence has certain characteristic features common to almost all organisms. One common feature is that {{the correlation}} values at distances that are multiples of three is higher than correlation values at other distances.

This property is neither shared by other species of the Plasmodium genus nor by other AT rich genomes.

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} {{models in}} a spherical, turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) {{in which the}} photon source is situated at the center are calculated to investigate {{the correlation between the}} scattered light and the dust column density. The medium is modeled using fractional Brownian motion structures that are appropriate for turbulent ISM. The <b>correlation</b> <b>plot</b> between the scattered light and optical depth shows substantial scatter and deviation from simple proportionality. It was also found that the overall density contrast is smoothed out in scattered light. In other words, there is an enhancement of the dust-scattered flux in low-density regions, while the scattered flux is suppressed in high-density regions. The correlation becomes less significant as the scattering becomes closer to be isotropic and the medium becomes more turbulent. Therefore, the scattered light observed in near-infrared wavelengths would show much weaker correlation than the observations in optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. We also find that the <b>correlation</b> <b>plot</b> between scattered lights at two different wavelengths shows a tighter correlation than that of the scattered light versus the optical depth.

40|$|The ill-posed {{projectile}} {{problem of}} finding the source height from spattered droplets of viscous fluid is a longstanding obstacle to accident reconstruction and crime scene analysis. It is widely known how to infer the impact angle of droplets on a surface from the elongation of their impact profiles. However, the lack of velocity information makes finding {{the height of the}} origin from the impact position and angle of individual drops not possible. From aggregate statistics of the spatter and basic equations of projectile motion, we introduce a reciprocal <b>correlation</b> <b>plot</b> that is effective when the polar launch angle is concentrated in a narrow range. The vertical coordinate depends on the orientation of the spattered surface, and equals the tangent of the impact angle for a level surface. When the horizontal plot coordinate is twice the reciprocal of the impact distance, we can infer the source height as the slope of the data points in the reciprocal <b>correlation</b> <b>plot.</b> If the distribution of launch angles is not narrow, failure of the method is evident in the lack of linear correlation. We perform a number of experimental trials, as well as numerical calculations and show that the height estimate is insensitive to aerodynamic drag. Besides its possible relevance for crime investigation, reciprocal-plot analysis of spatter may find application to volcanism and other topics and is most immediately applicable for undergraduate science and engineering students in the context of crime-scene analysis.
