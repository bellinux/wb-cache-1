5|$|The {{helicopter}} and boat chase scenes {{were not in}} the original novel but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by the crop-dusting scene in Hitchcock's North by Northwest and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, The Red Beret. These two scenes would initially be shot in Istanbul but were moved to Scotland. The speed-boats could not run fast enough due to the many waves in the sea, and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus. A helicopter was also hard to obtain, and the special effects crew were nearly arrested trying to get one at a local air base. The helicopter chase was filmed with a radio controlled miniature helicopter. The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post-production since the boats were not loud enough, and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of <b>control,</b> <b>burning</b> Walter Gotell's eyelids and seriously injuring three stuntmen.|$|E
2500|$|Vizcaya {{was locked}} in a running gun duel {{for nearly an hour}} with Brooklyn. Despite {{steaming}} side-by-side with Schley's flagship at a range of about [...] and even with some good shooting which knocked out a secondary gun aboard Brooklyn, almost none of the Spaniards' nearly 300 shots caused significant damage, while Brooklyn pounded Vizcaya with devastating fire. Subsequent claims by Admiral Cervera, and later research by historians, have suggested that nearly 85% of the Spanish ammunition at Santiago was utterly useless, either defective or simply filled with sawdust as a cost-saving measure for practice firing. The American ammunition had no such issues of lethality. Vizcaya continued the fight until overwhelmed, {{and by the end of}} the engagement she had been struck as many as 200 times by the fire from Brooklyn and Texas. Brooklyn had closed to within [...] when she finally delivered an [...] round which, according to witnesses, may have detonated a torpedo being prepared for launch. A huge explosion ensued, Vizcaya was mortally wounded, and fires raged out of <b>control,</b> <b>burning</b> her reserves of ammunition that were on deck. She hauled down her flag and turned toward the Aserraderos beach to ground herself at 11:15.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{standard}} practice to establish grasses on steep slopes (batters) of embankments and cuttings to minimise erosion problems. However, the increase in grass density (high biomass) on the steep slopes poses {{a greater risk of}} fire. <b>Controlled</b> <b>burning</b> is a common fuel hazard reduction program employed to minimise the fire risks. The increased risk of erosion on the steep slopes after <b>controlled</b> <b>burning</b> has received little attention if any. This paper assesses the erosion risks associated with <b>controlled</b> <b>burning</b> of grasses established on steep slopes. Grasses, with and without the aid of waste ballast rock mulch, were established on 10 m wide railway embankment batter experiment plots. Two-and-a-half years after the grass establishment, selected plots were controlled burned. Runoff and soil loss from the experimental plots were monitored throughout the 31 ⁄ 2 -year period of the experiment. After one year the grass cover on the burned plots has hardly exceeded 60 %, far below the average pre-burn levels of about 80 %. All treatments achieved an incredible soil loss reduction of over 95 % (compared with the bare scenario) without <b>controlled</b> <b>burning</b> {{at the end of the}} 31 ⁄ 2 -year period. This percentage value was decreased numerically by 14 where <b>controlled</b> <b>burning</b> was implemented. Compared with the 100 % grass cover treatment, runoff rates tripled while erosion rates increased by nine-fold for the waste ballast treatment, and 17 -fold for the non-waste ballast treatment, during the first year following <b>controlled</b> <b>burning...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Anticonvulsants. These {{agents are}} used to manage severe muscle spasms and provide {{sedation}} in neuralgia. They have central effects on pain modulation. Medications such as phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), used to treat seizures, also can {{lessen the pain associated}} with postherpetic neuralgia. The medications stabilize abnormal electrical activity in the nervous system caused by injured nerves. Doctors often prescribe another anticonvulsant called carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol) for sharp, jabbing pain. Newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and lamotrigine (Lamictal), are generally tolerated better and can help <b>control</b> <b>burning</b> and pain.|$|E

5000|$|In 1899, {{the plague}} reached {{the islands of}} Hawaii. [...] The first {{evidence}} of the disease was found in Honolulu's Chinatown on Oahu. [...] It was located {{very close to the}} island's piers, and rats in cargo ships from China were able to land on the Hawaiian islands unseen. As the rats, hosts for disease-carrying fleas, made their way deeper into the city, people started to fall ill. On December 12, 1899, the first case was confirmed. The Board of Health then quickly thought of ways to prevent the disease from spreading even further inland. Their solution was to burn down any buildings in Chinatown suspected of containing a source of the disease. On December 31, 1899, the board set the first fire. They had originally planned to burn only a few targeted buildings, and thought they could control the flames as each building was finished, but the fire got out of <b>control,</b> <b>burning</b> down untargeted neighboring buildings. The resulting fire caused many of Chinatown's homes to be destroyed and an estimated 4,000 people were left homeless.|$|E

Inter-annual variation of Chinese fir tree-ring widths were measured for the <b>controlled</b> <b>burning,</b> brush clearing and natural forest sites.

50|$|There {{are very}} {{practical}} needs for sustainable management of forest. Since forests provide many {{resources to the}} people, and to the world, management of the forests are critical to keep those resources available. To {{be able to manage}} a forest, knowledge of how the natural systems work is needed. If a manager knows how the natural system works, then when manager of the forest makes plans how the resources are to remove from the forest, the manager will know how the resources can be removed without damaging the forest. Since many forests are under management of the government that is in the region, the forest are not truly functioning how the ecosystem was naturally developed, and how it is meant to be. An example is the pine flatwoods in Florida. To be able to maintain that ecosystem frequent burnings of the forest needs to happen. Fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, but since wild fires can spread to communities near the forest, control of the wild fires is requested from the communities. To maintain flatwoods forest <b>control</b> <b>burning</b> or prescribe burning is part of the management to sustain the forest.|$|E
