5|$|Children {{have always}} played games. It is {{accepted}} {{that as well}} as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games, painted in 1560. It depicts <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as marbles, hide-and-seek, blowing soap bubbles and piggyback riding continue to be played.|$|E

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment.

By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E

5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E

5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
5|$|Human {{reactions}} to the sea are found in, for example, literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music, {{as well as in}} mythology and the psychotherapeutic interpretation of dreams. The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters. Trade and exchange of ideas with neighbouring nations is one of the means by which civilizations advance and evolve. This happened widely among the ancient peoples living in lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in India, China and other Southeast Asian nations. The World Oceans Day takes place every June 8.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} The Role of Preschool Teacher in Child Structured and Unstructured Play {{focuses on}} play, play {{materials and the}} role of preschool teacher in the preschool period. The theoretical part focuses on the meaning of <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> and play materials as well as the role of the preschool professionals. Various types, factors and characteristics of <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> were presented and play materials were defined. Toy quality criteria are also briefly described. The chapter dealing with the play and curriculum contains a detailed study on the meaning of <b>child's</b> <b>play</b> in connection with individual areas of the activity. The theoretical part ends with the important role of preschool teacher in organizing and preparing preschool <b>child's</b> <b>play.</b> The mail goal of the empirical part was an insight into the preschool teachers' point of view on structured and unstructured materials. I wanted to find out how well nursery schools are stocked with such materials, possible problems in organizing <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> using the abovementioned materials and how often the material is used in <b>child’s</b> <b>play.</b> The focus was put on the meaning of structured and unstructured materials as a means of motivation in child’s play; the child's response and perseverance using a specific type of play material as well as opinion on the meaning and quality of preschool teacher's role in <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> organization and preparation using child structured and unstructured materials. Based on the research results it was established that nursery schools are well stocked with structured and unstructured materials and that structured material is still mostly used by preschool teachers in organizing the <b>child’s</b> <b>play.</b> I also found out that visually and technically perfected toys do not necessarily mean successful <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> and development. According to preschool teachers, preschool children prefer unstructured materials, which increase the child's motivation and imagination in different child ages. Preschool teachers often join the <b>child</b> structured material <b>play</b> indirectly acting as a judge, guide and initiator in order to resolve the conflicts. Preschool teaches warn that their role in planning <b>child’s</b> <b>play</b> with structured and unstructured materials is demanding and difficult. Their main difficulty is organizing the time and ensuring a safe play with unstructured materials. ...|$|R
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the <b>children</b> <b>playing</b> together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the first}} three <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> films, this film takes a more humorous turn and often into self-referential parody. It does not {{continue}} on {{with the concept of}} a child victim in possession of the doll, thus the absence of <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> in the title. From this entry and onward, Chucky became the official brand name of the film series. Bride of Chucky follows the events of <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> 3 in continuity, but not tonally or in a continuation of those films' overall plot (where Chucky pursued the character Andy Barclay in the first and second films and later Ronald Tyler in the third film). This film also marks Chucky's new permanent look, a more frightening appearance in which his face is covered in stitches, staples, and scars following his fate in <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> 3. Although made seven years after, the setting is one month following the events depicted in <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> 3, as the previous film took place chronologically in 1998 anyway, eight years after <b>Child's</b> <b>Play</b> 2.
