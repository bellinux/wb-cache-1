40|$|Spring has arrived, moths {{are coming}} to our traps at night and {{sightings}} of day-flying Emperor moths are numerous particularly in southern England. So far this year we have recorded 197 individuals of 29 species in the trap at Butterfly Conservation’s Head Office in Dorset, admittedly it has only been operated on nine occasions. Common Quaker, Hebrew Character and Early Grey {{have been the most}} abundant moths with 33, 33 and 27 individuals recorded respectively. Lunar Marbled Brown are appearing in the Manor Yard trap at the moment along with the other usual suspects, <b>Clouded</b> <b>Drab,</b> Small Quaker and Muslin Moth. Hopefully you are all aware of the planned Macro-moth Atlas for Britain and Ireland which we will be publishing in 2018. The atlas will include records to the end of 2016. We only have two more field seasons to target ‘white-holes ’ and under-recorded areas so it is really important that we increase our recording effort this year. Your County Moth Recorder will be able to let you know where in your area extra effort is required. If you are planning some moth-ing holidays further afield, please contact the relevant CMR to find out where you can focus your effort to help with under-recording...|$|E
