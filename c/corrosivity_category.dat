40|$|Waterborne paints, an {{anticorrosive}} {{protection of}} steel surfaces, is an organic solvent-borne paints that helps protect steel surfaces exposed in atmospheres with different corrosivity categories. A {{prior knowledge of}} the atmospheric corrosivity including <b>corrosivity</b> <b>category</b> and corrosive agents present {{is essential for the}} correct specification of paint system. It is recommended to use paint systems with zinc-rich primers in atmospheres of great corrosivity such as marine atmospheres and damaged coating areas to assure good anticorrosive protection. Various tests were performed before and after atmospheric exposure to explain the behavior, adhesion characteristics, and water absorption rates, and it is observed that three waterborne paint systems including W 4, W 7, and W 8 has the best overall anticorrosive behavior. These waterborne paint systems are the epoxy systems with zinc powder pigments in their respective primers and these systems present relatively low water absorption rates. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka {{has made}} a {{significant}} development {{in the design and}} construction sector during the last 10 years. The use of steel is one of the governing construction materials in the industries. One of the major concerns of existing steel structures is the durability. Corrosion and deterioration have become major challenges in the lifetime of the structure, as {{it is one of the}} major public focuses on the structures. Standards are intended to assist engineers and corrosion experts in adopting best practice in corrosion protection of structural steel at new constructions with proper identification of an actual exposure. There are six environmental corrosivity categories according to BS ISO 12944 as C 1, C 2 C 3, C 4, C 5 and C 5 –M. Those are according to BS standard and they should be adapted for Sri Lanka. In this research environmental <b>corrosivity</b> <b>category</b> of SC 1, SC 2, SC 3 and SC 4 are classified for Sri Lanka considering corrosion affecting factors temperature, rainfall, coastal region and industrial zones. A field survey was carried out in different locations of the structure in the country to identify the pattern of corrosion according to variation of corrosion affecting factors. Among the methods used to clean the surface of the steel before applying corrosion protection, sand blasting cleans best. However, it cannot be carried out in every location due to environmental issues and equipment required. Steel surface is difficult to clean using light tools because temporary stabilized corroded layer on the steel surface. If we change this surface (Convert surface grade A to Surface grade B), the light tools can be used for the surface preparation. Therefore a new method is proposed to change this surface grade. Firstly, sea water is sprayed on to the surface to increase the rate of corrosion and left for a day for rust to appear. Then it is cleaned by fresh water and surface salinity level should be checked using salinity meter. Then the surface can be prepared using “Cup-Brush application” method without using sand blasting. By this method well cleaned surface can be obtained and then the surface protection primer is applied on it immediately. This surface protection primer type and primer and paint thickness should be defined according to environmental <b>corrosivity</b> <b>category...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} new paint {{systems that are}} less harmful to the {{environment}} and to man than traditional solvent-borne systems, but have identical anti-corrosive characteristics, is an issue of great interest at the present time. The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder paint systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in industrial atmospheres. In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester powder paints only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium <b>corrosivity</b> <b>category</b> (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.

In order to overcome such difficulty, this paper presents a method to automatically determine corrosive factors categories using detected environmental factors data instead of expert scoring. In this method, Bayesian network was used to build the mathematical model. And the inference was obtained by clique tree algorithm.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This work {{reports the}} {{deposition}} onto high voltage insulators and correlation to atmospheric corrosivity measurement. This work includes corrosion studies at 15 sites in New Zealand (1, 816 tests) for {{in excess of}} 12 months, and co-operative research in South Africa. In addition, to confirm the relevance and transportability of this proposed model, {{a review of the}} published international data on deposition rates on insulators was conducted. It was noted that the deposition rate of airborne pollutants onto a surface is dependent upon the true surface area facing the wind and the aerodynamic properties of the surface. Such is the effect that surfaces with minimal exposure to the wind such as horizontal plates, {{have been shown to be}} poor collectors of deposits while vertical plates are more efficient, followed by high voltage glass insulators, the ISO 9223 salt candle, and the largest collector is the Direct Dust Deposit Gauge. This study found that the ISO 9223 wet salt candle and the average annual deposition rate on the High Voltage Glass insulator bottom surface (unenergized) provided relatively similar deposition results. The deposition onto insulator surfaces may be a more relevant method as it replicates deposition on large surfaces. This Equivalent Salt Dry Deposition (ESDD) method for HV insulators is an all inclusive measure of the airborne pollutants deposition rate and converts the total deposited material into a single value equivalent to that of salt, even though the deposit may consist of sulphur, marine salts, nitrates, and other conductive pollutants. The measured deposition rate on the sheltered insulator bottoms at 85 sites around the world predicted 87 % of the ISO <b>corrosivity</b> <b>categories</b> (based on zinc corrosion) for these sites. Results from equatorial Asia appear to be non-compliant and warrant further investigation. The ESDD values are now being quoted from around the world, by electrical engineers who use the recently revised CIGRE methodology, to determine the probability of arc-over (shorting to earth) of high voltage cables due to pollution build-up on insulators. The implications from this research are significant, with the cost of atmospheric corrosivity studies becoming prohibitively expensive, this method converts technically valid surface deposition results from the electrical engineers from around the world (provided at no cost), to valid empirical corrosivity rates from often remote locations...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{coatings}} play {{a prominent}} economical role for protection of steel against corrosion. The driving forces {{for the development}} and application of water based coatings for corrosion protection are the challenges of increasing environmental requirements and the compliance with legislative regulations. In terms of these requirements, anti-corrosive coatings, based on polymer dispersions, e. g. acrylates and acrylate co-polymers, may offer best preconditions since they have further advantages concerning toxicity and work hygiene. Up to now polymer dispersions show intrinsic weaknesses in anti-corrosive behaviour. Especially in contrast to coatings, based on two-pack EP binders, coatings with polymer dispersions reveal low performance under salt spray conditions, according to <b>corrosivity</b> <b>categories</b> {{greater than or equal}} to C 3. One objective of this study is the search for the causes of these weaknesses, in order to find out principles or criteria for selecting polymer dispersions with a high anticorrosive potential for coatings. The other approach is to study specific contributions and synergies of fillers and anticorrosive pigments. Functional additives and their structure/property-relationships with polymer dispersions for significantly improving the barrier properties of coatings are studied as well. Derived from the frequently occurring failure modes, i. e. blistering and undercreepage due to cathodic delamination, another focus of this work is on the question, how to block the pathways for water, electrolytes and oxygen through the coating film and along the interface between coating film and steel surface, to improve the lateral barrier against cathodic delamination. This could be done via means of better modelling of the polymer to/on the steel surface topography. Also under consideration is the role of electrolytes, trapped as traces in polymer films, as an inherent weakness of polymer dispersions, originating from the polymerization process. Within this work a screening with over ten different polymer dispersions, based on styrene acrylates, formulated in three variants, is performed. The formulated coatings are applied to blasted steel surfaces. After standardized drying, the coated samples are tested with standard short-time corrosion tests, under salt spray and condensation-water atmosphere. The undercreepage on defined scribes, respectively the extent of blistering on the coating surface, were evaluated as a function of polymer dispersion type, pigmentation, anticorrosion pigment, film thickness, and single or two layer systems. Studies of water and electrolyte penetration through the polymer film to and along the interfaces between steel and organic coating with EIS, SKP and sorption kinetics measurements will give insights into the start, progress and extent of the corrosion process and are a measure for the estimation of the corrosion protection performance of the system. These results can help to identify the main factors of polymer dispersions influencing the anti-corrosion properties of coatings, and, in addition, important indications for paint producers and suppliers of polymer dispersions can be derived...|$|R
