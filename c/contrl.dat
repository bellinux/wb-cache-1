40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} undiscounted reinforcement learning in continuous state space. Regret bounds in this setting usually hold under various assumptions {{on the structure of}} the reward andtransition function. Under the assumption that the rewards andtransition probabilities are Lipschitz, for 1 -dimensional state space a regret bound of Õ(T^ 3 / 4) after any T steps has been given by <b>contrl.</b> Here we improve upon this result by using non-parametric kernel density estimation for estimating the transition probability distributions,and obtain regret bounds that depend on the smoothness of the transition probability distributions. In particular, under the assumption that the transition probability functions are smoothly differentiable, the regret bound is shown to be Õ(T^ 2 / 3) asymptotically for reinforcement learning in 1 -dimensional state space. Finally, we also derive improved regret bounds for higher dimensional state space...|$|E

Our analystical model shows that multilateral resitance dampens the imapct of FTAs on trade by less in South-South agreements than in North-South agreements, which accentuates the difference implied by our gravity model coefficients, and that this difference gets larger {{as the number of}} signatories rises. For example, allowing for lags and multilateral resistance, a four-country North-South agreement rasies bilateral trade by 53 % while the analogous South-South impact is 107 %...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{time-sharing}} system in which users may join after paying an appropriate toll and are subjected to service and waiting charges. The form of an optimal joining policy that minimizes the expected loss of users who may join the system at some of its queues is derived, and is {{shown to be a}} control-limit policy with a single control number for every possible entry queue; a newly arriving user will join the minimal-priority entry queue that is not filled up to its <b>contrl</b> number. Tolls and charges that maximize the average expected revenue of the system, as well as the control numbers, are determined for a round-robin time-sharing system. A multi-entrance foreground-background time-sharing system with random entrance is analyzed and the characteristics of the system, such as expected waiting times and expected number of waiting users in each queue, are given. It is shown that when the entry into this system is based on tolls and charges, there exists a set of prices (and associated control numbers) that maximizes the discounted expected revenues of the system...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} scheme, based on Gilbert's {{algorithm}} for quadratic minimization [SIAM J. <b>Contrl.,</b> vol. 4, pp. 61 - 80, 1966], to prove separation between a point and an arbitrary convex set S⊂R^n via calls to an oracle {{able to perform}} linear optimizations over S. Compared to other methods, our scheme has almost negligible memory requirements {{and the number of}} calls to the optimization oracle does not depend on the dimensionality n of the underlying space. We study the speed of convergence of the scheme under different promises on the shape of the set S and/or the location of the point, validating the accuracy of our theoretical bounds with numerical examples. Finally, we present some applications of the scheme in quantum information theory. There we find that our algorithm out-performs existing linear programming methods for certain large scale problems, allowing us to certify nonlocality in bipartite scenarios with upto 42 measurement settings. We apply the algorithm to upper bound the visibility of two-qubit Werner states, hence improving known lower bounds on Grothendieck's constant K_G(3). Similarly, we compute new upper bounds on the visibility of GHZ states and on the steerability limit of Werner states for a fixed number of measurement settings.

40|$|In {{the climactic}} {{scene of the}} highly-acclaimed Saving Private Ryan, the beleaguered Ranger and Airborne forces of Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) {{are about to be}} overrun. Against {{overwhelming}} odds they have fought to save a crucial stone bridge over the Merderet River. It is a losing battle. With defeat imminent, the Americans retreats across the bridge and prepare to blow it. However, before that can happen, Captain Miller is shot and is unable to detonate the explosives. As a German tank rumbles across the bridge it appears all is lost. Then, in typical Hollywood tradition, the calvary arrives [...] two P- 51 Mustangs. With uncanny timeliness and pinpoint accuracy they knock out the German tank on their first pass without destroying either the bridge or the American infantry who are mere yards away. Though this may be a fitting end to a very good movie, it is not representative of the capabilities of tactical air power, especially early in the Normandy campaign. Leaving aside the question of accuracy, the system of air support in place {{at the outset of the}} invasion was much too cumbersome to allow an intervention of this nature. The Americans went into Normandy with a system of Close Air Support (CAS) that was largely derived from the British experience in North Africa. It was based on the belief that centralized <b>contrl</b> of air assets was the most effective method of employment. However, following D-Day, the system in place was far too unwieldy to provide effective support. Over the next three months, most of the existing doctrine was effectively discarded. An air support organization emerged that was the complete antithesis to that with which the Americans had started. The system which evolved proved to be highly effective, flexible and able to adapt quickly to a variety of situations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is predominately {{a review}} of literature regarding the midwives' role in preparation for parenthood. The literature is reviewed to assess the evolution, purpose and aims and effectiveness of antenatal education. Funfamental issues regarding how education in general can serve to oppress or liberate are examined along with the purpose and aims specific to antenatal education. The study concludes {{that there are many}} differing aims of antenatal education, often causing a lack of clarity for the midwives who deliver this education. This dissertation examines studies on measures, benefits and effectiveness and finds that the results of these stdies are often inconclusive and sometimes contradictory. A small scale primary study using postal questionnaires informs the dissertation. Qiestionnaires were sent to all mothers who delivered during a two week period three months and six months prior to receiving the questionnaire. Questionnaires were also given to all practising midwives working in the same area. The questionnaires aimed to identify whether clients' expressed needs were matched with midwives' perceptions of client needs. An analysis of the results shows that both midwives and clients agree that the subjects of labour and delivery and pain relief during labour are the most important subjects to discuss during antenatal education. In the study both clients and midwives prefer antenatal education to be delivered on a one-to-one basis. Midwives recognise a need for increased education for themselves to develop their teaching skills with regular updates. It was found that most midwives considered that their training was not sufficicent for this role. The dissertation recommends that antenatal education should serve to liberate parents and empower women, enabling them to take <b>contrl</b> and make informed choice during the process of childbirth. It advocates that midwives should be supported and helped to take on this role. The need to explore alternative methods of delivering antenatal education is identified...|$|E
