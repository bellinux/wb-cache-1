In Canada, <b>clinical</b> <b>chemists</b> {{are members of the}} medical laboratory management team that consists of pathologists, laboratory managers and senior technologists. They are primarily responsible for setting the standards of performance for the clinical biochemistry laboratory. They use skills developed through post doctoral training programs to ensure that laboratory services {{meet the needs of the}} patients while being delivered in an efficient manner. They monitor the quality of the testing services and act as technical experts to evaluate and select methods and instrumentation.

50|$|Michael Somogyi {{was born}} on March 7, 1883 {{in the village of}} Zsámánd in Hungary, Austria-Hungary (today Reinersdorf, part of Heiligenbrunn, Austria). He {{graduated}} in chemistry from the University of Budapest in 1905 and then went to the United States. At first, he had trouble finding suitable work, but eventually he obtained a position as an assistant of biochemistry at the Cornell University Medical College, NY where he was active until 1908. That year Somogyi returned to Budapest to become chief chemist at the municipal laboratory. He obtained a doctorate from the University of Budapest in 1914. In 1922, his colleague P. A. Schaffer at Cornell University persuaded him to return to the USA to become a professor of biochemistry at the Washington University's medical school in St. Louis. The first insulin treatment of a child with diabetes in the USA in October 1922 was done with a preparation of insulin produced by Somogyi. In 1926, he became first chemist at the Jewish Hospital, St. Louis. In his first year working as a <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist</b> in St. Louis, he introduced a method for determining reducing sugars in human blood. He took a special interest in diabetic patients and in 1938, {{at a meeting of the}} medical society in St. Louis to the theme of “unstable, severe diabetic patients”, Somogyi first presented his theory that insulin treatment in itself might cause unstable diabetes. In 1940 he developed a method for the determination of serum amylase in healthy and diabetic individuals. He is also credited with devising a test for acute pancreatitis. Somogyi was active at the Jewish Hospital of St. Louis until his retirement in 1957.He died from a stroke on 21 July 1971.|$|E

However, this must always be preceded by eval-uations of safety in animals. It is the role of clinical chemistry in the assessment of drug safety in laboratory animals that is the subject of this commentary. There are many differences between the practice of clinical chemistry in a clinical setting and that practiced in drug-safety evaluation studies in industrial research.

40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of a}} charitable children’s hospital {{and the evolution of}} its clinical laboratory are presented. With the appearance of practical quantitative blood chemistry tests in the period between the two World Wars, applications to pediatrics were hampered by the need for ultramicro procedures then unavailable and for improved skin-puncture blood sampling. World War II brought economic demands that forced the hos-pital to privatize its beds and to charge fee-for-services. In turn, this brought added income, allowing the hiring or subsidizing of a professional staff, including the <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist.</b> The development of ultramicro blood chemistry followed, along with improved skin-puncture technology. © 2000 American Association for Clinical Chemistry Restrictions in the volume of blood samples available from children slowed the application of rapidly growing quantitative analytical methods seemingly developed for adults. The newborn (full-term and premature) and infant (up to; 2 years) were universally most in need of the clinical chemist’s attention. How we tried to solve this unique challenging problem in our institution provides the impetus for this report.

40|$|CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, {{the science}} in whieh {{chemical}} and biologic analy-sis of body fluids and tissues {{is used in}} the diagnosis and treatment of disease, is undergoing rapid change. Engineers and physicists have entered the field and have designed automated and mechanized equip-ment which, some people postulate, eventually may replace not only the technician, but also the <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist.</b> I feel, however, that there is more to clinical chemistry than the mere performance of laboratory tests. The <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist</b> must be, as the playwright wrote, a man for all seasons. He must be a capable administrator of his laboratory, able to solve the many personnel and instrumentation problems that face him daily. He must understand the fundamentals of biochemistry and immunochemistry, and keep abreast of all of the rapid changes in these burgeoning fields. He must be able not only to initiate new organic and inorganic analyses of biologic material, but also to recognize and appreciate the development of physical science and engineering, and perhaps most importantly, to discriminate between industrial science fiction and reality. Finally, during his training, and perhaps also as a result of strenuous personal effort, he must have obtained at least a smattering of ignorance in the art of clinical medicine so that he can provide the clinicians with the proper counseling for their myriad of pathologic-biochemical problems. Therefore, I hope that the modern <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist</b> will not pass into the liml) o of medical and chemical history, dragging his pipets, burets, and AutoAnalyzers behind him. I hope he will not go quietly into the dark night, but instead, rage, rage against the monsters of mechanization and computer conformity. A review of the early history of clinical chemistry may help him arm against these modern horrors and help him gain an appreciation of the background of this hybrid science and of the many interesting individ-uals-scientists, physicians, priests, wizards, and charlatans-who have contributed {{to the development of the}} field...|$|E

40|$|During the mid- 1960 s, the {{clinical}} chemistry profession {{began to take}} on new substance and new directions as its significance in the general US healthcare system came more prominently into public view. In part, this was precipitated by concern about the at-times unscrupulous and unprofessional conduct of certain laboratories in their treatment of human specimens obtained {{as part of the}} diagnostic process. “Sink testing, ” as it was referred to by the press, had all the makings of a national scandal. Prompt and efficient action was required to focus proper attention on the professionality of <b>clinical</b> <b>chemists.</b> The American Association of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Chemists</b> (as AACC was then named) was greatly concerned, but lacked the re-sources to become pivotally involved on its own. As a consequence, an effective working relationship was estab-lished with the American Chemical Society (ACS). aacc beginnings In 1950, the AACC had perceived the need to underscore the competency of adequately trained and experienced <b>clinical</b> <b>chemists</b> by helping to form the American Board of Clinical Chemistry (ABCC) to certify practitioners of clinical chemistry. Those who were certified had to hold a PhD degree or its equivalent and were certified by virtue of a rigorous written examination. By the 1960 s, it was recognized that the profession included a larger corps of qualified professionals, many of them at the BS and MS levels, who also were vital to clinical chemistry. As a result, the National Registry in Clinical Chemistry (NRCC) was created in 1967 to certify these professionals also. Pivotally involved in its formation were AACC...|$|R
40|$|The {{reference}} values concept {{has been adopted}} by health care professionals, including <b>clinical</b> <b>chemists,</b> laboratory scientists and clinicians and simultaneously by all the official organizations {{in charge of the}} establishment of legislation.

Recently, a group of experts started a revision process (1). The procedures for obtaining {{reference values}}, if we follow the original documents, are complex, and that is the main reason that <b>clinical</b> <b>chemists</b> or diagnostic kit manufacturers have not used them systematically. More than that, when the laboratory scientists try to use the papers describing the concept, they do not supply enough details and do not use them as rigorously as they should. There is also now a clear confusion between the notion of reference values and reference limits and that of decision limits. And finally the methods used for determining these limits are not sufficiently defined...|$|R

This survey should help familiarize them with the names and significance of the contributions of physicians and chemists such as Fourcroy, Berzelius, Liebig, Prout, Bright, and Rees. Folin and Van Slyke are better known, and it was their work {{near the end of}} the second decade of the 20 th century that brought the <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist</b> out of the annex of the mortuary and into close relationship with the patient at the bedside.

In the closing decades of the 20 th century, automated devices produced an overabundance, and an overuse and misuse, of testing to the detriment of careful history taking and bedside examination of the patient. This is attributable in part to a fascination with machine-pro-duced data. There was also an increased awareness of the value of chemical methods of diagnosis and the need to bring clinician and <b>clinical</b> <b>chemist</b> into a closer partnership.
