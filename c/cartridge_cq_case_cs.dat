30|$|The {{conditional}} collision risk {{is increased}} {{by a factor}} of 1.9 in the hypothetical <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 5 where PF-TO is the only agent not monitoring the traffic situation. In <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 8, where no ATC alerts are generated and both PF-TO and ATCo-R are not monitoring, the risk is higher {{by a factor of}} 76 with respect to <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 4. This indicates that an active monitoring of PF-TO considerably restricts the risk in cases that involve both the lack of monitoring of ATCo-R, and malfunctioning of ATC alerts (<b>Case</b> <b>C</b> 4 versus C 8). The risk is also reduced by the active monitoring of PF-TO (factor of 11) in case no ATC alerts are generated (<b>Case</b> <b>C</b> 2 versus C 6). The role of PF-TO in restricting the risk is however limited when PF-TX is not actively monitoring the traffic situation. This can be noticed when comparing <b>cases</b> <b>C</b> 9 with C 13, C 10 with C 14, C 11 with C 15, and C 12 with C 16.|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} category, the risk {{increase}} factor {{with respect to}} C 1 is between 60 and 556. The risk levels are high and {{are in the range}} between 1.0 E- 2 (<b>case</b> <b>C</b> 9) and 9.5 E- 2 (<b>case</b> <b>C</b> 16). In almost all cases of the second category, PF-TX was not actively monitoring the traffic situation (<b>cases</b> <b>C</b> 9 -C 16). The only exception is <b>Case</b> <b>C</b> 8 where the conditional collision risk is around 1.8 E- 2. In this case however, the performance of all other agents was affected to attain similar risk levels corresponding to cases without active monitoring of PF-TX.|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} and methods of incorporating historical controls in four <b>cases</b> (<b>C</b> 1, stable control; C 2, rare occurrence of responses; C 3, small group size; C 4, historical control as a reference) are discussed. Two points are emphasized: {{one is that the}} historical control should be regarded as a given condition and the other is that the historical control should be used conservatively. Incorporating historical controls is recommended only when it is advantageous under the conditional evaluation of the performance and even in the conservative use of controls. For <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 1, adjusting the critical value for the Cochran-Armitage trend test is proposed. For <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 2, a modified conditional trend test proposed by Yanagawa et al. is appreciated as a proper procedure. For <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 3, a conservative use of interblock information is discussed. The incorporation of the historical control is not recommended for <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 4...|$|R

30|$|The {{comparison}} of cases {{with and without}} active traffic monitoring by ATCo-R indicate that in most cases, the controller’s observation does not significantly restrict the risk. This can be noticed when comparing <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 1 with <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 3. The active monitoring by ATCo-R does reduce the risk with only a factor of 1.1. Close factors can be found when comparing <b>cases</b> <b>C</b> 2 with C 4, C 5 with C 7, C 9 with C 11, C 10 with C 12, C 13 with C 15, C 14 with C 16. However, an interesting remark can be made when comparing <b>case</b> <b>C</b> 6 with C 8. Here the controller’s own visual observation does {{play a role in}} restricting the conditional collision risk when the PF-TO is not monitoring the traffic situation and the ATC alerts are not functioning.|$|R

40|$|Canine mammary tumours (CMT) are {{the most}} common {{neoplasia}} in bitches. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a fast and inexpensive technique well-tolerated by animals. Few reports have shown how difficult cytological diagnosis of CMT is and how difficult benign or malignant tumours are to classify using FNAC. Cytological diagnosis has often been inconclusive in veterinary pathology. In the diagnosis of human breast cancer, FNAC efficacy is beyond doubt due to its high specificity. In this preliminary study, our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of NHSBSP classification, applied to CMT. Secondly, we wish to test the usefulness of H&H stain in FNAC for CMT diagnosis. 75 FNAC specimens, from 41 dogs with mammary tumours were examined. 72 / 75 underwent the NHSBSP classification Histological examination of the tumours was performed in each case for comparison purposes.
