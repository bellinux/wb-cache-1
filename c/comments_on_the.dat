5|$|Beginning with Michel Zink, whose {{influential}} 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge: Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole {{ushered in}} a new era of criticism, critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole as a work of literature about literature, a self-referential poem that <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status, encouraging a trend in studies of Renart and his work.|$|E

5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> play.

5|$|In Facundo, Sarmiento is {{both the}} narrator and a main character. The book {{contains}} autobiographical elements from Sarmiento’s life, and he <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire Argentine circumstance. He also expresses and analyzes his own opinion and chronicles some historic events. Within the book's dichotomy between civilization and barbarism, Sarmiento's character represents civilization, steeped as he is in European and North American ideas; he stands for education and development, as opposed to Rosas and Facundo, who symbolize barbarism.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> definitions of femininity and masculinity {{in the early}} nineteenth century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs.

5|$|The {{film was}} met with {{favorable}} reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph offers general praise for the good photography and the well-told story. The Nickelodeon was equally positive and began to reflect the acting, staging and photography {{was up to the}} regular standard of the Thanhouser company. The New York Dramatic Mirror offered additional <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Thanhouser company's higher standards in their productions, but gave an otherwise positive review that focused on the novelty of the circus scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio.

5|$|Gaudí left {{hardly any}} written documents, apart from {{technical}} reports {{of his works}} required by official authorities, some letters to friends (particularly to Joan Maragall) and a few journal articles. Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc Ràfols, Joan Bergós, Cèsar Martinell and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaudí left {{is known as the}} Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873–1878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject. Included are an analysis of the Christian church and of his ancestral home, as well as a text about ornamentation and <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> design of a desk.|$|E

Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E
