5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and <b>choline,</b> as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> can {{be found}} in milk as free <b>choline,</b> phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine, and <b>choline</b> levels within breast milk are {{correlated}} with <b>choline</b> levels in maternal blood. <b>Choline</b> consumed via breast milk has been shown to impact blood levels of <b>choline</b> in breast-fed infants – indicating that <b>choline</b> consumed in breast milk is entering the neonatal system. <b>Choline</b> may enter the milk supply either directly from the maternal blood supply, or choline-containing nutrients may be produced within the mammary epithelium. <b>Choline</b> reaches the milk through a transporter specific for <b>choline</b> from the maternal blood supply (against a concentration gradient) into the mammary epithelial cells. At high concentrations (greater than that typically seen in humans), <b>choline</b> can diffuse across the cell membrane into the mammary epithelium cell. At more normal concentrations, it passes via what is believed to be a calcium/sodium-dependent, phosphorylation-related, active transporter into the cell.|$|E
25|$|While {{maternal}} {{stores of}} <b>choline</b> are depleted during pregnancy and lactation, the placenta accumulates <b>choline</b> by pumping <b>choline</b> against the concentration gradient into the tissue, {{where it is}} then stored in various forms, most interestingly as acetylcholine, (an uncommon occurrence outside of neural tissue). The fetus itself is exposed to a very high <b>choline</b> environment as a result, and <b>choline</b> concentrations in amniotic fluid can be ten times higher than in maternal blood. This high concentration is assumed to allow <b>choline</b> to be abundantly available to tissues and cross the blood-brain barrier effectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> uptake {{into the}} brain is {{controlled}} by a low-affinity transporter located at the blood-brain barrier. Transport occurs when arterial plasma <b>choline</b> concentrations increase above 14 μmol/l, which can occur during a spike in <b>choline</b> concentration after consuming choline-rich foods. Neurons, conversely, acquire <b>choline</b> by both high- and low-affinity transporters. <b>Choline</b> is stored as membrane-bound phosphytidylcholine, which can then be used for acetylcholine neurotransmitter synthesis later. Acetylcholine is formed as needed, travels across the synapse, and transmits the signal to the following neuron. Afterwards, acetylcholinesterase degrades it, and the free <b>choline</b> is taken up by a high-affinity transporter into the neuron again.|$|E
25|$|The US Food and Drug Administration {{requires}} that infant formula not made from cow's milk be supplemented with <b>choline.</b> Choline-providing dietary supplement ingredients include: <b>choline</b> chloride, <b>choline</b> bitartrate, citicoline (CDP-choline), L-alpha-glycerophosphocholine (Alpha-GPC), lecithin, phosphatidylcholine.|$|E
25|$|Carbon-11 <b>choline</b> {{has found}} more success in cancer systems imaging. <b>Choline</b> is a {{precursor}} for {{the synthesis of}} phospholipids in our cells. When a cell is about to divide, it synthesizes these phospholipids to generate enough material to build the cell membranes of the two daughter cells. Thus {{it was hypothesized that}} highly proliferative tumors would uptake more <b>choline</b> than the surrounding healthy tissue. This was first tested in brain tumors after successful demonstration of <b>choline</b> uptake in the brain. It was found that these brain tumors had over 10x the uptake of carbon-11 <b>choline</b> than the surrounding brain tissue. Furthermore, because of the low <b>choline</b> uptake in healthy brain tissue, carbon-11 <b>choline</b> was found to be a superior PET tracer than fluorine-18 Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) when delineating brain tumors. Carbon-11 <b>choline</b> has also been used to detect tumors in the colon and esophagus and lung metastases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> in food {{exists in}} either a free or esterified form (<b>choline</b> bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an ester linkage). Although all forms are most likely usable, some {{evidence}} indicates they are unequally bioavailable (able {{to be used by}} the body). Lipid-soluble forms (such as phosphytidylcholine) bypass the liver once absorbed, while water-soluble forms (such as free <b>choline)</b> enter the liver portal circulation and are generally absorbed by the liver. Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for <b>choline</b> dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more <b>choline</b> de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for <b>choline</b> is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt -/- mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental <b>choline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some animals cannot produce <b>choline,</b> {{but must}} consume it through their diet to remain healthy. Humans make <b>choline</b> in the liver. Whether dietary or {{supplemental}} <b>choline</b> is beneficial or harmful to humans {{has not been}} determined. Possible benefits include {{reducing the risk of}} neural tube defects and fatty liver disease. It has also been found that intake of <b>choline</b> during pregnancy can have long-term beneficial effects on memory for the child.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} can produce <b>choline</b> by {{methylation}} of phosphatidylethanolamine by N-methyltranferase (PEMT) to form phosphatidylcholine in the liver, {{or it may}} be consumed from the diet. It has been demonstrated that both de novo production and dietary consumption are necessary, as humans eating diets lacking <b>choline</b> develop fatty liver, liver damage, and muscle damage. However, because of the close interplay between <b>choline,</b> folate, methionine, and vitamin B12, (whose pathways overlap), the function of <b>choline</b> can be complex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> {{deficiency}} {{may play}} a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders. One sign of <b>choline</b> deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT. If low <b>choline</b> intake causes an elevated homocysteine level, it raises the risk for preeclampsia, premature birth, and very low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> is a {{quaternary}} ammonium salt with the chemical formula (CH3)3N+(CH2)2OHX−, where X− is a counterion such as chloride (see <b>choline</b> chloride), hydroxide or tartrate. <b>Choline</b> chloride can form a low-melting deep eutectic solvent mixture with urea with unusual properties. The salicylate salt is used topically for pain relief of aphthous ulcers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Adolph Strecker from pig and ox bile (Greek: χολή, chole) in 1862. When {{it was first}} chemically synthesized by Oscar Liebreich in 1865, it was known as neurine until 1898 when it was shown to be chemically identical to <b>choline.</b> In 1998, <b>choline</b> was classified as an essential nutrient by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (USA).|$|E
25|$|While folate is most {{well known}} for {{preventing}} neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and <b>choline</b> metabolism are interrelated. Both <b>choline</b> and folate (with the help of vitamin B12) can act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can {{then go on to}} form SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary <b>choline</b> deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and <b>choline</b> are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production. Inhibition of <b>choline</b> absorption and use is associated with neural-tube defects in mice, and this may also occur in humans. A retrospective case control study (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily <b>choline</b> intake had a four-fold greater risk of having a child with a neural-tube defect than women in the highest quartile of intake.|$|E
25|$|Methionine and folate {{are known}} to {{interact}} with <b>choline</b> while homocysteine is undergoing methylation to produce methionine. Recent {{studies have shown that}} <b>choline</b> deficiency may have adverse effects, even when sufficient amounts of methionine and folate are present.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> {{increases}} carnitine uptake and retention. <b>Choline</b> supplements are inexpensive, safe (probably even in {{all children}} requiring anticholinergics) and can provide spectacular {{evidence of the}} suboptimal efficiency of carnitine supplementation by increasing exercise tolerance, truncal tone and general well-being.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine is {{synthesized}} {{in certain}} neurons by the enzyme <b>choline</b> acetyltransferase from the compounds <b>choline</b> and acetyl-CoA. Cholinergic neurons {{are capable of}} producing ACh. An example of a central cholinergic area is the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{involvement}} in biologic processes, several medical imaging techniques {{have been developed}} to monitor relative concentration and kinetics of <b>choline</b> in different diseases. Radiolabeling one of the nitrogen methyl groups on <b>choline</b> with carbon-11 allows it {{to be used as a}} tracer in PET imaging studies. Carbon-11 is radioactive with a half-life of 20.38 minutes. By monitoring the gamma radiation resulting from the decay of carbon-11, the uptake and retention of carbon-11 <b>choline</b> in different parts of the body can be measured.|$|E
25|$|Human milk {{is rich in}} <b>choline,</b> but {{formulas}} {{derived from}} other sources, particularly soy, have lower total <b>choline</b> concentrations than human milk. Bovine milk and bovine-derived formulas had similar or higher glycerophosphocholine compared to human milk, and soy-derived formulas had lower glycerophosphocholine content. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations were similar between bovine formulas and human milk, but soy-derived infant formulas had more phosphatidylcholine than human or bovine sources. Soy-derived formulas had less sphingomyelin than human milk, which is a concern, since sphingomyelin is used for producing myelin, which insulates neurons. Free <b>choline</b> concentrations in mature human milk were 30–80% lower than those found in bovine milk or formulas. Mature human milk also has lower free <b>choline</b> than colostrum-transitional human milk. Phosphocholine is particularly abundant in human milk.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} uses of carbon-11 <b>choline</b> in PET imaging was with Alzheimer's disease patients. <b>Choline</b> is the {{precursor}} to neurotransmitter acetylcholine whose cholinergic activity is impaired in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s. While there was uptake of the tracer in the brain, no pharmacokinetic pattern was found.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} another disease where carbon-11 <b>choline</b> PET imaging has found success. As with the brain, {{there is too}} much signal from the {{surrounding}} tissue, especially the bladder, to accurately measure tumor uptake with fluorine-18 FDG. While it was shown carbon-11 <b>choline</b> could be used to detect the initiation of prostate cancer, its value was found in detecting prostate cancer recurrence when it is the most deadly. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved carbon-11 <b>choline</b> as an imaging agent to be used during a PET scan to detect recurrent prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Besides cauliflower, other cruciferous {{vegetables}} {{may also}} be good sources of <b>choline.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> {{hydroxide}} {{is one of}} {{the class}} of phase transfer catalysts that are used to carry the hydroxide ion into organic systems, and, therefore, is considered a strong base. It is the least-costly phase transfer catalyst, and is used as an effective method of stripping photoresists in circuit boards. <b>Choline</b> hydroxide is not completely stable, and it slowly breaks down into trimethylamine.|$|E
25|$|Examples include {{nicotine}} (by definition), acetylcholine (the endogenous agonist of nAChRs), <b>choline,</b> epibatidine, lobeline, varenicline and cytisine.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} are <b>choline</b> values for {{a selection of}} foods in quantities that people may consume in a day.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the brain}} {{continues}} to develop after birth, {{and does not}} become similar to its adult structure until around four years of age. By feeding infants formula instead of milk, and presumably through differences in <b>choline</b> amount in the breast milk of mothers consuming different <b>choline</b> levels, the still-developing brain of an infant may be impacted, which may, in part, contribute to the differences seen between individual adult humans in memory and recall.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} urea and <b>choline</b> {{chloride}} {{is used as}} a deep eutectic solvent, a type of ionic liquid.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy pathway, which {{includes}} the transformation of <b>choline</b> to citicoline, by way of phosphorylcholine, to produce phosphatidylcholine when condensed with diacylglycerol.|$|E
25|$|Other {{derivatives}} include {{methyl salicylate}} {{used as a}} liniment to soothe joint and muscle pain and <b>choline</b> salicylate used topically to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Saliva stimulants – {{organic acids}} (ascorbic acid, malic acid), chewing gum, {{parasympathomimetic}} drugs (<b>choline</b> esters, e.g. pilocarpine hydrochloride, cholinesterase inhibitors), and other substances (sugar-free mints, nicotinamide).|$|E
25|$|<b>Choline</b> is a {{precursor}} to trimethylamine, which some persons {{are not able to}} break down due to a genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria. Persons suffering from this disorder may suffer from a strong fishy or otherwise unpleasant body odor, due to the body's release of odorous trimethylamine. A body odor will occur even on a normal diet i.e., one that is not particularly high in <b>choline.</b> Persons with trimethylaminuria are advised to restrict the intake of foods high in choline; this may help to reduce the sufferer's body odor.|$|E
25|$|Involvement of <b>choline</b> in {{long-term}} health {{and development of}} clinical disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, cognitive decline in aging and regulation of blood lipid levels, has not been well-defined.|$|E
25|$|DHA modulates the carrier-mediated {{transport}} of <b>choline,</b> glycine, and taurine, {{the function of}} delayed rectifier potassium channels, and the response of rhodopsin contained in the synaptic vesicles, among many other functions.|$|E
25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of <b>choline</b> deficiency in the general population. The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the <b>choline</b> made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV) based on the AI. For <b>choline,</b> as shown in Reference Daily Intake, 100% of the Daily Value is 550mg.|$|E
25|$|As both {{of these}} studies have only been done on rats, it is still unknown for certain whether the same effects of <b>choline</b> would be seen in humans. Further {{research}} in this area is needed.|$|E
25|$|Organic mercurial compounds, such as methylmercury, {{have a high}} {{affinity}} for sulfhydryl groups, which causes dysfunction of the enzyme <b>choline</b> acetyltransferase. This inhibition may lead to acetylcholine deficiency, and can have consequences on motor function.|$|E
25|$|The cation {{appears in}} the head groups of {{phosphatidylcholine}} and sphingomyelin, two classes of phospholipid that are abundant in cell membranes. <b>Choline</b> is the precursor molecule for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is involved in many functions including memory and muscle control.|$|E
