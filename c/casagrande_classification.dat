40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{clay mineral}} {{composition}} {{is one of}} the factors that affect he physical properties of soils, and a knowledge of it is required to promote a fuller understanding of the origin of these properties. The relationships between the clay content and the plastic and liquid limits of natural montmorillonitic and kaolinitic soils and of artificial mixtures have been examined and compared. Factors affecting the relationships are discussed, and illustrated by the effect of particle aggregation on the measurement of the liquid limit of tropical red clays and on the sedimentation analysis of the Keuper Marl. The effect of muscovite and of silt-sized material on the position of soils on the <b>Casagrande</b> <b>classification</b> chart has also been examined. The clay materials encountered in civil engineering include ancient deposits and recent alluvial deposits, as well as soils formed by weathering processes at the Earth's surface; the engineer efers to all these materials as soils. Clay mineral analysis is not normally employed in the routine examination of soils for particular engineering projects. This is partly because the techniques are beyond the resource...|$|E
