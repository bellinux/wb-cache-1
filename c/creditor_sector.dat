40|$|Ensuring the {{involvement}} of private <b>sector</b> <b>creditors</b> in the resolution of sovereign debt crises is crucial to ensure an effective management and orderly resolution of those crises. A review of experience gained in past financial crises suggests that crisis management practices have been largely following a case-by-case approach. This has led to some uncertainty about how the official sector addresses different types of crises, which in turn might partially account for the very mixed results achieved so far. From a global welfare perspective, the resolution of international financial crises is too costly and takes too long. Efforts to improve predictability of crisis resolution processes – through guiding debtor, <b>creditor</b> and official <b>sector</b> behaviour – could lower overall costs of such crises and bring about a better distribution of these costs. Past experience with such private sector involvement shows that, in certain cases, existing instruments have successfully contributed to minimising the economic disruptions caused by crises. However, the effective use of these instruments requires predictable and strong commitment of all parties involved. Key variables in that regard are the country’s economic fundamentals and its track record prior to the crisis, underscoring the importance of effective surveillance and crisis prevention. Success also hinges on the country’s resolve to implement necessary domestic adjustment measures. A transparent process providing for early dialogue between a debtor and its creditors also facilitates private sector involvement. Finally, the IMF {{plays a key role}} in crisis situations, as accurate and timely diagnosis by the IMF helps identify at an early stage the need for private sector involvement.

40|$|The Eurozone {{official}} {{sector has}} {{declared that the}} belated restructuring of Greek bonds held by private <b>sector</b> <b>creditors</b> in 2012 was a “unique and exceptional” event, never, ever to be repeated in any other Eurozone country. Maybe so. But if this assurance proves in time to be as fragile as the official sector’s prior pronouncements {{on the subject of}} “private sector involvement” in Eurozone sovereign debt problems, any future Eurozone debt restructuring will be surely plagued by the problem of non-participating creditors [...] - holdouts. Indeed, it is the undisguised fear of holdouts and the prospect of a messy, Argentine-style debt restructuring in the belly of Europe that {{has been one of the}} principal motivations for the official sector’s willingness to use its taxpayer money to repay, in full and on time, all of the private <b>sector</b> <b>creditors</b> of Eurozone countries receiving bailouts (the belated Greek restructuring being the sole exception). This article argues that a simple amendment of the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (the Eurozone’s new bailout facility) could immunize within the confines of the Eurozone the assets of a Eurozone country receiving ESM bailout assistance from attachment by litigious holdout creditors. By thus increasing the difficulties that holdouts would face in enforcing court judgments against a debtor country, the objective of the amendment is to deflate creditor expectations that staying out of an ESM-supported sovereign debt restructuring will lead to a preferential recovery for the holdouts. This measure would also, when taken together with the other steps that the Eurozone has already implemented, substantially replicate the important features of the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism proposed by the IMF in 2002...|$|R

The fiscal position {{appears to be}} sustainable, if resource mobilization is strengthened. If expenditure continues to rise (relative to GDP), without any further fiscal adjustment, indicators of sustainability would begin to deteriorate. It would be important to maintain an appropriate mix between additional financing and fiscal adjustment, in order that the future debt burden does not rise excessively.

40|$|Using a multi-country {{panel of}} banks, we study whether better {{capitalized}} banks experienced higher stock returns during the financial crisis. We differentiate among {{various types of}} capital ratios: the Basel risk-adjusted ratio; the leverage ratio; the Tier I and Tier II ratios; and the tangible equity ratio. We find several results: (i) before the crisis, differences in capital {{did not have much}} impact on stock returns; (ii) during the crisis, a stronger capital position was associated with better stock market performance, most markedly for larger banks; (iii) the relationship between stock returns and capital is stronger when capital is measured by the leverage ratio rather than the risk-adjusted capital ratio; (iv) higher quality forms of capital, such as Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity, were more relevant.

40|$|As {{a prelude}} to the overall review of the debt crisis and the debt {{strategy}} in later chapters, this chapter takes an in-depth look at {{the handling of the}} crisis in Mexico. Although Mexico was not the first indebted economy to erupt, nor the largest, nor the one with the most serious economic or financial problems, the 1982 Mexican crisis was the one that alerted the IMF and the world to the possibility of a systemic collapse: a crisis that could spread to many other countries and threaten the stability of the international financial system. Moreover, the Fund’s response to Mexico in 1982 introduced important innovations in the speed of negotiations, the role of structural elements in the policy adjustment program, the assembling of official financing packages, and—most important—relations between the Fund and private <b>sector</b> <b>creditors.</b> This story also illustrates the always complex relationships between the Fund and its major creditor members. A successful resolution of Mexico’s financial difficulties was economically and politically crucial for the United States, but the extent of Mexican indebtedness put the solution out of the bilateral reach of the U. S. authorities. The challenge for the Fund was to balanc...|$|R
40|$|The euro area’s {{political}} contract requires {{member nations}} to rely principally {{on their own}} resources when confronted with severe economic distress. Since monetary policy {{is the same for}} all, national fiscal austerity is the default response to counter national fiscal stress. Moreover, the monetary policy was itself stodgy in countering the crisis, and banking-sector problems were allowed to fester. And it was considered inappropriate to impose losses on private <b>sector</b> <b>creditors.</b> Thus, the nature of the incomplete monetary union and the self-imposed taboos led deep and persistent fiscal austerity to become the norm. As a consequence, growth was hurt, which undermined the primary objective of lowering the debt burden. To prevent a meltdown, distressed nations were given official loans to repay private creditors. But the stress and instability continued and soon it became necessary to ease the repayment terms on official loans. When even that proved insufficient, the German-inspired fiscal austerity was combined with the deep pockets of the European Central Bank. The ECB’s safety net for insolvent or near-insolvent banks and sovereigns, in effect, substituted for the absent fiscal union and drew the central bank into the political process...|$|R
