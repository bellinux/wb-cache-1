Procedures for selecting design professionals, including the choice of <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criteria,</b> can be analysed as the outcome of external and internal factors that influence procuring units. This investigation studies how the selection procedures that Swedish municipal clients rely on when procuring services from architectural and engineering consultants provide incentives for environmentally sustainable design management.

40|$|Public clients {{increasingly}} use multiple criteria {{instead of}} lowest price when awarding construction contracts. This investigation gives {{a clear picture}} of how municipalities identify new award criteria and assign weights to these when abandoning the traditional lowest bid-criterion. Bidding documents from a sample of 386 Swedish municipal construction contracts procured in 2003 have been analyzed. Result show that public owners in the sample used the lowest bid criterion for 19 per cent of their contract awards. The average price weight was 65 percent and these owners used three award criteria on average. Some bidding documents provide thorough descriptions of post-bid evaluation procedures while others give little information on how bids are to be evaluated. The development of advanced <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> in the public sector, as presented here for the first time, will provide incentives for contractors to improve their skills and internal routines, thus increasing efficiency and quality in the construction sector...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{applicability}} of care quality concepts as <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> for public procurement of health and social care, using the case of Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, European and Swedish legal texts, government regulations as well as 26 Swedish court review cases concerning care procurement have been analysed. Findings – Methods used for assessing care quality are seldom useful for predicting the quality to be delivered by a potential contractor. Legal principles of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers make it necessary to apply strict requirements for verification. Research limitations/implications – Results refer primarily to a Swedish context but could be applicable throughout the EU. Further studies of relations between award criteria and public/private collaborative practices for improving care quality during contractual periods are desirable. Practical implications – Local and regional procurement officials should benefit from a better understanding of how quality criteria should be designed and applied to the award procedures for care contracts. Care providers in the private sector would also be able to develop their quality strategies and present their abilities more efficiently when tendering for public contracts. Social implications – Issues of quality of health and social care are of obvious importance for social sustainability. Public awareness of care quality problems is evident and often a cause of media concern. Originality/value – This investigation pinpoints the difference between traditional care quality thinking and the legal principles underlying contract award in public procurement of care services...|$|E
40|$|Private sector buyers often <b>award</b> {{construction}} <b>contracts</b> through negotiation {{rather than}} through open competitive tendering. Negotiating with a reputable contractor {{is a way to}} mitigate contractual hazards. For many public sector buyers, however, open competitive tendering is required by law. The practices of procurement officers in local authorities are examined in regard to the selection of construction contractors, focusing particularly on their use of scoring-based competitive tendering and ex ante information exchange between procurement officers and the firms competing for contracts. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 procurement officers in 10 local authorities in Sweden. Using the contractor's staffing of the project organization as a <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> allows procurement officers to select reputable contractors. Arranging face-to-face meetings with contractors before the final award decision allows procurement officers to resolve at least some technical problems in complex construction projects. When negotiations are prohibited by law, these practices can be seen as combined responses to hazards of construction contracting. Contracting, procurement law, public sector, Sweden,...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{analyzes the}} relationship between the number of bidders and the final cost of public contracts for IT services in the Slovak Republic. The theoretical part focuses on public procurement legislative framework in European Union a Slovak Republic. It points out the fundamental principles of public procurement and gives recommendations about suitable types of auctions for IT services. In the following section of work IT services public procurement market in Slovak Republic is studied. Both contracting authorities and companies are characterized. The empirical part examines the factors influencing the price of contracts within multiple regression analysis. Dependent variable is the ratio between the final and estimated contract value. Independent variables are the number of bidders, the type of auction, the weight of the price as a <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> and type <b>contracting</b> authority. Key aim of the thesis is to test the validity of negative relationship assumption between the number of bids and final contract price...|$|R
40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to examine what the {{differences}} are between the Classic directive (directive 2004 / 18 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts) and the Revised Classic directive (directive 2014 / 24 /EU of the European Parliament and of the council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004 / 18 /EC) when it comes to social considerations in public procurement. The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions. The regulations regarding reserved contracts, technical specifications, and selection criterion are satisfied in the Revised Classic directive. Certain changes and clarifications are still required in regards to the regulations of exclusions grounds, <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> and abnormally low tenders. The facet of the directive which requires the most significant clarification is regarding the conditions for performance of contracts.     Keywords: public procurement, social considerations, socially responsible public procuremen...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding sustainability {{have led the}} construction sector to adopt various policy instruments for reducing the impacts caused by construction activities. One such policy instrument includes impact assessment, which enables the construction sector to evaluate the environmental consequences of proposed developments at project (environmental impact assessment) and strategic (strategic environmental assessment) level. In recent years, the construction sector has also adopted green public procurement, which is a process whereby contracting authorities aim to procure services and products that meet environmental requirements. In certain contexts, green public procurement has extended to sustainable public procurement, which involves the incorporation of both environmental and social considerations in the procurement of services and products. Promoting sustainability in the constructor sector is a significant challenge. This challenge is primarily due to the requirement of high levels of cooperation among project stakeholders, on the one hand, {{and a lack of}} coordination between project planning and implementation on the other hand. Therefore, procurement plays a significant role as it establishes the tone for the interaction between contracting authorities and contractors. The overall aim of this thesis is to bolster the knowledge of promoting sustainability in the construction sector, with the specific aim of analysing the ways in which policy instruments such as environmental impact assessment and green public procurement can be reinforced to improve the coordination between planning and the implementation of sustainability considerations. This thesis conceptualises an inter-link between impact assessment and green public procurement, and identifies the opportunities to develop the inter-link. It is appropriate to plan for green public procurement at the pre-decision phase of an environmental impact assessment. The inter-link can be strengthened by involving contractors in planning for green and sustainable public procurement. One way to involve contractors is with the aid of competitive dialogue procedure, which is a procurement procedure that allows contracting authorities to hold discussions with contractors regarding the authority’s requirements. This study strengthens the conceptualisation that competitive dialogue procedure can facilitate green and sustainable public procurement. The various elements in a competitive dialogue procedure can enable the contracting authorities to ensure the consistency between the weight for environmental considerations in <b>contract</b> <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> and the relevant preferences. This thesis also discusses key concerns for progress towards sustainable public procurement, which includes among others the incorporation of sustainability values in procurement decisions. In addition, this study identified certain discourses on future trends for green and sustainable public procurement. The discourses provide an opportunity for reflection, and thereby indicate that analytical support is required to develop criteria in a way that enables the evaluation of sustainable public procurement against the background of sustainability and justice regarding natural capital. Innovation must be promoted with a focus on sustainability values. Moreover, green or sustainable public procurement must be discussed between contracting authorities and contractors in light of its contribution to sustainability. QC 20140509 </p...|$|E
