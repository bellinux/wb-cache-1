Hydrogen is a suitable energy <b>carrier,</b> its generation <b>by</b> <b>water</b> electrolysis, the conversion into heat by (catalytic) combustion and into electrical energy by fuel cells is {{the present state of}} the art. Electrolyzer and fuel cell with a solid polymer electrolyte show several advantages compared to cells with liquid electrolyte. In compact modules high energy densities and high efficiencies are realized without a costly and complicated peripheral gas and electrolyte management system. The current work is concerned with the construction of a pressure electrolyzer, a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell {{and the development of a}} "reversible" system which works as electrolyzer and fuel cell as well. The modification of the fuel cell for the use of methanol as a fuel is a promising goal. Methanol is an attractive fuel for a back up system in the case of exhausted hydrogen reverse. The electrochemical reactions of hydro gen, oxygen and methanol at membrane/electrode composites are investigated...|$|R

30|$|Based on the recoil {{energies}} {{we can now}} {{determine the}} range of the recoils in various materials that are currently considered as drug carriers in nanomedicine. For this purpose the simulation software SRIM (Ziegler et al., 2013) was used. For simplicity, when simulating the ion ranges in liposomes or polymeric nanoparticles, we replaced the <b>carrier</b> material <b>by</b> using <b>water</b> as stopping medium with a density of 1 g⋅cm- 3 which is close to the density of most polymer materials. The recoil ranges determined in this way are reported in Table 2. The results show that recoil ranges of the various recoiling daughter nuclides are very similar for a given nanoparticle material, for example, in gold they are typically around 12 nm. Therefore, a nanoparticle that carries α-particle emitters in its center and is surrounded by a gold layer of 36 nm should retain all radionuclides up to the third daughter. Assuming a nucleus diameter of (3 - 5) nm housing the radioactive payload in the nanoparticle, the diameter of a gold-encapsulated α-particle nanogenerator should not exceed approximately 75 nm before surface functionalization. Similarly, when using 230 U, gold nanoparticles with diameters as small as about 50 nm in diameter could ensure safe confinement of all daughter radionuclides up to 222 Ra.|$|R
