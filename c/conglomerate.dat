40|$|Is the {{investment}} of Korean <b>conglomerates</b> inefficient? The recent economic crisis in Korea has been blamed partly on inefficient major <b>conglomerates.</b> Although theoretically <b>conglomerates</b> {{may or may not}} be efficient, it is popular to attribute many economic illnesses to major <b>conglomerates</b> in Korea. This paper examines if Korean major <b>conglomerates</b> are indeed inefficient by examining their investments. Following Scharfstein (1998), this paper compares major <b>conglomerates</b> with the rest of the firms or stand-alone firms. Specifically, if major <b>conglomerates</b> are indeed inefficient, major <b>conglomerates</b> invest less in productive opportunities (high Tobin Q) and more in less productive opportunities (low Tobin Q) than the rest of the firms or stand-alone firms. This paper finds that major <b>conglomerates</b> invest inefficiently and therefore concludes that the recent reforms of major <b>conglomerates</b> in Korea are justified...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the optimal regulation of financial <b>conglomerates</b> that combine {{a bank and}} a non-bank financial institution. The <b>conglomerate’s</b> risk-taking incentives depend upon the level of market discipline it faces, {{which in turn is}} determined by the <b>conglomerate’s</b> liability structure. We examine optimal capital requirements for standalone institutions, for integrated financial <b>conglomerates,</b> and for financial <b>conglomerates</b> that are structured as holding companies. For a given risk profile, integrated <b>conglomerates</b> have a lower probability of failure than either their standalone or decentralized equivalent. However, when risk profiles are endogenously selected conglomeration may extend the reach of the deposit insurance safety net and hence provide incentives for increased risk-taking. As a result, integrated <b>conglomerates</b> may optimally attract higher capital requirements. In contrast, decentralized <b>conglomerates</b> are able to hold assets in the socially most efficient place. Their optimal capital requirements encourage this. Hence, the practice of ‘regulatory arbitrage’, or of transferring assets from one balance sheet to another, is welfare-increasing. We discuss the policy implications of our finding in the context not only of the present debate on the regulation of financial <b>conglomerates</b> but also in the light of existing US bank holding company regulation. capital regulation; financial conglomerate; regulatory arbitrage...|$|R

40|$|The gold-bearing Tarkwaian <b>conglomerates</b> of the {{so-called}} Banket Series in the Ashanti Belt are oligomictic and consist of vein-quartz pebbles within a quartzitic matrix. The matrix consists, besides fine grained quartz, of secondary carbonates, chlorite, muscovite, tourmaline, epidote, actinolite, rutile, altered plagioclase, detrital zircon and opaque minerals. The opaque phases are mostly hematite and magnetite, which occur in about the same proportions. Free particles of gold and pyrite are rare. Fluid inclusion investigations revealed that the quartz-pebbles of the <b>conglomerates</b> contain predominantly CO 2 -rich fluids, {{some of which have}} unusually high densities (up to 1. 13 g/cm 3).

40|$|This article studies {{variations}} {{in the value of}} diversification across time under various capital market conditions. I find that when external capital is more costly at the aggregate level, the value of <b>conglomerates</b> increases relative to focused firms. I also find that this increase is greater for financially constrained <b>conglomerates,</b> such as bank-dependent or small <b>conglomerates.</b> My findings support the theories on the advantage of diversification over focus. They suggest that the ability to substitute external capital markets with internal capital markets creates value for <b>conglomerates</b> when the financing cost in external markets is high, especially for those <b>conglomerates</b> that are financially constrained.

50|$|<b>Conglomerates</b> {{deposited}} in fluvial environments are typically well rounded and well sorted. Clasts {{of this size}} are carried as bedload and only at times of high flow-rate. The maximum clast size decreases as the clasts are transported further due to attrition, so <b>conglomerates</b> are more characteristic of immature river systems. In the sediments deposited by mature rivers, <b>conglomerates</b> are generally confined to the basal part of a channel fill where they are known as pebble lags. <b>Conglomerates</b> {{deposited in}} a fluvial environment often have an AB-plane type imbrication.|$|R
50|$|Alluvial {{deposits}} form {{in areas}} of high relief and are typically coarse-grained.
