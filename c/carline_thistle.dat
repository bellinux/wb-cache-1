25|$|An {{important}} {{task of the}} landscape maintenance is the conservation of the dry and non-forested neglected meadows and dry meadowy slopes. Botanists have named this type of vegetation Magerrasen (neglected grassland). The ground there is covered with thin dry grass and a typical feature are the irregularly spaced juniper bushes. Well over 40 different species of flowering plants grow on this nutrient-poor, non-fertilised soil. Often different small species of gentian can be found. In late summer pasqueflower and <b>Carline</b> <b>thistle</b> bloom. From April until June orange tips fly over the sunny slopes. One of the most {{important task}}s for conservation of the neglected grassland is traditional herding. Grazing with sheep is a prerequisite for the long-lasting conservation of this grassland. If the amount of herding was reduced, initially more thorny and needle-bearing shrubs would grow because these are eschewed by sheep - the large number of juniper bushes thrive for the same reason. Under cover of these thornbushes and hedges other groves and the first trees would develop. In the final stage the mountain would become mostly overgrown with forest. The herbs and grasses of the neglected grassland have a positive influence {{on the quality of the}} sheep's meat. Due to this fact the restaurants of the Hesselberg region increasingly offer dishes of Hesselberg lamb.|$|E

50|$|This area {{of former}} gravel pits has grassland, ancient woodland, ponds and wet depressions. There are water birds such as kingfishers, coots and little grebes, and {{flowering}} plants include moschatels and <b>carline</b> <b>thistles.</b>|$|R
500|$|Raasay {{is home to}} the Raasay vole (Clethrionomys glareolus erica), a {{subspecies}} of bank vole, {{which is}} darker and heavier than the mainland variety and found nowhere else in the world. It is possibly a survivor of a Scandinavian race. Murray (1973) states that a single specimen of a pine marten, otherwise missing from the Hebrides, was found on the island in 1971. [...] No other records for this species exist. Raasay is one of only four of the Inner Hebrides where mountain hares breed. Raasay is regularly visited by white-tailed sea eagles and golden eagles and there are populations of otter, red deer and European rabbit (which were thoughtlessly introduced by the island's proprietor in the 19th century). Stoat and weasel are found in small numbers as are water shrew. It also supports a rich variety of plants, including red broomrape, dark red helleborine, mountain avens and numerous other saxifrages, orchids, alpines and ferns. The <b>carline</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carlina vulgaris) was apparently extant in the 1970s, but a recent survey found no evidence of its continued existence. There are several stands of mixed woodland.|$|E
2500|$|The shaded {{and moist}} {{northern}} {{slopes of the}} massif like, for example, the Wettersteinwald, {{are some of the}} most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The mountain pine grows at elevations of up to [...] 1,800metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of spruce and fir, but honeysuckle, woodruff, poisonous herb paris, meadow-rue and speedwell also occur here. Dark columbine, alpine clematis, blue and yellow monkshood, stemless <b>carline</b> <b>thistle,</b> false aster, golden cinquefoil, round-leaved saxifrage, wall hawkweed, alpine calamint and alpine forget-me-not flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst cinquefoil, sticky sage, butterbur, alpenrose, Turk's cap lily and fly orchid thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. Lily of the valley and daphne also occur, especially in the Höllental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.|$|E

The strongly protected yellow-bellied toad seeks out the smallest ponds and puddles.|$|E
50|$|Other {{parts of}} the lowland (on the south and north east slopes) are used as pasture.

Other important species present in the area include the Maltese Sea-Lavender (Limonium melitensis) and the Sea Carrot (Daucus rupestris), which is sub-endemic to the Maltese Islands, as well as Lampedusa, Lampione and Panarea. The upper region of the islet is colonised extensively by Esparto grass (Lygeum spartum), the Olive-leaved Bindweed, the Pyramidal Orchid (Anacamptis urvilleana), the Maltese Leek (Allium melitense), the <b>Carline</b> <b>Thistle</b> (Carlina involucrata) and two stunted Lentisks (Pistacia lentiscus).|$|E

The contamination of the land from the old chemical works with waste from the Leblanc process has resulted in an alkaline soil that now supports a variety of plants not found elsewhere in Greater Manchester, including many types of orchid, most notable amongst these are Fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, the Northern Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza purpurella, the Early Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza incarnata and other species such as Common Broomrape, Twayblade, Blue fleabane and <b>Carline</b> <b>thistle.</b> The reserve covers 8.8 hectares (21 acres).|$|E

50|$|Woodnook Valley {{has been}} a SSSI since March 1986. It {{is an example of}} a {{calcareous}} grassland. On the site are two types of orchid - the early purple orchid, and the man orchid.

Garden bumblebees can be seen on field scabious and lycaenid butterflies typical of this habitat such as the small copper and common blue, and a variety of browns including meadow brown, gatekeeper and ringlet can also be seen. Raptors such as the kestrel, buzzard and red kite also inhabit the area, hunting small rodents and rabbits which inhabit the grassland.|$|E
