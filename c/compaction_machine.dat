Static compaction of partially saturated soils was performed to generate force-displacement curves in a confined compaction process were generated. Based on the soil compaction data engineering design aspects of a toggle press are illustrated. The results of time and motion study on block production operations using manual machines are discussed. Critical path network diagrams were used for small-scale SSB production systems.

40|$|Existing Swedish design {{guidelines}} (JBR) cover silo wall heights {{up to about}} 3 m. These guidelines presumably overestimate the forces and pressures exerted by silage juice when silo walls are more than 3 m high, which could result in over-sizing, material waste and increased capital costs. This study determined silage physical properties in terms of horizontal wall pressure and evaluated silage juice levels in silos with a wall height of 3 m or more. Wall pressure was measured by transducers mounted on a steel ladder rack placed vertically along the internal silo wall. The ladder rack also permitted measurement of silage juice levels in slotted steel pipes. The pressure on the transducers was recorded by a data acquisition system displaying static and total loads (pressures imposed by silage material without and with the <b>compaction</b> <b>machine,</b> respectively). The static pressure {{at the bottom of}} the silo wall (4 m) was 16 kPa during filling and compaction, and 22 kPa 1 - 4 months after filling. The silage juice did not interact with compaction. The wall pressure increased by 30 % after filling, but the increase was only significant at 1 m from the silo bottom. The dynamic load was 17 kPa when the <b>compaction</b> <b>machine</b> passed 0. 1 m from the silo wall. New guidelines are proposed based on the results and on the Eurocode for ultimate limit states (ULS) for two stages; filling and the utility period. The design bending moment for ULS was 21 % lower than specified in JBR. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|The D-series, also {{referred}} to as SUPRA offers an even more robust design than the B-series. Therefore, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of this series are frequently mounted in <b>compaction</b> <b>machines</b> but are also used for other application fields such as generating sets for example. They have a power range of 3.5 to 15.2 kW at a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. The maximum torque is at 40.7 Nm.The SUPRA series particularly excels in its high running smoothness. This is achieved by a new design of the balance weights as well as the optimum use of two counter-rotating balance shafts and consequently a 100% first-order counterbalance. On demand, the engine may be equipped with the patented SILENT PACK ©, which reduces the noise emission by up to 90%. In addition, the engines of the D-series have up to 4 power take-off possibilities at the crank-shaft respectively auxiliary drives. Similar to the B-series, the engine is also available in a horizontal or vertical version. Furthermore, the D-series complies with the strict requirements of the EPA(Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|R
40|$|The sealing barrier {{will play}} very {{important}} role in the Czech disposal concept of high level radioactive waste. It follows Swedish SKB 3 design where granitic rock environment will host the repository. Swelling clay based materials as the most favorable for sealing purposes were selected. Such clays must fulfill certain requirements (e. g. on swelling properties, hydraulic conductivity or plasticity) and must be stable for thousands of years. Better sealing behavior is obtained when the clay is compacted. Technology of the seal construction can vary according to its target dry density. Very high dry density is needed for buffer (sealing around entire canister with radioactive waste). Less strict requirements are on material backfilling the access galleries. It allows compaction to lower dry density than in case of buffer. One of potential technology for backfilling is to compact clay layers in most of the gallery profile by common <b>compaction</b> <b>machines</b> (rollers etc.) and to spray clay into the uppermost part afterwards. The paper introduces the research works on sprayed clay technology performed at the Centre of Experimental Geotechnics of the Czech Technical University in Prague.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Mechanical and {{aerospace}} engineering. The {{research and development}} (R&D) of coal log <b>compaction</b> <b>machines</b> {{is very important for}} commercializing tl 1 e new technology of coal log pipeline (CLP). The CLP technology will be successful commercially only if the machine can produce high-quality, low-cost coal logs at a high production rate. In this thesis, a commercial scale rotary press for compacting coal logs and biomass logs is designed. This machine is not a small, conventional tablet rotary press used by the pharmaceutical industry. It {{is one of the largest}} rotary presses in the world. This machine provides a maximum of 250 -ton compaction force, and can produce coal logs of 5. 4 inches in diameter and 10 inches in length. The designed production rate is 3, 600 logs per hour or one log per second. Because of the large friction force and the long stroke, the design of such a machine is very challenging. In order to satisfy all design requirements and overcome technical problems, the critical components such as the cam, the punches, the turret, the feeding system, and the power train are carefully analyzed and designed. The design also incorporates special features learned from coal log compaction studies such as the backpressure during ejection of logs from mold. The cost estimation for this design is also conducted. As a result of the preliminary design, a set of assemblies, subassemblies, and main part drawings is provided with this thesis...|$|R

Design of the special 300 -ton coal log <b>compaction</b> <b>machine</b> was completed, Furthermore, much {{progress has been made}} in the design of the system needed to feed coal into the coal log <b>compaction</b> <b>machine,</b> and the design of the system to remove logs automatically as soon as they are compacted. 2. Coal mixtures containing different amounts of moisture were compacted into 1. 91 - inch-diameter coal logs rapidly (in 6 seconds). It was found that for the Mettiki coal tested, the optimum moisture is around 8 %. Under the test conditions (room temperature and 3 % binders), the rapidly compacted coal logs with 8 % moisture had less than 4 % weight loss in 350 cycles of circulation. 3. Completed evaluation of the effectiveness of using wall lubricants to enhance coal log quality. Both calcium sterarate and MoS{sub 2 } were found to be effective. 4. It was found that when the interior of a mold is not cleaned after coal log has been compacted, the coal mixture film clinging to the wall hardens in time and form a hard crust which affects the quality of the next log to be produced. But, if the second log is produced immediately after the first, no hard crust is formed and the quality of the second log, is not affected. 5. Coal logs made with the coal crushed by the Gundlach Company were found to be better than coal logs made with the coal crushed by the CPRC`s hammer mill. 7. A 320 -ft-long, 6 -inch-diameter coal log pipeline test facility was constructed in Rolla during this period. 8. Completed the simulation of an 8 -inch-diameter, 20 -mile-long coal log pipeline recirculating loop driven by a pump bypass. 9.

40|$|Abstract]: This Dissertation {{addresses}} the design, development {{and construction of}} an automated soil compactor for the preparation of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Proctor samples. The necessity for this machine is primarily due to an ever increasing number of workers compensation claims within the soil testing and certification industry. The technicians that are currently preparing substrate samples {{by means of a}} manual compaction hammer are subjected to extended periods of use of this apparatus, causing Repetitive Strain Injury and Occupational Overuse Syndrome in the shoulders, neck and elbows. Therefore, a mechanization of the manual compaction methods was required. In addition to addressing the physical strain issues, the machine was also designed to fully comply with current Australian Standards. Multiple automatic machines are available on the market; however none achieve full compliance to the methods set out in AS 1289. The design was therefore developed into a machine that mimics the manual compaction method exactly while eliminating the inherent human error of the manual method. The prototype <b>Compaction</b> <b>Machine</b> has successfully passed product testing as a viable, accurate and efficient tool for use within the Civil Testing Industry while fully complying with the relevant Australian Standards. The machine’s capabilities allow the unit to be used in researching more efficient compaction techniques; a very useful, promising future is ahead...|$|E

Materials used were microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 200), lactose monohydrate (Tablettose® 70) and talc. Mixtures with the 0 %, 0, 5 % and 1 % concentration of talc were prepared in a blending cube.

30|$|The writers {{suggest that}} the {{landfill}} is still able to receive MSW based {{on a number of}} factors. Firstly, it is possible that before the renaissance of LAWMA, and considering losses by decomposition, compaction and recycling, only about half of the projected 736, 500 tonnes/year were emplaced before 2008 (amounting to a total MSW in place of 5, 523, 750 tonnes in the intervening 15  years). Also, the current depth in parts hovers around 15  m. Settlement, overlying pressure of the waste and further <b>compaction</b> by <b>machines,</b> may also have increased the density of the deposited waste streams with time. Bhide [8] estimated a MSW density of 800  kg/m 3 after dumping. Given the plethora of factors, it is plausible to arrive at a density of about 2200  kg/m 3 bringing the capacity of the landfill to 13, 860, 000 tonnes. The Olusosun currently receives about 1, 700, 000 tonnes/year of MSW. Given that the quantity of soil added periodically is marginal and discounting for recycling and decomposition, only about 60  % of these may be emplaced in the landfill. In addition, the operators of the landfill are at liberty to marginally extend the elevation of the sites to accommodate more wastes provided proper capping is done and other sanitary conditions met. Therefore, it is possible for the Olusosun landfill operations to subsist for upward of another ten years.|$|R

Soil compaction was measured through its bulk density, cone index, and rut depth, under the condition with and without slash.   The slash comprised of twigs, branches, and leaves as wastes from harvested Acacia mangium that were stacked to a width of about 1 meter in thickness following forwarder traffic. Results indicated that slash was effective in decreasing soil compaction.   About 50 % increased in soil compaction by a Valmet forwarder could be reduced by using slash coverings at soil surface.   The maximum soil bulk density occurred after 5 forwarder passes.   Soil compaction also occurred at subsurface soil. After forwarder traffic, increasing cone index was observed at subsurface of various soil depths.   Slash was effective in decreasing soil compaction up to 20 cm in soil depth, although soil compaction by forwarder operation was slightly increased until 50 cm of soil depth.   Rut was not observed under the slash however rut of about 24 cm in depth was formed at soil surface without slash.   Using slash as coverings for forwarder operation reduced soil damaged.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{considers}} the modelling, simulation and experimental {{investigation of a}} rammer compactor machine. The purpose is to develop an efficient and verified method for simulation of rammer compactor machines {{to be used in}} the product development process. The experience gained through this work is also intended to be useful for studying other types of dynamic compactor machines. Rammer compactor machines perform impact soil compaction. This is more efficient than static <b>compaction.</b> The <b>machines</b> are often used in places where a high degree of compaction is needed, and where the space for operation is limited. The complexity of this type of machine makes design optimisation through traditional prototype testing impractical. This has pointed to the need for a theoretical model and simulation procedure for predicting the dynamic behaviour of the machine. To be useful for optimisation the theoretical model and simulation procedure must be verified. By concurrently working with theoretical modelling, simulations, experimental verifications, and optimisation an efficient analysis support for product development is achieved. This co-ordination works both ways in an iterative manner: experimental investigations are used to verify theoretical models and simulations; and theoretical models and simulations are used to design good experiments. This Complete Approach concept enables better decisions to be made earlier on in the development process, resulting in a decrease in time-to-market and improved quality. In this thesis, the Complete Approach concept is applied to a rammer soil compactor machine. An introductory iteration is described. The good agreement between theoretical and experimental results indicates that the theoretical model and simulation procedure should prove useful in introductory optimisation studies. The thesis discusses reasons for the remaining discrepancy and suggests improvements in both the theoretical model and the experimental set-up for future iterations.

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{durability}} of asphalted roads strongly {{depends on the}} final step in the road construction process; the profiling and compaction of the fresh spread asphalt. During <b>compaction</b> <b>machine</b> operators continuously make decisions on how {{to proceed with the}} compaction accounting for projectspecific aspects as: ambient conditions, road geometry, roller type, asphalt mixture characteristics and behavior of other machines. In discussions over quality improvement in road construction it is often suggested to robotize rollers. To operate such robots would of course require operational strategies and routines. The reality of this moment is that these operational strategies and routines are not documented. To identify the existing best working practices and, ultimately, to proceed with developing automated robotized compactors, the knowledge of machine operators should at first be explored and described in a formalized way. Unfortunately operators have difficulty verbalizing their expertise. Observation of behavior, as machine movement patterns, could be helpful to extract the operational strategies, but such observations are time and labor consuming. To overcome this burden we developed a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. In this VR environment operators perform compaction virtually, and their operational choices are traced and analysed. This paper describes this VR development and explains how it helps in following machine operators and extracting their (tacit) professional knowledge. The road geometry and the working conditions are visually represented; the operators show - rather than explain - how they would proceed with the compaction process in the given conditions. Movements of virtual machines are documented, analysed, visualised and discussed. This VR approach is expected to contribute to learning, to more formal description of operational strategies; stepping stones towards compaction algorithms for roller robotisation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} sugarcane production units, and it has often resulted in reduced structural quality of the soil due to soil <b>compaction</b> caused by <b>machine</b> traffic. Thus, sugarcane ratoon crops have often been chiseled to overcome such a problem. The aim {{of the current study}} is to assess some physical properties of a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Rhodic Hapludox) that was chiseled after the third harvest in a sugarcane ratoon crop. The study was conducted in a commercial crop area throughout the 2011 / 2012 crop year. A randomized block experimental design was used, with five replications. The treatments consisted of five chiseling operations in sugarcane ratoon crops, namely: T 1 - single-shank ripper with chiseling to a depth of 0. 15 m; T 2 - single-shank ripper with chiseling to a depth of 0. 30 m; T 3 - two-bar ripper with chiseling to a depth of 0. 15 m, T 4 - two-bar ripper with chiseling to a depth of 0. 30 m; and T 5 - control group, with no chiseling. Overall, soil chiseling is effective for improving the physical quality of the soil to a depth of 0. 15 m, regardless of the equipment and the depth.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Forest soils {{with low}} bulk densities are often {{considered}} {{less susceptible to}} compaction than soils with higher bulk densities. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if soil strength controlled the compression of soils with low bulk density. Four soils were selected for this evaluation. Three of these were andic soils with low bulk density and the fourth soil was a more dense, cohesive soil. Undisturbed samples of saturated and partly saturated soil were compressed in a one-dimensional consolidation test apparatus. Measurements with separate samples were at one of 7 normal stresses between 0. 033 and 1. 96 MPa. Shear strength of saturated soil was measured in direct shear tests. Primary consolidation of saturated soil was completed in less than one minute at all normal stresses. Shear stress and bulk density increased continuously during shear strain. The compression index of the cohesive soil was significantly larger (p< 0. 05) than that of the andic soils. The shear strength of andic soils (average cohesion intercept of 0. 016 MPa and friction angle of 33. 3 °) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the cohesive soil (cohesion intercept of 0. 028 MPa and friction angle of 28. 9 °). When saturated, the cohesive soil was more compressible than the andic soils because of lower soil strength. A nonlinear model of soil compression was developed that accurately predicted the compressed density of saturated and partly saturated soil as a function of normal stress, initial bulk density of undisturbed samples, and degree of saturation. As degree of saturation decreased, the compressibility of the cohesive soil decreased more rapidly than it did for the andic soils. As a result, bulk density of dry cohesive soil increased less than it did for dry andic soils. Differences in the compressibility of soils were attributed to texture and clay mineralogy. The differences in the compressibility of these soils were much smaller than were the differences in bulk density. Decreasing water content affected the compressibility of the cohesive soil more than it affected the andic soils. Because soil strength controls the compressibility of these forest soils regardless of bulk density, it will also determine the susceptibility of soils to <b>compaction</b> by <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Investigations on asphalt {{produced}} and compacted {{in the laboratory}} are indispensable for a forecast assessment of the presumed performance behaviour of asphalt. For this, predominantly cylindrical samples or sample slabs are required for technical testing responses of the deformation resistance of the asphalts in heat and prismatic samples for the response to crack resistance in cold conditions and the fatigue resistance under repeated load conditions. Since {{the end of the}} 1970 's it is a well known fact that the mechanical characteristics of asphalt to a large degree can be influenced by the type of compaction in the laboratory. This was confirmed {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 's as part of a research project sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Transport at the Institut fuer Strassenwesen der Technischen Universitaet Braunschweig (Institute for Road Building of the Technical University of Braunschweig). The aim of the current research project was therefore to design a laboratory asphalt <b>compaction</b> <b>machine</b> and to optimise the technical boundary conditions process to such an extent that asphalt sample slabs or samples could be produced, the mechanical characteristics of which correspond to those of field compacted asphalts in heat, cold and repeat loading conditions. This aim could be achieved with a laboratory asphalt compacting machine in which the asphalt coated materials are compacted in a heat chamber at a pre-defined temperature by means of a roller to a targeted density level. By means of path-controlled pre-compacting and powercontrolled main compacting the sample slabs can be produced with equal density and thickness distribution which have adequate mechanical characteristics of practical application.

Primary research tasks for this study include the following: (1) experimental testing and statistical analyses to evaluate machine power in terms of the engineering properties of the compacted soil (e. g., density, strength, stiffness) and (2) recommendations for using the compaction monitoring technology in practice. The compaction monitoring technology includes sensors that monitor the power consumption used to move the <b>compaction</b> <b>machine,</b> an on-board computer and display screen, and a GPS system to map the spatial location of the machine. In situ soil density, strength, and stiffness data characterized the soil at various stages of compaction. For each test strip or test area, in situ soil properties were compared directly to machine power values to establish statistical relationships. Statistical models were developed to predict soil density, strength, and stiffness from the machine power values. Field data for multiple test strips were evaluated. The R 2 correlation coefficient was generally used to assess the quality of the regressions. Strong correlations were observed between averaged machine power and field measurement data. The relationships are based on the compaction model derived from laboratory data. Correlation coefficients (R 2) were consistently higher for thicker lifts than for thin lifts, indicating that the depth influencing machine power response exceeds the representative lift thickness encountered under field conditions. Caterpillar Inc. compaction monitoring technology also identified localized areas of an earthwork project with weak or poorly compacted soil. The soil properties at these locations were verified using in situ test devices. This report also documents the steps required to implement the compaction monitoring technology evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The Georgia Loaded Wheel Tester (LWT) {{developed}} by Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) {{has been used}} since 1985 in the laboratory during the design stage to evaluate rutting susceptibility of asphaltic concrete mixtures. In the LWT testing, asphaltic concrete is subjected to an elevated temperature in a loaded wheel system under repetitive loading conditions and the permanent deformation induced under the wheel path is measured. This approach to assess rutting susceptibility {{was thought to be}} much more representative than the current test methods and can provide a fast and more accurate means of assessing rutting susceptibility of asphaltic concrete under actual field conditions. The asphalt beam samples used for the LWT testing are prepared by a rolling <b>compaction</b> <b>machine.</b> The new LWF developed in 1992 is described in this paper. To promote the concept of using Georgia LWT as a supplement to the SUPERPAVE Volumetric design procedure for evaluating permanent deformation of BMA, a test method utilizing STJPERPAVE Gyratory Compactor prepared samples to evaluate the rutting resistance of HMA by the LWT was developed. The gyratory samples placed in a specially designed mold can be tested in the LWT identical to that for performing the LWT testing on the beam samples. A test program was conducted to evaluate the applicability of the testing procedure and to develop correlations between the rut-depth of asphalt mixes using the beam samples and the gyratory samples. The test program used three asphalt mixes of different degrees of rutting resistance ranging from high to low rut susceptibility. Both types of samples 0 were tested at 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C temperatures for 8000 cycles under the standard LWT testing procedure. The rut-depth results from the beam samples and the gyratory samples showed good correlations for all three mixes tested...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to investigate Geographical Information Systems techniques for modelling a cross-country trafficability. To accomplished stated tasks, reciprocal relationships between the soil deposits, local hydrology, geology and geomorphology were studied {{in relation to the}} study area in South-Eastern Sweden. Growing awareness of nowadays users of GIS in general is being concentrated on understanding an importance of soil conditions changed after cross-country trafficability. Therefore, in this thesis, constructing of the Soil Knowledge Database introduced to the genuine geological soil textural classes a new, modified geotechnical division with desirable for off-road ground reasoning measurable factors, like soil permeability, capillarity or Atterberg’s consistency limits. Digital Elevation Model, the driving force for landscape studies in the thesis, was carefully examined together with the complementary datasets of the investigated area. Testing of the elevation data was done in association to the hydrological modelling, which resulted with the Wetness Index map. The three distinguishable soil wetness conditions: dry, moist and wet, were obtained, and used consequently for creation of the static ground conditions map, a visible medium of soils susceptibility to for example <b>machine</b> <b>compaction.</b> The work resulted with a conceptual scheme for cross-country trafficability modelling, which was put into effect while modeling in GIS. As a final outcome, by combining all processed data together, derivatives were incorporated and draped over the rendered 3 D animating scene. A visually aided simulation enabled to concretized theoretical, hypothetical and experimental outcomes into one coherent model of apprised under Multicriterial Evaluation techniques standardized factor maps for ground vehicle maneuverability.

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, the conventional tablet manufacturing process, a batch-based process based on solid powder handling, presents challenges such as inhomogeneous blending between Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and excipients, low yield, and low production rate. These difficulties {{can be resolved}} by the realization of a continuous manufacturing process through co-processing of APIs and excipients in the liquid-phase solution. A solvent-cast thin film, produced from liquid solution, can then be manufactured into tablets {{by way of a}} folding process. In order to design detailed <b>compaction</b> processes and <b>machines,</b> required compression pressure for layer bonding and mechanical properties of materials should also be investigated. The bonding strength of solvent-cast thin film layers was quantitatively measured by lap shear test. Based on this measurement, bonding threshold pressure was proposed as an indicator showing degree of bonding. At the same time, the layer bonding mechanism of solvent-cast thin films was interpreted as an interdiffusion of amorphous polymer chain end segments. In this context, relative contact area, polymer mobility, which is measured by glass transition temperature, and dwell time were proposed as critical factors in determining bonding threshold pressure. The relationships between those critical factors and process parameters such as surface roughness, residual water and excipient concentration, and compression rate were investigated. The mechanical and viscoelastic properties of solvent-cast thin films were also characterized. Solvent-cast thin films showed ductile-brittle transition, i. e., change of indentation hardness and strength factors among tensile properties with respect to residual water concentration. Changes of creep modulus and tensile properties at various stress levels and strain rates were also observed. by Won Kim. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, manual felling and logging of forest trees by animals or small {{tractors}} evolved towards mechanized harvesting, using heavy tractors or specialized forestry machines with increasing masses. This development may cause soil degradation in forest ecosystems as the resulting soil compaction modifies soil characteristics {{that are important}} for the sustained provision of ecosystem services. Consequently, soil conditions may become unfavourable to soil fauna, herb and tree layer and in the long-term it {{may lead to a}} loss of biodiversity, soil fertility and stand productivity. The impacts of site and stand characteristics, machine weight and traffic intensity on the compaction degree were examined in a first field trial, performed in eight Flemish forest stands. If based on bulk density and penetration resistance, we generally found low compaction degrees, even on the vulnerable soil textures. Effects could be explained by high soil water contents in the clayey soils (leading to clear rut formation) and a high precompression stress (as indicated by the high initial bulk densities) on the sandy and loamy to silt loamy soils. Results showed that soil water content and initial compaction status (as an indicator for the precompression stress) should always be taken in consideration when evaluating the influence of texture on the <b>compaction</b> degree. Higher <b>machine</b> masses and traffic intensities increased the compaction degrees. Although compaction degrees remained low, increased carbon dioxide concentrations within tracks on the sandy soils showed that soil aeration was severely affected by machine traffic. These results indicated that quantification of the soil impact based on bulk density and penetration resistance may lead to an underestimation and should take more sensitive soil variables such as soil carbon dioxide concentration into account. The vulnerability to compaction is often regarded as negligible on sandy forest soils and was therefore examined in detail in a second field trial. Significant increases of bulk density and penetration resistance and a positive (logarithmic) relationship with traffic intensity were found. The application of a brash mat reduced the compaction degree. The results of both field trials were combined with international study results to draw general conclusions on the impact of mechanized harvesting. A meta-analysis was performed {{to examine the effects of}} soil texture, machine weight and traffic intensity. It showed clear compaction degrees for both clayey as sandy textures and confirmed the significant impact of the initial <b>compaction</b> status and <b>machine</b> mass. A lot of interesting studies could not be implemented due to lack of important information. Recommendations for future research were therefore formulated. Abiotic changes may yield biotic effects and these were examined in a second meta-analysis, focussing on survival, height and diameter growth of seedlings of mainly light tolerant tree species. The influence of soil compaction on seedling growth and survival was predominantly insignificant, due to strong variation in the datasets. However, they indicated a different response in accordance to soil texture, with negligible to slightly positive impacts on sandy to loamy soils and more negative impacts on silty to clayey soils. Again a lot of the performed studies lacked important information. As soil compaction induces biotic effects, fast recovery is desired. Compaction status of nine forest stands on three soil textures where the last harvesting activity took place seven to nine years ago was determined by measuring penetration resistance along transects. In all forest stands, traces of former machine traffic were found in the shape of locally increased or overall high penetration resistance. This means that complete recovery of compacted forest soils was certainly not achieved within seven to nine years after the last machine impact. As this is a common period between two harvesting activities, effects will accumulate and expand at subsequent harvests in case machine traffic is not restricted to permanent skid trails. A fourth field trial examined whether stimulating biological activity by means of a manipulation of litter quality, soil acidity and earthworm populations could accelerate recovery. Liming and the application of calcium-rich litter positively influenced the numbers of inoculated anecic earthworms that were retraced, with a positive feedback on soil acidity and litter decomposition. Within the short study period, small reductions of the compaction degree due to anecic worms could only be shown on the non-trafficked soil beside the wheel tracks. Unfavourable soil acidity and nutrient status probably hampered ecological restoration. We hypothesize that ecological restoration of compacted soils is possible though time-consuming, stipulating that soil conditions are favourable, particularly to anecic earthworms. An increase of their survival rate and activity is best achieved through an admixture containing species with high quality litter, which induce lower soil acidity and a better nutrient status. In this thesis we gained insight into i) the abiotic and biotic effects of soil compaction as influenced by stand, site and harvesting characteristics, ii) the compaction status of Flemish forest soils, and iii) the potential of ecological restoration options for compacted forest soils. Results showed that the risk for soil compaction should be taken into account for all texture classes when planning and preparing harvesting activities. We recommend performing harvesting activities on sandy soils at intermediate soil water contents, while on medium- to fine-textured soils very dry conditions are optimal for limitation of the soil impact. The machines used should always be tuned to the intensity and the demands of the harvesting activity and the field circumstances. We emphasize to concentrate the traffic on designated skid trails. In this way only a restricted portion of the area is damaged, enabling the soil between trails to recover from the compacted status applied during previous harvesting activities. A brash mat may be very effective to further reduce the degree of soil compaction on these trails. Admixtures with tree species that provide good quality litter, perhaps combined with liming may imply stimulation of biological activity and in the long-term a decrease of the compaction degree...|$|R
40|$|During this 1 st {{quarter of}} 1997 (1 / 1 / 97 to 3 / 31 / 97), {{significant}} {{progress was made}} in many fronts of coal log pipeline research, development and technology transfer including the following: 1. A set of revised (final) drawings on {{certain parts of the}} coal log <b>compaction</b> <b>machine</b> (250 -ton press) was sent to the Gundlach Company in January. (Dr. Yuyi Lin and Kang Xue) 2. The coal log machine (250 -ton press) is under construction at the Gundlach Machine Company. The machine is expected to be completed in May or June. (Gundlach Machine Company/Floproducts). 3. Design of the metal building to house the coal log machine (250 -ton press), other compaction related equipment and the pipeline inlet/outlet has been completed, and bid specifications for this building are being prepared. (Burkett/Campus Facilities). 4. A preliminary set of equations for mathematical and computer modeling of the coal log compaction process has been derived. Plans to verify the equations through experiments have been made. Instrumentation for the tests have been prepared. (Dr. Yuyi Lin and Guoping Wen). 5. It was found that water temperature has a significant effect on coal log wear in pipe. More wear occurs when the water temperature is higher. This is good news because the water temperature in an underground pipe is expected to be relatively low. (Wei Li under Dr. Brett Gunnink. 6. The standard coal log compaction test has been conducted for a second time with improved results (supervised by Bill Burkett). 7. Tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} compaction pressure, binder concentration, binder-coal sample mixing time, compaction peak load time and coal log curing time. It was found that variation of pressure had the strongest effect on the tensile strength of the coal logs (Wilson/Zhao). 8. Practical experience has been gained in analyzing CLP effluent water, and dealing with regulatory officials on CLP effluent water discharge (Wilson/Paano). 9. Costs of many items of the CLP Pilot Plant (6 -inch-diameter pipeline 3, 000 ft long recirculating loop) have been determined; pumps and pump seals have been selected; a clarifier for treating CLP effluent water has been selected; a sand bed has been designed to clean up the sludge discharged from the clarifier; detailed design of the diverters has been completed (Dr. Charles Lenau). 10. Much progress has been made in the preparation of the experimental set-up for testing Polyox drag reduction in CLP in the 8 -inch-diameter test loop. The Polyox dissolution/injection tank has been built and tested. Test procedures for injecting and measuring Polyox concentration have been developed. Fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B) are being tested for possible use to determine Polyox concentration in water (Gangwei Wu under Dr. John Miles). 11. Hydrodynamic equations have been derived to determine the behavior of capsule trains entering and leaving a slope. A commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program (FLUENT) was used to determine the pressure field around a capsule in the turbulent regime (Xiang Gao under Dr. Henry Liu). 12. Five different biomass materials (sawdust, wood chips, alfalfa, soy bean hulls and cottonseeds) were compacted successfully into logs (1. 94 -inch-diameter solid cylinders) at room temperature without use of binder. Compaction ratios of these materials range from 2 to 8. The result looks promising (Chris Yates under Dr. Tom Marrero. Future Research (Plan for Next Quarter) : 1.

Completion of the metal building to house the coal log machine (Campus Facilities. 3. Complete preliminary tests to check the equations for predicting coal log compaction, and revising of equations if needed (Dr. Liu/Gao). 4. Conduct a set of more detailed tests on the effect of water temperature on coal log wear and breakage in pipe (Dr. Liuffao). 5. Conduct rapid compaction test (3 -second compaction time) by using the new 1. 9 -inch mold and the new alignment fixture (Dr. Gunnink/Li). 6. Compare small log wear (in Columbia) with large log wear (in Rolla) using logs made under similar conditions except for the size of the mold (Dr. Wilson/Zhao) 7.
