50|$|This {{data can}} be used to {{determine}} if an issue exists with an upstream filling, or packaging, machine. A <b>checkweigher</b> can send a signal to the machine to increase or decrease the amount put into a package. This can result in a payback associated with the <b>checkweigher</b> since producers will be better able to control the amount of give-away. See <b>checkweigher</b> case study outlining ground beef and packaging savings.|$|E

50|$|Checkweighers {{are also}} used for Quality management. For instance, raw {{material}} for machining a bearing is weighed prior to beginning the process, and after the process, the quality inspector expects that {{a certain amount of}} metal was removed in the finishing process. The finished bearings are <b>checkweighed,</b> and bearings over- or underweight are rejected for physical inspection. This is a benefit to the inspector, since he can have a high confidence that the ones not rejected are within machining tolerance. A common usage is for throttling plastic extruders such that a bottle used to package detergent meets that requirements of the finished packager.|$|R

50|$|With a {{check weigher}} {{programmed}} as a zone <b>checkweigher,</b> {{the data collection}} over the networks, {{as well as local}} statistics, can indicate the need to check the settings on the upstream equipment to better control flow into the packaging. In some cases the dynamic scale sends a signal to a filler, for instance, in real-time, controlling the actual flow into a barrel, can, bag, etc. In many cases a <b>checkweigher</b> has a light-tree with different lights to indicate the variation of the zone weight of each product.|$|E
50|$|A checkweighman (occasionally checkmeasurer or <b>checkweigher)</b> is {{a person}} who is {{responsible}} for weighing coal or another mined substance, and thereby determining the payment due to each worker.|$|E
50|$|Jenkins {{was the son}} of a {{coal miner}} and {{attended}} Glyncorrwg National School before taking up work on the railways at the age of 11Â½. Six years later he became a miner, and later a <b>checkweigher.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>checkweigher</b> {{can weigh}} {{in excess of}} 500 items per minute (depending on carton size and {{accuracy}} requirements).Checkweighers {{can be used with}} metal detectors and X-ray machines to enable other attributes of the pack to be checked and acted upon accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|Quality {{management}} {{can use a}} <b>checkweigher</b> for Nondestructive {{testing to}} verify finished goods using common Evaluation methods to detect pieces missing from a [...] "finished" [...] product, such as grease from a bearing, or a missing roller within the housing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>checkweigher</b> {{can be used}} {{to count}} packs, and the {{aggregate}} (total) weight of the boxes going onto a pallet for shipment, including the ability to read each package's weight and cubic dimensions. The controller computer can print a shipping label and a bar-code label to identify the weight, the cubic dimensions, ship-to address, and other data for machine ID through the shipment of the product. A receiving <b>checkweigher</b> for the shipment can read the label with a bar code scanner, and determine if the shipment is as it was before the transportation carrier received it from the shipper's loading dock, and determine if a box is missing, or something was pilfered or broken in transit.|$|E
5000|$|An {{automatic}} <b>checkweigher</b> {{incorporates a}} series of conveyor belts.

Morris was opposed by another Liberal candidate, clerk to the Llanwonno School Board, who stood in opposition to Morris's links to the beer trade. John Williams, <b>checkweigher</b> at a local colliery and a future Labour MP was a possible candidate but withdrew at an early stage.|$|E
50|$|Fixed-position scanner: an {{industrial}} barcode reader, {{used to identify}} products during manufacture or logistics. Often used on conveyor tracks to identify cartons or pallets which need to be routed to another process or shipping location. Another application joins holographic scanners with a <b>checkweigher</b> to read bar codes of any orientation or placement, and weighs the package. Systems like this are used in factory and farm automation for quality management and shipping.|$|E
50|$|In-motion scales come in {{numerous}} variations based on application. A simple version may {{have only one}} belt or chain, and use software for transmission-of-weight only. Some are used to sort product by weight. Through {{the use of an}} infeed bed, weigh bed, and outfeed bed, in motion scales or dynamic scales can be equipped with metal detectors, vision / camera systems and various types of rejection systems. See <b>checkweigher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the act of}} 1887, {{there have}} {{followed}} five minor acts, based {{on the recommendation of}} the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (<b>Checkweigher)</b> Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (" [...] owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager [...] ") to make the removal of a particular <b>checkweigher</b> a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a <b>checkweigher.</b> The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular <b>checkweigher.</b> In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.|$|E
50|$|After {{elementary}} school {{he went into}} the mines aged 12. Keen to educate himself, he rose to become secretary to a colliery company and in 1913 entered the Labour College in London as a student. After three years Williams was appointed a provincial lecturer for the college, though the war disrupted the college and left him unemployed. Forced to return to mining in 1917, he became <b>checkweigher</b> and in 1919 miners' agent to the Garw district of the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} is to program the <b>checkweigher</b> to check bands of different weight tolerances. For instance, the total valid weight is 100 grams Â±15 grams. This means that the product can weigh 85 g - 115 g. However, {{it is obvious that}} if you are producing 10,000 packs a day, and most of your packs are 110 g, you are losing 100 kg of product. If you try to run closer to 85 g, you may have a high rejection rate.|$|E
5000|$|Checkweighers {{are used}} in cleanrooms, dry {{atmosphere}} environments, wet environments, produce barns, food processing, drug processing, etc. Checkweighers are specified {{by the kind of}} environment, and the kind of cleaning will be used. Typically, a <b>checkweigher</b> for produce is made of mild steel, and one that will be cleaned with harsh chemicals, such as bleach, will be made with all stainless steel parts, even the Load cells. These machines are labeled [...] "full washdown", and must have every part and component specified to survive the washdown environment.|$|E
5000|$|Checkweighers can be {{built with}} metal detectors, x-ray machines, open-flap detection, bar-code scanners, {{holographic}} scanners, temperature sensors, vision inspectors, timing screws to set the timing and spacing between product, indexing gates and concentrator ducts to line up the product into a designated area on the conveyor. An industrial motion <b>checkweigher</b> can sort products from {{a fraction of a}} gram to many, many kilograms. In English units, is this from less than 100th of an ounce to as much as 500 lbs or more. Specialized checkweighers can weigh commercial aircraft, and even find their center-of-gravity.|$|E
50|$|Non-destructive {{examination}} (NDE) or {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy-current testing, acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a <b>checkweigher.</b> Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.|$|E
50|$|An {{in motion}} {{conveyor}} <b>checkweigher</b> {{can be used}} to detect missing pieces of a kit, such as a cell phone package that is missing the manual, or other collateral. Checkweighers are typically used on the incoming conveyor chain, and the output pre-packaging conveyor chain in a poultry processing plant. The bird is weighed when it comes onto the conveyor, then after processing and washing at the end, the network computer can determine whether or not the bird absorbed too much water, which as it is further processed, will be drained, making the bird under its target weight.|$|E
5000|$|A reject {{conveyor}} {{to enable}} the out-of-tolerance packages {{to be removed from}} the normal flow while still moving at the conveyor velocity. The reject mechanism can be one of several types. Among these are a simple pneumatic pusher to push the reject pack sideways from the belt, a diverting arm to sweep the pack sideways and a reject belt that lowers or lifts to divert the pack vertically. A typical <b>checkweigher</b> usually has a bin to collect the out-of-tolerance packs. Sometimes these bins are provided with a lock, to prevent that out of specification items are fed back on the conveyor belt.|$|E
5000|$|A dynamic, in-motion <b>checkweigher</b> takes samples, and {{analyzes}} them to form {{an accurate}} weight over a given time period. In most cases, there is a trigger from an optical(or ultrasonic) device to signal the passing of a package. Once the trigger fires, there is a delay set to allow the package {{to move to the}} [...] "sweet spot" [...] (center) of the weigh bed to sample the weight. The weight is sampled for a given duration. If either of these times are wrong, the weight will be wrong. There seems to be no scientific method to predict these timings. Some systems have a [...] "graphing" [...] feature to do this, but it is generally more of an empirical method that works best.|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{sections}} touching on wages questions, {{the prohibition of}} the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being re-enacted in 1887; {{the sections}} relating to payment by weight for amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing the amount by a [...] " [...] <b>checkweigher</b> [...] " [...] stationed {{by the majority of}} workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material, were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms [...] " [...] mineral contracted to be gotten." [...] The whole history of the development of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections affording protection to piece-workers by particulars of work and wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891.|$|E
50|$|The {{influential}} Durham Miners' Association {{had initially}} withheld their official {{support from the}} Labour Party candidate, but their executive committee passed a motion calling on all miners to support the Socialist candidate. Although there was a sizeable mining community in the constituency, the Association had not pressed {{to have their own}} candidate. The fact that the Labour Party candidate was neither local nor a miner, meant he had limited appeal to their members. At this time the Durham Miners were fairly evenly split between those like their President William House, who supported the Labour Party and those like their General Secretary John Wilson who supported the Liberal Party. The pro-Labour Party element of the Union were still reeling from the Houghton-le-Spring by-election, 1913 when House stood as a DMA endorsed Labour Party candidate and came third, while miners lodges across the constituency supported the Liberal, who won despite not being a miner. However, that did not stop individual miners leaders taking different sides in the campaign. On 20 January, the Liberal Aneurin Williams spoke at the Council School, Tanfield Lea. He shared the platform with J. J. Gray, a <b>checkweigher</b> at the Tanfield Lea Colliery. On 21 January 1914 Williams spoke at the Miners' Hall, South Moor {{in front of an audience}} of about 300.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} act {{was passed}} in 1908 (Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908) limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman {{was not to be}} below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance {{in the event of an}} accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term [...] " [...] workman [...] " [...] in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or furnace man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A [...] must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of <b>checkweigher</b> or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.|$|E
