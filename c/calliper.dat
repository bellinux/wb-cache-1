The family moved to Pittsburgh when he was two. He {{contracted}} polio when he was four, {{and as a result}} wore a <b>calliper</b> on one leg, and spent his last years in a wheelchair.|$|E

25|$|Using a 20mm <b>calliper</b> as a protractor—one tip at {{the apex}} of the wound—the surgeon delineates two semi-circles, an inner semi-circle, and an outer semi-circle. The outer semi-circle defines the {{necessary}} length of the two lobes of the skin flap. The inner semi-circle bisects the center of the original wound, and continues across the donor skin, establishing limit measure of the pedicle common to the two lobes of the flap. The surgeon then draws two lines from the apex of the wound; the first line drawn is at an angle of 45 degrees from the long axis of the wound, and the second line drawn is at a 90-degree angle from the axis of the wound. The two (2) lines delineate the central axes of the two lobes of the bilobed flap.|$|E

All Ghibli models employ a ZF 8HP 8-speed automatic transmission and a rear limited slip differential.Power steering is hydraulic.The braking system uses vented discs on all four corners, four-pot <b>callipers</b> at the front and floating <b>callipers</b> at the rear; S models come with larger cross-drilled dual-cast rotors, six-pot <b>callipers</b> at the front and four-pot at the rear.|$|R

A <b>calliper</b> and Orbscan measure the external limbus-to-limbus diameter of anterior chamber (white-to-white diameter) which provides an approximate estimation of AC diameter but UBM and OCT offer a more adequate measurement of the sulcus diameter (sulcus-to-sulcus diameter) and should be used when available.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} comparing 3 methods of measuring the skin area of a clipped patch on sheep to determine the most appropriate technique {{in terms of its}} precision, repeatability and ease of measurement. The methods were: 1) using <b>callipers</b> to take 3 measurements of both dimensions, 2) tracing the patch outline onto plastic, and 3) photographing the patch with an object of known area. Two clipped patches on the mid-side of 20 weaner sheep at each of 2 geographic locations were measured 2 - 3 times by each of the 3 methods. Linear relationships, and high correlations (0. 83 - 0. 89), between the patch area estimates by each of the methods indicate consistency between the methods in discriminating relative differences in patch size. The mean patch area was larger (P< 0. 01) when measured using <b>callipers</b> (21. 0 ± 3. 2 cm 2) than when estimated by the tracing technique (18. 5 ± 2. 7) or photography (18. 7 ± 2. 7), although the overall coefficients of variation (CV) were similar (14. 7 - 15. 1 %). The between-patch variance was also larger with <b>callipers</b> than tracing or photography, having between-patch CVs of 14. 3, 13. 6 and 13. 9 %, respectively. However, the within-patch CVs of <b>callipers</b> and photography were lower (4. 7 and 5. 0 %) than that for tracing (5. 9 %). All methods were associated {{with a high degree of}} repeatability. <b>Callipers</b> provided the highest level of repeatability (t= 0. 90), followed by photography (0. 88) with tracing the least repeatable (0. 84) ...|$|R
