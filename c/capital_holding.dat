Had the CBA kept the BankWest Commercial Loan Book, it (the CBA) would have faced a $49 billion increase in, recurring interest costs, and regulatory and <b>capital</b> <b>holding</b> costs.(Calculation estimate). From the outset, the CBA {{made no attempt to}} capital raise the extra $17 billion in Tier 1 Capital (Share Capital in the case of BankWest). Instead the CBA only raised $2 billion in payment of BankWest's existing Share capital (the Initial Purchase Price). In avoidance of raising the extra $17 billion in BankWest Tier 1 Capital, BankWest under reported the BankWest Commercial Loan Book by $10.3 billion, in its first Basel II Risk Disclosure dated 31 March 2009.|$|E

The CBA however was in a similar position as HBOS.

50|$|Although, {{economic}} capital has evolved sufficiently {{to be used}} alongside regulatory initiatives, it should remain a hypothetical measurement, and be used primarily {{as a basis for}} risk adjusted performance measurement (RAPM/SVA) and risk-based pricing (RAROC).
