5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>history</b> key to development.

Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E

40|$|This {{special issue}} {{addresses}} {{the influences of}} planning <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>histories</b> {{on the evolution of}} planning systems and spatial development. As well as providing an international comparative perspective on these issues, the collection of articles also engages in a search for new conceptual frameworks and alternative points of view to better understand and explain these differences. The articles focus on three main aspects: the change in planning systems and its impact on spatial development patterns; the interrelationship between planning <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>histories</b> from a path-dependency perspective; and the variations in physical development patterns resulting from different planning <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>histories.</b> Papers from different parts of the European continent present evidence at different scales to illustrate these aspects. In all cases, the specific combinations of political, ideological, social, economic and technological factors are important in determining urban and regional planning trajectories as well as spatial development patterns...|$|R

5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>history</b> of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
