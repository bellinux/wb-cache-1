25|$|Trading on {{commodities}} {{began in}} Japan in the 18th century with the trading {{of rice and}} silk, and similarly in Holland with tulip bulbs. Trading in the US began in the mid 19th century, when central grain markets were established and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (also called spot or <b>cash</b> <b>market)</b> or for forward delivery. These forward contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today's exchange-traded futures contracts. Although contract trading began with traditional commodities such as grains, meat and livestock, exchange trading has expanded to include metals, energy, currency and currency indexes, equities and equity indexes, government interest rates and private interest rates.|$|E

40|$|To many people, futures {{trading is}} a little {{understood}} and rather suspicious activity. The word most often associated with this trading is "speculation", the idea being {{that most of those}} involved in futures markets are gamblers in a high stakes game seeking profit at the expense of those outside the game. Any relationship between futures <b>markets</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>markets</b> is generally seen in a negative light - futures trading causing "speculative booms" which distort <b>cash</b> <b>markets</b> and harm many honest traders not directly involved in futures.

50|$|However, as {{more and}} more animals were sold under formula pricing, other contract, or captive supply arrangements, the open <b>cash</b> <b>markets</b> became less helpful as benchmarks.

50|$|In {{commodities}} transactions, formula pricing is {{an arrangement}} where a buyer and seller agree in advance {{on the price}} to be paid for a product delivered in the future, based upon a pre-determined calculation.

50|$|Such {{transactions}} {{have been}} used widely in agriculture, particularly for livestock. Users believe that formula pricing brings efficiency and predictability to markets transactions.

Some of these producers believe that formula pricing makes it harder to determine the true value of their animals in the marketplace, and creates greater opportunity for buyers to manipulate and pay lower prices.|$|R
