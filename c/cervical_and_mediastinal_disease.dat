30|$|Primary mediastinal goiters are {{considered}} in Rives classification established in 1947 (Rives 1947) as an aberrant goiter. The precise description of PMG {{is defined as}} the presence in the mediastinum of thyroid tissue that met the following criteria: the cervical thyroid gland can be present or absent with no history of thyroidectomy, there is a total discontinuity between the <b>cervical</b> thyroid <b>and</b> the <b>mediastinal</b> goiter, the mediastinal mass receives its blood supply from the <b>mediastinal</b> vessels <b>and</b> no history or evidence of malignancy is documented in both <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> goiters (Shields 1995; Foroulis et al. 2009).

40|$|Background: Primary thyroid {{lymphoma}} is {{an uncommon}} neoplasm frequently associated with lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT). Once the pathologic diagnosis of primary thyroid lymphoma is established, imaging {{plays an important}} role in tumor staging and evaluating treatment response. The present case discusses the role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 F-FDG PET) /computed tomography (CT) in this clinical setting along with the potential diagnostic challenges. Patient Findings: A 44 -year-old man with a history of LT and hypothyroidism presented with an enlarging goiter. Initial imaging evaluation showed markedly enlarged gland with bilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> adenopathy. Histopathologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of primary thyroid lymphoma on a background of LT. An 18 F-FDG PET/CT revealed increased uptake in the gland and lymph nodes. Follow-up 18 F-FDG PET/CT after chemotherapy showed interval decrease in FDG uptake in the thyroid gland associated with interval decrease in the size and metabolic activity of the <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> superior <b>mediastinal</b> lymph nodes. Conclusions: The frequent association of LT with primary thyroid lymphoma and the overlap of their clinical and pathologic findings pose a significant diagnostic challenge. While other imaging techniques are helpful in evaluating anatomic local and regional extent of primary thyroid lymphoma, 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be of an added value in evaluating its metabolic activity and detecting regional and distant disease as well as in assessing response to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Negative-pressure {{pulmonary}} edema accompanied by hemorrhage as {{a manifestation of}} upper airway obstruction is an uncommon problem that is potentially life-threatening.

30|$|Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) {{accounts for}} approximately 10  % of all lymphomas diagnosed {{in the developed}} world annually [1]. The WHO classification divides HL into two main types: classical HL (CHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominance HL (NLPHL). CHL is further subdivided into four histological subtypes: nodular sclerosis CHL (NSCHL), mixed cellularity CHL (MCCHL), lymphocyte-rich CHL (LRCHL) and lymphocyte-depleted CHL (LDCHL) [2]. HL has bimodal age distribution with most patients diagnosed between 15 and 30  years of age, followed by another peak in adults over the age of 50. HL is usually confined to the lymph nodes. <b>Cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> lymph nodes are the most common site of lymph nodal involvement in HL. In mediastinal lymph nodes, prevascular and paratracheal subsets are most commonly affected. Isolated infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy occurs in less than 10  % of patients at diagnosis [3].

40|$|Perforation of the {{oesophagus}} still {{carries a}} high mortality, despite chemotherapy and antibiotics; {{and whether the}} rupture be in the cervical or the thoracic oesophagus, conservative management seems to be unsuccessful in most cases. Con-servative measures have included the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs, intravenous fluid, gastrostomy, {{and in some cases}} drainage of the pleural cavity <b>and</b> of the <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> tissues. Barrett (1946) has pointed out that in patients suffering from spontaneous rup-ture the slit in the wall of the oesophagus may be of a considerable size, whereas the communication into the pleura may be relatively small. In consequence there is inadequate drainage into the pleural cavity and severe mediastinitis results. Fluid in the pleural cavity may be secondary, a consequence of the irritation of the gastric juices, so that simple drainage of the pleura is insufficient to relieve the toxaemia of the mediastinitis.

Methods We present {{a case of}} a 41 -year-old woman with known metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (T 1 bN 1 aMx) in whom sarcoidosis-affected <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> lymph nodes demonstrated uptake of thyroid-targeting radionuclides. Only the minority of these nodes demonstrated radionuclide uptake, raising the suspicion of adjacent or coexisting sarcoid and metastatic involvement. Selective uptake of thyroid-targeted radionuclides by isolated sarcoidosis is, to our knowledge, a previously undocumented occurrence. Results Biopsies of uptake-negative mediastinal nodes revealed sarcoidosis. Pathology from a subsequent neck dissection excising uptake-positive cervical nodes also showed sarcoidosis, with no coinciding malignancy. Conclusions We document a case of sarcoidosis causing a selectively false-positive thyroid scintigraphy scan.

The experimental disease has the same features as the epizootic. It has been maintained for study by serial passages accomplished either by intranasal instillation or by pen contact. Eight strains of the virus have been established experimentally during three epizootic periods. The clinical disease induced by these eight strains has been in general the same although its severity and mortality have varied. The principal features of the pathology of swine influenza are an exudative bronchitis accompanied by marked damage of the bronchial epithelium and its cilia, a peribronchial round cell infiltration, and massive pulmonary atelectasis. The latter is modified somewhat by a round cell infiltration of the alveolar walls. The lymph nodes, especially the <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> ones, are hyperplastic and edematous.

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} use of CT imaging, chest radiography remains a very important diagnostic modality in the evaluation of lung parenchymal <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> <b>diseases,</b> providing a vast amount of useful information. This information is generally derived from the relationships among the normal anatomic structures of the mediastinum, pleura, and lungs, which represent the basis of the "cardiac silhouette" and "mediastinal lines-and-stripes" concepts that potentially {{play an important role in}} the establishment of a diagnosis or a spectrum of diagnoses before proceeding to CT imaging. The capability of recognizing an abnormal chest radiograph on the basis of the displacement, deformation, or obscuration of one of these structures when compared with those in normal findings is often mandatory prior to requesting a potentially useful CT scan examination.

Tumors were categorized as 12 type E (SQ), 6 type E (AD), 27 type Ge and 47 type G; of these 7 (58. 3 %), 3 (50 %), 19 (70. 4 %) and 14 (29. 8 %) and 23 patients, respectively, had lymph node metastases. No patients with type E (AD) and Ge tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis; those with type G tumors had no nodal metastasis at <b>cervical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediastinal</b> lymph nodes. Multivariate analysis showed that type E (AD) tumor was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions We should distinguish type Ge tumor from type E (AD) tumor because of the clinicopathological and prognostic differentiation. Extended gastrectomy with or without lower esophagectomy according to tumor location <b>and</b> lower <b>mediastinal</b> <b>and</b> abdominal lymphadenectomy are recommended for EGJ cancer.
