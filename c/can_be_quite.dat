For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E

5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E
5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Atlantic torpedo {{is capable}} of {{generating}} up to 220volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators. Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes, though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans. It is an aplacental viviparous species, wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year. The electric shock of this species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> severe and painful, {{though it is not}} fatal. Because of its electrogenic properties, the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon. Prior to the 19th century, its liver oil was used as lamp fuel, but it is no longer of any economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers, but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The brolga breeds {{throughout}} its range in Australia and New Guinea. The {{start of the}} breeding season is largely determined by rainfall rather than the time of year; thus the season is February to May after the rainy season in the monsoonal areas, and September to December in southern Australia. The flocks split up and pairs establish nesting territories in wetlands. In food-rich habitats, nests <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> close together, and are often found {{in the same area}} as those of the sarus crane. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a raised mound of sticks, uprooted grass, and other plant material sited on a small island in shallow water, or occasionally floating. If no grasses are available, mud or roots unearthed from marsh beds are employed. Sometimes the birds make hardly any nest, take over a disused swan nest, or simply lay on bare ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
5|$|When approached, {{the coffin}} ray tends to keep {{still in its}} place of {{concealment}} on the sea floor. As a result, many divers, swimmers, and bathers have been shocked after accidentally contacting it. While not life-threatening, the shock <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> severe. The shock can still be perceived by a person pouring a stream of seawater on the ray. The coffin ray has no economic value. In 1883, Edward Pierson Ramsay noted {{that it was the}} only ray native to Port Jackson that was inedible. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawlers, but is hardy enough to usually be returned to the water alive. It is also caught in lobster traps and infrequently taken by spear fishers. As it remains common and widespread, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern. It has been kept in public aquariums, but requires moving food.|$|E
