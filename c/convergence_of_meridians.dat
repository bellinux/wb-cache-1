40|$|The high {{latitude}} filtering techniques commonly {{employed in}} global grid point models {{to eliminate the}} high frequency waves associated with the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>meridians,</b> can introduce serious distortions which ultimately affect the solution at all latitudes. Experiments completed so far with the 4 deg x 5 deg, 9 -level GLAS Fourth Order Model indicate that the high latitude filter currently in operation affects only minimally its forecasting skill.

40|$|Variable-resolution grids {{are used}} in global {{atmospheric}} models to improve the representation of regional scales over an area of interest: they have reduced computational cost compared to uniform high-resolution grids, and avoid the nesting issues of limited-area models. To address some concerns associated with the stretching and anisotropy of the variable-resolution computational grid, a general convolution filter operator was developed. The convolution filter that was initially applied in Cartesian geometry in a companion paper is here adapted to cylindrical polar coordinates as an intermediate step toward spherical polar latitude–longitude grids. Both polar grids face the so-called “pole problem” because of the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> at the poles. In this work the authors will present some details related to the adaptation of the filter to cylindrical polar coordinates for both uniform as well as stretched grids. The {{results show that the}} developed operator is skillful in removing the extraneous fine scales around the pole, with a computational cost smaller than that of common polar filters. The results on a stretched grid for vector and scalar test functions are satisfactory and the filter’s response can be optimized for different types of test function and noise one wishes to remove...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Extensive {{empirical}} {{work has}} shown that species richness decreases roughly exponentially or quadratically with latitude. What {{appears to be a}} latitudinal gradient in fact may simply be a negative correlation of latitude with area at that latitude, due to <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>meridian</b> at the poles. There is simply less area at high latitudes, which means fewer niches and fewer opportunities for spe-ciation, hence diminished biodiversity at high latitudes. Similarly, analytic geometry of a cone shows that species number should decrease linearly with altitude on a conical mountain. Here, I provide an explicit mathematical model of the area hypothesis of species richness along latitude and altitude gradients. I re-analyze a previously published latitudinal gradient dataset and show that species number is a linear function of the predicted area and that species number is more fully explained by predicted area than by a quadratic function of latitude. However, analytic geometry is not needed if precise measures of area are known...|$|R
40|$|In a {{latitude-longitude}} coordinate system, {{with the}} mathematical pole {{located at the}} geographic pole, the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meridians</b> (as one moves northward) brings the grid points sufficiently close together that the CFL linear stability criterion (1) Ax/At> c (Ax = r cos 6 A) becomes impossible to satisfy without an inordinately short time step At. A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed which fall into two broad categories: 1) one may simply delete grid points from the grid as one moves north (Kurihara, (2)) such as to maintain an approximate constancy to the geographic distance between grid points or 2) one may perform some sort of smoothing to either the data fields or the tendency fields to suppress the growth of CFL unstable waves. There are rather severe difficulties associated with the solutions o...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its highly}} autonomy, the strapdown {{inertial}} navigation system (SINS) is widely used in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) navigation. Initial alignment is crucial because the initial alignment results {{will be used as}} the initial SINS value, which might affect the subsequent SINS results. Due to the rapid <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> Earth <b>meridians,</b> there is a calculation overflow in conventional initial alignment algorithms, making conventional initial algorithms are invalid for polar UUV navigation. To overcome these problems, a polar initial alignment algorithm for UUV is proposed in this paper, which consists of coarse and fine alignment algorithms. Based on the principle of the conical slow drift of gravity, the coarse alignment algorithm is derived under the grid frame. By choosing the velocity and attitude as the measurement, the fine alignment with the Kalman filter (KF) is derived under the grid frame. Simulation and experiment are realized among polar, conventional and transversal initial alignment algorithms for polar UUV navigation. Results demonstrate that the proposed polar initial alignment algorithm can complete the initial alignment of UUV in the polar region rapidly and accurately...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> {{toward the}} South Pole causes unique {{problems}} for geometrical comparison of structural geological and geophysical datasets from Antarctica. The true North reference direction ordinarily {{is used for}} measuring and reporting vector data (strike, trend) in Antarctica, as elsewhere. However, over a latitude distance of just 100 km at 85 ° South, the angular difference in the true North direction exceeds 10 °. Consequently, when performing a regional tectonic analysis of vector data (strike, trend) for structures such as faults, dike arrays, or geophysical lineaments {{oriented with respect to}} North at different sites, it is necessary to rotate the data to a common reference direction. A modular arithmetic function, performed as a spreadsheet calculation, offers the means to unify data sets from sites having different longitude position, by rotation to a common reference direction. The function is SC ≡ SM + ∆L (mod 360), where SC = converted strike; SM = measured strike; ∆L = angle in degrees longitude between reference longitude and study site; and 360, the divisor, is the number of degrees in Earth’s circumference. The method is used to evaluate 1) paleomagnetic rotation of the Ellsworth-Whitmore Mountains with respect to the Transantarctic Mountains, and 2) orogenic curvature of the Ross Orogen...|$|E
40|$|Currently, most {{operational}} forecasting models use latitude-longitude grids, whose <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> {{towards the}} poles limits parallel scaling. Quasi-uniform grids might avoid this limitation. Thuburn et al, JCP, 2009 and Ringler et al, JCP, 2010 {{have developed a}} method for arbitrarily-structured, orthogonal C-grids (TRiSK), which has many of the desirable properties of the C-grid on latitude-longitude grids but which works {{on a variety of}} quasi-uniform grids. Here, five quasi-uniform, orthogonal grids of the sphere are investigated using TRiSK to solve the shallow-water equations. We demonstrate some of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the hexagonal and triangular icosahedra, a Voronoi-ised cubed sphere, a Voronoi-ised skipped latitude-longitude grid and a grid of kites in comparison to a full latitude-longitude grid. We will show that the hexagonal-icosahedron gives the most accurate results (for least computational cost). All of the grids suffer from spurious computational modes; this is especially true of the kite grid, despite it having exactly twice as many velocity degrees of freedom as height degrees of freedom. However, the computational modes are easiest to control on the hexagonal icosahedron since they consist of vorticity oscillations on the dual grid which can be controlled using a diffusive advection scheme for potential vorticity. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{limitation}} of many explicit finite-difference global climate models is the timestep restriction {{caused by the}} decrease in cell size associated with the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> near the poles. A computational grid in which the number of cells in the longitudinal direction is reduced toward high-latitudes, keeping the longitudinal width of the resulting cells as uniform as possible and increasing the allowable timestep, is applied to a three-dimensional primitive equation ocean-climate model. This ''reduced'' grid consists of subgrids which interact at interfaces along their northern and southern boundaries, where the resolution changes {{by a factor of}} three. Algorithms are developed to extend the finite difference techniques to this interface, focusing on the conservation required to perform long time integrations, while preserving the staggered spatial arrangement of variables and the numerics used on subgrids. The reduced grid eliminates the common alternative of filtering high-frequency modes from the solution at high-latitudes to allow a larger timestep and reduces execution time per model step by roughly 20 percent. The reduced grid model is implemented for parallel computer architectures with two-dimensional domain decomposition and message passing, with speedup results comparable to those of the original model. Both idealized and realistic model runs are presented to show the effect of the interface numerics on the model solution. First, a rectangular, mid-latitude, at-bottomed basin with vertical walls at the boundaries is driven only by surface wind stress to compare three resolutions of the standard grid to reduced grid cases which use various interface conditions. Next, a similar basin with wind stress, heat, and fresh water forcing is used to compare the results of a reduced grid with those of a standard grid result while exercising the full set of model equations. Finally, global model runs, with topography, forcing, and physical parameters similar to those used for ocean-climate studies, are advanced to a near equilibrium state for both the reduced grid and the standard grid. Differences between the two are presented for typical fields of interest, and very little degradation of the solution due to the reduced grid is observed...|$|E
40|$|To {{solve the}} {{unavailability}} {{of a traditional}} strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in the polar region, a polar grid navigation algorithm for UUVs is proposed in this paper. Precise navigation {{is the basis for}} UUVs to complete missions. The rapid <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> Earth <b>meridians</b> and the serious polar environment make it difficult to establish the true heading of the UUV at a particular instant. Traditional SINS and traditional representation of position are not suitable in the polar region. Due to the restrictions of the complex underwater conditions in the polar region, a SINS based on the grid frame {{with the assistance of the}} OCTANS and the Doppler velocity log (DVL) is chosen for a UUV navigating in the polar region. Data fusion of the integrated navigation system is realized by a modified fuzzy adaptive Kalman filter (MFAKF). By neglecting the negative terms, and using T-S fuzzy logic in the adaptive regulation of the noise covariance, the proposed filter algorithm can improve navigation accuracy. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the polar grid navigation algorithm can effectively navigate a UUV sailing in the polar region...|$|R

5000|$|The heading {{indicator}} works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane {{defined by the}} longitudinal and the lateral axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The {{heading indicator}} is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. [...] The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise {{it would be necessary}} to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meridian</b> lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (orthodrome) flight path.|$|R
