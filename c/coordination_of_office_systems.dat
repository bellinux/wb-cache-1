40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have {{made possible the}} automation <b>of</b> traditional <b>office</b> functions such as document preparation, storage, retrieval, inter-personal communication, etc. With the increased pervasiveness <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> technology, selection <b>of</b> the appropriate technology components can be a complex and difficult task. There {{is a need for}} a methodology to aid in selecting <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components based on the needs of the particular operating environment. In this paper, we propose to structure the selection problem in a hierarchical fashion, with the top level representing the single overall objective, the intermediate level(s) representing the users' needs, and the lowest level representing the viable candidate set <b>of</b> alternative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> to be evaluated. A recently developed technique termed analytical hierarchies is employed, and a case study is presented to illustrate how the technique can be used in the selection <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Concentration of {{knowledge}} work in cities generates innovations entailing economic development. This paper addresses {{the challenge of}} turning around the present trend of urban sprawl toward the concentrated knowledge work in cities. The assumption is that dislocation <b>of</b> <b>office</b> and residential housing entailing longer commuting mileage is {{the main cause of}} urban sprawl. Methods: The life cycle costs method is used for comparison <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> is compared to the concentrated mega <b>offices</b> <b>system</b> outside cities, as well as the local and home offices within cities. The life cycle costs are assessed with statistical data on space, materials and energy, and information services. These are the main resources <b>of</b> the <b>offices</b> <b>systems</b> given labor and capital. Results: Commuting costs about 22 % of the annual average wage and causes congestion, fragmentation of districts, health risks and pollution. These high costs can be reduced by changes in the <b>office</b> <b>systems.</b> The present <b>office</b> <b>system</b> with commuting adds 40 % to the average labor costs. The innovative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> reduce these costs by 15 to 28 % <b>of</b> the present <b>offices.</b> Sensitivity analyses underpin the findings for nearly all urban conditions. The local <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> are particularly cost-effective. The local <b>office</b> <b>system</b> can also save nearly 78 % energy and reduce 74 % CO 2 emission <b>of</b> the present <b>offices</b> along with less space use. Congestion, as well as fragmentation of communities and nature caused by commuting can be avoided. Conclusions: Some project developers invest in the distributed offices. Policies encourage such investments if they reallocate funds from infrastructure into refurbishing of the available housing and internalize the external effects of land use in the costs of real estate development. These policies increase smartness of cities, reduce energy use, and improve living qualities in cities...|$|R

For many, it remains the only form <b>of</b> <b>office</b> automation technology. Office automation, however, is not just word processing, although it does include the function of facilitating and manipulating text. In reality, office automation is not one innovation, or one <b>office</b> <b>system,</b> or one technology, but rather it is the integration of a broad set <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>systems,</b> information processing and communications technologies. Office automation encompasses a wide span of applications which will be examined individually as well as collectively. Additionally, this thesis will take a cursory look at the problems of implementing an automated office and the possible impact it can have on human office workers. The purpose of this thesis is thus to provide a capsulated examination <b>of</b> what <b>office</b> automation is, what it consists of, what applications are available, and how it can be implemented.
