40|$|International audienceMany {{scholars}} in China {{have done a}} lot of research on regionalization of agricultural resources in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, but there is no quantitative research on agriculture of the whole plain. By using qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the basic data collected over 300 counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, considering such indicators as the natural resources of the plains and the yields of major crops and agricultural GDP,this paper designed the agricultural zoning of the plains. The Plain was classified into high-yield areas and low-producing areas. High-yield areas were divided into advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> advantageous regions <b>of</b> cotton, advantageous regions of oil, advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> and cotton, advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> and oil, advantageous regions of cotton and oil, and advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> oil and cotton. And these areas have been divided specifically. The research is of referential values for agricultural development of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, both practically and theoretically...|$|R

40|$|The report {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the rate of inequality in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages by households in the Czech Republic. It analyzes the said inequality on the basis of data from the Family Account Statistics for the period of 2001 – 2009. The main methodical tools for the performed analysis are the quantification of the Gini coefficient of natural consumption and the consumption expenditures for <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages <b>of</b> Czech households, the construction, quantification and verification of consumption functions. The obtained results evidence a greater balance in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages than which is shown by the allocation of the overall expenditures or income of Czech households. At the same time, the said inequality in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages is characterized by a slightly declining tendency in time. With regard to individual categories <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages, the greatest inequality can be defined in the case of dispensable commodities, which are consumed by quantitatively wealthier strata of the population, who are simultaneously willing to pay a higher price for them. Thus, for a number of commodities, we can note the greater quality <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and beverages consumed by higher income groups. These commodities may primarily be characterized as having a greater price elasticity. On the other hand, there are foodstuffs in the case of which consumers react more flexibly to changes in income, but whose consumption is relatively stable. Therefore, inequality of consumption is not unequivocally associated with income elasticity, but rather with price elasticity...|$|R
