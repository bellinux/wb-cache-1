But when the derivative law results not from different effects of one cause, but from effects of several causes, we can not be certain that it will be true under any variation in the mode of co-existence of those causes, or of the primitive natural agents on which the causes ultimately depend. The proposition that coal-beds rest on certain descriptions of strata exclusively, though true on the earth, so far as our observation has reached, can not be extended to the moon or the other planets, supposing coal to exist there; because we can not be assured that the original constitution of any other planet was such as to produce the different depositions in the same order as in our globe.

60|$|True {{it is that}} in {{the case}} of the {{practical}} inquirer, who is endeavoring to ascertain facts not for the purposes of science but for those of business, such, for instance, as the advocate or the judge, the chief difficulty is one in which the principles of induction will afford him no assistance. It lies not in making his inductions, but in the selection of them; in choosing from among all general propositions ascertained to be true, those which furnish marks by which he may trace whether the given subject possesses or not the predicate in question. In arguing a doubtful question of fact before a jury, the general propositions or principles to which the advocate appeals are mostly, in themselves, sufficiently trite, and assented to as soon as stated: his skill lies in bringing his case under those propositions or principles; in calling to mind such of the known or received maxims of probability as admit of application to the case in hand, and selecting from among them those best adapted to his object. Success is here dependent on natural or acquired sagacity, aided by knowledge of the particular subject, and of subjects allied with it.

In Gödel's first result he showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable system—such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic—a statement that can {{be shown to be}} true, but that does not follow from the rules of the system.

Ukrainian topic had a strong influence on Masłowski in his youth. It was carrying parallel: blustering vigor and lyrical musing. That was the Ukraine, which Maslowski saw and began to enact in his studio compositions. It was unlike the painting of the noble-knight's and hunter's Ukraine by Juliusz Kossak, Józef Brandt and Józef Chełmoński. A numerous images of Ukrainian themes may be mentioned: [...] "Odbicie branki" [...] (Reflection from Captive - exhibited 1878), [...] "Pożegnanie Kozaka" [...] (Farewell Cossack - illustration, 1878), [...] "Jarema's Duma" [...] (1879), [...] "Chłopcy w stepie" [...] (Boys in the Steppe - illustration, 1879), [...] "Noc" [...] (Night - exhibited in 1880), [...] "Tabun" [...] (Herd of Horses, 1880), [...] "Odpoczynek czumaka" [...] (Chumak's Rest, 1880), [...] "Wesele" [...] (The Wedding, 1881), [...] "Odpoczynek" [...] (The Rest, 1882), and finally [...] "Taniec Kozaków" [...] (Cossacks Dance - Kozachok, 1883), which {{is a kind of}} closure and synthesis of the whole.

An armed thinking in dialogue, which is a welcome and a synthesis-oriented reject Hegel, Heidegger notoriously Nietzschean inspiration, whose expression is what he calls [...] "dialectical existentialism.

Against this stands the active nature of the spirit that is always right and will, vital impulse of life but does not deny the claims, but does not repress the instincts that leads to full empowerment. But unlike Nietzsche who agrees with this reassessment of the vital forces, proposed ranking them according to their greater or lesser contribution to the implementation of the spirit and therefore the reverse, [...] "he says of what is happening in contemporary society. This understanding of the dialectical method allows you to recover the right of difference that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> the formalism of the synthesis of opposites.

In this area, the contradictions are insoluble when overcome in Hegel appears as reconciliation of opposites guaranteed by the necessary evolution, is given here as hiatus, the qualitative leap forward is the land of paradox where opposites coexist, land and carved by Kierkegaard. (Freedom, existence and being, 1942) Thus anchor their thinking in Heidegger for whom consciousness is not something theoretical but emotional.
