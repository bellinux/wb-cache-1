5|$|On October 6, 2001, {{the team}} was {{involved}} {{in what was then}} the most-attended hockey game in history: The Cold War. The Spartans set up a hockey rink {{in the middle of their}} football stadium, Spartan Stadium and played U-M before a crowd of 74,554. The game ended in a 33 tie. A decade later, the same two teams were again involved in the most-attended ice hockey game in history. This time, Michigan hosted the rivalry game at its Michigan Stadium. The Big <b>Chill</b> <b>at</b> the Big House set the current record with an officially certified crowd of 104,173.|$|E

25|$|Thereafter, {{the couple}} spent half {{their time in}} New Mills, {{and the other half}} in Calder Grove. Mackie paid for a new school at nearby Painthorpe, {{completed}} in 1875. In Derbyshire in the same year he became chairman of the New Mill School Board, and later on was a council representative for New Mills and an alderman on Derbyshire County Council. Back in Crigglestone in 1885, Mackie became chairman of the Liberal Association. While at Calder Grove, he served as a Sunday school teacher, was at one time a delegate to the Diocesan conference, and in 1899 was elected Wakefield YMCA's president. He died unexpectedly at the age of 54 after catching a <b>chill</b> <b>at</b> his and Mary's 25th wedding anniversary celebrations at Crigglestone. He was given a big funeral and buried in Derbyshire. A granite drinking fountain was erected at New Mills in his memory.|$|E
40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria ananasa) is a {{berry fruit}} {{belonging}} to the family Rosaceae and requires certain amount of cold temperature to initiate flowering. Present {{study was conducted with}} the objective to study flowering and fruiting responses of strawberry to growth hormone and chilling under tunnel conditions. The study comprised of six different treatments as; control, GA 3 (gibberellic acid) 200 ppm, GA 3 400 ppm, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C + GA 3 200 ppm and <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C + GA 3 400 ppm. Treatments were applied at vegetative stage before flowering. It was inferred from the study that strawberry plants responded much better to application of GA 3 at 400 ppm for their growth, flower stimulation, their number, quality features while <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> 4 °C proved better for maximum fruit production and better quality under tunnel condition...|$|R

25|$|Kansas City {{hosted the}} Miami Dolphins in the second-coldest game ever held at Arrowhead Stadium on December 21 with the game-time {{temperature}} at 10°F and a wind <b>chill</b> <b>at</b> −12°F. It was the coldest conditions that Miami had ever played in. Miami scored {{first on the}} opening drive with a touchdown by WR Ted Ginn, Jr.. Despite trailing 10–0 early in the game, Tyler Thigpen led the Chiefs to a 28–24 lead by halftime. The Chiefs failed to score a touchdown {{in the second half}} of the game, only managing a field goal by Connor Barth. The Dolphins broke a 31–31 tie with a touchdown by TE Anthony Fasano with 4:08 remaining in the game. With just over a minute remaining, Chiefs LB Demorrio Williams forced and recovered a fumble to give the Chiefs another chance to tie the game. A failed drive capped off by Thigpen's third interception helped Miami run out the clock. Thigpen threw a career best 320yards with two touchdowns, but also threw three interceptions. TE Tony Gonzalez became the first Chiefs player and first NFL tight end to record four 1,000yard receiving seasons. The game also marked the last time Gonzalez played in Arrowhead Stadium as a member of the Chiefs, due to his trade to the Falcons following the season.|$|E
500|$|Michigan's 17-point {{comeback}} against Notre Dame {{tied for}} the third-biggest comeback in Michigan history and {{tied for the}} second-biggest comeback at Michigan Stadium. The game's announced crowd of 114,804 set the all-time attendance record for a football game—college or NFL—and broke the Michigan Stadium attendance record. The previous Michigan Stadium record was 113,411 spectators, established at the 2010 [...] "Big <b>Chill</b> <b>at</b> the Big House" [...] ice hockey game. In recognition of his performance during the game, the Big Ten named Denard Robinson its Offensive Player of the Week, while the Davey O'Brien Award named him its Quarterback of the Week. He was also named Rivals.com's Big Ten and National Player of the Week and won the Capital One Cup Impact Performance of the Week.

40|$|Abstract. For the {{regeneration}} niche {{to contribute}} to the main-tenance of species diversity interspecific differences in sensi-tivity of seedling recruitment to environmental conditions is assumed. We experimentally tested differences between meadow species for the response of seed germination to chilling, and sensitivity of seedling recruitment to microscale heterogeneity. We also compared the dynamics of seedling recruitment in gaps. Seed germination was tested in standard laboratory germi-nation tests, comparing control seeds with seeds <b>chilled</b> <b>at</b> + 4 °C, and at – 14 °C for one month. Species responses varied from significant increases in germinability after chilling (e. g. Cirsium palustre, Betonica officinalis, Angelica sylvestris) to significant decreases (e. g. Hieracium umbellatum, Succisa pratensis, Selinum carvifolia). In some species, <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> + 4 °C has a similar effect to <b>chilling</b> <b>at</b> – 14 °C, in others th...|$|R

The game was played at Michigan's (American) {{football}} venue, Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, with a capacity of 109,901 as of the 2010 football season. When UM stopped sales to the public on May 6, 2010, with plans to reserve remaining tickets for students, over 100,000 tickets had been sold for the event. Ultimately, a crowd announced by UM as 113,411, {{the largest in the}} stadium's history (including football), saw the homestanding Wolverines win 5–0. Guinness World Records, using a count of ticketed fans who actually entered the stadium instead of UM's figure of tickets sold, announced a final figure of 104,173.|$|E

40|$|Key words: duck, {{chilling}} water temperature, breast meat quality ABSTRACT An {{experiment was}} carried out to inves-tigate whether variations in chill water temperature affect muscle shortening and meat quality in duck breast. Three chill water temperatures were applied to duck carcasses at 20 min postmortem for 30 min, including in ice water at 0 °C, in cold water at 10 °C, and in water at 20 °C. Results revealed that carcass temperatures were different (P 0. 05) among treat-ments, {{with the exception of}} 50 min postmortem. The pH of breast meat in the 0 °C treatment was higher (P 0. 05) in pH existed among treatments.
