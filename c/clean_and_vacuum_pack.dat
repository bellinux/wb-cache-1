Forty-five strains of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum were characterized for their growth capabilities at different temperatures, NaCl concentrations, and pH values and for in vitro lipolytic and proteolytic activities. Moreover, their spoilage potential in meat was investigated by analyzing the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in meat stored in air or <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs.</b> Almost all the strains were able to grow at 4, 10, and 20 °C, at pH values of 6 to 9, and {{in the presence of}} 2. 5 % NaCl. The release of VOCs by each strain in beef stored at 4 °C in air <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs</b> was evaluated by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) -gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. All the meat samples inoculated and stored in air showed higher numbers of VOCs than the vacuum-packed meat samples. Acetoin, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, and butanoic acid were the compounds most frequently found under both storage conditions. The contaminated meat samples were evaluated by a sensory panel; the results indicated that for all sensory odors, no effect of strain was significant (P > 0. 05).

Prior to testing, samples were cracked and roasted. Analytical tests included peroxide value, p-anisidine and TBA (thiobarbituric acid number). Volatile compounds were isolated using Head-Space-Solid-Phase-Micro Extraction (DVB/PDMS/CAR). Volatiles were analysed by chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results show that at – 18 °C peroxide, p-Anisidine and TBA values were lower compared to the other 2 storage temperatures. This indicates that lipid degradation was lowest at this temperature. The main compounds found in volatile components of both fresh and roasted macadamia nut were hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and ketones. Several compounds deriving from lipid degradation and Maillard reaction were detected such as hexanal, thiazole. This indicates that changes in volatiles of macadamia nuts result from compounds present in macadamia nuts which were the precursors of volatile compounds produced during roasting. Storage materials which were net bag and EVOH showed no significant effect on volatile produced during 2 months storage trial. Volatiles generated depend mainly on processing steps such as roasting.

The slaughterhouses were grouped by their average pH values of the muscles, prevailing at the moment when the temperature of the muscles reached 7 °C. The pH groups for LD were (i) low (5. 52 - 5. 63) (ii) medium (5. 84 - 5. 97) and (iii) high (6. 16 - 6. 17). The highest shear forces were in group (iii), being the toughest: 155 and 152 N/g, and the lowest in group (i) (the most tender) : 108 and 116 N/g, respectively. The regression equation for the shear force was SF= - 295. 4 + 73. 0 *(pH at 7 °C); (R 2 = 87 %). There was no significant correlation between the cooling rate and tenderness in SM, indicating {{that it is difficult to}} control the tenderness of all the muscles by the same cooling regime.

40|$|Sliding {{friction}} and adhesive contact interactions between microgear silicon-based MEMS teeth {{working in a}} <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> environment have been modelled using a multiscale hierarchical elastic structure. Here the results of numerical simulations based {{on the use of}} multiscale block model are presented. The tooth is modelled as a bulk silicon-based MEMS surface covered by roughness having two subscales specified by the character of interactions: atomic subscale level and adhesive subscale. Friction over completely meshing teeth surfaces is estimated by calculation of the total energy dissipated during sliding. The dissipation is caused by the different physical and chemical mechanisms. Due to the vacuum environment, these mechanisms reduced to the energy lost by the dissociation of chemical and van der Waals bonds, and by the elastic interlocking between the asperities located on the meshing micro-tooth surfaces. It is argued that due to the Polonsky-Keer effect, there is no plastic deformation of the MEMS tooth surface asperities because the asperity sizes are within the validity of this effect. The adhesion layer is defined employing ideas of the Maugis approximation. The adhesion force of each nanoasperity has assumed to be equal to the pull-off force in the Boussinesq-Kendall model corrected by the Borodich no-slip coefficient. The simulations show that MEMS with the clean silicon surfaces of teeth cannot work due to stiction between surfaces, while friction between tooth surfaces functionalised by carbon-based layer is much smaller. If the functionalised coating is worn away then stiction may occur...|$|R
40|$|A novel solvent mixture {{points the}} way to cheap, {{flexible}} sources of en-ergy and new applications such as self-powered electronic newspapers. During the last five years, increasing concern about global warming {{has led to an}} intense search for cost-effective alterna-tive energy sources such as photovoltaics. 1 Yet existing com-mercial silicon-based (i. e., inorganic) solar cells have limited use. Moreover, they require expensive and complicated manu-facturing processes involving <b>clean</b> rooms <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> cham-bers. Polymer (i. e., organic) solar cells built from thin films of organic semiconductors—conjugated polymers and small-molecule compounds provide two examples—are potentially versatile sources of cheap renewable energy, as they may ul-timately make it possible to print large-area solar cells on lightweight flexible surfaces at room temperature. Future appli-cations of this technology include self-powered electronic news...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Temporary {{abdominal}} closure methods {{allow for}} management of open abdomens where immediate primary closure {{is not possible}} and/or where repeat abdominal entries are necessary. We assessed pressure mapping and fluid extraction efficiency of three open abdomen dressing systems: ABThera™ Active Abdominal Therapy System, V. A. C. ® Abdominal Dressing System, <b>and</b> Barker’s <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> technique. Methods: An in vitro test model was designed to simulate physical conditions present in an open abdomen. The model consisted of a rigid rest platform with elevated central region and a flexible outer layer with centrally located incision. Constant − 125 [*]mmHg negative pressure was applied according {{to the type of}} system, under simulated dynamic conditions, using albumin-based solution with a viscosity of 14 [*]cP. Data were collected by pressure sensors located circumferentially into three concentric zones: Zone 1 (closest to negative pressure source), Zone 2 (immediately outside of manifolding material edge), and Zone 3 (area most distal from negative pressure source). Each value was the result of approximately 100 pressure readings/zone/experiment with a total of three experiments for each system. Results: Pressure distribution of ABThera Therapy was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) superior to Barker’s <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> technique in all three evaluated zones. Similarly, V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System pressure distribution was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) improved compared to Barker’s <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> technique in all zones. There were no pressure distribution differences in Zone 1 between ABThera Therapy and V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System; however, in Zones 2 and 3, ABThera Therapy was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) superior to V. A. C. Abdominal Dressing System. Conclusions: These data suggest that all approaches to negative pressure therapy for open abdomen treatment are not equal. Additional research should be conducted to elucidate clinical implications of data demonstrated here...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{base their}} {{purchasing}} choices on perceived quality {{and a bright}} red colour of beef is to many a sign of freshness and good meat quality, making colour the most important quality attribute for retailers. The most common consumer packaging types for beef in Sweden is high-oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), with the gas composition (80 % O₂; 20 % CO₂). The high-oxygen content gives the beef a stable bright red oxymyoglobin colour that is desirable to consumers {{at the moment of}} purchase and the addition of 20 - 30 % CO₂ prolongs the shelf life by inhibiting bacterial growth. Nonetheless, the high level of oxygen promotes oxidation of both proteins and lipids, giving an inferior product compared with packaging systems that exclude oxygen. Vacuum packaging expands the shelf life of beef even further than high-oxygen MAP and the tenderization continues throughout the storage time. However, the purple deoxymyoglobin colour and the visible purge loss in the vacuum bag are thought to be unattractive to consumers. The aim of this thesis was to study how storage time and packaging methods affects the quality of beef, comparing high-oxygen MAP with vacuum packaged and/or skin packed beef, with emphasis on colour, Warner-Bratzler shear force, sensory quality and oxidation of proteins. In conclusion, high-oxygen MAP systems for beef steaks were found to negatively influence shear force and water-holding capacity as well as the sensory attributes tenderness, meat flavour and juiciness, compared with beef steaks packaged in skin <b>pack</b> or <b>vacuum.</b> High-oxygen MAP might also lead to decreased α-tocopherol values and increased oxidation of proteins. Moreover, no clear differences was found between skin <b>packed</b> <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>packed</b> steaks for shear force, sensory quality and total loss, however, skin packed steaks had lower purge loss which might be more appealing to the consumers in retail display. Most research is done on frozen meat due to practical reasons. As the consumers mostly eat meat fresh, the differences in quality that comes with freezing should be taken into consideration when planning research...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} Halloumi cheese samples were {{produced}} from 1 : 1 mixtures of ewe's and cow's milk. Cheese samples {{were divided into}} two groups. Samples of the first group were dry salted <b>and</b> then <b>vacuum</b> <b>packed.</b> Next group samples were ripened in tin packs containing brine solution of 13 % salt content. The changes in chemical, microbiological and sensory properties of the samples were investigated during the ripening period. It was found that the samples of the first group had higher dry matter and fat contents and acidity values but lower salt and ash contents than the samples of second group. It was also observed that salt and ash contents and acidity values increased in both groups during the ripening period while pH values decreased. In microbiological view, coliforms, total viable, yeast and mould counts were higher in the first group than in the second one. Coliforms decreased in both groups during the ripening period. On the other hand, total viable, yeast and mould counts decreased in second group. According to sensory evaluations, the first group samples were more preferred. The yield of cheese was determined as 15. 40 %...|$|R
40|$|To {{insert the}} fresh cut fruit to markets is {{necessary}} to ensure that visual quality is not altered {{by the process of}} peeled and sliced; and also must ensure physical chemistry product quality. It was evaluated the physicochemical and physic properties of the pulp of green plantain (PPV), after vacuum impregnation (IV) with two solutions containing antioxidants (1 : Sulfites 500 mg/kg PPV fresh, 2 : mixture of 90 mg and 100 mg ascorbic acid citric acid / kg PPV fresh) plus preservatives, NaCl and EDTA, with <b>and</b> without <b>vacuum</b> <b>packed</b> (CV <b>and</b> SV), and stored at 4 °C for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days; in addition, it was compared with PPV without impregnating the same storage conditions. There was a tendency to decrease the pH and content of sulphites, and increase the °Brix, acidity and enzyme activity, while the aw and humidity showed no significant changes. Treatments controlled enzymatic browning for 15 days in the PPV were all those conditions packaged CV, besides to treatment with sulfites SV. The samples impregnated with the sulfite solution and packed CV and SV, had the higher strength, making these the most appropriate treatmen...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{morphological}} and functional characterization of a Carnobacterium maltaromaticum strain with a potential bioprotective effect isolated from vacuum packaged long shelf life beef. The morphological, biochemical and enzymatic profiles, the influence of different temperatures and atmospheres, and the microbial stability of fresh beef inoculated with the C. maltaromaticum strain were evaluated. The isolated C. maltaromaticum strain presented similar morphological, biochemical and enzymatic profiles as those of two reference strains (LMG 11393 and LMG 22902). The growth of C. maltaromaticum was slower in an atmosphere containing O 2 <b>and</b> CO 2. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> is therefore suitable for this bacterium. An antimicrobial effect against Enterobacteriaceae was highlighted on inoculated fresh meat stored under N 2. The functional characterization of this isolate will be further pursued by a genotypic characterization to better understand its potential bioprotective effect...|$|R
