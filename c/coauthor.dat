40|$|This paper {{describes}} and analyzes B. F. Skinner's <b>coauthoring</b> practices. After identifying his 35 <b>coauthored</b> {{publications and}} 27 <b>coauthors,</b> we analyze his <b>coauthored</b> works by their form (e. g., journal articles) and kind (e. g., empirical); identify the journals {{in which he}} published and their type (e. g., data-type); describe his overall and local rates of publishing with his <b>coauthors</b> (e. g., noting breaks in the latter); and compare his <b>coauthoring</b> practices with his single-authoring practices (e. g., form, kind, journal type) and {{with those in the}} scientometric literature (e. g., majority of <b>coauthored</b> publications are empirical). We address these findings in the context of describing the natural history of Skinner's <b>coauthoring</b> practices. Finally, we describe some limitations in our methods and offer suggestions for future research...|$|R

5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a <b>coauthor</b> and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
30|$|A global {{perception}} of the results indicates that we could successfully match 18.51 % of the <b>coauthors.</b> This {{is consistent with the}} interpretation that a significant portion of <b>coauthors</b> belongs to other institutions, and thus their CVs are not in our database.

40|$|It {{is found}} that alphabetized <b>coauthored</b> papers with two authors are more highly cited than non-alphabetized <b>coauthored</b> papers in both {{economics}} and agricultural economics.

We speculate that the preponderance of non-alphabetized papers in agricultural economics, as compared to economics, is due in some part to the differential importance of nonmarket-based criteria to evaluate {{research in this area}} as opposed to economics departments. ...|$|R
