Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.|$|E

However, formal constitutional amendment is not the only way in which <b>constitutional</b> <b>norms</b> change, and in some systems not even the most important. To the contrary, it appears to be more common for <b>constitutional</b> <b>norms</b> to adjust to changing circumstances and demands through alternative, ‘informal’ processes of change. Key questions, central to this dissertation, are: how should we understand and identify constitutional change that takes place without prior formal constitutional amendment? Why do significant constitutional developments sometimes occur without new constitutional writing? And are alternative mechanisms of constitutional change capable of functionally substituting formal constitutional amendment mechanisms? Examining and comparing topical cases from Japan, the United States and Germany, this dissertation not only sheds new light on questions regarding the phenomenon of informal constitutional change itself, it also compels us to rethink our ideas about how the realms of law and politics relate to one another across time. Exploring the important – yet understudied – phenomenon of informal constitutional change is particularly relevant at a time when the context in which <b>constitutional</b> <b>norms</b> are embedded is changing more rapidly than ever...|$|R

Once the works on the first tunnel are finished, the Swiss government plans to operate one single lane in each tunnel (northbound traffic in the newly constructed tunnel, southbound traffic in the renovated one) {{in order to maintain the}} current tunnel overall capacity, in compliance with the Swiss <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> that forbids a further growth of the traffic capacity across the Alps. The reconstruction would have lasted for several years in any variant - one variant would push the traffic over the mountain pass, another proposed to load the vehicles onto trains with a new terminal, a third would close the tunnel for several months every year over time range of a decade. All of these have their drawbacks and the usage of the second tunnel was chosen as the best option to allow for the reconstruction. Further usage of both tunnels was subject to a popular referendum that was held in February 2016, where it was approved. The actual upgrade mining of the second road tunnel would last from 2020 to 2027 at a cost of 2.7 billion francs for the whole project including the following reconstruction of the first tunnel.|$|E

40|$|Constitutional {{text and}} {{government}} action are at times discordant in important ways. This discrepancy occurs in both mature and emerging democracies. It {{can result in}} the underenforcement of constitutional norms and implicate the rule of law. When the <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> involves the right to vote, the gap between constitutions and governance inevitably triggers concerns about democracy as well. There is rich and ample debate within American legal scholarship over {{the effect of the}} underenforcement of constitutional norms on the scope and meaning of the norm. The arguments generally fall into one of two camps. One strand of argument suggests that judicial underenforcement of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> does not define the norm itself; nor does it absolve non-judicial actors from enforcing the full conceptual scope of the norm. That is, a constitution 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 are the foreground where the norm is defined. A second branch of underenforcement scholarship suggests that judicial implementation defines constitutional norms by employing the 2 ̆ 2 implementing doctrine 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 decision rules 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 used to enforce some aspect of the norm. This Article aligns itself with the first branch of scholarship and borrows the 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 thesis to examine the right to vote when it exists as a <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> in a maturing democracy. In particular, I extract two principles from the 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 thesis and employ them in the contexts of voting rights and comparative law to illustrate how and why underenforcement of a normative right to vote can occur in newer democracies. First, I adopt the position that the scope and meaning of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> may be greater than its actual enforcement. Second, I rely on the argument that under- or nonenforcement results not only from a lack of judicial enforcement but also from underenforcement by the legislative and administrative actors that are obligated to enforce constitutional norms to their fullest extent. By employing these two principles, this Article analyzes an under-recognized underenforcement of the right to vote that has evaded the force {{of some of the most}} liberal contemporary constitutions. It also analyses the subsequent judicial enforcement of that norm as an integral step toward full enforcement of the fair measure of the right to vote. To illustrate this phenomenon and apply the theory of constitutional underenforcement to practice, I use Ghana, in West Africa—a recently designated 2 ̆ 2 maturing democracy 2 ̆ 2 —as a case study...|$|E

The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that, in the criminal law context, an accused is entitled to challenge a law that violates the constitutional rights of third parties but that applies in a constitutionally sound manner {{with respect to the}} accused. This principle spawned the conventional wisdom that in order to obtain a declaration that a statute is invalid, a litigant must present voluminous legislative fact evidence to demonstrate that the statute unjustifiably limits rights of third parties.

It considers how, at face value, contemporary constitutional law reflects a post-constituent constitutional order, which is defined by a rupture with classical constitutional principles, such that the extra-legal source of constitutional order is diminished. However, it argues that the common perception of a decline in constituent power in <b>constitutional</b> <b>norm</b> construction is marked by an excessively literalistic understanding {{of the origins of}} constitutional norms and practices. As an alternative, drawing on systems-theoretical methodologies, the article proposes a functionalist, sociologically attuned reconstruction of the historical content of constitutional concepts, including the concept of constituent power. Through this perspective, it explains that constituent power, in conjunction with constitutional rights, always acted, not as an externally founding source of political agency, but as an inner projection of the political system, which served the internal organization of the political system as a distinct societal domain. The article concludes that the transnational constitutional models which are widespread in contemporary society, far from negating constituent power, re-articulate its primary functions, and they realize potentials for preserving the autonomy of the political system which constituent power always contained...|$|E
