5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> an access hatch over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E

5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat mood and includes an unusual die-cut <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> a textured surface.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} with the prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} a publicity stunt to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of Quick and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour plates to a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E

5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold <b>cover,</b> <b>with</b> one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E
5|$|Kill the Irishman {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997. Producer Tommy Reid heard that Rick Porrello, an Ohio policeman, was about to publish a book about Greene called To Kill the Irishman. Reid flew to Ohio and met with Porrello, who told Reid his grandfather was a high-ranking Mafia figure in Cleveland during the prohibition era. The meeting went well, and on March 17, 1998, they signed a deal for the film rights to the book. Getting Kill the Irishman produced was difficult. Reid frequently left deals unconcluded, and discovered that the script he’d commissioned was attached to a <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> another screenwriter and producer’s name listed. According to Reid, this was a common occurrence in Hollywood, and {{he claims to have}} spent over $1 million to ensure the film was made.|$|E

The <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> the most votes will be the cover for the disc. Voting started that same day. The DVD and Blu-ray include eight deleted scenes, with the Blu-ray Combo Pack containing an opening scene from Part 2 featuring Harry and Ollivander discussing the Deathly Hallows. Deathly Hallows – Part 1 performed well in DVD sales, selling 7,237,437 DVD units and adding $86,932,256 to the gross revenue of the film, bringing the total to $1,043,331,967.|$|E
5|$|Players have {{discovered}} that {{the cover of the}} North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a watermark from IGN, and traced the source to an image taken from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover has no such error.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy incarnation of the Mega Man series came {{after the release of}} Mega Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to Mega Man. The North American version of this game and the first DOS Mega Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple touch-up of Mega Man 3s regional <b>cover,</b> <b>with</b> the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.|$|E

40|$|Four {{patients}} with five wounds {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with three occlusive dressings: DuoDERM, Restore and Comfeel Ulcus; the dressings were left intact for 24 - 48 h. When the dressings were removed, it was found that wounds that had been <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore and Comfeel contained coagulated sanguinous material. Two wounds that had been <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, were then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved. Although these preliminary data suggest that DuoDERM gel may have fibrinolytic properties, more extensive and controlled studies are needed to assess the characteristics of this dressing...|$|R

5|$|The final French {{operation}} in the Atlantic during the campaign {{was an attempt to}} send seven frigates and corvettes to the French West Indies in September, laden with supplies to help maintain the strength and morale of the garrisons. With Willaumez believed to be still at sea, September 1806 seemed a good time to send a squadron into the Atlantic, but in fact the force was spotted within hours of leaving Rochefort by the British blockade force under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood. Hood's force gave chase and the large ships of the line soon caught up the frigates in heavy weather. Sending four of his ships off in different directions, Soleil attempted to give them <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> his three largest vessels, but after a hard-fought battle in which Hood lost an arm, four of the French frigates were captured.|$|E
5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
5|$|When Kubo {{was asked}} to make a <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> a female {{character}} during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable for such role. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to see the image. In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such as when {{she is going to}} be executed in the manga.|$|E
