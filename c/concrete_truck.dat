A 4. 5 -km stretch of badly damaged <b>concrete</b> <b>truck</b> lanes was rebuilt in only two 210 -hour (about 9 days) one-roadbed continuous closures, using counterflow traffic and 24 -hour operations. The same project would have taken 10 months using traditional nighttime closures. This "Rapid Rehab" project adopted state-of-the-practice technologies to accelerate construction, to mitigate traffic disruptions, and to propagate project information. As a result, traffic demand through the construction work zone was reduced by 20 percent, and the maximum peak-hour delay was reduced by 50 percent. Web surveys showed dramatic changes in public perception to the Rapid Rehab approach from initial reluctance and objection to support. Advantages of using this method of fast-track accelerated reconstruction included: a shorter period of disruption for the traveling public, 30 -year life expectancy for the new pavement, improved safety for motorists and workers, and a 25 percent reduction in construction costs ($ 6 million savings) when compared to traditional repeated nighttime closures.

Concrete washout water is belief to cause blockage to drainage and pollution thus affecting the ecosystem and water quality in the drainage system. Therefore, the main aim {{of this research is}} to determine concrete washout water quality which affecting the urban drainage. In this research, concrete washout was collected from concrete laboratory after concrete mixing. Samples taken from three different mixes of concrete. Water quality index then measured and compared with the National Water Quality Index (NWQI). The result shows that the water quality index for all types of mixes increase the water quality category to Type VI and V. The high pH value itself which are more than 7 shows that the concrete washout is high in alkali.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the workability of fresh portland cement concrete while it is still in the mixing truck by determining fundamental rheological parameters (plastic viscosity and yield stress). Nine concrete mixtures with different values of yield stress and plastic viscosity were tested in a <b>concrete</b> <b>truck.</b> The measurements made with the truck were based on the typical method of determining the flow behavior in a traditional fluid rheometer; that is, the shear rate in the mixing truck was swept from high to low by varying the rotation speed of the drum. The results of these experiments are discussed and compared with data provided by the ICAR rheometer, a portable rheometer designed for measuring concrete rheology. The test results indicate that the mixing truck equipment is sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in yield stress, slump, and plastic viscosity. However, the plastic viscosity determined by the truck measurement did not correlate with plastic viscosity as measured by the ICAR rheometer, while the yield stress determined by the truck measurement did correlate well with the measured slump and the ICAR rheometer results. Suggestions are given on how to improve the mixing truck for better use as a rheometer. Key words: concrete; concrete rheometer; mixer truck; rheology...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: Oxyfibre is {{a new type of}} surface chemically modified polypropylene fibre used to reinforce and improve the overall properties of concrete materials. The product is the first type of polypropylene fibre with a permanent modified wettable surface in the world and has the international patent in major regions in the world. Oxyfibre is an ideal reinforcement for concrete to improve the cracking resistance, impact resistance, toughness and durability of hardened concrete materials. When using in steel reinforced concrete structures, the fibres in concrete can help to reduce the corrosion rate of the steel reinforcement and thus prolong the service life of the concrete structures. Oxyfibre can be used with all the conventional concrete mixing procedures and mixing ratio. Oxyfibre can be added into concrete via hand mixing, all type of mechanical mixers, ready mix concrete batching plant and ready mix <b>concrete</b> <b>truck.</b> The fibres have found wide applications in construction industry, such as float foundation, concrete floor and pre-cast concrete components, etc. In transportation industries, Oxyfibre has already been successfully used in ordinary concrete road, farm road, parking lot, road side drainage, underground road way in mine and in sprayed concrete for tunnel and shaft lining to prevent rock blasting. In these applications, Oxyfibre is mainly used to replace the steel mesh and thus results in a reduction in material and labour cost.

40|$|Hundreds of ready-mix {{concrete}} trucks are dispatched daily from {{ready-mix concrete}} plants. On average, a <b>concrete</b> <b>truck</b> has a carrying capacity ranging from 7 to 9 cubic metres of concrete, requiring about 1500 litres of water. In addition, 500 to 1300 litres of water {{are used to}} wash out the excess concrete when the truck returns. Based on these figures, {{it is clear that}} the ready-mixed concrete industry consumes large amounts of fresh water. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using the wash water as mixing water in new concrete. The specific goal of this project is to determine the influence of the high pH and dissolved solids content of the wash water on the durability of concrete, particularly with respect to de-icing salt induced corrosion of steel reinforcement. Two types of mix designs were used in this research: a standard class N and a higher strength, structural C 2 concrete. Two sets of concretes specimens were made with both mix designs: one with wash water and one with clean water. The project consists of a multi-component experimental program, beginning with wash water characterization, then pore solution and cement chemistry, followed by an evaluation of the effect of wash water on concrete workability and mechanical properties, resistance to de-icing salt scaling, and corrosion of reinforcing steel embedded in the concrete. In addition, the effect of the wash water on the effectiveness of air entraining agents (AEA) is being determined using air void analysis of specimens with different AEA contents. On the basis of the results obtained from the comparative study using wash water versus tap water, it appears that wash water can be used as mixing water for the production of concrete without compromising the durability properties related to corrosion and salt scaling performance. In addition, the mechanical and plastic properties of wash water concrete meet all standards pertaining to the use of wash water concrete and are similar to those of tap water concrete. Finally, the pore solution, thermal analyses, and water analyses of wash water and tap water showed comparable results. Overall, with regards to the tests conducted thus far, the use of wash water as mixing water in concrete poses no durability concerns...|$|E

40|$|Delivery {{precision}} and fleet optimisation are highly prioritised within the ready mix concrete industry. Introducing a Global Positioning System (GPS) for logistic steering and planning provides {{a tool to}} make improvements on these areas. Such a system is presently under evaluation at a ready mix concrete supplier in Stockholm, Sweden. The system consists of GPS receivers in the trucks that send relevant information via the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) net to a server. A direct effect of implementing a GPS system is that the plants and the order central {{will be able to}} better control the whereabouts of the <b>concrete</b> <b>trucks.</b> As a result {{it will be possible to}} decrease the waste time at the plants. Another result is that the ratio of usage of <b>concrete</b> <b>trucks</b> will increase, leading to cut-downs in the truck fleet. It is further believed that the lead-time at work sites can be reduced as the delivery precision is improved. By eventually letting the contractor be a part of the system the possibilities for a good production planning at the work site will increase and the non-value adding activities will decrease due to reduced waiting time. The article presents findings from a pilot study in Stockholm, Sweden. An important ambition is to find out if the system gives the expected benefits. The customer value is evaluated through interviews and time measurements. Godkänd; 2005; 20070322 (ysko) </p...|$|R
