5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Jose Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans {{of becoming a}} teacher. He and his sister Teresa began frequenting the Black Cat Bar, a center of the city's Beat and bohemian scene. Sarria and Teresa both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet as to which of them <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when {{he was unable to}} work and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Dick about his {{relationship}} with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, who says that Dick mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to dig into the financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E

5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though {{she says she has}} not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

25|$|In late August 1951, Kalchinian, a {{recovering}} drug addict, met Sherman at a doctor's office {{where they were}} both getting treatment for their addiction. They talked about drugs, and Kalchinian eventually asked Sherman if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> some as his own methadone program wasn't working. Sherman resisted, citing his own efforts to get clean.|$|E

25|$|At the time, however, Gray {{could not}} afford the bus or train fare to Annapolis, so he hired on as an {{apprentice}} seaman on a tramp steamer out of Galveston. During the journey to Philadelphia (the closest the steamer <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to Maryland), Gray taught calculus to the ship's captain, a Bulgarian named Frank Solis, in return for basic lessons in navigation. Once in Philadelphia, Gray hitchhiked to Annapolis.|$|E
25|$|Alan and Dale Klapmeier {{grew up in}} DeKalb, Illinois. Their parents {{bought a}} second home in the early 1970s on a small farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Aviation {{was a part of}} the {{brothers}}' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to stop crying at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale was known to repeatedly pester their father into letting them build real ones. When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning to drive a car. While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as a way of getting cheaper flying lessons. He would often go around visiting small airports to talk to pilots and even told his friends that he wanted to design aircraft, speaking about how he and his younger brother would one day compete with Cessna.|$|E
500|$|... "Park Safety" [...] {{was written}} by Aisha Muharrar and {{directed}} by Michael Trim. It featured a guest appearance by comedian Andy Samberg as Carl, the park ranger. Samberg and Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler previously appeared together as regular cast members in the NBC sketch comedy series, Saturday Night Live. The role of Carl was written with Samberg in mind because the writing staff knew they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> as a guest appearance as long as filming corresponded with his Saturday Night Live schedule, although the character was tweaked slightly when it was confirmed Samberg would definitely play him. Samberg also knew most of the supporting cast, writers and staff when the episode was filmed. During an interview about his performance in the episode, Samberg jokingly responded: ...|$|E

500|$|Peale {{journeyed to}} London, hoping that Moore's {{connections}} <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> {{instruction in the}} parting process. [...] Although he visited the Royal Mint, he found officials there unhelpful and unwilling to teach him. In England, Peale studied the method of assaying via the humid process at Percival N. Johnson's refinery, and in 1835 introduced it to the Philadelphia Mint, replacing assaying by cupellation. Peale wrote that he [...] "cannot speak in too high terms of Mr. Percival Johnson... I have derived much useful information in his refinery particularly his method of separating silver, gold and paladium [...] by a shortened process". While in London, Peale ordered a delicate balance scale from his friend, expatriate American Joseph Saxton, and later induced Saxton {{to return to the}} United States and work for the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
500|$|Rigby said Hannah {{had married}} Darren {{to try to}} fit in and impress people. She added that Hannah would never have gone out with Darren willingly, [...] "not even under the influence". She felt Hannah stayed married to Darren to annoy her parents and to get attention. Darren begins scheming with Cindy to scam The Dog. Darren decides to stay married {{to try to get}} The Dog back, so proposes that they do not get their {{marriage}} annulled to Hannah. Dawson said, regarding his plan to scam Hannah, that [...] "Hannah wants an annulment and so does Darren … at first. The cogs begin to turn in his twisted mind after Cindy points out that being married to Hannah <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> The Dog back. He plans to pretend he's falling in love with her and, motivated by money, tries to make her fall in love with him".|$|E
500|$|McCoy {{completed}} 20of his 29passing attempts, accumulating 333yards {{through the}} air. [...] For {{the first time}} in the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the firstdrive of the secondhalf. [...] True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first appearance as a Texas player in the firstquarter, when he participated in a single play. He came out of the game after the play before returning in the thirdquarter as McCoy's replacement. On his first drive, Chiles led the Longhorns 80yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball 4times for 49yards. [...] He also threw oneincomplete pass (one of twohe threw in the game) and handed off to Vondrell McGee threetimes for thirty-oneyards. Redshirt freshman Sherrod Harris replaced Chiles for the final twodrives of the game. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how the Longhorns <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> more playing time.|$|E

50|$|The {{fear that}} Crawford might die before the mob <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to <b>him</b> {{collided}} with the fear that the sheriff might spirit him out of town, and at 3 p.m., around 200 white men besieged the jail, captured and disarmed Sheriff Burts, and abducted Crawford.|$|R

Roger W. Straus Jr., suggested that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> $1,000 by selling it to a mass publication. [...] "Rescue at Truk" [...] ran in Collier's and was later widely anthologized. He published {{an article about the}} [...] "Capture at Truk" [...] which made the cover of Life magazine.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2012, Chibnall {{contacted}} Ólafur {{to ask him}} {{to compose}} the music for Broadchurch. [...] "The music is a narrative all of its own," [...] Chibnall later said. [...] "I'd heard Ólafur's music and it just broke my heart. I instinctively felt if we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him,</b> that would be amazing." [...] Ólafur agreed to join the production, and his hiring was publicly announced in December 2012. Ólafur called working on Broadchurch series one [...] "an absolute pleasure. The creators and directors gave me complete artistic freedom and encouraged me to be as bold as possible. Which is what every artist wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Widlar {{was a hard}} {{person to}} work with, but the few {{men and women who}} could, like Talbert and Jack Gifford, joined his inner circle for life. Widlar and Talbert closely guarded their trade secrets and kept {{unwanted}} co-workers out of the loop. Gifford, one of those accepted by Widlar and Talbert, said that Widlar [...] "would almost talk to nobody and he would only talk to me on, you know, if I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> in the right mood. And he was still secretive as hell". Talbert pushed Widlar's experimental orders through his plant at top speed, saving his partner four weeks on every batch {{at the expense of other}} orders. Fairchild executive Don Valentine said in 2004: [...] "This was a phenomenal duo of highly eccentric — or whatever the word is beyond eccentric — individuals". Former Fairchild photographer Richard Steinheimer said in 1995: [...] "Talbert handling the fabrication and Widlar handling the design, they ruled the world and led the world in linear integrated circuits for a couple of decades." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008, {{newspapers}} {{speculated that}} he was wanted by Chelsea in the January 2009 transfer window, in a rumoured £8 million bid by Luiz Felipe Scolari. Gareth Southgate laughed off the rumours suggesting that Chelsea <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> for such a small fee, saying {{that if he was}} even to start to consider selling him, then Chelsea's bid would have to be much higher. Tuncay scored two goals in as many games; during his side's 2–0 victories over both West Ham in the FA Cup and against Liverpool in the league, with the latter bringing an end to both Liverpool's 15-match unbeaten run, and Boro's 14-match winless run in the league. The win against West Ham takes Boro to their fourth Quarter Final in the FA Cup in four consecutive seasons. Against Tottenham in March, he had 2 goals again ruled out for offside, in a game which Tottenham defeated Boro 4–0. April 2009 saw Tuncay score Boro's quickest goal of the season, just 3 minutes into the game. The match, against Hull City, finished 3–1 to Middlesbrough in what was described as a [...] "must-win game" [...] by manager Gareth Southgate.|$|E
