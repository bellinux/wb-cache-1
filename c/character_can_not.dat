60|$|Yes (answers the Owenite), {{but these}} words, “if we will,” {{surrender}} the whole point: since {{the will to}} alter our own character is given us, not by any efforts of ours, but by circumstances which we can not help, it comes to us either from external causes, or not at all. Most true: if the Owenite stops here, {{he is in a}} position from which nothing can expel him. Our character is formed by us as well as for us; but the wish which induces us to attempt to form it is formed for us; and how? Not, in general, by our organization, nor wholly by our education, but by our experience; experience of the painful consequences of the character we previously had; or by some strong feeling of admiration or aspiration, accidentally aroused. But to think that we have no power of altering our character, and to think that we shall not use our power unless we desire to use it, are very different things, and have a very different effect on the mind. A person who does not wish to alter his <b>character,</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be the person who is supposed to feel discouraged or paralyzed by thinking himself unable to do it. The depressing effect of the fatalist doctrine can only be felt where there is a wish to do what that doctrine represents as impossible. It is of no consequence what we think forms our character, when we have no desire of our own about forming it; but it is of great consequence that we should not be prevented from forming such a desire by thinking the attainment impracticable, and that if we have the desire, we should know that the work is not so irrevocably done as to be incapable of being altered.|$|E

He is such a rich character that people can not imagine him disappearing. According to Jean-Michel, Blueberry has even rubbed shoulders with Eliot Ness.

We had created the possibility to highlight Blueberry in a panoramic manner by concurrently publish several different series, {{in which he is}} young, less young and, why not, old eventually. We even could have told the story of his death without ending the series. Blueberry is a particularly intimate life companion. He is part of me, but it should not become an obsession. That is the reason why I have given him the chance to escape me by entrusting him to others. In essence, it has become Blueberry's fate to be condemned to life by his creators." [...] —Giraud, on his firm conviction that, due to the biography, Blueberry is now for the ages, and how it has allowed the Blueberry universe to expand beyond the boundaries of the main series. In 1974 Charlier had a sixteen-page background article added to [...] "Ballade pour un cercueil" [...] (...) , when the book was first released. The article concerned a fictitious biography of Mike Steve Donovan, alias Mike S. Blueberry, detailing his life from birth to death, and written from a historic, journalistic point of view. When asked about it a decade later, Charlier clarified that once it became clear to him that Blueberry had become the central character of the series he had conceived, he then already postulated in his mind the broad strokes of the complete life and works of his creation, including the reasons for Blueberry's broken nose and odd alias. By the time [...] "Ballade pour un cercueil" [...] was ready for its book release, Charlier deemed the moment had arrived to entrust his musings to paper. There had been a practical reason as well for this. The story already ran 16 pages over-length and as contemporary printers printed eight double-sided comic book pages on one sheet of print paper, the addition of the 16-page biography was not that much of a bother for their production process.

The article chooses Na, LiPb and LBE {{three kinds}} of metal coolant, and makes a {{comparative}} analysis of the thermophysical properties of Na, LiPb and LBE when they are at liquid state. The results show that Na has the lowest density and the largest thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. There is a small difference between LBE and LiPb in terms of density, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. LiPb has the largest kinematic viscosity. The thermal conductivity of Na decreases as temperature rises, which is opposite of LBE and LiPb. The kinematic viscosity of LiPb increases as temperature rises. Considering thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, LBE and LiPb are not the best coolant. However, their high densities can economize equipments and materials at the same time.

40|$|What makes {{atypical}} employment forms attractive {{from the point}} of view of enterprises is the personnel-policy leeway that they provide with regard to working hours, remuneration or continuity of employment. In particular company-internal social relations based on trust are important for the ability of enterprises to make innovation and change, because trust increases workers' willingness for commitment and co-operation and promotes the diffusion of knowledge within the organisation. According to the thesis, the production factor of trust sets relatively narrow limits to the spreading of atypical forms of employment, since the establishment and strengthening of trust in organisations is strongly influenced by subjectively perceived employment and labour market prospects. Where individual job insecurity is perceived, a climate of mistrust prevails which is accompanied by an activation of non-co-operative behaviour among the employees. Although atypical forms of employment do not generally result in a loss of trust, fixed-term employment and temporary agency work, owing to their temporary <b>character,</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> bring about stable and lasting relations of trust between employers and employees. Thus the business-management interest in a maximum flexibility of the staff depending on the order situation conflicts with the interest in the workers' demonstrating a high level of willingness for performance and productivity. The latter requires the workers' trust and can best be achieved in stable and permanent regular full-time jobs with a relative employment 'guarantee'. For this reason for many enterprises maximum staff flexibility is not synonymous with optimum flexibility.

Although the size of large trichome is about four times that of normal one, the <b>character</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be recognized with the naked eye. However, it is easily identified by the roughness of leaf touch. The large trichomes develop {{on both sides of}} the leaf blades. The direction of trichome is both acropetal and basipetal. It is clearly distinguished from the extremely long trichome controlled by Pub gene. About 2, 300 varieties of our Barley Germplasm Center were screened by the leaf touch to find nine varieties with large trichome. Two of them were six-rowed local variety from Pakistan, and other seven were two-rowed varieties from Europe and Japan. All of them were hulled type. Crosses of six large trichome varieties with a normal Japanese variety resulted in the large trichome type F 1 s, suggesting the dominant nature of the trait. The large trichome line Hokuiku 17 was crossed with various linkage testres to study the mode of inheritance and the linkage relationship of the gene. In the F 2 populations, the large trichome was controlled by a single dominant gene named Ltr (large trichome), which was independentiy inherited from the following marker genes; br and gl- 5 on chromosome 1; li and ν on chromosome 2; uz on chromosome 3; K and gl- 3 on chromosome 4; trd on chromosome 5; ο on chromosome 6. On the other hand, from the cross between Hokuiku 17 and OUL 166, Ltr was found to be linked with s and fs on chromosome 7. Although the allelism test has not been completed, the very low frequency of the large trichome type (9 / 2, 300) indicates that the variant resulted from a recent mutation event, or the fitness of the variant is low in the natural and/or artificial selection. 岡山大学資源生物科学研究所大麦系統保存施設が保有するオオムギのうち約 2, 300 品種を対象として、葉身の表面に生じる毛（trichome）の変異体を検索した。 1 ） 2, 300 品種のうち 9 品種（ 0. 4 ％）が葉身の表面に剛毛を生じた。 2 ）通常の品種では毛茸の鈎状部分の長さが約 10 μmであるのに対して剛毛型の品種では約 40 μmであった。Pub遺伝子による長毛はこれよりはるかに長く、剛毛型とは明らかに異なった。 3 ）剛毛型は優性の 1 遺伝子（Ltr,large trichome）に支配されており、連鎖分析の結果、第 7 染色体にLtr-s-fsの順に配列されることが明らかになった...|$|E

This encourages a more tactically oriented and thought-out game play, which is in accordance to the rough-and-gritty ethos of the Cyberpunk genre. Also, the amount of damage a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> sustain does <b>not</b> increase as the character develops. The only way a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> become more damage resistant is to either become better at not being hit, physically augment their body with muscle (trained or implanted) or cybernetics, or wear armor.|$|R

I propose and develop a new method to recognize rehabilitation actions and quantize body moving angles through analyzing theprogression of pressure images. I also present a way to construct 3 D models of patients from 2 D pressure images. The 3 D <b>character</b> model <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only reflect the rehabilitation exercises, but also the visualization synchronizes with the actions of patients. Our experimental results on five on-bed exercises show that this systemcan accurately recognize patient's exercising type and track compliance of patients to prescribed treatment programs. The system is easy to setup and is suitable for long term monitoring...|$|R
