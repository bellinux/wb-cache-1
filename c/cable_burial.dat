50|$|FLAG {{includes}} undersea cable segments and two terrestrial crossings. The segments can {{be either}} direct point-to-point links or multipoint links which are attained through branching units. At each cable landing point, a FLAG cable station is located. The total route length exceeds 27,000 km and comprises 1,020 km of terrestrial crossings. Approximately 6,600 km of the submerged cable is buried 1 m below the sea bed. <b>Cable</b> <b>burial</b> was performed by either a submersible plough as the cable was laid or jetting the laid cable into the sea bed via remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).|$|E
50|$|Cables can {{be broken}} by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, {{turbidity}} currents, and even shark bites. Based on surveying breaks in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, {{it was found that}} between 1959 and 1996, fewer than 9% were due to natural events. In response to this threat to the communications network, the practice of <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> has developed. The average incidence of cable faults was 3.7 per 1000 km per year from 1959 to 1979. That rate was reduced to 0.44 faults per 1000 km per year after 1985, due to widespread burial of cable starting in 1980. Still, cable breaks are by no means a thing of the past, with more than 50 repairs a year in the Atlantic alone, and significant breaks in 2006, 2008, and 2009.|$|E

5000|$|After freeing {{one arm and}} smashing {{his way out of}} his buried vault, The Ultimate went on a rampage in Midwestern America, {{where he}} first {{encountered}} the Justice League. He defeated the entire team of superheroes in a matter of minutes, which in turn attracted the attention of Superman. Most notable {{is the fact that the}} creature fought the whole time literally with one hand tied behind his back (due to his ancient <b>burial</b> <b>cables),</b> yet was still able to lay waste to all opposition and much of the surrounding area. The only Justice Leaguer who could defend herself against the creature was Maxima. The creature gained its new name when League member Booster Gold remarked how the rampage resembled [...] "the arrival of Doomsday". The comment reached the broadcast media and led to the creature becoming known by its new name of Doomsday. Five Leaguers, including Superman, combined their energy powers in an attempt to take Doomsday down, but succeeded only in destroying the last of his ancient <b>burial</b> <b>cables,</b> allowing him to use both hands.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of such offshore testing of a wind turbine floating platform is electrical loading of the wind turbine generator. An option of interconnecting the floating wind turbine with the onshore grid via submarine power cable is limited by many factors such as costs and associated environmental aspects (i. e., an expensive and lengthy sea floor study is needed for <b>cable</b> routing, <b>burial,</b> etc). It {{appears to be a}} more cost effective solution to implement a standalone grid simulator on a floating platform itself for electrical loading of the test wind turbine. Such a grid simulator must create a stable fault-resilient voltage and frequency bus (a micro grid) for continuous operation of the test wind turbine. In this report, several electrical topologies for an offshore grid simulator were analyzed and modeled...|$|R
5000|$|The T1200 {{was built}} in the United Kingdom by Forum Energy Technologies’ Perry Slingsby Systems Remotely Operated Vehicle {{manufacturing}} brand. The T1200’s design was based around a smaller version called the T750 but with 50 percent (1,125 hp) more power and the capacity to trench larger diameter products ( [...] up to 36 inches) to burial depths of 3 m (10 ft) depending on soil strength. The T1200 was completed in April 2012 and delivered to Helix Energy Solutions Group’s ROV operations business unit Canyon Offshore in May 2012. In July 2012 the T1200 completed its first <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> project at the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm in the North Sea. Its first oil and gas project was completed in October 2012 with the burial of a 14 km (8.7 mile) export pipeline in the North Sea.|$|E
50|$|The old kiosk and arcade {{have been}} leveled, {{as well as}} some of the older {{buildings}} on the east side of the plaza, to create more open space. An agave garden will be the center of the new Plaza. Benches, better walkways, lighting and a tourism information booth will be added. However, most of the remodeling money is going towards the purchase and renovation of the buildings around the plaza, to make them better-suited to commercial and tourism purposes. The renovation extends to the facades of 32 buildings that face the plaza, as well as infrastructure projects such as water, drainage and <b>cable</b> <b>burial.</b> New pavement and sidewalks are being installed in the neighboring streets of Republica de Perú, San Camilito, Republica de Honduras, Monteros and Amargura. These streets will also get benches, trash receptacles, better lighting and garden spaces. The goal is to promote new private investment in the area, promoting it as a “Barrio Mágico del Distrito Federal” (Magical Neighborhood of Mexico City) and a Zona de Desarrollo Turístico Sustenable (Sustainable Tourism Development Zone).|$|E
40|$|This {{version of}} the thesis only covers the non-confidential part of the report. Tideway, as an {{offshore}} contractor, is often involved during {{the construction of an}} offshore wind farm to carry out <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> and/or rock placement operations. The process of burying a cable, by means of a trencher, is until now executed by subcontractors. Tideway considers conducting the <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> proceedings themselves, rather than hire a subcontractor. The goal of this research is to identify whether it is feasible to integrate burial equipment into the fall pipe ROV of the Flintstone, such that Tideway can carry out both burial and rock placement operations, as separate activities, using a single vessel. A literature study is performed in order to produce a qualitative analysis of the existing jet trenching theory, and revealed that both the relationship between jet-production and total momentum flux of a jet system (Vlasblom, 2003) and the mathematical relationships for moving jets (Yeh et al., 2008), can {{serve as the basis for}} a computational model. Furthermore, an overview of the main components of an ROV jet trencher is added to the report. A mathematical model is built in order predict the trench performances on the basis of the available hydraulic power. This model contains three different calculations methods, which are based on the collected theory, and provides a range of achievable burial depth versus ROV transit velocity, within which the actual trench performances are expected.

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{and the health}} performance of network assets are of a great interest due to power network operators. This project investigates methods of developing a prognostic capability for evaluating the health and long term performance of ageing distribution cable circuits. From the instant of installation and operation, the insulating materials of a cable will begin to age {{as a result of}} a combination of mechanical, thermal and electrical factors. Development of simulation models can significantly improve the accuracy of prognostics, allowing the targeting of maintenance and reduction of in service failures [1]. Real-time measurements taken close to underground cables can update the simulation models giving a more accurate prognostic model. Currently the project investigates a thermal prognostic simulation model which will predict the likely temperature impact on a <b>cable</b> at <b>burial</b> depth according to weather conditions and known loading. Anomalies of temperature measurements along the cable compared to predicted temperatures will indicate a possible degradation activity in a cable. An experimental surface trough has been set up where operation of power cables is simulated with a control system which is able to model any cable loading. The surface temperature of the cable is continuously monitored as well as the weather conditions such as solar radiation, soil moisture content, wind speed, humidity, rainfall and air-temperature<br/...|$|R
50|$|Most cable faults {{result from}} human {{activities}} especially ships' anchoring and commercial fishing that involves {{contact with the}} seabed, e.g. bottom trawling. Collectively, these activities account for over 65% of cable faults and occur primarily in water depths <200m. Damage resulting from natural phenomena account for around <10% of all cable faults, but this percentage can spike during a major event such as large earthquakes (>M=7.0) when multiple cables can break. On the continental shelf, waves and currents, especially those generated by storms, may abrade exposed cables and/or cause them to sway in the oscillating currents thus inducing fatigue. Those effects are minimized by <b>cable</b> armouring and <b>burial</b> beneath the seabed. Less frequent but nonetheless devastating are tsunami such as the 2011 Great Tohuku Earthquake of 2011 that severely damaged Japanese coastal infrastructure. Such earthquakes may also generate submarine landslides and turbidity currents - sediment-laden currents that travel long distances (100s to 1000s kilometres) at high speeds (up to 68 kilometres/hour). These turbulent flows break cables in water depths down to 5000m and deeper. For example, offshore Taiwan and Algeria suffered earthquakes in 2006 and 2003 that caused 22 and 29 cable breaks respectively. Turbidity currents also form under major rain storms. The discharged flood waters are so laden with mud and sand that they sink to the seabed and move downslope to form cable-damaging turbidity currents. Other natural causes of cable faults include deep-ocean currents, volcanoes and ice. While such forces may be locally significant, worldwide they are minor compared to earthquakes and storms.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to perform a preliminary study to determine the desirability/practicality of burying the communication cables in underground mines {{in order to protect}} then from the effects of fires and explosions We conducted discussions with Government and industry specialists on the physics of mine fires and explosions, mine disaster fighting, rescue, and investigation activities, and on nine operations. In addition we examined published experimental work and selected detailed NSHA accident reports on fires and explosions in underground mines. We found the overall desirability /practicality of <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> must be regarded at this time as highly questionable, because of its benefit limitations to special sceneries, its practical operational shortcomings, and the availability of alternative cable protection options...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method is detailed {{by which the}} ambient temperature parameter as applied to the calculation of ratings of cables buried in surface trough installations can be determined. Improvement in the accuracy of cable rating calculations will allow greater utilisation of the cable asset and assist for example in the planning of system outages for maintenance work. The proposed model calculates the temperature at the <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> depth based on measurements of solar radiation, windspeed and air temperature. The model is based on physical laws rather than empirical approaches that {{have been shown to}} be generally conservative in application. Results based on weather data monitored over a two-year period show that the ambient temperature of the soil at cable depth can be accurately determined and the model provides a significant improvement on existing methods...|$|E
40|$|As {{the use of}} {{offshore}} renewable energy sources such as wind and wave energy systems expands, they represent an increasing portion of the energy mix. Subsea cables connecting these resources are subject to many hazards, making <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> using cable ploughing an important tool in preventing unplanned outages and downtime. This represents a significant installation cost for offshore renewables {{and there is a}} need to improve the accuracy of tow force, plough speed predictions and final burial depth of the cable. These are currently made using semiempirical models as the large soil displacements involved cause instabilities in the finite element analysis. This paper provides an overview of work to develop new material point method numerical software to allow cable ploughing to be analysed and optimised. The focus of this paper is the physical modelling carried out to provide validation of the software, which includes both 1 g and centrifuge testing, as well as considering interim ways to improve the existing semi-empirical models...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{optimize}} power cable routing in a wind farm based on the expected morphological behaviour in the design lifetime of an offshore wind farm. Up to now methods to optimize cable route layout in offshore wind farms are only based on a flat seabed and do not take the seabed dynamics into account. For offshore wind farms, migrating seabed features in the form of sand waves are of great importance and may significantly alter the position of the seabed over the life time of the wind farm. This paper discusses the optimization of power cable routing in a morphodynamic seabed by assessing the power <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> depth in both the vertical plane, e. g. buried deeper in areas where future seabed lowering is expected, and in the horizontal plane, e. g. diverting the power cables around risk prone areas. Outcomes of the proposed method showed both cost and risk reductions for the Hollandse Kust (zuid) Wind Farm case study compared to state-of-the-art optimization based on a fixed burial dept...|$|E
40|$|Fibre optic {{telecommunication}} cables laid {{across the}} seaoor are buried {{in shallow water}} depth (< 2000 m) for protection against hazards arising from commercial shing and shipping activity. The cables are buried in a trench created by a sea plough, often jet assisted and towed from a ship, or by a ROV with jet legs straddling the cable and uidising the soil around it. Recent trends in the industry require more versatile burial tools, so a sound understanding of their fundamental mechanics is required to enable their optimun design and performance. The aim of this research program was to study the mechanics of force reduction on jet assisted <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> tools. The experimental program consisted of two stages, both conducted in controlled submerged conditions. The rst studied the effects of jet parameters, tool rake angle and pore pressure on tool force reduction. The second stage studied the action of a single horizontal buried jet on the surrounding soil, in which the rst series of experiments studied a static jet nozzle in sand and clay, and the second a dynamic jet nozzle. The flow rate or nozzle Velocity was varied in each respectively. The rst stage showed force reduction {{was caused by the}} reduced soil stress on the tool face in areas intersecting uidised sand. The larger the uidised area (FA), or the lower its intersection, the greater the force reduction. Evenly spaced nozzles gave greater FA coverage of the tool face. Interaction between jet and rake angle and force was complex, but upward angled jets and forward raked tools gave least force reduction. Results of the second stage showed cavity formation in sands characterised by shear erosion whereas in clay by pressure fracturing. The cavity size in sands was directly proportional to jet momentum ux and inversely proportional to tool Velocity. Mathematical models were developed from each stage, the rst to simulate tool force reduction created by the jets, given knowledge of the FA, and the second to simulate the FA created by a single jet. The second over predicted cavity length by a average of 7 % over the range of tool velocities tested. The combined models over predicted tool force, and suggested reasons for the discrepancies are given. Further research is required to rene the model and provide a useful tool for the design and operation of jet assisted <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> tools in saturated sands...|$|E
40|$|To {{manage a}} cable network {{effectively}} {{it is desirable}} to rate cable assets precisely. To investigate the conservatism of cable ratings provided by accepted modelling approaches several models have been employed to provide comparative continuous ratings for a directly buried cable group arrangement. Operational ratings are performed using expedient cable rating calculations, typically employing analytical or one dimensional (1 D) finite difference (FD) methods. The case for a directly buried cable group is considered; ratings are obtained using three methods including the international standard analytical approach (IEC 60287), 1 D FD and a 2 D finite element analysis (FEA) approach. A continuous equation for resultant heat-flux has been derived to more precisely model the dielectric loss in 2 D and 3 D FEA models. Comparing results shows that all the models have good agreement when modelling an isothermal ground surface condition and validate the 2 D FEA model against established approaches. The FEA model developed {{has been used to}} investigate more realistic ground surface boundary conditions. Results for different <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> depths and ground surface boundary conditions show that using the established methods can lead to overestimation of cable ratings in the case of shallow buried cables...|$|E
40|$|Offshore <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> {{is often}} {{performed}} with submarine narrow shaped ploughs. Available submarine narrow shaped ploughs have different geometries {{and the influence}} of several variables in the design of these ploughs was analysed during this thesis. This was done to develop a plough pulling force model for generic narrow shaped plough geometries in clay soil conditions. Additionally, the specific geometric shape of the Sea Stallion 4 plough was analysed as this plough is used by VolkerWessels Boskalis Marine Solutions and no satisfactory model for predicting the required pulling forces in clay was available. The following variables in the geometries of the narrow shaped ploughs were analysed: adhesion area, ploughing angle, tip shape and additional cutting teeth. In addition to these geometric variables the influences by ploughing depth and ploughing velocity were also analysed. First, a literature study was performed in order to identify analytical models already available for submarine narrow shaped ploughs and models from other branches that probably could be used to predict the required ploughing forces for narrow shaped ploughs. The following theories and models were reviewed: submarine plough models, ultimate bearing capacity models, narrow tine models and strain-rate dependency models. Concurrently with the literature study, orientating experiments were performed in order to gain insight in the force magnitudes occurring in small scale experiments and in order to gain insight in the influence by size, length and tip of the analysed geometries. Knowledge gained by the literature study and orientating experiments was used to develop a more advanced experimental setup, in which all selected variables were analysed. Results from the experiments were compared to predictions made by the analytical models. From this comparison, it was concluded that an adapted ultimate bearing capacity theory is most appropriate to predict the required ploughing forces. As the more advanced experimental setup, the results gained with this setup and the conclusions of the research are confidential, the repository version of the report does not contain these parts.

40|$|The Offshore wind {{industry}} harvests {{energy in}} offshore locations, using large turbines to convert this energy to electrical power. The electricity is gathered and transported to shore via cables. These cables {{need to be}} protected from external hazards that could result in damages and thus economic losses. Generally the cables are buried in the seabed or covered with solid objects like rocks or concrete matrasses. For <b>cable</b> <b>burial</b> a trench needs to be created in the seabed, this process is called trenching. Tideway acquired a trenching vehicle to enable provision of a wider range of cable protection solutions besides rock placement. Instead of more familiar trenching ploughs, this machine is equipped with a track drive and is self-propelling. To create trenches the vehicle has two options, mechanical cutting and jetting. Expected progress rates of the vehicle are to be determined to make a more realistic assessment of the expected project durations in the pre-execution stages. This can only be done if specific knowledge regarding the interaction between seabed soils and track drive is available. Further-more it is interesting to look at the most optimal setup of the vehicle for each project, make the machine work more efficiently and decrease the trenching duration. The current thesis proposes a model that can assess the trench production rates for a tracked trenching vehicle. Inputs for the model are CPT results, operational conditions and general vehicle specifications. Furthermore, the model considers the fact that the vehicle has a limited amount of power onboard. The sensitivity of the model parameters and impact on production is analyzed via a tool created specifically for Tideway’s subsea trencher. The project is based on a review of literature regarding soil mechanics, soil cutting and Terra-mechanics. Using this knowledge the model is developed considering a rest state and a steady driving state of the vehicle. The final model incorporates several sub-models, accounting for the resistant-, thrust forces, slopes and more. Phenomena as shear displacement and slip are incorporated and build towards the output for the model, a forward speed of the vehicle while cutting. The model can include seabed slopes and layered homogeneous soils. The presence of boulders, currents and effects of acceleration/braking are outside the scope of this thesis. Based on the developed model a software algorithm is developed in the open-source programming language Python. This algorithm generates a working area which indicates the zone within which all operational and machine boundaries are fulfilled. Additionally an optimal working-point is also suggested. This point corresponds to the given combination of operational and vehicle specifications, where the machine operates at a desired efficiency. Several conclusions are drawn, accompanied with recommendations regarding optimization of the model and industry procedures. The goal of thesis has been achieved, by developing the model and the tool. A validation process based on measured field data shows that the several (sub) models are within range of the measured data.
