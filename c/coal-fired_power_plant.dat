5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam {{generated}} from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{importance}} of <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> on the market of electric energy, with emphasis on aspects that fundamentally affect their production. <b>Coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> belongs nowadays among socially unpopular source of electricity. In recent decades intensively growing interest groups that support state intervention and regulation of the energy sector. This is essentially a massive promotion of renewable energy sources {{at the expense of}} fossil fuel plants. Analysis of individual power sources shows that despite the current restrictive measures imposed on <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> burning fossil fuels, and especially <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> electricity produced from coal resources is still competitive, despite some drawbacks has many positive qualities. <b>Coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> produce higher amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants than other types of <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, they are able to provide a stable supply of electricity to transmission network, and thus partially offset the high volatility of electricity supply from renewable energy sources. The price of electricity from <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> could be considered as relatively low in comparison with other energy sources. The analysis shows that in terms of practical economic policy is not economically justified to reduce the proportion of <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the total production of electricity...|$|R
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food.

50|$|In 2013 coal made {{up about}} 45% of Germany's {{electricity}} production (19% from hard coal and 26% from lignite). German <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are being designed and modified {{so they can}} be increasingly flexible to support the fluctuations resulting from increased renewable energy. Existing <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in Germany are designed to operate flexibly. Load following is achieved by German natural gas combined cycle <b>plants</b> and <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> New <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> have a minimum load capability of approximately 40%, with further potential to reduce this to 20-25%. The reason is that the output of the coal boiler is controlled via direct fuel combustion and not, {{as is the case with}} a gas combined-cycle <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> via a heat recovery steam generator with an upstream gas turbine.|$|R
25|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} of a <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> also reduces emissions.

Over the longer term, HELE plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for {{carbon capture and storage}} retrofit.|$|E
