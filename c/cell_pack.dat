[...] For this technique, suspension cultured cells of tobacco (e.g.: NT1 or BY2 cell lines of Nicotiana tabacum) are immobilised by filtration onto a porous support to form a well-aerated <b>cell</b> <b>pack,</b> then incubated with recombinant Agrobacterium for a time to allow T-DNA transfer, before refiltration to remove excess bacteria and liquid. Incubation of the <b>cell</b> <b>pack</b> in a humid environment for time periods up to several days allows transient expression of protein.

Honda acknowledged problems with the 2006-2008 models which could cause the batteries to [...] "deteriorate and eventually fail"; software updates were issued to prolong {{the life of the}} battery, but some owners reported these updates led to reduced fuel economy and power. The 132 NiMH <b>cell</b> <b>pack</b> suffers from imbalance as individual cells can't be monitored or charged. Monitoring is available at a 12 cell sub-pack level, but charging isn't. After years/miles of use, the cells become imbalanced as the cells charge/discharge at slightly different rates from one another. Eventually, strong cells are limiting the upper capacity of the pack and weak cells are limiting the lower capacity of the pack thereby reducing the usable capacity of the pack. There are higher capacity non-OEM packs available for less than the OEM price, and many owners have achieved years-long extensions of usable battery life by utilizing a grid charger. A grid charger is a home-made or purchased charger that connects your car to the power-grid. These devices impart a long, slow [...] "balancing" [...] charge where all cells are gently charged to their maximum capacity. This can temporarily restore balance and dramatically improve usable capacity for months at a time.|$|E

40|$|The {{boundaries}} of subnuclei of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were outlined {{on the basis}} of a step by step computer-assisted image analysis of coronal, serial sections of the hypothalamus in rats. The cell size-frequency histogram, <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> density, and the cell number were determined for each PVN subdivision. Three principal cell types were distinguished: small, short diameter (d) = 6 - 10 microns; medium-sized, d = 10 - 13 microns; and large, d = 13 - 19 microns. None of these cell types occur exclusively in any PVN subdivision. According to the predominant cell type, the PVN can be divided into magnocellular, mediocellular and parvicellular subnuclei. Large cells appear to form one subdivision in which the <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> density is relatively stable. Although the cell sizes showed a relatively large variation, no definitive subgroups (parts) could be distinguished. On the basis of <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> density, the parvicellular and mediocellular subnuclei can be further divided. The mediocellular cell group can be divided into a dorsal and a posterior subdivision. The parvicellular zone is subdivided into a periventricular and a large medial subdivision. Based on inhomogeneities in <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> density, the medial subdivision can be further divided into anterior, dorso-lateral, ventromedial and caudal parts. The estimated total cell number in the PVN (in both sides of the brain) is about 21, 500.

40|$|The {{development}} of multicellular organisms {{is accompanied by}} the formation of tis- sues of precise shapes, sizes and topologies. Remarkable similarities between tissue topologies, in particular proliferating epithelial topologies, in various species suggest that the mechanisms that govern the formation of tissues are conserved among species. To understand these mechanisms various models have been developed. In this thesis, we present a novel mechanical model for cell divisions and tissue for- mation. The model accounts for cell mechanics and cell-cell adhesion. In our model, each cell is treated individually, thus the changes in cell’s shape and its local rearrange- ments occur naturally {{as a response to}} the evolving cellular environment and cell-cell interactions. We introduce the processes of cell growth and divisions and numerically simulate tissue proliferation. As tissue grows starting from few cells, we follow the dynamics of the tissue growth and <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> topologies. The outcomes are com- pared with experimental observations in Drosophila wing growth. Our model accounts for the exponential decay of the mitotic index and reproduces commonly observed <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> topologies in proliferating epithelia. Next, we consider two biologically relevant division schemes, namely, division through asymmetric division plane and division by Hertwig’s rule. We study the im- pact of division planes on tissue growth and show that the division plane may affect <b>cell</b> <b>packing</b> topologies. Development of the tissue is accompanied by cellular rearrange- ments. We vary the extent of cellular rearrangements and analyse their effects on tissue topology.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} observer-based state-estimation techniques for the real-time prediction of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) of lead-acid cells. Specifically, an approach based on the well-known Kalman filter, is employed, to estimate SoC, and the subsequent use of the EKF to accommodate model non-linearities to predict battery SoH. The underlying dynamic behaviour of each cell {{is based on a}} generic Randles' equivalent circuit comprising of two-capacitors (bulk and surface) and three resistors, (terminal, transfer and self-discharging). The presented techniques are shown to correct for offset, drift and long-term state divergence-an unfortunate feature of employing stand-alone models and more traditional coulomb-counting techniques. Measurements using real-time road data are used to compare the performance of conventional integration-based methods for estimating SoC, with those predicted from the presented state estimation schemes. Results show that the proposed methodologies are superior with SoC being estimated to be within 1 % of measured.

The framework {{is used to calculate}} the maximum usable capacity of a battery pack composed of cells of varying capacity coupled to a balancing circuit of a specified type and size. In the duty cycle balancing case the effect of cell redundancy for packs with DC and AC outputs is explored. In the energy redistribution case, balancing performance of different circuit topologies and circuit ratings is evaluated. An experimental validation of the numerical prediction for the duty cycle balancing method is conducted for a pack of twelve cells, where the duty cycle of each cell is controlled using a full-bridge circuit. In all cases the numerical and experimental results show an agreement in usable capacity to within 1 %. The experimental results indicate that for a duty-cycle balanced pack constructed from cells with an extreme capacity range (where variation between cells is as large as the average cell capacity), the inclusion of two redundant cells in a 12 <b>cell</b> <b>pack</b> enables the extraction of 95 % more capacity than in the case of no redundancy...|$|E

As distinguished from nursery crops, floriculture crops are generally herbaceous. Bedding and garden plants consist of young flowering plants (annuals and perennials) and vegetable plants. They are grown in <b>cell</b> <b>packs</b> (in flats or trays), in pots, or in hanging baskets, usually inside a controlled environment, and sold largely for gardens and landscaping. Pelargonium ("geraniums"), Impatiens ("busy lizzies"), and Petunia are the best-selling bedding plants. The many cultivars of Chrysanthemum {{are the major}} perennial garden plant in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{cost per}} unit of power output from flat plate solar modules can most likely be {{achieved}} through efficient packaging of higher efficiency solar cells. This paper outlines a module optimization method which is broadly applicable, and illustrates the potential results achievable from a specific high efficiency tandem junction (TJ) cell. A mathematical model is {{used to assess the}} impact of various factors influencing the encapsulated <b>cell</b> and <b>packing</b> efficiency. The optimization of the packing efficiency is demonstrated. The effect of encapsulated <b>cell</b> and <b>packing</b> efficiency on the module add-on cost is shown in a nomograph form...|$|R
