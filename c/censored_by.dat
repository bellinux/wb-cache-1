5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively <b>censored</b> <b>by</b> the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily <b>censored</b> <b>by</b> the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were <b>censored</b> <b>by</b> the guards.|$|E

5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, {{and the editor of}} the Alaska Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and the Alaska Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, to compete with the News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded his weekly newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded the Alaska islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was <b>censored</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. Army. Fairbanks benefited from a military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{occurred during}} World War II, with activity from a German U-boat {{expected in the}} Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations for issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily <b>censored</b> <b>by</b> the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers {{about the loss of}} production of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of this storm was published in Texas and Louisiana. After the loss of life in this storm, the Government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.|$|E

40|$|To {{account for}} the {{correlation}} between failure and censoring, we propose a new frailty model for clustered data. In this model, the risk to be <b>censored</b> is affected <b>by</b> the risk of failure. This model allows flexibility in the direction and degree of dependence between failure and censoring. It includes the traditional frailty model as a special case. It allows <b>censoring</b> <b>by</b> some causes to be analyzed as informative while treating <b>censoring</b> <b>by</b> other causes as noninformative. It can also analyze data for competing risks. To fit the model, the EM algorithm is used with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in the E-steps. Simulation studies and analysis of data for kidney disease patients are provided. Consequences of incorrectly assuming noninformative censoring are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Pearl’s article {{provides}} a useful springboard for discussing further the benefits and drawbacks of principal stratification and the associated discomfort with attributing effects to post-treatment variables. The basic insights of the approach are important: {{pay close attention to}} modification of treatment effects by variables not observable before treatment decisions are made, and be careful in attributing effects to variables when counterfactuals are ill-defined. These insights have often been taken too far in many areas of application of the approach, including instrumental variables, <b>censoring</b> <b>by</b> death, and surrogate outcomes. A novel finding is that the usual principal stratification estimand in the setting of <b>censoring</b> <b>by</b> death is by itself of little practical value in estimating intervention effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Donald Rubin’s lucid {{discussion}} of <b>censoring</b> <b>by</b> death comments on several issues: he warns against mistakes, describes obstacles to inference {{that might be}} surmounted within a given investigation, and discusses barriers to inference that direct attention to new data from outside the current investigation. <b>Censoring</b> <b>by</b> death creates outcomes that are defined only contingently, such as quality of life defined only for survivors. If the contingency is an outcome of treatment—if survival could {{be affected by the}} treatment—then, as Rubin demonstrates, it is a serious analytical mistake to act as if the contingency were a covariate, a variable unaffected by treatment, when studying the effect of the treatment on the contingently defined outcome. This is one instanc...|$|R
