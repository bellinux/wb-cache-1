25|$|The ideal op amp has {{infinite}} <b>common-mode</b> rejection ratio, or zero <b>common-mode</b> gain.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{quadrant}} is {{the lower}} right 4 parameters and describes the performance characteristics of the <b>common-mode</b> signal SCCab propagating through the device under test. For a properly designed SDDab differential device there should be minimal <b>common-mode</b> output SCCab. However, the fourth quadrant <b>common-mode</b> response data {{is a measure of}} <b>common-mode</b> transmission response and used in a ratio with the differential transmission response to determine the network <b>common-mode</b> rejection. This common mode rejection is an important benefit of differential signal processing and can be reduced to one in some differential circuit implementations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} 741 op amp, the <b>common-mode</b> {{rejection}} ratio is 90dB, implying an open-loop <b>common-mode</b> voltage gain of about 6.|$|E
25|$|<b>Common-mode</b> gain: See DC imperfections, above.|$|E
25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor <b>common-mode</b> rejection ratios and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other <b>common-mode</b> interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{circuitry}} {{called the}} right leg driver {{can be used}} to reduce <b>common-mode</b> interference (typically the 50/60Hz mains power).|$|E
25|$|<b>Common-mode</b> gain: A perfect {{operational}} amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the differential input stage of an {{operational amplifier}} is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the <b>common-mode</b> rejection ratio (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E
25|$|Providing the {{interfering source}} remains uniform, or nearly so, over the {{distance}} of a single twist, the induced noise will remain <b>common-mode.</b> Differential signaling also reduces electromagnetic radiation from the cable, along with the associated attenuation allowing for greater distance between exchanges.|$|E
25|$|This {{feedback}} circuit tends {{to draw the}} common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage Vcom − 2 * VBE, where Vcom is the input <b>common-mode</b> voltage. At the same time, {{the magnitude of the}} quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1–Q4, such as hfe, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.|$|E
25|$|In a {{balanced}} line operation, the two wires carry equal and opposite signals, and the destination detects {{the difference between}} the two. This is known as differential mode transmission. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a <b>common-mode</b> signal which is canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.|$|E
25|$|The op-amp is {{one type}} of {{differential}} amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op-amps), the isolation amplifier (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to <b>common-mode</b> voltages that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).|$|E
25|$|This method {{starts to}} fail when the noise source {{is close to}} the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more {{strongly}} and the <b>common-mode</b> rejection of the receiver will fail to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce crosstalk in another and it is additive {{along the length of the}} cable. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged.|$|E
25|$|Suppression {{capacitors}} {{are effective}} interference reduction components because their electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or <b>common-mode</b> interference.|$|E

X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. On the other hand, Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or <b>common-mode</b> interference.|$|E
25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular <b>common-mode</b> voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor <b>common-mode</b> rejection ratio, weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E
500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency <b>common-mode</b> voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E
500|$|Prevention of {{high-frequency}} bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, {{interruption of}} bearing currents, and filtering or damping of <b>common-mode</b> currents for example through soft magnetic cores, the so-called inductive absorbers. Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded, symmetrical-geometry power cable {{to supply the}} motor, installation of shaft grounding brushes, and conductive bearing grease. [...] Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic-shielded induction motors. [...] Filtering and damping high-frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or motor bearing currents. [...] Another approach is to use instead of standard 2-level inverter drives, using either 3-level inverter drives or matrix converters.|$|E
500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, <b>common-mode</b> voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

2500|$|Here, the {{feedback}} resistor Rf provides a discharge path for capacitor Cf, while the series resistor at the non-inverting input Rn, when {{of the correct}} value, alleviates input bias current and <b>common-mode</b> problems. That value is the parallel resistance of Ri and Rf, or using the shorthand notation ||: ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{currents}} {{flow through}} the resistances connected to the inputs and produce small voltage drops across those resistances. Appropriate design of the feedback network can alleviate problems associated with input bias currents and <b>common-mode</b> gain, as explained below. The heuristic rule {{is to ensure that}} the impedance [...] "looking out" [...] of each input terminal is identical.|$|E
2500|$|... 1961: A {{varactor}} bridge op-amp. There {{have been}} many different directions taken in op-amp design. Varactor bridge op-amps started to be produced in the early 1960s. They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op-amps available in terms of <b>common-mode</b> rejection {{with the ability to}} correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>common-mode</b> voltage {{is formed}} {{out of the}} {{respective}} average values {{of the differences between}} the positive and negative phase voltages, which form the pulsating DC voltage. The peak value of the delta voltage [...] amounts ¼ of the peak value of the phase input voltage [...] and is calculated with [...] minus half of the DC voltage at 60° of the period: ...|$|E
2500|$|Finite input {{impedances}} : The {{differential input}} impedance of the operational amplifier {{is defined as}} the impedance between its two inputs; the <b>common-mode</b> input impedance is the impedance from each input to ground. [...] MOSFET-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive. [...] The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{difference}} is that more of the photons entering the camera will be detected by the Foveon X3 photosensor than is possible with a mosaic sensor. This is because each of the color filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes {{only one of the}} primary colors, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colors reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the color of the light impinging on each sensor element. Although the Foveon X3 has greater light gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus color-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires [...] "aggressive" [...] matrixing (essentially, removal of <b>common-mode</b> signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circuit}} {{involving}} Q16 (variously named rubber diode or VBE multiplier), the 4.5k resistor must be conducting about 100μA, with the Q16 VBE roughly 700mV. Then the VCB must be about 0.45V and VCE at about 1.0V. Because the Q16 collector {{is driven by}} a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ≈ 1V, regardless of the <b>common-mode</b> voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100mV / VT [...] ) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the crossover distortion of this stage.|$|E
2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases <b>common-mode</b> gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E
