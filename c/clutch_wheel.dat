40|$|Abstract:- Global {{automotive}} industry is growing rapidly in recent years. Increased torque range with deeper transmission ratio {{as well as}} overall vehicle refinements in modern trucks places higher demands on transmission and its components. Changing market requirement and driver comfort is also a new challenge in commercial market. With this overall effects design and development of transmission and its components {{plays a major role}} for performance, comfort and economically driven market. Synchronizer is one of the critical components which need to look upon. Synchronizer plays a vital role for gear shifting performance in manual gearbox without any shifting assistance. Synchronizers primary function is to reduce the rpm difference between two gears before gear shifting subject to time and more comfort. Increasing demand for performance, enhance life, less shift effort, less synchronization time, optimum size of Synchro pack and low cost has become an interesting area for engineer for improvement. More over existing synchronizer can be economically re-engineered into more efficient designs with the help of new mathematical tools and techniques. A mathematical optimization model can be developed to establish optimum cone parameter. A model of relationship can built between cone angle and sleeve champers angle, synchronizer size, coefficient of friction, cone torque and index torque. In this study a model was built in Matlab optimization toolbox pattern-search solver to find global minimum value of Cone angle which satisfy set of given and known design constrains. This Model can be used to select first cut synchro parameter with moderate accuracy. These Values can be then finer tune by customized and specialized softwareâs. It is not easy to study the entire gear-changing process from <b>clutch</b> till <b>wheels,</b> dynamical behavior of manual gearbox is too complicated to simulate, owing to the large number of elements involved in it. This study considers only major parameter involved in synchronization. Also generous experience and data is required to accurately select parameter with desired Shift feel and comfort...|$|R
5000|$|A Racing wheel, {{essentially}} a larger {{version of a}} paddle, is used in most racing arcade games {{as well as more}} recent racing simulators such as Live for Speed, Grand Prix Legends, GTR2, and Richard Burns Rally. While most arcade racing games have been using steering wheels since Gran Trak 10 in 1974, the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on fifth-generation consoles such as the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Many are force feedback (see Force Feedback Wheel), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a <b>clutch.</b> Most <b>wheels</b> turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the Logitech Driving Force Pro, Logitech G25 and Logitech G27 can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The Namco Jogcon paddle was available for the PlayStation game R4: Ridge Racer Type 4. Unlike [...] "real" [...] video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a soda can's) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some VCRs. The Nintendo Wii game Mario Kart Wii is bundled with the Wii Wheel: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the Wii Remote is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the kart during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the Nintendo 3DS game Mario Kart 7. When the steering wheel is placed {{on the back of the}} console, then it will have the same ability as in Mario Kart Wii by using the gyroscope in first-person mode.|$|R

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschÃ¤ftigt sich mit der Gruppenschaltungsansteuerung von Nutzfahrzeuggetrieben. Gruppengetriebe, d. h. in Reihe geschaltete Getrie-be, sind bei Nutzfahrzeugschaltgetrieben weit verbreitet. Es wird dann von Gruppenschaltungen gesprochen, wenn zwei in Reihe geschaltete Getriebe gleichzeitig die Ãbersetzung wechseln. Wird wÃ¤hrend der Schaltung die Last von der Getriebeeingangswelle genommen, handelt es sich um eine technisch beherrschbare Aufgabe. Bei Automatikgetrieben wird der Ãbersetzungswechsel aber mit anliegender Eingangslast ausgefÃ¼hrt. Die Automatikgetriebe zÃ¤hlen zur Kategorie der Lastschaltgetriebe. Bei Nutzfahrzeugautomatikgetrieben werden bisher Gruppenschaltungen vermieden, da die Ansteuerung der Kupplungen und Bremsen auch ohne Gruppenschaltung bereits anspruchsvoll ist. Die vorliegen-de Arbeit hat zum Ziel, den Gruppenwechsel unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Zug-kraftschaltung beherrschbar zu machen. Die Arbeit umfasst drei wesentliche Schwerpunkte. Hierzu zÃ¤hlt die Erstellung eines Getriebeprogramms fÃ¼r die Antriebsstrangstreckensimulation, die Optimie-rung der Ãbersetzungswechsel mit einem auf die Fragestellung angepassten Optimierungsprogramm und die Auslegungsempfehlungen fÃ¼r die Ansteuerung des Ãbersetzungswechsels in Automatikgetrieben. Aufgrund eines fehlenden Simulationswerkzeugs zu Beginn der Arbeit wurde fÃ¼r die Beantwortung des Ge-triebeverhaltens im Ãbersetzungswechsel ein entsprechendes Getriebepro-gramm entwickelt. Das Getriebeprogramm arbeitet als Unterprogramm innerhalb einer Basisantriebsstrangsimualtion fÃ¼r Streckensimulation und wurde so gestal-tet, dass beliebige Planetengetriebeanordnungen modelliert werden kÃ¶nnen. Aus der groÃen Anzahl von Simulationsrechnungen wurden Auslegungsempfeh-lungen fÃ¼r die Steuerung des Ãbersetzungswechsels abgeleitet. Das zeitlich sehr empfindliche Verhalten von Gruppenschaltungen fÃ¼hrt zu einem LÃ¶sungs-ansatz mit Kennfeldern. Durch das Vorhalten optimierter Ãberdeckungen fÃ¼r un-terschiedliche Schaltausgangsvoraussetzungen mit Hilfe von Kennfeldern konn-te die Gruppenschaltung auch unter dem Aspekt der Zugkraftschaltung beherrschbar gemacht werden. Product {{development}} {{according to}} current aspects cannot afford to neglect the customer's requirements. This influences the economical {{success of a}} product significantly. The technical solution {{must be based on}} the customer's requirements but without neglecting the basic demands which apply to every gearbox. The behaviour of the automatic transmission during a gearshift is of vital importance to the customer and can become the most important criterion when considering whether or not to purchase. Further main tasks of the automatic transmission are the automatic gear selection taking into consideration the efficiency, the power and the driver's wishes. In this case {{it is a question of}} fundamental technical requirements without which a product will not be successful. With an automatic transmission it is easier to drive a vehicle with the result that road safety is improved. The demands on the automatic transmissions show that the automatic control is of great significance. This thesis is largely concerned with the gear control. Via sensors, the gear control receives information regarding the state of the vehicle and the driver's requirements. With the input variables considering the shift-strategy, the output variables are determined. This process is taken over by the control program and/or the shift point control. In this way the control program determines the time of the gearshift. The gear steering has a further program which is called the shift quality control. The shift quality control activates the hydraulic valves and actually performs the gear ratio change. The design of the shift quality control is the nucleus of this thesis. Emphases of the thesis The thesis concentrates on three main points: the preparation of a detailed gear model for the power train simulation, the optimization of the gear shifting and the design recommendations for the timing of the gear shifting in automatic transmissions. Gear model The gear model enables the arbitrary arrangement of elementary planetary gearing on a modular basis. Additionally, the gear model makes it possible to illustrate the gear shifting without restrictions. Furthermore, the model preparation was influenced by the standards of the basic simulation. Because of this, the solution algorithm must be adapted to suit the basic simulation. The gearbox can be built up from six basic elements in any way required. The elements are a hydrodynamic torque converter, open elementary planetary gearing, <b>clutches,</b> free <b>wheels,</b> supplies and nodes. The hydrodynamic torque converter is the typical driving element of the automatic transmission. The elementary planetary gearing leads and changes torque and rotation speed. The clutches change the ratio. Free-wheels are exclusively used in the torque converter. The supplies lead the driving power to the relevant power train, or connect to the case of the gear box. The nodes link the different gear elements to each other. This structure can simulate automatic transmissions with arbitrary arrangement under realistic conditions, also during the gearshift. Optimization The optimization algorithm supports the calculation of the variants during the structuring. Afterwards it calculates the variants automatically in a so-called batch mode. The variation is carried out according to the chronological overlap of the acting clutches. That means that the opening and locking times are changed automatically. After the calculation the results are evaluated automatically. Basically this is a question of screening the results from the variation calculation. The procedure used here, the least squares method, means that evaluations can be carried out for several results. The procedure of the least squares method computes the deviations of a simulated process from an ideal previously defined. The optimization algorithm allows the objective classification of the shift-quality. Design recommendations The optimization calculation proved the sensitive behaviour of the gear change, particularly with group shifts. The design recommendations concern the chronological overlap, the pressure functions as well as the amount of the design pressure during the slipping time. These design recommendations are formulated in a general manner, although the object of consideration is the gearbox. Furthermore, design recommendations were formulated for group shifting and their chronological activation. The behaviour of the group shifting is very sensitive. Optimized characteristic diagrams can solve this sensitive behaviour. The optimized characteristic diagrams must be set up ready for the respective operational status of vehicles...|$|R
