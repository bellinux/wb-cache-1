2500|$|Mexico {{demonstrated}} {{patterns of}} noncompliance {{in the areas}} of judicial and law enforcement performance in FY 2008. Many of the systemic problems identified in previous compliance reports persist. Locating children and TPs in Mexico continues to be a serious obstacle for Convention applicants and often takes years. There are instances in which TPs flee into hiding when ordered to appear in court for a hearing on a <b>Convention</b> <b>application.</b> Of the USCA’s 47 unresolved cases concerning Mexico, 34 involve TPs and children who have not been located (see the [...] "Unresolved Return Applications" [...] section of this report for more information). Mexico devotes inadequate resources to locating missing children, severely impeding successful implementation of the Convention. In order to comply with the Convention, it is imperative for Mexico to devote more resources to locate missing children and bring TPs to justice.|$|E
2500|$|Merle H. Weiner in the Fordham Law Review {{pointed out}} that there was {{widespread}} media attention in the US during the late 1970s and early 1980s about international child abduction where the typical abductor was a foreign non-custodial male who abducted children from their primary caregiver. According to Weiner, this stereotype dominated the U.S. Congressional proceeding for ratification and resulted in a presumption in the US that abduction is always harmful to children. The Hague Convention makes no mention of domestic violence as a defense. Due to the focus on promoting return of children to their habitual residence, [...] "the domestic violence victim's ability to defeat a Hague <b>Convention</b> <b>application</b> for the return of their child, if possible at all, often turns more on fortuity and the judge's sympathy than on any principled rule of law." [...] The Australian delegate to the Hague Convention commission stated that: There is concern that the Convention is now being used by abusive (usually male) parents to seek the return of children and primary carers back to the country of habitual residence and that the Convention is moving away from what it was meant to deter. Recent statistics demonstrate that the majority of abducting parents are women, often those fleeing situation of abuse and domestic violence. There is also growing concerns regarding the correlation between incidents of child abduction and the presence of domestic violence and that the Convention does not give due consideration and sufficient weight to such mitigating circumstances {{in the context of a}} [...] "grave risk" [...] argument.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} Article V Convention process {{has never been}} used to amend the Constitution, the number of states {{applying}} for a convention has nearly reached the required threshold several times. Congress has proposed amendments to the Constitution on several occasions, at least in part, because {{of the threat of}} an Article V Convention. Rather than risk such a convention taking control of the amendment process away from it, Congress acted pre-emptively to propose the amendments instead. The Bill of Rights, which includes the first ten amendments as well as the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, was proposed in part because of a <b>Convention</b> <b>application</b> by the New York and Virginia legislatures at the suggestion of a letter from the New York State Convention to ratify the Constitution. The Convention would have been limited to those changes discussed at the various State ratifying Conventions. At least four other amendments (the Seventeenth, Twenty-First, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments) have been identified as being proposed by Congress at least partly in response to the threat of an Article V convention, bringing the total to 15 out of 27, a majority of the Amendments.|$|E

25|$|Mexico {{remains the}} {{destination}} {{country of the}} greatest number of children abducted from or wrongfully retained outside the United States by parents or other relatives. Despite coordinated efforts undertaken by the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Central Authority, and senior Department of State officials to press for more expeditious processing and resolution of cases, the systemic problems in Mexico's handling of <b>Convention</b> <b>applications</b> that were detailed in the 2002 Compliance Report persisted during the reporting period. The Department’s experience is that, relative to the large number of pending Convention cases in Mexico, the number of cases resolved annually in Mexico is quite small. Most <b>Convention</b> return <b>applications</b> remain pending and never progress to the point of a definitive adjudication. Among the U.S. Central Authority's greatest concerns is Mexico's inability to locate children. Other problems include long delays in adjudication of return applications, the Mexican Central Authority's lack of adequate resources to perform its role effectively, the absence of implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system, and an apparent lack of understanding of the Convention among many Mexican judges, which has resulted in Convention cases being treated as custody matters or mishandled in other ways.|$|R

By 1911, 29 states had Article V <b>convention</b> <b>applications</b> on file for an amendment providing for direct election of senators, just two short of the 31-state threshold. [...] As new States were being added the threshold increased, however those States had already passed resolutions supporting such a Convention. The final count is somewhat uncertain, but when either one or two further states were required the Senate finally conceded and passed its version of an amendment in May 1911, which was then approved by the House in 1912 and submitted to the states.|$|R

The Brazilian courts continue to show a troubling trend of treating Convention cases as custody decisions, and often deny <b>Convention</b> <b>applications</b> upon finding that the children have become [...] "adapted to Brazilian culture." [...] It takes many months before a court receives a case to analyze and many more months before a court issues a decision.

50|$|Mexican courts grant {{automatic}} {{custody of}} children below 7-12 years (depending on the state) to mothers {{unless they have}} been proven to be unfit. This maternal preference {{has been the subject}} of Constitutional challenges on the basis that the Mexican Constitution enshrines the equality of the sexes, but has been upheld on the grounds that the Constitution also protects the integrity of the family. Custody cases are also not immune to many of the problems found in Hague cases and, even if a custody decision were to be won it would not necessarily allow for the child to be taken back out of Mexico. In cases where taking the child back out of Mexico to the home country is sought the decision can be subject to the same lack of enforceability pending the exhaustion of all appeals that plagues Hague <b>Convention</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{trend is}} for Chilean courts to deny <b>Convention</b> <b>applications</b> upon {{finding that the}} child is well settled in the new environment. This result, which could be avoided if Chilean courts handled Convention cases more expeditiously, leaves the victim parent with the much less {{desirable}} option of filing an <b>application</b> under the <b>Convention</b> for mere access to the child, or for visitation, and even these applications in some cases have not resulted in contact between the left behind family and the child. In 2008, a Chilean court ordered a scheduled access visit by the LBP, and the left behind parent purchased and confirmed his plane ticket and accommodations for the trip. Hours before the parent was scheduled to board the plane for Chile, the Chilean Central Authority notified him that the Chilean judge had suspended the scheduled visitation. In April 2008, the Chilean Central Authority sponsored a seminar on the <b>Convention</b> and its <b>application</b> in Chile, including topics such as the emotional impact of international child abduction on children and parents, and the role of “network judges” in promoting the correct <b>application</b> of the <b>Convention</b> in Chile.

5000|$|A {{report in}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2011 {{described}} the movement for a convention as gaining [...] "traction" [...] in public debate, and wrote that [...] "concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for {{fundamental change in the}} document that guides the nation's government." [...] For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article V Convention calls at all, and {{even went so far as}} to adopt resolutions rescinding their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these states had adopted rescissions in 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively, but then reversed course in 2011.

25|$|The USCA {{observed}} {{the following three}} causal factors for judicial delays: (1)lack of implementing legislation or procedures for <b>Convention</b> <b>applications</b> and many Mexican judges following inapposite procedures found in state civil codes in resolving such cases; (2) {{lack of understanding of}} the Convention by many Mexican judges, as evidenced by extensive requests for information, including letters under Article 15 of the Convention from the USCA to confirm that a particular case involved an international child abduction as defined by the Convention; and (3) TPs absconding with the children when summoned to a hearing because they were notified of the hearing but neither they nor the children were secured in any way. The USCA has observed that a tool for securing children in the Mexican system is for the judge to place the child temporarily in a children’s protection service (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia, or DIF) shelter while the case is being processed, but judges are reluctant to place children in these shelters unless the TP is determined to be a clear danger to the child.|$|R
