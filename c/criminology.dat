5|$|At the party, Veronica {{notices that}} the “rape coasters” which test for date rape drugs do not {{actually}} work. Veronica, Mac, and Piz test various peoples’ cups and find nothing. After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s <b>criminology</b> professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the <b>criminology</b> professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, and they have a quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and <b>Criminology</b> supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years {{a number of}} {{scholars}} have called upon fellow criminologists to rethink the field’s priorities and methods, {{as well as the}} American criminal justice system and current punishment practices. Drawing on alternative <b>criminologies,</b> including constitutive and peacemaking <b>criminologies,</b> as well as the practice of reintegrative shaming, this paper presents a new model of criminal justice that combines aspects of adversarial, restorative, social, and transformative justice frameworks. The resulting “intersectional criminal justice” offers a holistic harm-reduction model that moves the focus of our criminal justice system away from “rough justice” and towards collective restorative healing and positive social change...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to recent discussions about <b>criminology’s</b> public role through an empirical case study {{analysis of the}} dominant discourse of ‘public confidence {{in the criminal justice}} system’ in England and Wales. The thesis begins by arguing that the recent literature reflecting on <b>criminology’s</b> public role has failed to adequately deal with the tensions created by the plural, value-dependent and contested character of criminological knowledge. Then, drawing on primary data from newspaper archives, parliamentary debates, research reports, academic books and papers, policy documents and focus group and interview transcripts, the thesis provides a multi-faceted analysis of the public confidence agenda. It argues that the dominant discourse of public confidence takes up a politically prominent ‘lay concept’ and, without clarifying what it means, discursively constructs it as a ‘real’ object which is both measurable and caused. This understanding of confidence reflects contingent historical conditions (including the ‘modernist’ criminological outlook), and is premised on an (unacknowledged) value-based decision about how to do research on how the public think and feel about the criminal justice system. The public confidence agenda in research and policy is a governmental project encompassing a double-epistemic aspiration: (i) to be epistemic (by providing scientific knowledge which shapes policy); and (ii) to promote a particular conception of criminological expertise (as episteme - objective, context-independent, scientific knowledge). As such it provides an excellent case study for reflecting on recent discussions of <b>criminology’s</b> public role. The thesis concludes that the starting point for any discussion of <b>criminology’s</b> public role in a democratic society should be an explicit acknowledgment of the value-based decisions which are implicit in every criminological project. Such acknowledgment provides a route to a more fruitful method for negotiating the inherent pluralism of the field, and thus to re-evaluating its public role.

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in <b>criminology</b> and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{held the}} title of Chef des Sicherheitspolizei und SD (Chief of the Security Police and SD) until 27 September 1939, when he became chief of the newly {{established}} Reich Main Security Office (RSHA). From that point forward, the RSHA {{was in charge of}} SS security services. It had under its command the SD, Kripo, and Gestapo, as well as several offices to handle finance, administration, and supply. Heinrich Müller, who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo, was appointed Gestapo chief at this time. Arthur Nebe was chief of the Kripo, and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers, including Otto Ohlendorf and Walter Schellenberg. The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS, and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those within the ranks of the Allgemeine SS. Members of the SD were specially trained in <b>criminology,</b> intelligence, and counter-intelligence. They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology.|$|E

5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the <b>criminology</b> class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Keith and Vinnie {{debate on}} Piz’s radio show, and Vinnie gathers some support about his lax underage {{drinking}} policy.

She helps Weevil retrace his steps and notices one of her <b>criminology</b> classmates, Jenny (Dianna Agron), involved with one of Weevil’s clients. Veronica deduces that Jenny and her circle of friends are responsible for creating the fake student IDs, disseminating them, and implicating Weevil. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing, and they run into Veronica, Piz, and Mac helping Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with his final project for a class. Veronica learns that one of Jenny’s group lives in the same town in Georgia where the student ID machines are made.|$|E
