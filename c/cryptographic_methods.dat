5000|$|Accordingly, {{regulations}} were introduced {{as part of}} munitions controls which required licenses to export <b>cryptographic</b> <b>methods</b> (and even their description); the regulations established that cryptography beyond a certain strength (defined by algorithm and length of key) would not be licensed for export except on a case-by-case basis. This policy was also adopted elsewhere for various reasons.|$|E

Therefore, applications are generally advised not to use NTLM." ...|$|E

5000|$|One-time pads are {{a popular}} <b>cryptographic</b> <b>method</b> to invoke in advertising, {{because it is}} well known that {{one-time}} pads, when implemented correctly, are genuinely unbreakable. The problem comes in implementing one-time pads, which is rarely done correctly.

50|$|Some of the {{geometric}} <b>cryptographic</b> <b>methods</b> {{are based on}} the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass. Given an arbitrary angle, there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle. But there is no ruler and compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one-third of a given angle. Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle {{can be thought of as}} a one-way function, the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>method</b> {{for a group}} of users to electronically share information in an anonymous, yet authenticated way. However, anonymous communications open the door for undetectable system abuse. This can be dealt with by using revocable anonymity features, but that may be unacceptable for competitive communicating parties since it could reveal their identity. We employ a multi-level communication structure that mitigates system abuse by allowing message revocation, yet retains true anonymity at the highest level. I...|$|R
