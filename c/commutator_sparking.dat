40|$|The {{commutation}} {{is one of}} lhe {{most important}} problam on d-c machines, and the <b>commutator</b> <b>sparking</b> is a principal phenomenon of bad commutation. Previously, we have developed a measuring apparatus using microcomputer for the arc energy of all commutator sparks. In the present work, with this measuring apparatusï¼Œit is experimented {{on the relationship between}} the arc energy of commutator spark and the Spark-Number of JEC- 54 by eye measurement. Results of the experimental work are as follows : (1) Arc energy is almost proportional to (S- 1) ^ 3 in the case of positive-brush, where S is the Spark-number. (2) The occurrence nunber of spark increases according to the Spark-Number. It cannot be disregarded on calculaion of the arc energy per one commutator revolution. (3) It seems possible to get the automatical judgement of the Spark-Number by comparing the magunitude ofarc energy...|$|E

The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a <b>commutator,</b> thus avoiding <b>sparking</b> and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|R
