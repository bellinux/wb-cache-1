He managed the family farm, which he {{expanded}} to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In 1892 he invented a milk-fat tester to <b>check</b> <b>milk</b> quality of the milk delivered and went to Stockholm to show his new invention for Gustaf de Laval. de Laval {{was impressed by the}} self-taught Dalén and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the Chalmers University of Technology where he earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate on leaving in 1896. Dalén was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing [...] "impossible" [...] ideas, but Dalén was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.|$|R

A similar disadvantageous dairy marketing {{has been described}} in northern {{parts of the country}} (Gómez-Ruiz et al. [2012]). There was a huge contrast between the farmers’ uneasy economic situation and the prosperous cajeta industry. Coronado is a subsidiary of Bimbo, worldwide the fourth largest food company and the largest bread manufacturer (Ochoa [2013]). Bimbo reported 20 % larger profits in 2005 than in 2004.a Farmers were paid about 13 % of the shelf price.b The caramel industry is the main winner here and as such it can be called a ‘food empire’ (Ploeg [2010]), which sets its rules such as milk price and the quality standards, e.g. <b>checking</b> watered <b>milk,</b> that are important for cajeta production.|$|R

50|$|There {{is usually}} a {{transition}} point to move the milk from the pipeline under vacuum to the bulk tank, which is at normal atmospheric pressure. This is done by having the milk flow into a receiver bowl or globe, which is a large hollow glass container with electronic liquid-detecting probes in the center. As the milk rises to a certain height in the bowl, a transfer pump is used to push it through a one-way check valve and into a pipe that transfers it to the bulk tank. When the level has dropped far enough in the bowl, the transfer pump turns off. Without the <b>check</b> valve, the <b>milk</b> in the bulk tank could be sucked back into the receiver bowl when the pump is not running.|$|R

Questionnaires followed by one reminder were sent to 3710 dairy farms via the 11 milk-processing plants that they supplied in October 1998. The response proportion was 14. 1 %. The median BMSCC was 289 x 10 (3) cells/ml (range: 74 x 10 (3) to 1800 x 10 (3) cells/ml). The median herd size was 70 cows (range: 7 - 616); herd size was not associated with BMSCC. The annual milk yield of 33. 2 % of the herds was 200 x 10 (3) cells/ml was more likely when foremilking was practised, and when cows were collected in a yard before milking. BMSCC was less likely to be > 200 x 10 (3) cells/ml when teats were washed with water containing disinfectant compared with plain water; when the udder and teats were always <b>checked</b> before <b>milking</b> compared with, sometimes or never; when cows with mastitis were milked first compared with any other ordering, and when farmers recorded individual-cow somatic-cell count (ICSCC) compared with when ICSCC was not recorded.

Subdermal tags with medical information are already being implanted in animals and people. However, a world in which practically everything is tagged and can be read at a modest distance by anyone who wants to buy an RFID reader introduces serious security and privacy issues. For example, women walking down the street may be effectively broadcasting the sizes of their RFID-tagged bras and medical data without realizing it. To protect people in this environment, we propose developing a compact, portable, electronic device called an RFID Guardian, which people can carry with them. In the future, it could be integrated into PDAs or cell phones. The RFID Guardian looks for, records, and displays all RFID tags and scans in the vicinity, manages RFID keys, authenticates nearby RFID readers, and blocks attempted accesses to the user’s RFID tags from unauthorized readers. In this way, people can find out what RFID activity is occuring around them and take corrective action if need be. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to evaluate effects on prolactin (PRL) concentration and mammary milk secretion of an injectable cabergoline formulation administered to five lactating Beagle bitches during early postpartum (PP). Bitches were bled twice daily (from PP day 3 to PP day 12) and then daily (from PP day 13 to PP day 16) to assay serum PRL. On PP day 6, a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 0. 1 ml/kg of placebo was administered. On PP day 9, a SC 0. 1 ml/kg dose of injectable cabergoline was administered. All bitches were <b>checked</b> for <b>milk</b> production, using a clinical scoring in order to quantify milk expression from each teat. A circadian variation of serum PRL was evident during the 6 days of pretreatment monitoring. The day after cabergoline injection, an 80 % decrease of PRL serum concentration was observed (p < 0. 05). The circadian oscillatory pattern of PRL secretion disappeared after administration of cabergoline, and PRL values remained significantly lower than in the previous days for the first 60 h following treatment (p < 0. 001). Milk production was drastically reduced when comparing pretreatment to post-treatment scores (p < 0. 001). A single dose of injectable cabergoline caused a significant reduction in serum PRL concentration and a significant reduction in milk flow. The injectable formulation of cabergoline appeared to be safe and well tolerated...|$|R

40|$|With the aim {{to study}} the plasma Se content during {{transition}} period, 2 groups of 12 dairy cows were monitored the month before and after calving. In stall 1 (S 1) cows were tied and individually fed, in stall 2 (S 2) cows were free and fed TMR. In both stalls cows were supplied with Se as Na-selenite. In S 1 3 mg/d of Se were fed mixed with corn silage while, in S 2, Se was offered with TMR, in dry period 2 mg/d were added with a mineral-vitamin supplement, in lactation 2. 6 mg/d (when DMI was 22. 2 kg/d) with the concentrate. Forages, the same for both stalls, and concentrates were sampled for chemical composition and Se determination. Cows were <b>checked</b> for <b>milk</b> yield and its content of somatic cells (SCC), health problems, and bled for Se determination in plasma. Average Se intake was higher in S 1, in both dry (4. 08 vs 2. 76 mg/d) and lactating (5. 80 vs 2. 11 mg/d) period. Besides the supplementation, differences depended on high Se intake in S 1 with the concentrate (increased after calving to 11. 5 kg/DM on d 30 and containing 0. 24 mg/kg DM of Se). According to the intake, plasma Se content resulted higher in S 1 in dry (1. 20 vs 0. 74 μmol/L) and lactating (1. 47 vs 0. 62 μmol/L) cows. In close-up plasma Se decreased in both groups, in first days of lactation increased in S 1, while decreased in S 2 to level indicating a deficient intake (0. 50 μmol/L). These results confirm the link between Se intake and its plasma level. Finally, Se plasma content did not seem related to cow health status during transition period...|$|R

Although they are informed they {{will soon be}} released, Dante blames Randal for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness {{to start a new}} life without Randal, while Randal condemns Dante for his willingness to live his life under the standards of others and for walking out of their friendship. Amid the argument, Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it, although Dante says that neither have the money to purchase the store. Jay and Silent Bob offer to lend them some money (from the royalties they collected following the events of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) on the condition that they can hangout outside of the Quick Stop anytime they want without calling the police.

40|$|Automated {{monitoring}} {{might be}} an alternative for periodic <b>checking</b> of electronic <b>milk</b> meters. A computer model based on Dynamic Linear Modelling (DLM) has been developed for this purpose. Two situations are distinguished: more milking stands in the milking parlour and only one milking stand in the milking parlour, e. g. in case of robotic milking. In the first case the model {{is based on a}} comparison per milking session of the average per stand with the overall average over all stands. The model calculates a stand deviation factor per stand after each milking session. In the second case the model is based on a comparison of the measured milk with the total collected milk. The model calculates a separation term and a deviation factor after each collection to the milk. The measured milk yields of two experimental farms, one with and one without a milking robot, were used to test the model. It was possible to fit the stand deviation factor with the model for the comparison of milking stands. This factor can be interpreted as the relative error per milking stand and per milking session. The results correspond globally with routine control results. The results of the model at the milking robot farm for the comparison of measured and collected milk were hampered by unknown separations. The conclusions of this research are: Automated monitoring of milk meters by a comparison of the average per stand with the overall average is possible. Validation on more farms is wanted. The measured milk yield should be corrected by the stand deviation factor if it is used for management purposes. Automated monitoring of milk meters on milk robot farms by a comparison of the measured milk with the collected milk seems possible, provided that separated milk is recorded properly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} fresh-cow handling practices and techniques used during fresh cow evaluations to identify postpartum health disorders on 45 dairy farms in California ranging from 450 to 9, 500 cows. Fresh cow practices were surveyed regarding (a) grouping and housing, (b) scheduling and work organization, (c) screening for health disorders, and (d) physical examination methods. Information was collected based on cow-side observations and responses from fresh cow evaluators. Cows were housed in the fresh cow pen for 3 to 14 (20 %), 15 to 30 (49 %), or > 31 (31 %) d in milk. Fresh cow evaluations were performed daily (78 %), 6 times a week (11 %), 2 to 5 times a week (9 %), or were not routinely performed (2 %). There was significant correlation between the duration of fresh cow evaluations and the number of cows housed in the fresh pen. Across all farms, the duration of evaluations ranged from 5 to 240 min, with an average of 16 s spent per cow. During fresh cow checks, evaluators always looked for abnormal vaginal discharge, retained fetal membranes, and down cows. Dairies evaluated appetite based on rumen fill (11 %), reduction of feed in the feed bunk (20 %), rumination sensors (2 %), or a combination of these (29 %). Milk yield was evaluated based on udder fill at fresh cow <b>checks</b> (40 %), <b>milk</b> flow during milking (11 %), milk yield records collected by milk meters (2 %), or a combination of udder fill and milk meters (5 %). Depressed attitude was evaluated on 64 % of the dairies. Health-monitoring exams for early detection of metritis were implemented on 42 % of the dairies based on rectal examination (13 %), rectal temperature (22 %), or both (7 %). Dairies implementing health-monitoring exams took longer to perform fresh cow evaluations. Physical examination methods such as rectal examination, auscultation, rectal temperature evaluation, and cow-side ketosis tests were used on 76, 67, 38, and 9 % of dairies, respectively. Across dairies, we found large variation in signs of health disorders screened and how those signs were evaluated. Fresh cows were primarily evaluated based on nonspecific and subjective observations during screening. Future research efforts should focus on developing and validating scoring systems to more objectively identify health disorders in postpartum cows...|$|R
