5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he is now}} on {{a closer}} social {{standing}} to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts {{him for a few}} minutes on a spit; grabs him by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he [...] "walked over a very sharp <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> in an extremely heavy hat"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he does seem to have a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{is divided into}} eight townships: Knock Carloway, Park Carloway, Doune Carloway, Upper Carloway, Garenin, Borrowston, Kirivick and Dalmore. The Estate starts at the <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> between Garynahine and Callanish and ends at the Bragar <b>cattle</b> <b>grid,</b> just leaving Shawbost towards Bragar.|$|E
50|$|The Common covers 35 acre {{protected}} by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids,</b> {{and is the}} largest such enclosed common in England.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> {{are usually}} {{installed}} on roads where they cross a fenceline, often at a boundary {{between public and}} private lands. They are an alternative to the erection of gates that would need to be opened and closed when a vehicle passed, and are common where roads cross open moorland, rangeland or common land maintained by grazing, but where segregation of fields is impractical. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> are also used when otherwise unfenced railways cross a fenceline. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> are seen throughout the world and are quite common in places such as Australia, the Scottish Highlands, or the National Parks of England and Wales. They are also common throughout the Western United States and Canada. In the United States, they are often used on BLM and Forest Service land, but are also used on paved roads and exit ramps of the Interstate Highway System in rural areas.|$|R

50|$|Departing Bentley {{from the}} Bordon bay {{platform}} (created by extending the down platform then {{separated from the}} main line platform by iron railings), services would proceed on the main down line {{in the direction of}} Alton for 17 chains before reaching the junction for Bordon at which stood the Bentley signal box. The line to Bordon branched off to the south here, climbing up towards Kingsley of 1 in 156. After 1 mile 10 chains it reached Blacknest Road level crossing, an ungated crossing which was protected by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b> The line then gradually dropped towards Kingsley Halt (2 miles 57 chains from Bentley), proceeding again over Blacknest Road level crossing, another ungated crossing with <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Worcestershire County Council {{was awarded}} £770,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund for {{restoration}} work {{and preservation of}} the area by fitting <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> to roads across the Hills and encouraging local landowners to allow sheep to wander across their land. As part of the Malvern Heritage Project nine water features within the AONB were also renovated.|$|R
50|$|As a common, {{historically}} it was grazed by livestock {{owned by}} local people; {{as with other}} heathlands it was this grazing which created and maintained the open habitat. Grazing ceased in the mid-20th century, leading to long-term deterioration in the structure and composition of the habitat. Plans {{are under way to}} install <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> on the minor roads crossing the heath, and then to begin grazing again.|$|R

50|$|The {{only other}} {{entrance}} is off Anzac Avenue {{and is more}} subdued, with one large double gate flanked by thick timber posts and also possessing a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid.</b> The gates are of the same style and construction as those found at the South Street entrance.|$|E
50|$|One major road, the A478, {{crosses the}} eastern end of the range, {{reaching}} a height of 248 m. Two B-class roads, intersecting at New Inn, cross the hills: the B4313 NW-SE, reaching 278 m and the B4329 NE-SW, reaching 404 m. These, {{and a number of other}} minor roads and lanes, provide scenic routes popular with motoring, cycling and walking tourists. Some grazing areas are protected by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> {{are used}} on roads and tracks to prevent grazing animals from leaving an open space without fencing onto a more {{controlled}} area where {{access to the}} road from surrounded land is more limited. They are widely used in the UK at the entrances to common and moorland areas where animals are free to roam, but also on private drive entrances. Typically, they consist {{of a series of}} metal bars across the road that are spaced so that an animal’s legs would fall through the gaps if it attempted to cross. Below the grid is a shallow pit that is intended to further deter livestock from using that particular crossing point. The sound produced as vehicles cross these devices is a characteristic low frequency “brrrr” where the dominant frequencies relates to the bar passage frequency under the tyres. The sound can be disturbing to riders and their horses and walkers and residents living close by as evidenced by press reports and the need to consider noise aspects in planning for new installations. For this reason and {{due to the lack of}} available information on the size and nature of the problem measurements and recordings have been made at a number of sites in Yorkshire in the UK. In addition, questionnaire surveys of residents living close by and façade measurements have also been used to gauge impact. Results show that there is a wide variation in the maximum noise level produced by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> of apparently similar design. This can be related to impact noise produced by the movement of all or part of the grid as the frame comes under impulsive loading as the vehicle crosses. It was further established that some residents living close to the <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> were disturbed by the noise, and in some cases vibration, and wanted them removed or suitably modified...|$|R

5000|$|After the summit, {{the road}} drops steeply by Bwlch Gwynt to another <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> and the {{intersection}} with the B4313 at Greenway, {{also known as}} New Inn, which in the 19th century sustained northbound travellers before [...] "the arduous task of winding up the painful ascent of Bwlch Gwynt".|$|E
50|$|A further {{system is}} to use a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> style system. All {{pedestrian}} exits have specially designed flooring tiles which, along with specially designed wheels on the cart, will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them. Like the magnetic systems, this can easily be overcome by lifting the cart over the tiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} {{surrounded}} by the open heathland of the New Forest, containing a complex of woodland, heathland and acid grassland, shrub and valley bog, supporting a richness and diversity of wildlife.Burley Fire Station {{is thought to be}} the only fire station in the country with a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> at the entrance.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{access is}} via gates on South Street, opposite Hampton Street. The gates are set into an ornamental wall, constructed of brick with cement rendered ledges along the tops and decorative end posts. The metal gates {{are made of}} thin strips bolted {{together to make a}} pattern inside an outer frame. Two large gates in the middle are for vehicular access and have <b>cattle</b> <b>grids,</b> and the two smaller gates on either side are for use by pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|From 1999 to July 2001 South Gloucestershire Council {{built a new}} {{section of}} the A4174 Avon ring road along part of the path. While the work was being {{undertaken}} the path was diverted away from the old railway line and a new section was added around the ring road, increasing the length by 200 yards. The new section includes two bridges, several tight corners, a hill (South Gloucestershire Council describes it as a 'barely perceptible gradient'), and two <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Herds {{of cattle}} and {{domestic}} sheep {{can be seen}} apparently roaming free on the moor. All are owned by farmers and let out to graze. Each is branded - the sheep with a coloured patch on its coat, unique to its owner. The livestock will naturally remain within the territory {{in which they are}} released, although walls and <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> (a pit in the road covered with metal bars - impassable to hoofed animals) provide an additional level of control.|$|R
50|$|Box lies at {{the edge}} of Minchinhampton Common, {{designated}} as a SSSI. The common is well known for its cows, which often cause traffic delays as there are no fences on the common. Since there is no <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> {{at the entrance to the}} village, cattle are also often found wandering through its streets.|$|E
50|$|The {{gradient}} increases {{until the}} road passes {{the site of}} Tafarn-y-Bwlch (approximate English: Tavern at the Pass), an inn which existed at least as early as 1729. The road crosses a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> marking a boundary between enclosed agricultural land and unenclosed moorland and continues to climb to 404 m between Carn Lladron and Mynydd-du Commin.|$|E
50|$|The A4117 {{runs through}} the village {{and there is a}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> {{stretching}} over this major thoroughfare due to the road running across common land. The road reaches an elevation of 381 metres as it passes Titterstone Clee Hill just to the east of the village, and is often affected by snow in winter. The B4214 road to Tenbury Wells starts at a junction with the A4117 in the village.|$|E
50|$|The Rother Valley Railway {{opened a}} small {{platform}} at Junction Road in 1900 as an informal private stopping {{place for the}} benefit of the tenant of the adjoining fields who enjoyed shooting rights over the land. The station was situated on the eastern side of a level crossing adjacent to Udiam Farm on the turnpike road from Hawkhurst to Hastings called Junction Road (now part of the B2244 road). The crossing was originally gated but <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> were later provided. The existence of the platform was discovered by the Board of Trade in January 1903 during an inspection of the line by Major Pringle who had stopped at the site to examine the new <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b> After the inspection, Colonel Stephens, the proprietor of the Rother Valley Railway, wrote to the Board of Trade to obtain permission to open the halt to the public. The station would be unstaffed and trains would only call as required. The Board of Trade indicated its willingness to authorise the halt so long as the railway provided suitable lights for trains calling in the hours of darkness. Despite Stephens' reply that guards would be instructed to aid passengers with a hand lamp, the Board of Trade still insisted on lights.|$|R
50|$|The New Forest Act 1949 reconstituted the Court of Swainmote. A {{register}} of voters was {{kept by the}} Verderers and a secret ballot imposed to elect 5 Verderers who join 4 who were nominated - now by the Forestry Commission, DEFRA), Hampshire County Council and the Countryside Agency - together with an appointed Official Verderer. The Court's powers were strengthened, and fencing of roads began and <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> introduced. The Verderers could also grant the Forestry Commission new inclosures for timber production. Agisters carry out the day-to-day work with the animals {{on behalf of the}} court.|$|R
5000|$|Cattle guards, {{the name}} used {{most often in}} United States, are known by {{a wide variety of}} other names {{in various parts of the}} world. In England and South Africa, they are <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b> Mato burro is the {{preferred}} name in Brazil and Venezuela, while guarda ganado is what they are called in Argentina. Alternatives in the United States include car crossing, auto gate, corduroy gate, stock gap, cattle pass, run-over, and many others. Canadians use pit gate, vehicle pass, and Texas gate, as well as cattle guard, which in Canada refers mainly to guards at railway lines.|$|R
