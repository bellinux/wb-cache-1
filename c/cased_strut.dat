40|$|The {{performance}} of the Pratt & Whitney Advanced Ducted Propulsion (ADP) UHB concept has been recently evaluated with studies of a 17 in. diameter fan simulator. Following the model scale tests, a 118 in. diameter demonstrator was tested at the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The 18 blade fan was driven by the low compressor shaft of a PW 2037 core through a reduction gear system fabricated by Fiat with approximately 1 : 3. 7 reduction ratio. ne variable pitch fan was hydraulically actuated with settings for take-off, cruise, feather, and reverse thrust. The low-pressure turbine was built by MTU to provide higher shaft power {{in comparison with the}} standard PW 2037. The demonstrator was provided with 45 vanes located 2. 6 fan chords downstream of the rotor, and 10 <b>case</b> <b>struts</b> approximately 1 fan chord downstream of the vanes. The inlet, mid-duct, and exhaust linings were acoustically treated. Acoustic surveys were taken in the for-ward thrust mode for fan speeds of 898, 1120, 1205, and 1302 R. P. M., and at tunnel speeds of 25, 50, 100, and 140 kts. The lowest speed was achieved with the wind tunnel fans at flat pitch, but with the engine pumping the test section Microphone signals were recorded for 30 seconds at 5 deg. increments. These measurements will be used to assess the effects of forward speed on UHB engines, to compare these effects with the corresponding characteristics of conventional bypass ratio engines, and to discuss the various aspects of testing large engines in the wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|Metallic lattice {{structures}} intentionally contain open porosity; however, {{they can also}} contain unwanted closed porosity within the structural members. The entrained porosity and defects within three different geometries of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V lattices, fabricated by Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM), is assessed from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. The results suggest that horizontal struts that are built upon loose powder show particularly high (~ 20 × 10 − 3 vol %) levels of pores, as do nodes at which many (in our <b>case</b> 24) <b>struts</b> meet.

We describe our experiences of strut failure in the Zenith abdominal aneurysm endograft device. Design/materials/methodsEighty-four patients have undergone endovascular repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at Christchurch Hospital from 1996 to 2005, all with the Zenith endoprosthesis. All available plain radiographs of the endoprosthesis (AP and lateral planes) were reviewed retrospectively, by a single experience observer, to assess <b>strut</b> failure. ResultsThree <b>cases</b> of <b>strut</b> failure in second-generation grafts were identified, each in the inferior body of the graft above the iliac bifurcation. There was no clear evidence that these strut failures were associated with clinical complications. ConclusionThis {{is the first time that}} strut failure in the Zenith abdominal endoprosthesis has been reported. Whilst in each of our three cases this does not appear to have been of clinical significance, these findings re-iterate the necessity of life-long surveillance of this technology...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the second of}} two studies under the same title. In this part five theoretical struts are developed from distributed sources and sinks and constructed for pressure and resistance tests in a wind tunnel. The surface pressures for symmetrical inviscid flow are computed for each strut from theory and compared with those found by experiment. The theoretical and experimental pressures are found to agree quantitatively near the bow, only qualitatively over the suction range, the experimental suctions being uniformly a little low, {{and not at all}} near the stern. This study is the strut sequel to Fuhrmann's research on airship forms, the one being a study in two dimensions, the other in three. A comparison of results indicates that the agreement between theory and experiment is somewhat better for bodies of revolution than for cylinders when both are shaped for slight resistance. The consistent deficiency of the experimental suctions which is found in the <b>case</b> of <b>struts</b> was not found in the case of airships, for which the experimental suctions were sometimes above sometimes below their theoretical values...|$|R
40|$|The chief {{concern was}} {{to measure the}} {{variations}} of resistance {{brought about by the}} nature of the surface of the struts. The struts were spanned with aviation linen, and then covered with one coat of varnish. The top surface was not perfectly smooth after this treatment, being slightly rough owing to the threads and raised fibers of the fabric. The results of the measurements of the surfaces are shown by the dotted lines of the curves plotted in several figures. The resistance is given in terms of the characteristic value. Next, the surface was altered by the removal of any roughness on it by means of filing with sandpaper. The measurements of surfaces thus treated gave values represented by extended lines. The increase of resistance with increasing characteristic value, more or less marked in the first series of measurements, was no longer observable. Resistance always decreases with the increase of characteristic value, excepting in the <b>case</b> of <b>strut</b> 7, which shows a slight tendency to rise again.

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Jason Cantarella) A discrete tensegrity framework {{can be thought of}} as a graph in Euclidean n-space where each edge is of one of three types: an edge with a fixed length (bar) or an edge with an upper (cable) or lower (strut) bound on its length. Roth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper “Tensegrity Frameworks”, showed that in certain <b>cases,</b> the <b>struts</b> and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing the framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity bar equivalent. In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of positive weights, called a positive stress, on the edges such that the weighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity is bar equivalent. In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in which the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean n-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These are called continuous tensegrities. We show that if a continuous tensegrity has a strictly positive stress, i...|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this <b>case,</b> the <b>struts</b> are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|R

40|$|SummaryMulti-strut {{injection}} is {{an approach}} to increase the overall performance of Scramjet while {{reducing the risk of}} thermal choking in a supersonic combustor. Hence computational simulation of Scramjet combustor at Mach 2. 5 through multiple central lobed struts (three struts) have been presented and discussed in the present research article. The geometry and model used here is slight modification of the DLR (German Aerospace Center) scramjet model. Present results show that the presence of three struts injector improves the performance of scramjet combustor as compared to single strut injector. The combustion efficiency is also found to be highest in <b>case</b> of three <b>strut</b> fuel injection system.

40|$|AbstractBrittle {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} a perfect open-cell Kelvin foam is considered. The foam is modeled as a spatial lattice consisting of brittle elastic struts rigidly connected to {{each other at the}} nodal points. The fracture toughness is determined from the analysis of a quasi-plane problem for a slice of the foam with an embedded finite length crack generated by broken struts. The crack plane is chosen {{on the basis of a}} previous study of crack nucleation phenomenon, and the crack length, which assures the self-similar K-field in the tip vicinity, is established by numerical experiments. For the considered densities range the crack includes several hundreds of broken struts and, consequently, the portion of the foam to be considered in the analysis has a very large number of nodal degrees of freedom. The computational cost is reduced significantly by using for the analysis the representative cell method based on the discrete Fourier transform. As a result, the initial problem for the foam slice is reduced to the problem for the repetitive cell which includes 12 struts. The dependence of the Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness of the considered bending dominated foam upon its relative density is determined and found to be different from known results for the stretch dominated cubic cell lattice. On the other hand, the results obtained for Mode I meet the experimental data and theoretical predictions for random foams. For the <b>case</b> of <b>struts</b> with hollow cross-section the analysis predicts linear dependence of the fracture toughness upon cross-section gyration radius...|$|R
40|$|From the {{experimental}} investigation detailed herein {{it has been}} determined, at least for two types of struts, {{that there is a}} very close correlation between (1) {{the experimental}}ly determined buckling load which a given strut will sustain and (2) the critical load determined by the use of Southwell’s method, which does not entail loading the strut to its critical load. By using an initial eccentricity and loads considerably less than the original, the critical load may be derived from the results of three or four simple test readings, not requiring an elaborate or refined setup. Experimental verification of existing theory of lateral buckling is noted for the <b>case</b> of <b>struts</b> tapered to a point at the application of the loading. The possibility of determining the eccentricity of a given loading by plots of β/p vs. β is pointed out and the type of curve to be expected as noted. However due to lack of refinement of the experimental setup, no definite conclusions are presented. The theoretical portion of this thesis offers the derivation of a formula for the lateral buckling of a thin linearly tapered strut of constant thickness. Due to the complexity of the problem certain simplifications were made to facilitate this derivation. Comparison of the values determined by use of this formula with the values experimentally determined for four struts shows a fairly close correlation. It is suggested that in some future work a more thorough investigation be made of the relation between the eccentricity of the loading and the load which a strut will carry, using a given deflection as a parameter. ...|$|R

Roth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper "Tensegrity Frameworks", showed that in certain <b>cases,</b> the <b>struts</b> and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing the framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity "bar equivalent". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of positive weights, called a positive "stress", on the edges such that the weighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity is bar equivalent. In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in which the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean n-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These are called "continuous tensegrities". We show that if a continuous tensegrity has a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a semipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show that if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but removing any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly positive stress. In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable curve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of it. Our methods provide an attractive proof of the following result: There is no locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal distance without decreasing some other one.

BackgroundThick polymer-based BVS have different mechanical properties than thin second-generation DES. Data on the acute performance of BVS are limited to simple coronary lesions treated in trials with strict inclusion criteria. MethodsFifty complex coronary lesions (all type American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association B 2 -C) treated with a BVS undergoing a final optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination were compared with an equal number of matched lesions treated with second-generation DES. The following stent performance indexes were assessed with OCT: mean and minimal area, residual area stenosis (RAS), incomplete strut apposition (ISA), tissue prolapse, eccentricity index, symmetry index, strut fracture, and edge dissection. ResultsOne hundred lesions from 73 patients were analyzed. A higher balloon diameter/reference vessel diameter ratio was used for predilation in the BVS group (p < 0. 01). Most of the BVS and DES were post-dilated with short noncompliant (NC) balloons of similar diameter. OCT showed in the BVS group a higher tissue prolapse area (p = 0. 08) and greater incidence of ISA at the proximal edge (p =  0. 04) with no difference in the overall ISA. The RAS was 20. 2 % in the BVS group and 21. 7 % in the DES group (p = 0. 32). There was no difference in the eccentricity index. The minimal and mean lumen areas were similar in the 2 groups. Two <b>cases</b> of <b>strut</b> fractures occurred after the BVS, whereas none was observed in the DES. ConclusionsBased on OCT, the BVS showed similar post-procedure area stenosis, minimal lumen area, and eccentricity index as second-generation DES. The different approach for lesion preparation and routine use of OCT guidance during BVS expansion may have contributed to these results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} case of sternal steel strut {{dislodgement}} and migration in a patient undergoing Ravitch repair for pectus excavatum (PE) 37 years ago. Broken struts perforated the right ventricle and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and additionally migrated into the left upper lobar bronchus. Dislodged sternal struts represent rare complications after surgical repair of patients suffering from pectus excavatum. Reviewing the literature, only five cases of intrapericardial migration of dislodged sternal struts or wires have been reported so far. In our <b>case,</b> the first <b>strut</b> {{was removed from the}} airways through a left antero-lateral thoracotomy. Using cardiopulmonary bypass, a second strut was removed via ventriculotomy. These life-threatening sequelae underscore the importance of postoperative follow-up and early removal of osteosynthetic materials used in open PE repair. Accurate preoperative localization of migrated materials and availability of CPB support are crucial for successful surgical removal. Introduction The migration of dislodged sternal steel struts or wires into the pericardium and cardiac cavities is a rare but life-threatening complication of open pectus excavatum (PE) repair 1. Removal of these materials poses a challenge for cardiothoracic surgeons.

40|$|Objective Stapediovestibular luxations {{are rare}} lesions {{that are most}} {{commonly}} caused by direct, penetrating trauma to the external ear canal. In this type of ossicular dislocation, disruption of the annular ligament or footplate fracture {{may lead to a}} perilymphatic fistula (PLF) presenting with cochleovestibular symptoms including (progressive) sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular symptoms. The objective {{of this article is to}} define the optimal treatment of stapediovestibular luxations and review the literature on this topic. Patient We present a case of internal stapediovestibular dislocation and pneumolabyrinth after penetrating trauma with predominantly conductive hearing loss and incapacitating vertigo. Intervention Middle ear inspection with removal of the luxated incus, repositioning of the stapes with a "stapedial strut" and closure of the tympanic membrane. Main outcome measures Hearing outcome and vestibular symptoms of this patient are presented, and all comparable cases in the literature are reviewed. Results Complete resolution of the vestibular symptoms and stabilization of the bone conduction thresholds. Conclusion In patients with pneumolabyrinth after middle ear trauma with mild symptoms, we recommend initial conservative treatment with close monitoring of hearing. In patients with severe, persisting, or progressive vestibulocochlear symptoms, exploratory tympanotomy should be performed to check for and treat PLF. Oval window fistula repair is reported to have variable hearing outcomes but offers complete resolution of vestibular symptoms in most <b>cases.</b> The stapedial <b>strut</b> is one of the possible surgical techniques in case of an internally luxated stape...|$|R
