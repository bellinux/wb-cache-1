40|$|Identification of {{competencies}} to be mastered {{during training}} and maintained through lifelong learning has recently received considerable attention. This study investigated a single, commonly identified core assess-ment skill competency, adherence to standardized administration procedures, {{to establish a}} current appreci-ation of <b>baseline</b> <b>competency</b> in the profession. Standardization adherence among 150 professionals averaged 70 % and was not significantly related to level of education or the time elapsed since degree attainment. Contrary to expectations, adherence was significantly higher for less frequently administered tests than for those more commonly administered. Accessibility to procedural instructions (e. g., embedded within stimuli) was unrelated to levels of adherence...|$|R

However, we have not found documentation of their required knowledge, skills, and characteristics, or the existence of any formal core competencies for this role. Methods We describe {{the development of a}} minimum set of core competencies for scientific editors of biomedical journals. Results The 14 key core competencies are divided into three major areas, and each competency has a list of associated elements or descriptions of more specific knowledge, skills, and characteristics that contribute to its fulfillment.

40|$|Objective : To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} interactive Nutri-Advice kiosks on children's nutritional skills {{and their ability to}} apply it to food choices in a middle school cafeteria menu (food choice competencies). Design : Quasi-experimental design; pre/post-test. Setting : Freestanding interactive computer terminals (kiosks) were installed in three middle schools in Toulouse, France. Participants : A total of 580 children were enrolled into the study (mean age, 13 ± 1 years). Intervention : Each child's physiological profile was stored in a personal barcode card. During 1 school year, once a day, each child could access the kiosk with this card, trying to find the most balanced meal according to his or her profile and the food available on the cafeteria menu. Main Outcome Measures : Children's food choice competency changes and body mass index z-score were evaluated. Analysis : Significance of change in food choice <b>competencies</b> (postintervention vs <b>baseline)</b> was examined using paired t test. Results : Across the study, children chose significantly less cheese and pastry or desserts, and significantly more starchy food and dairy, and tended to choose fruits and vegetables more often. Body mass index z-score decreased significantly during the period. Conclusions and Implications : Personalized nutrition counseling through an interactive device has the potential to improve the food choice competencies of children...|$|R
40|$|Session: Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Behavioral Change: Oral Presentation: no. 0369 Objectives: To {{assess and}} compare {{preschool}} children’s performance in tooth brushing following a social-story-based dental health education (SSDHE) intervention {{compared to a}} conventional dental health education (CDHE) approach. Methods: Preschool children (332) with autism at special child care centre in Hong Kong were assigned to a test SSDHE intervention group (148 children) or a control CDHE intervention group (204 children) to learn the task of tooth brushing. Performance in tooth brushing was assessed using a standardized 13 -step pro forma. Number of tooth brushing steps and number of effective tooth brushing steps successfully completed were assessed and compared over time, and between groups in a 6 -month study. Results: The response rate to the study was 67 % (222 / 332). Over time, there were significant improvements in {{the overall number of}} tooth brushing steps completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and the control group (p< 0. 001). Likewise, there were significant improvements in number of effective tooth brushing steps completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and control group (p< 0. 001). Those in the test group completed a greater number of effective tooth brushing steps compared to the control group at 3 -months (p= 0. 009) and at 6 -months (p= 0. 003). Controlling for other factors in regression analyses, improvement in performance of tooth brushing at 6 -months was associated with baseline performance (OR 0. 46, 95 %CI 0. 35, 0. 60, p< 0. 001), social skill deficits (OR 0. 19, 95 %CI 0. 16, 0. 55, p< 0. 01), reading deficits (OR 0. 21, 95 %CI 0. 05, 0. 95, p< 0. 05) and parental education level (OR 0. 45, 95 % 0. 24, 0. 83, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: There was evidence of improvement in tooth brushing performance among preschool children with autism following the use of a social-story-based education intervention compared to a conventional education approach. However, child developmental factors, level of <b>competency</b> at <b>baseline</b> and parental education factors were key determinants of improvement in tooth brushing performance at 6 -months post intervention...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{competence}} among {{child welfare}} practitioners is imperative given rapidly changing Canadian demographics, current inadequacy {{in the delivery}} of social services due to ethnocentric bias, and the insufficiency of educational programs in providing multicultural training for future practitioners. This study investigated {{the extent to which a}} specific training program influences multicultural competencies. In Ontario, child welfare employees (N = 61) completed the Multicultural Awareness Knowledge and Skills Survey (MAKSS) (D 2 ̆ 7 Andrea, Daniels, 2 ̆ 6 Heck, 1991) on two separate occasions. A 2 (pre, post) x 2 (experimental, comparison) mixed-model design was used to test the hypothesis that experimental participants would score significantly higher than comparison participants at post-test on measures of multicultural competence. Significant group by time interactions were detected for the Awareness measure, F (1, 49) = 12. 07, p 3 ̆c. 001, and the Knowledge measure, F (1, 45) = 14. 62, p 3 ̆c. 001, of the MAKSS, supporting the hypothesis; the Skills model was non-significant. A second research question explored participant responses to the training experience through open-ended focus groups (N = 13). Overall, participants are satisfied, despite the perception that only 1 of 3 learning objectives were met. In general, reactions to training are positive, although participants expected a traditional curriculum. A linear regression analysis tested a third research question, exploring whether participant demographics predict cultural <b>competency</b> scores at <b>baseline.</b> Age and level of education significantly predicted 25...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{on child}} abuse {{supports}} the conception that physical abuse is a multidetermined behavior. Multifaceted treatment programs have shown some promise {{in dealing with}} the heterogeneity of abusive parents. Most of the reported comprehensive intervention programs have provided predetermined doses of a variety of treatment components to each subject. The intent of this study was two-fold: (a) to provide treatment components based on assessment of the parent and (b) to train the parent to a specified level of <b>competency.</b> A multiple <b>baseline</b> design was used in this clinical study of six agency-referred, physically abusive parents. Based on initial assessment and ongoing observation, subject parents were provided with one or two of four available parent-training components (child behavior management, cognitive modification, relaxation, and systematic desensitization). Treatment effects on 16 dependent variables were measured by self-report, coded audiotape, coded observation, physiological measures, and reports of abuse to public agencies. Results indicated improvement by all the subjects on most of the dependent variables (i. e., 77 of 90 comparisons). However, only three of the six subjects met all of the predetermined criteria for termination of all intervention. Subjects met 15 of 22 training competency criteria. Reductions in abuse indicators were maintained on most of the dependent measures during 30 - and 90 -day follow-up probes. Only one subject was re-reported for child abuse during the year following treatment. The low attrition rate was seen as a function of assessment...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the patterns of antecedents of catastrophic reactions (CRs) in nursing home residents with dementia in the United States. MethodsA total of 229 catastrophic reaction events were the sample for this study. Ten antecedent variables were selected and analyzed using cluster analysis to address the patterns of antecedents of CRs in dementia. Data were obtained from field observation and a structured recording form over a 6 -week period covering all 7 days of the week and all three shifts (i. e., 21 shifts in total) in two nursing homes in the United States. ResultsThis study showed that there were two distinct patterns of antecedent conditions at the time of, or immediately prior to, CRs in dementia: (a) a cluster of antecedents that consists of components of the physical environment including public location, olfactory stimulation, use of media, sundowning hours, and being in a dementia unit (“Stimulation in Early Evening”); and (b) a cluster of antecedents that is composed of mixed components of the physical and social environment including olfactory stimulation, activities of daily living (ADL) -related care activities, demands of tasks, and being in a dementia unit (“Stress due to Care, Tasks, and Odors”). ConclusionThe findings suggest that elders who are exposed to overstimulation in sundowning hours or experience stress from care activities and task performance beyond their <b>baseline</b> <b>competency</b> are likely to be at risk of presenting with CRs. Health care providers need to be aware that a CR is a multi-factorial phenomenon in which multiple contextual antecedents are involved and that creation of a therapeutic physical and social milieu is an important nursing goal in preventing the occurrence of CRs in nursing home residents with dementia.

40|$|Systems {{engineering}} {{is vital for}} the acquisition of systems for the Department of the Navy (DON). As systems {{engineering is}} a relatively young discipline, no professional engineer occupational series exists under which systems engineers can be classified from a human resources perspective. In addition {{to the lack of}} an occupational designation, there is no official competency model to form the basis for employee selection and career development. In order for a competency model to be used for employee selection, it must be validated under the Uniform Guidelines for employee selection. Once validated, the model can be used to create systems engineering position descriptions and related career development plans that would be specifically used for systems engineers within the DON and perhaps for DOD. A <b>baseline</b> <b>competency</b> model {{is the first step in}} performing a validation process in accordance with the Uniform Guidelines. In order to begin to address this situation, a system engineering competency model was developed to provide a baseline. This model was designed specifically for the DON, though it should also be useable in any organization that employs system engineers. The core of the model is based on the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that a systems engineer needs to develop competency in across varying career levels. These KSAs are defined using Bloom’s Taxonomy to describe, the cognitive and affective aspects needed for achievement of the respective competencies. The research also identifies whether these KSAs are best attained through specific methods, such as undergraduate education, graduate education, professional training, or through on-the-job experience. Furthermore, the model can inform the development of graduate and undergraduate curricula in systems engineering, since using Bloom’s Taxonomy describes the KSAs in terms that lend themselves to direct use as curriculum related learning objectives. The outcome is called the Competency Model for the Profession of Systems Engineering (COMPOSE) model. The COMPOSE model can be used by the DON and several other organizations as a means to formulate career development plans for the professional development of systems engineers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} proposed framework of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) of a practitioner who is competent in business ethics, compliance, or integrity should possess. These competencies may be leveraged as key input to selecting content for an institutionalized business ethics (BE) training program. The research problem for this dissertation was: What competencies {{are important for}} job performance of business ethics practitioners in industry and how do their perceptions compare with those of academics? Triangulation of research methods and data sources—including industry (public service and private sector) and academics, were used to investigate this problem. Phase I consisted of developing a provisional taxonomy of business ethics competencies {{through the use of}} the secondary methodology to help design a survey questionnaire. Phase II involved a survey of academic and industry practitioners implicated in business ethics to empirically validate the conceptually developed provisional taxonomy of business ethics competencies and help identify potentially under or over-emphasized competencies to help make recommendations regarding the selection of business ethics training content by choosing relevant course materials based on competencies and key risks and issues. Several theoretical and pragmatic contributions to the business ethics training, competency-based management, and risk management bodies of knowledge are made that include: Institutionalized BE Program (IBEP) parent theory and body of knowledge A model for content selection for BE instruction is developed to help guide future selection and tailoring of training content based on <b>baseline</b> <b>competencies</b> and organizational context. Competency-Based Management (CBM) parent theory and body of knowledge A conceptually and empirically developed and content validated proposed business ethics competency model that may serve to guide future research in this neglected area is provided. Risk Management (RM) parent theory and body of knowledge Given the rapid pace of technological, social, economic, and other constant changes faced by organizations, future competency identification is made possible by the proposed enhancement of traditional environmental scanning methods to include new dimensions to the risk identification process through the creation of an extended environmental scanning model (STEEP LEDGES). Also, the traditional risk assessment framework is enhanced by adding prevalence, a third dimension to augment likelihood and impact that should help assess current and new risks and issues using the extended risk assessment model (LIP). ...|$|R
