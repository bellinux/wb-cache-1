Brain damaged patients {{were divided into}} three group, left <b>cortical</b> <b>damaged,</b> right <b>cortical</b> <b>damaged,</b> and global/based brain damaged group, respectively. The score of performance IQ in the global/based brain damaged group was the lowest of these groups. Meanwhile, the score of language IQ in left cortical group was the lowest of the these groups. Chronic schizophrenic patients were divided into three groups, 20 -, 30 -, 40 - age group, respectively. Each groups showed that the score of performance IQ is lower than one of language IQ. The lowed score of performance IQ in 20 - group may be qualitatively different form 40 - age group. The lowed score of the 40 - age group might be affected by organic brain damage. The factor analysis of WAIS-R were conducted from the data of brain damaged patients. Consequently, two factors were extracted. The first was "performance" factor including "block design", "object assembly", "picture arrangement", and "picture completion" and the second was "language" factor including "knowledge", "vocabulary", "similarity" and "comprehension". Also, The factor analysis of WAIS-R were conducted from the data of chronic schizophrenic patients. They were divided into "below 40 years old" and, "above 40 years old" group, respectively. Consequently, three factors were extracted from "below 40 years old " group and two factors were extracted from "above 40 years old" group. The result extracted two factors in "above 40 years old" group were {{similar to that of}} brain damage patients.

In all, 12 patients with cerebral contusion following TBI were recruited. All patients underwent IMZ SPECT within 1 week after TBI. To investigate the changes in distribution of IMZ in the cortex in the chronic phase, after conventional treatment, patients underwent IMZ SPECT again. A decrease in the accumulation of radioligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor in the cortex corresponding to the contusion revealed with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were shown on IMZ SPECT in the acute phase in all patients. In 9 of 12 patients (75 %), images of IMZ SPECT obtained in the chronic phase of TBI showed that areas with a decreased distribution of IMZ were remarkably reduced in comparison with those obtained in the acute phase. Both CT scans and MRI showed a normal appearance of the cortex morphologically, where the binding potential of IMZ recovered in the chronic phase.

L-Arginine (200 mg/kg) as a NO synthase (NOS) inducer and L-NAME (2 O mg/kg) were injected intraperitonealy (IP) and 7 - nitroindazde (25 mg/kg) as non-specific was injected subcutaneously (S. C.) for 4 weeks. The kind of stress was immobilization for 4 weeks, every other day. The brain was removed after this period and each brain divided into two parts in a coronal section manner. Anterior part used for histological studies with H&E staining and posterior part used for measurement of NO production using spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelengh.  Results: Statistical analysis of microscopic and light microscopic finding showed that thickness of prefrontal cortex and NO production were significantly decreased in stressed rats and especially in groups which received 7 - nitroindazole and L-NAME and L-arginine could reverse these results.  Discussion: According to this research, we could say that L-arginine decreases the <b>cortical</b> <b>damages</b> in stressed rats and 7 -nitroindazole and L-NAME increase this damage in non-stressed group.

40|$|Nowadays, no {{suitable}} {{animal model}} exists to assess long-term disabilities after cerebral ischemia. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare long-term behavioral and histological differences between two common mouse strains (129 S 2 /SvPasCrl and C 57 BL 6 H) after 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Sensorimotor assessments were conducted at one and at three weeks post-surgery using accelerated Rotarod and open-field locomotion. Long-term behavioral testing began four weeks after MCAo using operant conditioning in a progressive fixed-ratio (FR) schedule. Experiments ended with volumetric determination of the infarcted area using NeuN immunostaining. Although no effect of ischemia was detected in 129 S 2 mice using these tests, in C 57 mice, results showed obvious short-term motor and locomotor deficits. Furthermore, subtle but persistent disturbances of endurance and executive functioning were recorded by the progressive schedule tests but not highlighted by sensorimotor tests. Ischemic lesion extended to the dorsolateral part of the striatum in both strains and recurrent <b>cortical</b> <b>damages</b> were also observed in C 57 mice. All those results are in accordance with inherent morphological and behavioral features of each strain. Since the motor cortex is spared by 30 minutes MCAo, functional disabilities could be related to striatal damages. In conclusion, C 57 BL/ 6 H mouse strain, by offering an acceptable survival rate and enough sensitivity to MCAo, seems to be a mouse strain suitable to evaluate long-term deficits and possible functional recovery after cerebral ischemia.

40|$|AbstractPremature {{babies are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to brain injury. In this study we focus on <b>cortical</b> brain <b>damage</b> associated with long-term cognitive, behavioral, attentional or socialization deficits in children born preterm. Using a mouse model of preterm birth (PTB), we demonstrated that complement component C 5 a contributes to fetal cortical brain injury. Disruption of cortical dendritic and axonal cytoarchitecture was observed in PTB-mice. Fetuses deficient in C 5 aR (−/−) did not show <b>cortical</b> brain <b>damage.</b> Treatment with antibody anti-C 5, that prevents generation of C 5 a, also prevented cortical fetal brain injury in PTB-mice. C 5 a also showed a detrimental effect on fetal cortical neuron development and survival in vitro. Increased glutamate release was observed in cortical neurons in culture exposed to C 5 a. Blockade of C 5 aR prevented glutamate increase and restored neurons dendritic and axonal growth and survival. Similarly, increased glutamate levels – measured by 1 HMRS – were observed in vivo in PTB-fetuses compared to age-matched controls. The blockade of glutamate receptors prevented C 5 a-induced abnormal growth and increased cell death in isolated fetal cortical neurons. Simvastatin and pravastatin prevented cortical fetal brain developmental and metabolic abnormalities -in vivo and in vitro. Neuroprotective effects of statins were mediated by Akt/PKB signaling pathways. This study shows that complement activation {{plays a crucial role}} in cortical fetal brain injury in PTL and suggests that complement inhibitors and statins might be good therapeutic options to improve neonatal outcomes in preterm birth...|$|R

MDpyr levels increased significantly in both Sham-SP and CCI-SP rats (p[*]<[*] 0. 05 vs. CCI-Sal) and were higher in left/injured cortex of the CCI-SP group (p[*]<[*] 0. 05 vs. sham-SP). In CCI-SP rats the contralateral MDlac decreased below CCI-Sal levels (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and the ipsilateral MDglc levels exceeded those of CCI-Sal rats (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).

40|$|Neurogenesis, {{especially}} neurite outgrowth is {{an essential}} element of neuroplasticity after cerebral ischemic injury. Mitochondria may supply ATP to power fundamental developmental processes including neuroplasticity. Although rosuvastatin (RSV) displays a potential protective effect against cerebral ischemia, it remains unknown whether it modulates mitochondrial biogenesis and function during neurite outgrowth. Here, the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was used to induce ischemic injury. We demonstrate that RSV treatment significantly increases neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons after OGD-induced damage. Moreover, we show that RSV reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protects mitochondrial function, and elevates the ATP levels in cortical neurons injured by OGD. In addition, we found that, under these conditions, RSV treatment increases the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and the mRNA levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF- 1). Furthermore, blocking Notch 1, which is expressed in primary cortical neurons, reverses the RSV-dependent induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and function under OGD conditions.
