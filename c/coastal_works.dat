50|$|In the 2000 decade, partly {{boosted by}} the European Union Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, {{the number of}} coastal {{engineering}} works increased dramatically in the Portuguese coast, to develop harbours or to protect the coast. However, in general, the Environmental Impact Accessment of these coastal constructions ignored to study the respective impacts on surfing. S.O.S. started as a civic and informal surfer movement in 2002/2003 to preserve beaches and waves for surfing from these <b>coastal</b> <b>works</b> who ignored surfing. In 2008/2009, S.O.S. turned legal, as a non-profit surfer's Association {{in order to improve}} the protecting and developing of surfing. S.O.S. is further being upgraded to an Environmental Non-Governmental Organization, since the surf and beach damaging <b>coastal</b> <b>works</b> continue being constructed. S. O.

50|$|By 1872, the <b>coastal</b> <b>works</b> had progressed considerably, but the {{question}} of landward defences remained unsettled. Although the girdle of forts proposed by Colonel Jervois in 1866 would have considerably enhanced the defence of the harbour area, other factors had cropped up that rendered the scheme particularly difficult to implement, particularly the creation of suburbs. Another proposal, put forward by Col. Mann RE, was to take up a position well forward of the original.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, {{business}} interests were concerned to improve transport facilities for iron ore being mined {{in the area}} of Canonbie, in south Dumfriesshire close to the English border. Their intention was to bring the mineral to Annan Harbour (on the north shore of the Solway Firth), from where it could be forwarded by coastal shipping. They approached James Brunlees, a civil engineer with experience of <b>coastal</b> <b>works.</b> He advised against the scheme, which would have partly duplicated the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR) route, but he put them in touch with business people in Cumberland, who had engaged him to plan a railway from Cumberland iron deposits to a new harbour at Bowness, on the south shore of the Solway.|$|E
50|$|Such {{specialist}} {{work was}} part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300 ft high), monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400 ft high), complete power station structures, and <b>coastal</b> <b>works</b> such as tanker berths, docks and harbours.In the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings. Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey avant-garde development of apartment blocks named Highpoint, located in Highgate Village, north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the coastal {{batteries}} was to provide protected positions for heavy coastal artillery which {{would be able to}} engage enemy warships and troopships. In some places, for instance high on a cliff, the guns could be mounted in a barbette or open gun pit. However where the batteries were close to the shoreline and could be engaged directly by enemy gunfire, each heavy gun was mounted in a casemate, a vaulted chamber with embrasure for the gun to fire through which was pierced through an armoured shield. Since being mounted in an enclosed space limited the traverse of the gun, casemates were arranged in a long curved row so that the guns of the battery could follow the progress of a passing enemy ship, each weapon engaging it in turn. The rear of the battery was closed either by a simple wall pierced with loopholes, or by a more elaborate defensible building which doubled as a barracks for the garrison. The intention of these rearward defences was that they would be strong enough to prevent the battery being taken by enemy infantry but weak enough to be demolished should the battery fall into enemy hands. In two forts, Fort Darnet and Fort Hoo, the casemates formed a complete circle; other circular works were built as sea forts with foundations on the sea-bed and entirely surrounded by water. A number of the Royal Commission <b>coastal</b> <b>works</b> were upgrades of existing fortifications, such as the 16th century Pendennis Castle at Falmouth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{causes of}} beach erosion in Doi Duong-Phan Thiet is {{presented}} {{by considering the}} hydro-meteorological and geomorphological conditions in Binh Thuan province. The mild wind speeds from W/SW are predominant in V-X. The gusty wind speeds from E/NE are mainly in XI-IV. The tropical storms occur statistically in X-XII and tides are semi-diurnal. By Hsu and Evan model (1989), the shoreline in Phan Thiet bay, Ham Tien and fishing port breakwater are dynamical equilibrium. With imaginary structures, the shorelines in Ham Tien and fishing port can be stabilized. Using the spectral model and mild slope equation, the wave and current fields in Phan Thiet bay for two representative NE and SW direction seasons are presented. Without <b>coastal</b> <b>works,</b> no beach erosion is reported in Phan Thiet. However, with <b>coastal</b> <b>works,</b> the unbalance of coastal sediment budget causes beach erosion in Doi Duong-Phan Thiet. The beach nourishment in associated with geotextile is proposed for erosion controls in Doi Duong tourist resort...|$|E

40|$|In all {{the complex}} {{cultural}} {{history of the}} islands of Britain and Ireland {{the idea of the}} coast as a significant representative space is critical. For many important artists coastal space has figured as a site from which to braid ideas of empire, nation, region, and archipelago. They have been drawn to the coast as a zone of geographical uncertainty in which the self-definitions of the nation founder; they have been drawn to it as a peripheral space of vestigial wildness, of island retreats and experimental living; as a network of diverse localities richly endowed with distinctive forms of cultural heritage; and as a dynamically interconnected ecosystem, which {{is at the same time}} the historic site of significant developments in fieldwork and natural science. This collection situates these cultures of the Atlantic edge in a series of essays that create new contexts for coastal study in literary history and criticism. The contributors frame their research in response to emerging conversations in archipelagic criticism, the blue humanities, and island studies, the essays challenging the reader to reconsider ideas of margin, periphery and exchange. These twelve case studies establish the coast as a crucial location in the imaginative history of Britain, Ireland and the north Atlantic edge. <b>Coastal</b> <b>Works</b> will appeal to readers of literature and history with an interest in the sea, the environment, and the archipelago from the 18 th century to the present.

40|$|A {{barrier to}} {{longshore}} drift {{has the potential}} to cause downdrift erosion. Understanding this problem means that any new construction of a groyne field or breakwater should be accompanied by monitoring to record changes in beach volumes and profiles as well potential erosion of the coastline.
