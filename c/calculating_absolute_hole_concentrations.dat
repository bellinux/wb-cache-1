The effects of growth tenperature and thermal annealing on the crystal quality and strain were carefully investigated. The electrical properties such as <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> and mobility would be discussed. Design/methodology/approach: GaN-based III–V semiconductors have become promising materials for short-wavelength optoelectronic devices {{because of their}} large and direct band gap energies. In this paper, p-GaN has been grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 900 °C, 950 °C, 1000 °C, and 1050 °C with low temperature LT-deposited AlN/AlGaN buffer layer. Findings: The mobility was achieved at 150 cm 2 /Vs and the <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> was 8 x 1017 cm- 3. SIMS and XRD were used to measure and explain the relationships between <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> and the growth temperature. When the growth temperature was increased to 1000 °C, the <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> was increased by ten times. According to the experimental results, the optimal growth temperature was 1000 °C. After the thermal annealing process at temperature 850 °C for 2 minutes, the FWHM of p-GaN was lowered to 617 arcsec. The effects of growth temperature were explained in the two temperature regions. From 900 °C to 1000 °C, the incorporation rate of Mg was slightly increased and the strain decreased with the growth temperature. Mg would provide holes and the lower strain would result in better crystal quality. The crystal quality and Mg <b>concentration</b> effects on <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> below 1000 °C was thus beneficiary. On the other hand, when the growth temperature was further increased, the strain and FWHM increased while <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> decreased at 1050 °C.

Research limitations/implications: It was suggested that the <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> reduced at 1050 °C due to the Si diffusion and the strain caused by Mg dopant.

This anisotropy switching can also be realized by post-growth annealing, and the temperature-dependent ac susceptibility is significantly changed with increasing annealing time. On the basis of our recent scenario [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 147203 (2005); Phys. Rev. B 73, 155204 (2006). ], we deduce that the growth of highly hole-concentrated cluster regions with [110] uniaxial anisotropy is likely the predominant cause of the enhancement in [110] uniaxial anisotropy at the high <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> regime. We can clearly rule out anisotropic lattice strain as {{a possible}} origin of the switching of the magnetic anisotropy. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
