5|$|Sinoceratops was {{discovered}} in the Xingezhuang Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous. It lived alongside leptoceratopsids, saurolophines, and tyrannosaurines. The most common <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the formation was Shantungosaurus, to {{which most of the}} material has been assigned. The animals living alongside Sinoceratops and Shantungosaurus were Zhuchengceratops, Huaxiaosaurus, and Zhuchengtyrannus.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, who described the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent some significant developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the same vein as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided he wanted a big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E

5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> Muskrat Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of Muskrat Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E
5|$|As {{the police}} chase the rapidly {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end all life on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E

5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the model's place; while using a utility knife to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is {{attacked}} and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|Charging outside, Mulder is {{attacked}} by the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the hall. When he returns with the welts all over his throat, George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage, leaving Mulder {{to die in the}} hallway. Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby. However, water collects in the light fixture above them and the creature appears. It grabs George Vincent by the neck. Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers, realizing that the freshwater kept the creature at bay, as with the deputy until Epsom salt was added to the water. Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent's life. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also, and runs out into the rain to heal his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into the tub where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|On September 2, 2014, {{after weeks}} of leaking clues that a major {{announcement}} was forthcoming, Cedar Point released a statement that Mantis would close on October 19, 2014. According to the park, the roller coaster had given over 22 million rides since its debut. However, Cedar Point revealed on September 18, 2014, that Mantis wouldn't be removed, but instead would be converted into a floorless roller coaster complete with new trains, new colors, and a new theme. It reopened as Rougarou, {{the name of a}} legendary <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> French folklore that draws comparisons to the mythical werewolf, on May 9, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.|$|E
5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder calls Scully to come bail him out. Afterwards, Scully brings Mulder to {{meet with}} Dr. Diamond, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Maryland, before going on a date with Rob. The local park ranger contacts Mulder after finding the corpse of a wild man in the woods who he believes could be the Jersey Devil. Scully and Mulder bring the ranger and Dr. Diamond to the morgue, where the body has mysteriously vanished. Mulder believes that the Jersey Devil they are hunting is actually the creature's mate who has headed into Atlantic City in search of food after her mate's death. The agents, along with the ranger and Dr. Diamond, search for the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> an abandoned building. While they are searching the building, Detective Thompson arrives with a SWAT team.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully eagerly hunt for a deadly <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the Arizona desert. What they find seems to support Mulder’s revived belief in aliens, but is discredited when the agents are not reassigned to the now re-opened X-Files, with Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) taking over instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Boogeyman 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2006 {{due to the}} financial success of its predecessor with Jeff Betancourt, film editor of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, When a Stranger Calls and The Grudge 2, making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced by Ghost House Pictures, a film production company created by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the <b>creature</b> <b>in</b> the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. Storyboards were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital Linda Vista Community Hospital served as the primary filming location for the mental institution.|$|E
