40|$|Epichloë species (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) are {{the causal}} agents <b>of</b> <b>choke</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>grasses.</b> This disease is {{characterized}} by the presence of cylindrical fungal stromata which wrap the immature inflorescences and inhibit the normal development of reproductive tillers. Using phenotypic and molecular characters, as well as mating compatibility tests, the fungus causing choke disease in Brachypodium phoenicoides (Poaceae) was identified as Epichloë typhina. A three year field experiment conducted with infected and uninfected plants of a single clone of B. phoenicoides showed no significant differences in biomass production during their vegetative growth stage, but the content of Ca, Mg, and Mn was greater, and that of Na was lower in infected plants compared to uninfected plants. Infected plants produced up to twice as many reproductive tillers than healthy plants, but their reproductive tissue biomass was smaller than that of healthy plants, because tiller development was arrested by choke forming stromata.

40|$|Hemorrhagic disease <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> carp is {{the most}} serious {{infectious}} disease <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> carp and causes significant losses of fingerlings. The main clinical signs are external and internal hemorrhage. The disease is caused by aquareovirus and has several serotypes. The optimal epidemic temperature of this disease is 25 - 28 °C. The disease can be transmitted by water or par- asite bite. Susceptible hosts are grass and black carp. Other cyprinids are only carriers. Vaccination can control hemorrhagic disease <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> carp. An inactivated vaccine prepared from organs of sick fish is simple and easy to produce with good efficacy. In China, hemorrhagic disease <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> carp was prevalent but has been controlled by wide application of the vaccine. In other Southeast Asian countries, it is a new disease.

There is described the development and actual state <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> seeds production in terms of quantities, cultivated species and yields.
