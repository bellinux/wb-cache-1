2500|$|A {{major oil}} {{discovery}} in 1928 brought prosperity to the state, especially Lea County {{and the town}} of Hobbs. The town was named after James Hobbs, a homesteader there in 1907. The Midwest State No. 1 well, begun in late 1927 with a standard <b>cable-tool</b> <b>drilling</b> rig, revealed the first signs of oil from the Hobbs field on June 13, 1928. Drilled to 4,330 feet and completed a few months later, the well produced 700 barrels of oil per day on state land. The Midwest Refining Company's Hobbs well produced oil until 2002. The New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources called it [...] "the most important single discovery of oil in New Mexico's history".|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present a}} method for {{distillation}} of hard-frozen Martian permafrost. A <b>cable-tool</b> is <b>drilled</b> into hard frozem permafrost {{to a depth of}} 10 to 20 m. They calculate that a 10 m hole could be drilled in a few days. A 10 m shaft with a diameter equal to the bore is inserted into the hole, and a air tight tent-like structure is erected over the borehole. Photovoltaic cells mounted on the tent supply electrical energy that is dissipated in the shaft. Drilling power can be supplied by other sources. With 1000 watts, the shaft can be heated to near 350 K, producing relatively high temperatures {{in the vicinity of the}} borehole. Surrounding H 2 O is vaporized and diffuses up through the regolith. The authors calculate that a tent of a radius of no more than a few meters would intercept most of the H 2 O as it diffused to the surface. Calculations suggest that it would require perhaps 30 days to extract H 2 O from most of the volume drained by this technique. Assuming that the hard frozen regolith is no more than 10 percent ice, the author's calculate that that about 2890 kg of H 2 O could be extracted in 30 days. Since the nominal requirement for each crew member is about 5 kg/day, one such borehole might be expected to supply enough H 2 O to maintain a crew of 5 for perhaps 100 days. Additional engineering studies will be done to attempt to improve the capacity or efficiency of this method...|$|R

50|$|Drill {{cuttings}} {{are produced}} as the rock is {{broken by the}} drill bit advancing through the rock or soil; the cuttings are usually carried to the surface by drilling fluid circulating up from the drill bit. Drill cuttings can be separated from liquid drilling fluid by shale shakers, by centrifuges, or by cyclone separators, the latter also being effective for air drilling. In <b>cable-tool</b> <b>drilling,</b> the drill cuttings are periodically bailed out of {{the bottom of the}} hole. In auger drilling, cuttings are carried to the surface on the auger flights.|$|E

5000|$|Gushers were {{an icon of}} oil {{exploration}} during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During that era, the simple drilling techniques such as <b>cable-tool</b> <b>drilling</b> {{and the lack of}} blowout preventers meant that drillers could not control high-pressure reservoirs. When these high pressure zones were breached, the oil or natural gas would travel up the well at a high rate, forcing out the drill string and creating a gusher. A well which began as a gusher was said to have [...] "blown in": for instance, the Lakeview Gusher blew in in 1910. These uncapped wells could produce large amounts of oil, often shooting 200 feet (60 m) or higher into the air. A blowout primarily composed of natural gas was known as a gas gusher.|$|E
40|$|Northern Utah Valley {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing areas of Utah and has {{increasing}} needs for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water. To meet these needs, groundwater and surface water systems must be understood to maximize their use. Chemical studies of the sediment mineralogy and related water-chemistry give insight to the movement of the water. There are three major aquifers present in the valley: shallow Pleistocene; deep Pleistocene; and Tertiary. They are composed of sands and gravels and are separated by confining layers (aquitards) composed mostly of clay. Along the flanks of the bordering mountains there are undifferentiated aquifers which act as conduits supplying water for aquifers in the valley. Sediment samples from aquifers and confining layers were obtained by rotary and <b>cable-tool</b> <b>drilling.</b> X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the aquifers are mainly composed of quartz, calcite, and dolomite, whereas the con fining layers contain illite and montmorillonite with some kaolinite, quart z and calcite. One hundred nine water samples were collected in this study from s ur face water, spring water, undifferentiated aquifer water, shallow Pleistocene aquifer water, deep Pleistocene aquifer water and Tertiary aquifer water. Results show that the ground water system has several geochemical cells in each aquifer, due to diverse areas of recharge. Three major water types can be identified in different areas of the shallow Pleistocene aquifer, three in different areas of the Tertiary aquifer, and four in different areas of the deep Pleistocene aquifer. The differences in these water types are related to the composition of the mountain recharge areas and positions of faults within the valleys. The aquifer composition exerts relatively little influence on the chemistry of the ground water. Mountains of predominantly carbonate rocks produce recharge waters rich in calcium and bicarbonate. Mountains of predominantly granitic rocks produce recharge water low in mineral content. Valley sediments near major faults produce highly mineralized waters...|$|E
40|$|Artificially {{recharging}} the Las Vegas Valley (Valley) ground-water {{system with}} treated Colorado River water is one water resource management option {{employed by the}} Las Vegas Valley Water District (District) to help meet future long-term and short-term peak water demands. The District began operation of an artificial ground-water recharge program in 1988 in order to bank water for future use and to slow declining water levels. Artificial recharge occurs in the winter months, typically from October to May, when there is excess capacity in the Southern Nevada Water System (SNWS), currently a 400 Million Gallon per Day (MGD) treatment and transmission system. Treated Colorado River water is recharged into the principal aquifer through the District 2 ̆ 7 s existing distribution system, to a network of production wells or dual -use wells for both recharge and production. The water is then stored until recovered from the wells, during the high demand summer months. The water recovered is injected Colorado River water, however, this water is accounted against the District 2 ̆ 7 s groundwater rights. Credits in the artificial recharge account accrue until needed to cover pumpage in excess of permitted ground-water rights. Wells used in the program were drilled and constructed {{in a variety of}} ways, and have responded differently to artificial recharge operations. The majority of the wells now used for artificial recharge and production were completed prior to 1980, using the <b>cable-tool</b> <b>drilling</b> method, perforated in place and naturally developed. Other wells were installed using the reverse-circulation drilling method with filter packs. The District commenced drilling dedicated injection wells in 1993, to address operational concerns observed in some of the production wells. Several types of installation and drilling methods have been used to optimize injection. The types of drilling methods used for the injection wells include, reverse circulation, air-foam, cable tool and dual-rotary. In 1988, two dual-use wells where used for production and artificial recharge, injecting an annual total of 1, 153 acre feet of water. Since 1988 the artificial recharge program has expanded, using up to 40 wells with eight dedicated injection wells. Total water banked for future use, as of January 1, 1997 is 114, 126 acre feet of water. Static water levels in the principal aquifer have risen from 10 to 40 feet in the main area of artificial recharge. Water levels {{in other areas of the}} Valley also show increases, indicating that the rise is not isolated, but is occurring throughout the principal aquifer. The artificial recharge program is currently expanding to utilize 31 dual use and 19 injection wells, for a potential capacity of 62, 000 gallons per minute of injection or 45, 000 acre feet per year of recharge by the fall of 1999...|$|E
