50|$|A major {{drawback}} to this architecture {{is the fact}} that a missed two-tone sequence {{at the beginning of a}} transmission, or a lost signal during a transmission, causes the rest of a transmission to be missed. If the mobile receiver gets interference or loses the repeater signal for the moment the second selective <b>calling</b> <b>tone</b> is sent, it remains muted, missing the entire conversation. The same is true if the repeater signal is lost at any time during a transmission. Only another two-tone sequence being sent will allow it to rejoin the conversation.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes two {{efficient}} and distortionless schemes to {{significantly reduce the}} Peak to Average power Ratio (PAR) of DMT and OFDM signals. These methods are based on adding a symbol dependent, time domain signal to the original DMT/OFDM symbol to reduce its peaks. This time domain signal can be computed efficiently at the transmitter and can be easily stripped off the received signal. For the first method, <b>called</b> <b>Tone</b> Reservation (TR), the transmitter does not send data on a small subset of carriers, which are optimized for PAR reduction. This technique can achieve 3 dB or 6 dB of PAR reduction for a loss in data rate of less than : 2 % and 5 % respectively. The second scheme, <b>called</b> <b>Tone</b> Injection (TI), is based on replicating the subsymbol constellation with known translating vectors. In this expanded constellation several points represent the same information, and therefore we can choose those points that minimize the transmitter PAR. This method achieves more than 6 dB PAR reduc [...] ...|$|R

Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable.

50|$|Tones {{may affect}} each other just as consonants and vowels do.
