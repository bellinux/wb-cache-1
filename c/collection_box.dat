5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the <b>collection</b> <b>box</b> on his visits.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Canadian mailboxes, {{which were}} painted red, U.S. mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{originally}} painted in red or green. Beginning in 1909, all mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> were painted {{a dark green}} to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment. [...] Dark green gave way to olive drab green after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of olive drab green paint to the Post Office. Olive drab green subsequently became the standard color for all U.S. mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> in red and blue, with white lettering. In 1971 the Post Office (now USPS) changed mail <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or [...] "snorkel" [...] to drive-up curbside <b>collection</b> <b>boxes</b> was adopted.|$|R

5|$|The {{sporting}} event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising {{event for the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the sport and he then {{came up with the}} idea of a competition to aid the charity. He put out a box of sticks and a <b>collection</b> <b>box</b> and it soon became an annual event.|$|E
5|$|The {{ubiquitous}} lifeboat collection boxes seen nationwide {{are popular}} {{enough to have}} even become the target for thieves. A fixed, cast iron <b>collection</b> <b>box</b> in Porthgwarra, Cornwall, is Grade II listed.

5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the <b>collection</b> <b>box</b> when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
