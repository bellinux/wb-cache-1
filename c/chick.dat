5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a <b>chick</b> fledges or not. After a <b>chick</b> fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the <b>chick</b> will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of their hatching, <b>chicks</b> range in {{development}} from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless <b>chicks</b> are termed altricial, and tend to be born small, blind, immobile and naked; <b>chicks</b> that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial. Altricial <b>chicks</b> need help thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial <b>chicks.</b> <b>Chicks</b> at neither of these extremes can be semi-precocial or semi-altricial.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. West Nile virus (WNV) causes {{significant}} {{mortality of}} American White Pelican <b>chicks</b> at northern plains colonies. We tested oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs from moribund <b>chicks</b> for shed WNV. Such shedding could enable chick-to-chick transmission and {{help explain why}} WNV spreads rapidly in colonies. WNV was detected on swabs from 11 % of <b>chicks</b> in 2006 and 52 % of <b>chicks</b> in 2007; however, viral titers were low. Before onset of WNV mortality, we tested blood from < 3 -week-old <b>chicks</b> for antibodies to WNV; 5 % of <b>chicks</b> were seropositive, suggesting passive transfer of maternal antibodies. Among near-fledged <b>chicks,</b> 41 % tested positive for anti-WNV antibodies, indicating that they survived infection. Among years and colonies, cumulative incidence of WNV in <b>chicks</b> varied from 28 % to 81 %, whereas the proportion of <b>chicks</b> surviving WNV (i. e., seropositive) was 64 – 75 %. Our data revealed that WNV kills <b>chicks</b> that likely would fledge {{in the absence of}} WNV, that infection of <b>chicks</b> is pervasive, and that significant numbers of <b>chicks</b> survive infection...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} six days after the <b>chicks</b> hatch, the adults and <b>chicks</b> stay in the nesting sites. At around seven to twelve days old, the <b>chicks</b> begin {{to move out of}} their nests and explore their surroundings. When they are two weeks old, the <b>chicks</b> congregate in groups, called [...] "microcrèches", and their parents leave them alone. After a while, the microcrèches merge into [...] "crèches" [...] {{containing}} thousands of <b>chicks.</b> <b>Chicks</b> that do not stay in their crèches are vulnerable to predators.|$|R
5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of <b>chick</b> deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their <b>chick</b> from attack, although it may be more passive if the <b>chick</b> is sickly.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} the <b>chick</b> is brooded by {{a parent}} {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the <b>chick.</b> In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the <b>chick</b> with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. <b>Chick</b> development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the <b>chick</b> has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake <b>chick</b> survival is limited: although <b>chick</b> growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{low ambient}} temperatures influence foraging behavior of precocial Japanese quail <b>chicks</b> and alter {{the balance between}} investment in growth and thermogenic function. To test this, one group of <b>chicks</b> was exposed to 7 °C and one group to 24 °C during foraging throughout the developmental stage. <b>Chicks</b> adapted well to the temperatures through a high flexibility in behavior and physiological development. In response to cold, <b>chicks</b> shortened foraging bout lengths two- to sixfold, and increased cycle lengths (i. e. length of a brooding bout plus subsequent foraging bout), resulting in a decrease in total foraging time. Body temperature during foraging was lower in cold-exposed <b>chicks</b> but did not drop below 37. 8 °C, suggesting that the direct cause to end a foraging bout was not body temperature. The metabolic rate of cold-exposed <b>chicks</b> was reduced by 48 % to 60 % when switching from foraging to brooding, which {{may be an important}} factor in determining foraging behavior of precocial <b>chicks.</b> Mass-specific food intake of the cold-exposed <b>chicks</b> exceeded that of warm <b>chicks</b> by 15 %. Cold-exposed <b>chicks</b> doubled foraging efficiency to reach this intake during their reduced foraging time. Metabolic rates initially were similar in both groups, but increased rapidly and were elevated in cold-exposed <b>chicks</b> from 15 days of age onward. Growth rate initially was reduced in cold-exposed <b>chicks,</b> and exceeded growth of warm <b>chicks</b> only after 21 days of age. These results suggest that in response to cold, a shift occurs in the balance between growth rate and thermoregulatory function in favor of thermoregulatory function. ...|$|R

5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The <b>chick</b> may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the <b>chick</b> is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the <b>chick</b> has departed. During the last few days underground, the <b>chick</b> sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The <b>chick</b> finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
