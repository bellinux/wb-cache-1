40|$|AbstractRecognition of {{handwritten}} <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas</b> {{is a hot}} area. Since {{the symbols}} are often written connected and cannot be easily segmented, {{the recognition of the}} whole formula faces challenge. In this paper, we present a method for handling the connected areas in online handwritten <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas.</b> The formula is preprocessed firstly and then both of structure features and time features are combined for segmentation. Benzene ring is a very common structure in <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas,</b> so we employ the freshman chain code to separate it from the chemical bond when they are connected. Experiment results show that the proposed method can work with a high accuracy of more than 90 %...|$|R

5|$|Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides {{with various}} metals. With alkali metals A, the {{crystals}} have a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> APaO3 and perovskite structure, or A3PaO4 and distorted rock-salt structure, or A7PaO6 where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E
5|$|The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> Am2(C2O4)3·7H2O.

The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25g/L.|$|E
5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E

5|$|Vanadinite is {{a mineral}} {{belonging}} to the apatite group of phosphates, with the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It {{is one of the}} main industrial ores of the metal vanadium and a minor source of lead. A dense, brittle mineral, it is usually found in the form of red hexagonal crystals. It is an uncommon mineral, formed by the oxidation of lead ore deposits such as galena. First discovered in 1801 in Mexico, vanadinite deposits have since been unearthed in South America, Europe, Africa, and North America.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E

5|$|While Degesch {{owned the}} rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the {{packaging}} system, the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa, owned {{the rights to}} a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow (Testa) of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east. Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of Testa.|$|E
