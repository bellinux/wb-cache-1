50|$|Typical {{orthodontic}} treatment can take 12-36 months. The treatment time {{depends on the}} distances the teeth need to be moved, treatment goals, the type of techniques employed and {{the cooperation of the}} patient. Rapid tooth movement following decortication, commonly known as Wilckodontics or accelerated osteogenic orthodontics is a well documented procedure that is claimed to decrease treatment time by 6 to 9 months of active orthodontic care. The out-patient decortication surgery is hypothesized to induce a transient osteopenia (decreased bone density) condition that favors accelerated {{orthodontic treatment}}. The idea behind the therapy is biological in nature. The main drawback is that the surgery can be invasive.New surgical, less invasive approaches may be available, depending on orthodontic needs. Also a segmental fashion (only {{in a part of the}} mouth) can be performed. Patients, as in every oral surgery procedure, should follow a liquid and cold diet for the first 24 hours and a liquid /soft diet for the rest of the week. <b>Corticotomy</b> should not impair working activity. A certain degree of swelling may be expected. It is not known if these <b>corticotomy</b> procedures lead to decreased bone density in all treated patients. It is also not know if the decreased bone density increases the risk for relapse after orthodontic treatment.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{systematic}} {{literature review}} {{was conducted to}} find out if bone-borne maxillary expansion with <b>corticotomies</b> is an effective and secure orthodontic/orthopaedic treatment modality, eliminating orthodontic and periodontal side effects of tooth-borne maxillary expansion with <b>corticotomies.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT) and case series with a sample size >or= 5 were electronically searched in PubMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE Excerpta Medica, CINAHL, Biological Abstracts and CENTRAL till June 2008. Data were extracted by 2 observers. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 9 were prospective and 1 was a retrospective case series. CONCLUSION: No RCT's or CCT's were published on bone-borne surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). For expected advantages compared to tooth-borne SARME, only weak evidence was found for less buccal tipping of the teeth used as anchor teeth in tooth-borne expansion. The heterogeneity of the retrieved publications and the wide variety of outcome variables posed serious restrictions on the review of the literature in a quantitative systematic manner. There is a need for well designed clinical trials research on the effects of tooth-borne and bone-borne SARME...|$|R

40|$|Background: The posttreatment and {{retention}} outcomes following nonextraction orthodontic therapy, {{with and without}} <b>corticotomy,</b> were assessed using the American Board of Orthodontists objective grading system (OGS). Purpose: The purpose {{was to determine if}} the course of retention was any different following alveolar decortication and augmentation bone grafting, i. e., periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO). Materials and Methods: Study casts and panoramic radiographs of patients with and without PAOO (28 subjects each) were {{selected on the basis of}} the following: (1) comprehensive nonextraction orthodontic treatment using straight wire edgewise appliances for Class I crowding, (2) availability of immediate posttreatment records {{and retention}} records at least 1 year post de-bracketing, and (3) use of Hawley removable retainers with similar wearing instructions. Results: Independent and paired t-test statistical testing revealed the following: (1) Posttreatment orthodontic outcomes were the same, with or without <b>corticotomy.</b> (2) During retention, 5 of 8 ABO grading criteria improved for the sample without <b>corticotomy,</b> and 6 of 8 ABO grading criteria improved for the group with <b>corticotomy.</b> (3) Retention outcome scores were lower (better) for alignment and marginal ridges in the corticotomy-facilitated group.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationships among the volume of bone cut during <b>corticotomy,</b> amount of tooth movement, volume of root resorption, and volume of the resultant alveolar bone resorption after tooth movement. Methods: Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were distributed into the <b>corticotomy</b> groups and a control group that underwent sham <b>corticotomy.</b> Two experiments employing two different orthodontic forces (10 or 25 g) and experimental periods (14 or 21 days) were performed. The volumes of the bone cut by <b>corticotomy</b> were 0. 1, 1. 0, and 1. 7 mm 3 in the 25 g groups, and 1. 0 and 1. 7 mm 3 in the 10 g groups. Nickel-titanium closed-coil springs were set on the maxillary left first molars to induce mesial movement. After orthodontic tooth movement, the amount of tooth movement, volume of root resorption, and volume of alveolar bone resorption were measured. Results: Despite differences in the volume of bone cut among the different <b>corticotomy</b> groups, there were not significant differences in the amount of tooth movement and volume of root resorption between the control group and any of the <b>corticotomy</b> groups. However, higher volume of bone cut during <b>corticotomy</b> was significantly related to the decreased alveolar bone volume—in particular, to the reduced height of the alveolar bone crest after tooth movement. Conclusions: The volume of the alveolar bone cut during <b>corticotomy</b> does not affect tooth movement or root resorption in 10 -week-old female Wistar rats; however, it may increase alveolar bone loss after tooth movement. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 877 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 8 月 3 日Author: Takeshi Kurohama, Hitoshi Hotokezaka, Megumi Hashimoto, Takako Tajima, Kotaro Arita, Takanobu Kondo, Airi Ino, Noriaki YoshidaCitation: The European Journal of Orthodontics, 39 (3), pp. 277 - 286; 201...|$|E
30|$|Rapid maxillary {{expansion}} {{was pointed}} out {{to be among the}} most promising methods in the treatment of transversal maxillary deficiency [27 – 29]. It was stated that the main resistance regions to the midpalatal suture opening during maxillary expansion both in clefted and healthy subjects were zygomatic buttress areas in the lateral sides and the pterygoid junctions in the posterior [29, 30]. Therefore, some relieving <b>corticotomies</b> should be applied over these surrounding tissues for decreasing pain during maxillary expansion in adult patients [30].|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of bone grafting when performed in association with <b>corticotomies.</b> A randomized split-mouth design was utilized in seven adult male beagle dogs. <b>Corticotomies</b> were performed with a piezosurgery unit adjacent to the maxillary second premolars. The experimental (Graft+) side additionally received bone grafting (demineralized freeze-dried bone graft, Straumann USA, Andover, MA) with a resorbable collagen membrane. The premolars underwent 9 weeks of archwire expansion, followed by 3 weeks of consolidation. Soft tissues measurements, including probing depth, attachment loss, and recession were obtained. Tooth movements were evaluated by intraoral, radiographic, and model measurements. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify the surrounding bone and new bone formation was analyzed histologically using calcein and alizarin fluorescent labels and hematoxylin and eosin stains. Results of the experiment showed that the Graft+ and control (Graft-) second premolars displayed similar amounts of expansion (~ 2. 5 mm measured intraorally, and ~ 1. 7 mm radiographically) and tipping. Bony dehiscences were visible on both the Graft+ and Graft- sides, with significantly (p= 0. 038) more bone loss over the mesial root on the Graft- than Graft+ side. New bone apposition was evident on the periosteal surface of buccal bone and surrounding graft particles on the Graft+ side. Mineralized particulate graft material was evident at the apical aspect of the roots. Histologically, graft incorporation into host bone occurred along the buccal surface of the expanded tooth root, with greater bone volume present apically than coronally. Bone material density (mg HA/cm^ 3) was found to be significantly (p= 0. 028) greater on the grafted side. No significant differences were found for any second premolar soft tissue measurement, or for tooth and root heights between the Graft+ and Graft- sides. Within the context of this study, we can conclude that while new bone formation occurs after bone grafting in combination with <b>corticotomies,</b> it is mostly limited to the more apical aspect of the tooth root. Although the soft tissue periodontium was not detrimentally affected, bony dehiscence formation was not prevented with the bone grafting procedure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionOne of {{the many}} uses of the Ilizarov fixator is for {{torsional}} deformities correction. Rotational and translational bone displacement related to torsional deformities correction includes the additional tension stresses, which affect the biology of the regenerated bone. Understanding the clinical factors will assist in designing the optimal treatment strategy, thus possibly improving the outcomes. Patients and methodsIt was case series retrospective study. The study examined 56 patients. The mean follow-up time was 5 years and 6 months. The mean age {{at the start of}} treatment was 19 years and 10 months. Patients underwent derotational <b>corticotomies</b> of distal metaphysis of the femur or proximal metaphysis of the tibia using the Ilizarov method. In these patients, following derotational <b>corticotomies</b> with the Ilizarov method, numerous variables were defined and their effect evaluated: the selected treatment strategy, the rate, size, type, and level of derotation on complications, the alignment index, the correction coefficient, the elongation index, and deformation correction factor. ResultsThe differences in the values of alignment index and deformation correction factor in this study subgroups were not statistically significant. We found differences in the elongation index and correction coefficient in a number of subgroups. DiscussionIn the case of correcting torsional deformation without significant elongation, acute correction and with a value of > 30 ° does not significantly affect the results. Treatment strategy, type and level of derotation had no major influence on torsional deformities treatment. Level of evidenceCase-control study III...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to {{investigate}} radiologically the distraction site in the gonial angle area after three different protocols of unidirectional mandibular distraction in sheep. Bilateral mandibular distraction was performed in nine sheep, and one other sheep served as a sham-operated control. In the nine experimental sheep, three different distraction protocols were used. In three sheep, an oblique <b>corticotomy</b> line was applied and the distractors were positioned perpendicular to the <b>corticotomy</b> line. In three other sheep, a horizontal <b>corticotomy</b> line was applied and the distractors were also positioned perpendicular to this <b>corticotomy</b> line. In the remaining three sheep, again, a horizontal <b>corticotomy</b> was performed, but with an angular positioning of the distractors relative to this <b>corticotomy</b> line. Distraction of 20 mm was performed over 20 days at a rate of 1 mm per day. After 3 weeks of retention the sheep were sacrificed, the mandibles were dissected and hemisectioned, and standardized hemimandibular contact radiographs were made of the specimens. The distracted gaps were traced from the radiograph and the gonial angle was measured. The displacements of the distracted parts were measured, the gonial angles were determined, and the values were compared with four additional control non-distracted sheep mandibles. The results show that there was a very large variability in the distracted gaps {{as well as in the}} gonial angle changes after distraction, and it was not possible to recognize any of the three different distraction protocols radiographically after distraction.

40|$|Background: Selective {{alveolar}} <b>corticotomy</b> {{is defined}} as an intentional injury to cortical bone. This technique is {{an effective means of}} accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effect of buccal <b>corticotomy</b> in accelerating maxillary canine retraction. Materials and Methods: The sample in this clinical trial study consisted of 15 adult female patients with therapeutic need for extraction of maxillary first premolars and maximum canine retraction. By use of split-mouth design, at the time of premolars extraction, buccal <b>corticotomy</b> was performed around the maxillary first premolar, randomly on one side of maxilla, and the other side was reserved as the control side. Canine retraction was performed by use of friction – less mechanic with simple vertical loop. Every 2 weeks, distance between canines and second premolars was measured until complete space closure. The velocity of space closure was calculated to evaluate the effect of this technique in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. The obtained data were statistically analyzed using independent t-test, and the significance was set at 0. 05. Results: The rate of canine retraction was significantly higher on the <b>corticotomy</b> side than the control side by an average of 1. 8 mm/month versus 1. 1 mm/month in the <b>corticotomy</b> side and control side, respectively (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Based on result of this study, <b>corticotomy</b> can accelerates the rate of orthodontic tooth movement about two times faster than conventional orthodontics and it is significant in early stages after surgical porsedure.

30|$|Brutscher et al. {{conducted}} an experimental study on sheep tibiae {{to assess the}} differences in regenerative properties when the division was by either a <b>corticotomy</b> or osteotomy. At 8  weeks after the procedure, there was no remarkable difference between the cases of <b>corticotomy</b> and osteotomy. From the 9 th week onwards, bone regeneration after osteotomy was considerably delayed {{and even more so}} after the 12 th week [50]. Brutscher highlighted several factors to consider in their work. The feasibility of the <b>corticotomy</b> relied on the condition of the medulla and cortex, instruments available and the experience of the surgeon. The work concluded that the <b>corticotomy</b> group developed new tubular bone quicker and with fewer complications and was seen as optimal. The osteotomy group led to regenerate, which was not tubular initially, however, did lead to tubular bone after remodelling.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} an orthodontic patient faces is the time spent wearing brackets. Over the years, several surgical techniques have been developed to address this issue and reduce the overall treatment time. These combine bone-healing mechanisms with orthodontic loads to accelerate tooth movement. Although effective, these techniques are also quite invasive in nature, requiring the elevation of buccal and lingual full-thickness flaps with extensive decortications of the buccal and lingual alveolar bone. Moreover, these techniques run the risk of teeth devitalization, avascular necrosis of the osseous block, alveolar resorption, and the risks of complications, with low acceptance by the patient. This manuscript reports three cases treated with a novel, flapless approach for minimally invasive rapid orthodontic (MIRO). This procedure includes radiographic-guided micro incisions and localized piezoelectric <b>corticotomies.</b> The clinical implications of this technique are discussed herein. MIRO reduces orthodontic treatment time, avoiding the reported adverse effects of accelerated orthodontics. KEY WORDS: tooth movement, surgical procedures, minimally invasive, piezosurgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of orthodontic treatments in adult patient remains a barrier for some patients. The recent scientific reports describing piezocision technique involving minimally invasive <b>corticotomies,</b> {{seem to be}} of interest for these particular cases. The present communication describes the clinical case of a 20 -year-old patient presenting a class I bilateral, an overcrowding of front areas with the superior canine in mesio-infraclusion and a deviated lower median line. An excellent multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for the planification of such cases. Under local anesthesia, the surgical technique involves vertical minimal incision around the teeth {{that need to be}} moved. Trough the minimal incisions, 5 mm vertical alveolar osteotomies are performed using ultrasonic surgical device. No suture is necessary. The orthodontic activation is applied 1 week before the surgical procedure and the patient is recalled every 15 days to activate the orthodontic appliance. In this case self-ligating brackets were used to reduce the friction. Post-operative outcomes were painless for the patient and the complete orthodontic procedure took 7 months. The overall treatment appeared to be faster than a conventional orthodontic treatment. However, even if animal studies seem to confirm the clinical feeling described in this case report, further clinical studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to validate this treatment approach.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{link between}} the neurosurgeon’s {{knowledge}} and the scientific improvements made {{a dramatic change in}} the field expressed both in impressive drop in the mortality and morbidity rates that were operated {{in the beginning of the}} XXth century and in operating with high rates of success cases that were considered inoperable in the past. Neuronavigation systems have been used for many years on surgical orientation purposes especially for small, deep seated lesions where the use of neuronavigation is correlated with smaller <b>corticotomies</b> and with the extended use of transulcal approaches. The major problem of neuronavigation, the brainshift once the dura is opened can be solved either by integrated ultrasound or intraoperative MRI which is out of reach for many neurosurgical departments. METHOD: The procedure of neuronavigation and ultrasonic localization of the tumor is described starting with positioning the patient in the visual field of the neuronavigation integrated 3 D ultrasonography system to the control of tumor resection by repeating the ultrasonographic scan in the end of the procedure. DISCUSSION: As demonstrated by many clinical trials on gliomas, the more tumor removed, the better long term control of tumor regrowth and the longer survival with a good quality of life. Of course, no matter how aggressive the surgery, no new deficits are acceptable in the modern era neurosurgery. There are many adjuvant methods for the neurosurgeon to achieve this maximal and safe tumor removal, including the 3 T MRI combined with tractography and functional MRI, the intraoperative neuronavigation and neurophysiologic monitoring in both anesthetized and awake patients. The ultrasonography integrated in neuronavigaton comes as a welcomed addition to this adjuvants to help the surgeon achieve the set purpose. CONCLUSION: With the use of this real time imaging device, the common problem of brainshift encountered with the neuronavigation systems is covered and any eventual tumor residue can be spotted by ultrasonography and resecte...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: The average {{orthodontic}} treatment time for extraction therapy is 31 months. One {{of the main}} disadvantages of {{orthodontic treatment}} is time. Alveolar corticotomies {{have been used in}} conjunction with orthodontics to reduce the treatment time by increasing the rate of tooth movement. Concerns about the possible risks of <b>corticotomy</b> procedure have led to the modification of this technique. Germeη et al. reported a case treated by their modified <b>corticotomy</b> technique and noted reduced treatment time without any adverse effects on the periodontium and the vitality of teeth with their new conservative <b>corticotomy</b> technique. This study was undertaken to clinically evaluate the efficacy of the aforesaid technique. Materials and Methods: A split-mouth study design was carried out to compare the rate of maxillary canine movement with and without modified <b>corticotomy</b> facilitated orthodontic treatment in 10 patients requiring maxillary first premolar extractions. The modified <b>corticotomy</b> procedure was performed on the maxillary arch unilaterally. The upper arch was immediately activated bilaterally after surgical procedure using equal orthodontic forces for retraction of the maxillary canines. The amount of tooth movement was recorded at an interval of every month till the completion of canine retraction. The rate of canine movement on experimental and control site was compared. The patients were followed for 6 months to check the occurrence of undesired effects such as root resorption, periodontal damage and loss of vitality of teeth on the experimental side. Results: Higher mean velocity was observed in canines with modified <b>corticotomy</b> facilitated retraction compared to conventionally retracted canines; with the difference in mean velocity between the two groups was found to be clinically significant as well as statistically significant (P < 0. 001).

Material and method Forty-five Wistar rats (Rattusnorvegicus Albinus) were equally divided into three groups: Control Group (CG) - no tooth movement or corticotomy; Movement Group (MG) - tooth orthodontic movement only; and <b>Corticotomy</b> and Movement Group (CMG) - tooth orthodontic movement surgically assisted by <b>corticotomy.</b> In the CMG, surgical procedures consisted in an incision in the palatal, reaching from the mesial to the distal regions of the maxillary right first molar. Tooth movement in the MG and CMG was applied with coil spring force of 40 gF from the maxillary right first molar to the maxillary right incisor. The rats were sacrificed at days 1, 3, and 7, and histological sections were performed to evaluate the counting of osteoblasts and osteoclasts throughout the areas of tension and pressure. Result Histological analysis showed that the CMG presented better cell response to bone neoformation compared with that of the other groups. Greater proliferation of osteoclasts was observed in areas of pressure on day 3, resulting in increased reabsorption, whereas greater proliferation of osteoblasts was observed in areas of tension on day 1, indicating increased bone formation. Conclusion Differences between the treated groups occurred only in the initial period of tooth movement. Therefore, the changes caused by <b>corticotomy</b> are not significant in orthodontic movement to justify this invasive procedure...|$|E
30|$|This <b>corticotomy</b> {{technique}} has been adapted by various authors, notably De Bastiani [2] and Patkiss and Gross [3] who described the ‘Afghan Percutaneous Osteotomy’ using a Gigli saw. The De Bastiani technique purports {{to keep the}} medullary blood supply intact; the Gigli saw technique divides it. On the other hand, the usual approach for the De Bastiani <b>corticotomy</b> is an anterior incision over the tibial crest, whereas the incisions to pass a Gigli saw tend to be smaller but require more periosteal elevation.|$|E
