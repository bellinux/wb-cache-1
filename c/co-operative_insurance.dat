Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the Fairfield ward of the Liverpool Labour Party.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the scale of}} the {{architecture}} changed as the east side of Corporation Street attracted substantial broad based buildings. The neo-Baroque building designed by F. E. L. Harris for the Co-operative Wholesale Society was erected between 1905 and 1909, and dated 1907. It was constructed in red brick with polished granite and sandstone dressings. The façade has full height pilasters and Corinthian columns, and the roof is concealed by parapet walls. The Mitchell Memorial Hall was lost in the Manchester Blitz, and the 1907 building has been extended to fill the whole block. A further Classical sandstone building on Corporation Street to the north of Hanover Street is owned by the CWS. This was designed by W. A. Johnson in 1928 and opened in 1930. It is symmetrical in design, with further full height pilasters and a large central entrance arch, topped with a mansard roof with dormer windows. By 1908 a new Chief Office for the <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Insurance</b> had been built at 109 Corporation Street, Manchester, which served as their head office until 1962 when they moved to the CIS Tower on Miller Street, barely 100 yards distant. Footage captured in 1901 shows the junction of Cross Street and Corporation Street with horse-drawn carriages. The junction with Withy Grove became the northern offices of a national newspaper.|$|E
