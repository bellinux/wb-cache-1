2500|$|Oxidation of {{antimony}} metal dominates in Europe. Several {{processes for}} the production of crude antimony(III) oxide or metallic antimony from virgin material. The choice of process depends on the composition of the ore and other factors. [...] Typical steps include mining, <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> of ore, sometimes followed by froth flotation and separation of the metal using pyrometallurgical processes (smelting or roasting) or in a few cases (e.g. when the ore is rich in precious metals) by hydrometallurgical processes. These steps do not take place in the EU but closer to the mining location.|$|E

'When I used to lie {{catching}} {{notes of}} the chanting, and knowing that the organ was quiet for me, I used to feel that if I got well, I must give up my life to it, and study music in full earnest, {{so as to be}} a real lift to people's praise, perhaps in our own Cathedral. I thought maybe I could get in as a lay-vicar when my year is up, and work at harmony under Miles, and take a musical degree. But then came that day when the organ seemed to be <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> my head to bits--and of all Psalms in the world it was the forty-second! and Manby telling me on my life not to try to do anything for I can't tell how long.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose that}} my readers must be {{generally}} aware that glaciers are masses {{of ice in}} slow motion, {{at the rate of}} from ten to twenty inches a day, and that the stones which are caught between them and the rocks over which they pass, or which are embedded in the ice and dragged along by it over those rocks, are of course subjected to a <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> power altogether unparalleled by any other force in constant action. The dust to which these stones are reduced by the friction is carried down by the streams which flow from the melting glacier, so that the water which in the morning may be pure, owing what little strength it has chiefly to the rock springs, is in the afternoon not only increased in volume, but whitened with dissolved dust of granite, in proportion to the heat of the preceding hours of the day, and to the power and size of the glacier which feeds it.|$|E
50|$|Olive Ridley {{sea turtles}} feed on marine snails, smaller forms of fish, fish eggs, {{crustaceans}} and jellyfish. Algal material {{is also used}} as food by the Ridleys. Ridleys generally <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> the food materials before intaking.|$|R
50|$|Molcajetes {{are used}} to <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> spices, <b>and</b> to prepare salsas and guacamole.

50|$|Human {{teeth are}} made of dentin and are covered by enamel in the areas that are exposed. Enamel, itself, is {{composed}} of hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate crystal. The various types of human teeth perform different functions. Incisors are used to cut food, canines are used to tear food, and the premolars and molars are used to <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> food.|$|R

5000|$|A {{mortar and}} pestle is a kitchen device used since ancient times to prepare {{ingredients}} or substances by <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> them into a fine paste or powder. The mortar (...) is a bowl, typically made of hard wood, ceramic or stone. The pestle (...) is a heavy and blunt club-shaped object, {{the end of which}} is used for <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding.</b> The substance to be ground is placed in the mortar and ground, crushed or mixed using a pestle.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{metamorphism}} {{is associated}} with zones of high to moderate strain such as fault zones. Cataclasis, <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> of rocks into angular fragments, occurs in dynamic metamorphic zones, giving cataclastic texture.|$|E
50|$|Abrasion {{occurs when}} larger rock {{particles}} roll and strike against bedrock walls, chipping and splintering particles {{and pieces of}} rock (Strahler and Strahler). As these cobbles and boulders roll across the stream bed, they continue to <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> the bedrock, producing an assortment of eroded rock sizes (Ritter, 2006). Again, the severity {{of this type of}} erosion is dependent upon stream velocity and stream load (i.e. the presence of larger rock particles)..|$|R
50|$|One main {{characteristic}} of elasmobranch fishes is {{their ability to}} continually replace the teeth in their upper and lower jaw. Smooth dogfish differ from other sharks because of their 10 rows of flat, blunt teeth. The teeth in {{the upper and lower}} jaw are similar in size and are asymmetrical with a rounded cusp. These teeth are used to <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> food, rather than bite it. Their unique dentition is important for their crustacean-based diet.|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} the Port Jackson shark are {{one of its most}} {{distinguishable}} feature. Unlike other sharks, its teeth are different in the front and back. The front teeth are small, sharp and pointed, while the back teeth are flat and blunt. These teeth function to hold <b>and</b> break, then <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> the shells of the mollusks and echinoderms upon which this species feeds. Juveniles of the species have sharper teeth and their diet has a higher proportion of soft-bodied prey than adults.|$|R
50|$|The mill {{features}} a conventional gold mill circuit, with <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> followed by carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes for gold recovery. A portion of gold is recovered by gravity before the leaching process.|$|E

2500|$|During the Edo Period, {{lower class}} and impoverished samurai {{in the area}} used the wood of the elm trees around the castle site to craft wooden pestles, a {{traditional}} kitchen utensil in Japan. [...] These pestles, or surikogi, were (and continue to be) used to <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> sesame seeds, spices, or other dry ingredients. [...] The samurai craftsmen sold these pestles to merchants, just as samurai across Japan did with specific items made of locally available materials, in order to supplement the meagre stipend they received from their daimyo.|$|R
5000|$|Two of the panda's most {{distinctive}} features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: [...] "much like the vegetarian gorilla, the low {{body surface area}} to body volume the giant panda is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo." [...] Similarly, the giant panda's round face {{is the result of}} powerful jaw muscles, which attach {{from the top of the}} head to the jaw. Large molars <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> fibrous plant material.|$|R
50|$|Mining of banded iron {{formations}} involves coarse <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> screening, {{followed by}} rough <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> fine <b>grinding</b> to comminute the ore {{to the point}} where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.|$|R
50|$|Dunite {{could be}} used to {{sequester}} CO2 and help mitigate global climate change via accelerated chemical rock weathering. This would involve the mining of dunite rocks in quarries followed by <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> as to create fine ground rock that would react with the atmospheric carbon dioxide. The resulting products are magnesite and silica which could be commercialized.|$|E
50|$|Hypsodont molars lack both {{crown and}} neck. The occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> plant material.

5000|$|Production {{increased}} {{slightly in}} 2006 to 465,000 ounces. Mining {{concentrated on the}} high-grade GQ lode in the open pit. Mining from the known underground reserves increased significantly, especially in the Sunrise and Western Shear zones. Gold production from the underground mine was 67,000 ounces. Record throughput of 3.9Mtpa was achieved in the process plant {{as a result of}} additional <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> circuit optimization.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth of}} the Port Jackson shark are very {{different}} from other shark species. They are not serrated, and the front teeth have a very different shape from those found {{at the back of the}} jaws, hence the genus name Heterodontus (from the Greek heteros, meaning different, and dont, meaning tooth). The anterior teeth are small and pointed, whereas the posterior teeth are broad and flat. The teeth function to hold <b>and</b> break, then <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> <b>grind</b> the shells of molluscs and echinoderms. Juvenile Port Jackson sharks have more pointed teeth and feed on a higher proportion of soft-bodied prey than adults. They can feed by sucking in water and sand from the bottom, blowing the sand out of the gill slits, and retaining the food, which is swallowed.|$|R

50|$|Bat rays feed on mollusks, {{crustaceans}} {{and small}} {{fish on the}} seabed, using their winglike pectoral fins to move sand and expose prey animals. They may also dig trenches up to 20 cm deep to expose buried prey, such as clams. Bat ray teeth are flat and pavementlike, forming tightly-packed rows that are used for <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> prey—the crushed shells are ejected and the flesh consumed. As with all elasmobranchs, these teeth fall out and are replaced continuously.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, as {{the mining}} {{operation}} moved into an ore zone with different composition, the gold/silver doré operation was decommissioned and the operation converted to copper and zinc concentrates. The Sulphide Phase operation {{will use the}} same front end <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> process from the Gossan operation and will use a Flotation Circuit for the recovery of copper and zinc concentrates. The first shipment of copper concentrate was in March 2009 and completion of the zinc circuit is expected in April 2010.|$|E

50|$|Due to low zinc prices {{production}} was halted between 2001 and 2003. In 2009 {{production was}} again threatened as demand for zinc, used to galvanise steel {{for the car}} and construction industries, declined sharply due to the slowdown in the global economy. Zinc and lead prices maintained their strength throughout 2011 due to continued demand from China and India. Ore production from Tara Mines continued strongly throughout 2011. A brand new Autogenous Grinding mill, which replaces large sections of the original <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> plant, became operational in October.|$|E
50|$|Before froth {{flotation}} can work, the ore {{to be treated}} is reduced to fine particles by <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> (a process known as comminution) so that the various minerals exist as physically separate grains. This process is known as liberation. The particle sizes are typically less than 0.1 mm (100 µm), but sometimes sizes smaller than 7-10 µm are required. There is a tendency for the liberation size of the minerals to decrease over time as the ore bodies with coarse mineral grains that can be separated at larger sizes are depleted and replaced by ore bodies that were formerly considered too difficult.|$|E
