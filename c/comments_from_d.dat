40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> <b>D.</b> Cattaneo and co-workers on our article describing a retrospective study in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients receiving linezolid tailored to the individual patient using therapeutic drug monitoring {{as part of their}} regular treatment [1]. Cattaneo and co-workers correctly summarise that one of our findings was that we did not observe any significant differences between exposure to linezolid and adverse events. Indeed, this observation may be surprising with a toxic drug like linezolid, {{but it is not a}} reason to rule out therapeutic drug monitoring as a tool for optimising the treatment regimens of TB patients. The explanation for this lies in the design of our study, the characteristics of the patient population, and the specific dosing regimen used for MDR-TB patients...|$|E

We agree that the article by Mannherz et al does cover a younger age group of patients, but given the difficulty finding prospective follow-up in bracing treatments, it was included as it showed failure in long-term follow-up. 1 The illustrative case demonstrates a patient with high compliance in that she was highly motivated to be braced, and continued to wish to be braced, despite earlier advice to the contrary that the brace treatment was failing to maintain the curve. The patient was premenarche at the time of treatment commencement. Continuation of treatment was purely at patient request. In our institution, we have adopted the shared decision-making model for patient consent to treatment. 2 All forms o...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} two interconnected networks with dif-ferent qualities. There are call externalities {{in the sense that}} consumers value calls they send and receive. Networks compete in two part tari¤s. We show that call externalities create private incentives for each competi-tor to charge low access prices. This result moderates the risk of tacit collusion when competitors can freely negotiate their access charges. We also analyze the case of a merger between the two networks and give conditions under which the merger can be welfare improving.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{compares the}} degree to which personal and interactive factors respectively account for variation in patterns of physician-parent communicative exchange. The analysis of audiorecordings of 115 pediatric consultations revealed several notable findings: (a) individual physicians differed in {{the degree to}} which each provided information, issued directives, exhibited positive socioemotional behavior, and engaged in partnership-building, (b) parents who asked more questions and expressed more negative affect (e. g. concerns, frustrations) received more information and directives from physicians, (c) parents who were more affectively expressive elicited a greater number of positive socioemotional <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> doctors, and (<b>d)</b> parents' question-asking and opinion-giving were related to the parents' level of education and {{the degree to which}} physicians' engaged in partnership-building.

40|$|Based on {{the setting}} defined {{in a paper}} by Kihlstrom and Roth (1982), we {{consider}} a 2 -person insurance bargaining game in which a risk-averse client is bargaining with an insurer. Existing literature using an axiomatic Nash cooperative bargaining game shows that risk aversion constitutes a disadvantage for the client. Essentially the same result will in general arise in a non-co-operative bilateral bargaining game of complete and perfect information. We complement the discussion {{on the impact of}} risk aversion by constructing a non-eo-operative alternating offer bargaining game for the insurance market where we account for 'risk aversion ' of the players through the discount factor.

40|$|A {{total of}} 216 {{weanling}} pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, initially 13. 6 lb and 21 d of age) {{were used in}} a 42 -d growth trial to compare the effects of supplemental zinc and copper and changing mineral regimens on growth performance and plasma mineral levels. The 6 dietary treatments included a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with main effects of added copper from copper sulfate (0 or 125 ppm) and added zinc from zinc oxide (0 or 3, 000 ppm <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14 and 0 or 2, 000 ppm <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 14 to 42). For the final 2 treatments, either zinc oxide alone or the combinations of zinc and copper were fed <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14, with copper sulfate fed <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 14 to 42. There were 6 pens per treatment with 6 pigs per pen. All diets were supplemented with an additional 165 ppm zinc and 16. 5 ppm copper from the trace mineral premix. Plasma was collected from 2 pigs per pen on d 14 and 42. <b>From</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14, ADG, ADFI, and F/G were improved (P < 0. 04) {{with the addition of}} dietary zinc.

Over the entire trial, continuous supplemental zinc increased (P < 0. 03) ADG and tended to increase (P < 0. 09) ADFI. Dietary copper also increased (P < 0. 004) ADG and ADFI when fed <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 42. The most advantageous values for ADG and ADFI were seen in the treatment containing high levels of zinc <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14 and high copper levels <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 14 to 42. The addition of either zinc or copper increased (P < 0. 02) feed cost per pound of gain.

Pigs were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments (6 pens per treatment) balanced by average BW within gender.

All diets contained 3 % added fat. Pig BW, ADG, ADFI, and F/G were determined every 14 d. At the end of the trial, carcass fat quality was evaluated. There were no treatment × gender interactions (P > 0. 21) for any criteria evaluated. Although there were some differences in F/G within phases, there were no overall differences (P > 0. 35) in growth performance among treatments. Final weight numerically decreased as total DDGS level increased. Feeding continuously or withdrawing DDGS from the diet, regardless of the amount or duration, had no significant effect (P > 0. 39) on any of the carcass criteria measured. Pigs fed DDGS had increased (P 0. 57) revenue or income over feed cost.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of diet complexity, feed-grade antibiotic and zinc (Zn) source on weanling pig growth performance. In Exp. 1, 320 pigs (initially 4. 42 ? 0. 09 kg and 14 d of age) were allotted in a 2 ? 2 ? 2 factorial with main effects of diet complexity (simple or complex); added zinc oxide (ZnO; none or 3, 000 ppm Zn <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 10 then 2, 000 ppm <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 10 to 20); and feed-grade antibiotic (none or 55 mg neoterramycin/kg of diet). Experimental diets were fed <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 20 after weaning and then a common diet that contained no ZnO (other than provided in the trace mineral premix) or antibiotic was fed to all pigs <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 20 to 27. <b>From</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 10, a three-way interaction was observed (p< 0. 02) for ADG, which appeared to be a result of an additive response to both ZnO and the antibiotic in simple diets, whereas in complex diets, either ZnO or antibiotic was equally effective in improving ADG. Pigs fed complex diets had improved (p< 0. 05) ADFI throughout the trial and ADG was increased (p< 0. 05) in all phases except d 20 to 27. Pigs fed diets containing ZnO had greater (p< 0. 05) ADG <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 5 to 10, 0 to 20 and 0 to 27 and greater (p< 0. 05) ADFI <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 5 to 10, 0 to 10 and 0 to 20 compared to pigs fed no added Zn. The feed-grade antibiotic increased (p< 0. 05) ADG <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 10 to 20, 0 to 20 and 0 to 27. In Exp. 2, 288 pigs (initially 5. 59 ? 0. 12 kg and 18 d of age) were allotted in a 2 ? 3 factorial with main effects of antibiotic (none or 55 mg carbadox/kg of diet) and Zn source (none, 250 ppm Zn from a Zn amino acid complex (ZnAA), or 3, 000 ppm Zn <b>from</b> ZnO). <b>From</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14, pigs fed diets containing ZnO had greater (p< 0. 01) ADG than pigs fed no added Zn and those fed ZnAA were intermediate. <b>From</b> <b>d</b> 14 to 27, added Zn did not affect ADG, but ADFI tended to increase (p< 0. 07) with added ZnO. Feed-grade antibiotic had no effect <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 0 to 14 but tended to increase (p< 0. 08) ADG and ADFI <b>from</b> <b>d</b> 14 to 27.
