5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, we <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that,</b> for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as}} an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
500|$|The ad was {{conceived}} {{by the agency}} Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: [...] "Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag." [...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> scene. Here, we were just taking advantage of those incredible moments." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{film was}} an example of the use of the {{character}} names Jack and May, which were to be repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Bowers writes, [...] "It developed that Lloyd F. Lonergan, ... liked these names, and during the years to come used them again and again. One <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> it must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles. Patrons watching the picture in a theatre had not the foggiest idea whether the hero was named Jack, Bertram, or Ezekiel." [...] The first usage of the two leading character roles was in Dots and Dashes.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 May 2017, Wikileaks posted {{links to}} e-mails {{purported to be}} from Emmanuel Macron's {{campaign}} in the French 2017 presidential election. The documents were first relayed on the 4chan forum (used by far-right American groups) and by pro-Trump Twitter accounts, and then by Wikileaks, who indicated they did not author the leaks. Experts have asserted that the Wikileaks Twitter account {{played a key role}} in publicising the leaks through the hashtag #MacronLeaks just some three-and-a-half hours after the first tweet with hashtag appeared. The campaign stated that false documents were mixed in with real ones, and that [...] "the ambition of the authors of this leak is obviously to harm the movement En Marche! in the final hours before the second round of the French presidential election". France's Electoral Commission described the action as a [...] "massive and coordinated piracy action". France's Electoral Commission urged journalists not to report on the contents of the leaks, but to heed [...] "the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election". Cybersecurity experts initially believed that groups linked to Russia were involved in this attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement. The head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that they did not have evidence connecting the hack with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that [...] "we <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country." ...|$|E
