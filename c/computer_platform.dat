25|$|On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, {{along with}} 30 {{hardware}} and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network <b>computer</b> <b>platform.</b> The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the Internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became {{a partner in the}} network computing effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. Katz Media attempted to use the network <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> concept as a way to push the Pippin into vertical markets. Although the Apple iMac (1998) is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk, the Apple Pippin platform was about two years ahead of the iMac in this effort.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Apple, Jobs {{took a few}} of {{its members}} with him to found NeXT, a <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> {{development}} company that specialized in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate {{the development of the}} visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story—an event made possible in part because of Jobs's financial support.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there had}} long been {{important}} platform games on home computers, a second generation of platform games for computers appeared alongside {{the new wave of}} consoles. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Amiga was known as a stronger gaming platform than IBM-compatible PCs, thanks to its more powerful stock video hardware and sound hardware. The Atari ST was solidly supported as well. Games like Shadow of the Beast and Turrican showed that <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> games could rival the graphics and sound of their console contemporaries, and Prince of Persia featured an unprecedented level of animation.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of CP/M and S-100 bus computers was loosely patterned on the MITS Altair, an early {{standard in the}} microcomputer industry. This <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s. CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly {{reducing the amount of}} programming required to install an application on a new manufacturer's computer. An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and hackers bought them and shared their creations in user groups. CP/M was displaced by MS-DOS soon after the 1981 introduction of the IBM PC.|$|E
25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|E
25|$|South Korea's RPG {{industry}} {{began with}} translations of RPGs imported from Japan and the United States. The first fully translated Japanese RPG in Korea was Phantasy Star (1987) for the Sega Master System, which was licensed by Samsung and released as the Samsung Gam*Boy in South Korea, on April 1989. The country's first fully-fledged computer RPG was Sin'geom-ui Jeonseol, {{also known as}} Legend of the Sword, released for the Apple II <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> in 1987. It was programmed by Nam In-Hwan and distributed by Aproman, and was primarily influenced by the Ultima series. In the late 1980s, the Korean company Topia began producing action role-playing games, {{one of which was}} Pungnyu Hyeopgaek for the MS-DOS in 1989. It was the first Korean title published for IBM PC compatibles and is set in ancient China. Another action RPG released by Topia that same year was Mirae Sonyeon Conan, a video game adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's Japanese 1978 anime series Future Boy Conan, for the MSX2 platform.|$|E

2500|$|Hideo Kojima {{designed}} the original Metal Gear, which debuted in Japan and Europe in 1987 for the MSX2 <b>computer</b> <b>platform.</b> A separate team created a heavily modified Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) port {{of the game}} that was released in Japan, North America and Europe. Konami then produced an NES sequel titled Snake's Revenge—in whose development Kojima was again not involved—that was released in North America and Europe in 1990. One of that game's designers became acquainted with Kojima {{and asked him to}} create a [...] "real Metal Gear sequel". In reaction, Kojima began development of , which was released in Japan in 1990 for the MSX2.|$|E
2500|$|The current Mac {{product family}} uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple {{introduced}} an emulator {{during the transition}} from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), {{much as it did}} during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. [...] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.|$|E
