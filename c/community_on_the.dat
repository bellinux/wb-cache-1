5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Hamersley Progress Association {{was formed to}} {{represent}} the views of Hamersley residents to all levels of government. It was, however, fairly short-lived. In 1999, the Hamersley Reference Group was formed to advise then-Federal Member for Stirling Jann McFarlane MHR on {{issues related to the}} ABC radio transmission towers and their effect on local residents. It was renamed to Radio Interference Group – Hamersley Towers after it moved to complete community management, and lobbies the government and makes submissions to public inquiries on behalf of the <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Mount Vision, the two roads {{parallel}} {{each other}} {{into the town}} of Hartwick, where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek, CR11D. The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing, intersecting with another crossroad, the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road. In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end a short distance to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E

5|$|East of Jacobsville, MD 177 {{receives}} {{the eastern end}} of MD 100. There is no direct access from eastbound MD 100 to westbound MD 177. The state highway becomes a three-lane road with the center lane controlled by lane use signals. During rush hours, there are two lanes in the relevant direction; at all other times, the center lane serves as a center left turn lane. The eastern end of the three-lane section is at South Carolina Avenue in the community of Lake Shore. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road and passes a loop of Old Mountain Road. At Pinehurst Road, which leads to Downs Memorial Park, the route veers southeast toward Gibson Island. MD 177 reaches its eastern terminus at the gatehouse that guards the private island <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of the mouth of the Magothy River at the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of massacre. Evidence {{included}} complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of}} the violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E

5|$|John Caldwell Calhoun {{was born}} in Abbeville District, South Carolina on March 18, 1782, the fourth child of Patrick Calhoun (1727–1796) and his wife Martha Caldwell. Patrick's father, also named Patrick Calhoun, had joined the Scotch-Irish {{immigration}} movement from County Donegal to southwestern Pennsylvania. After {{the death of the}} elder Patrick in 1741, the family moved to southwestern Virginia. Following the defeat of British General Edward Braddock at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755, the family, fearing Indian attacks, moved to South Carolina in 1756. Patrick Calhoun belonged to the Calhoun clan in the tight-knit Scots-Irish <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Southern frontier. He was known as an Indian fighter and an ambitious surveyor, farmer, planter and politician, {{being a member of the}} South Carolina Legislature. As a Presbyterian, he stood opposed to the Anglican elite based in Charleston. He was a Patriot in the American Revolution, and opposed ratification of the federal Constitution on grounds of states' rights and personal liberties. Calhoun would eventually adopt his father's states' rights beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Louie Broady Nunn {{was born}} in Park, Kentucky– a small <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border of Barren and Metcalfe counties– on March 8, 1924. His given name, Louie, honored a {{deceased}} friend of his father's; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother's family. Louie {{was the youngest of}} the four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital heart condition and severe arthritis and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a small farm. The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula on the lake. The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, and bends slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake, before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), which leads to a small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, and proceeds to its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling <b>community</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hulls of vessels.|$|E
