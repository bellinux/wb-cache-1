30|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with the non-invasive embedding of enriched partition of unity approximations in classical finite element simulations and the efficient solution of the resulting linear systems. The employed embedding is based on the partition of unity approach introduced in Schweitzer and Ziegenhagel (Embedding enriched partition of unity approximations in finite element simulations. In: Griebel M, Schweitzer MA, editors. Meshfree methods for partial differential equations VIII. Lecture notes in science and engineering, <b>Cham,</b> <b>Springer</b> International Publishing; 195 – 204, 2017) which is applicable to any finite element implementation and thus allows for a stable enrichment of e.g. commercial finite element software {{to improve the quality of}} its approximation properties in a non-invasive fashion. The major remaining challenge is the efficient solution of the arising linear systems. To this end, we apply classical subspace correction techniques to design non-invasive efficient multilevel solvers by blending a non-invasive algebraic multigrid method (applied to the finite element components) with a (geometric) multilevel solver (Griebel and Schweitzer in SIAM J Sci Comput 24 : 377 – 409, 2002; Schweitzer in Numer Math 118 : 307 – 28, 2011) (applied to the enriched embedded components). We present first numerical results in two and three space dimensions which clearly show the (close to) optimal performance of the proposed solver.|$|E

On the other hand, the composition of interfaces in a distributed environment must be provably consistent. We present a novel approach for automatic interface configuration in distributed services. We introduce a Message Definition Language (MDL), an interface description language with support of subtyping, flow inheritance and polymorphism. The MDL supports configuration variables that link input and output interfaces of a service and propagate requirements over an application graph.

40|$|In {{a social}} network, {{the number of}} links of a node, or node degree, is often assumed {{as a proxy for}} the node's {{importance}} or prominence within the network. It is known that social networks exhibit the (first-order) assortative mixing, i. e. if two nodes are connected, they tend to have similar node degrees, suggesting that people tend to mix with those of comparable prominence. In this paper, we report the second-order assortative mixing in social networks. If two nodes are connected, we measure the degree correlation between their most prominent neighbours, rather than between the two nodes themselves. We observe very strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often significantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests that if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the most prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also true if we measure the average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This property is weaker or negative in non-social networks. We investigate a number of possible explanations for this property. However, none of them was found to provide an adequate explanation. We therefore conclude that second-order assortative mixing is a new property of social networks. Comment: Cite as: Zhou S., Cox I. J., Hansen L. K.

However, the number of cases that result in prosecution is relatively low. One of the factors influencing this low prosecution rate is communication difficulties.

In this paper we conduct a follow up study investigating the possibility of Robot-Mediated Interviews with children that have various special needs. In a case study we investigated how 5 children with special needs aged 9 to 11 responded to the humanoid robot KASPAR compared to a human in an interview scenario. The measures used in this study include duration analysis of responses, detailed analysis of transcribed data, questionnaire responses and data from engagement coding. The main questions in the interviews varied in difficulty and focused on the theme of animals and pets. The results from quantitative data analysis reveal that the children interacted with KASPAR in a very similar manner to how they interacted with the human interviewer, providing both interviewers with similar information and amounts of information regardless of question difficulty. However qualitative analysis suggests that some children may have been more engaged with the robotic interviewer. ?? Springer International Publishing 2013...|$|R

People with CVI have difficulties in their mobility and they have behaviours that others find hard to understand due to their visual impairment. A branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of behaviour by building computational models that help to explain how people solve problems or why they behave in a certain way. This paper describes a novel computational system that simulates the navigation problem that is faced by people with CVI. This will help relatives, friends, and ophthalmologists of CVI patients understand more about their difficulties in navigating their everyday environment. The navigation simulation system is implemented using the Unity 3 D game engine. Virtual scenes of different living environment are also created using the Unity modelling software. The vision of the avatar in the virtual environment is implemented using a camera provided by the 3 D game engine. Filters that mimic visual defects are created automatically and placed in front of the visual field of the avatar. The filters are based on the visual field charts of individual patients. Algorithms for navigation based on the limited vision have also been developed to demonstrate navigation problems because of the visual defects. The results showed different actions for the navigation behaviours according to the patients’ vision, and the navigations differ from patient to another according to their different defects...|$|R
40|$|The {{pollution}} {{of the oceans}} with plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, called microplastics is moving into the focus of science and governments. To {{determine the amount of}} microplastics several steps are necessary, starting with the sampling, work up and finally analysis. Each step has its own challenges due to small size of the particles. [1] For analysis the imaging with µFTIR microscopy is a powerful tool allowing the analysis of complete filters. Systematic screening for optimal conditions and filter materials have already been performed. [2] While the measurement is performed mostly by the spectrometer, the data interpretation process is highly time consuming as it has to be made by hand on the basis of false color images. To overcome the manual part we developed a novel approach based on the Bruker OPUS© Software to decrease the high time demand for the analysis of microplastics. With this approach it was possible to analyze measurement files from focal plane array (FPA) FTIR mapping containing up to 1. 8 million single spectra. These spectra were compared with a database of different synthetic and natural polymers by various methods. By benchmark tests their performance was monitored with the focus on accuracy and data quality. After optimization high quality data was generated, which allowed image analysis. Based on these results an approach for image analysis was developed, giving information for the particle size distribution for each polymer type as well as their distribution on the filter. It was possible to collect all data with relative ease even for complex sample matrices. This approach has significantly decreased the time demand for the interpretation of FTIR-imaging data and increased the generated data quality. [1]	M. Bergmann, L. Gutow, M.

We {{were interested in the}} ways in which undergraduate physics students learn to combine the different resources used in physics in order to become “disciplinary literate” and what university lecturers do to help their students in this process. Comparative data on the disciplinary literacy goals of physics lecturers for their students was collected at five universities in South Africa and four universities in Sweden. One of the main contributions of the project concerned what we termed the disciplinary affordance of a semiotic resource, that is, the specific meaning-making functions a particular resource plays for the discipline. We contrasted these meaning-making functions with the way that students initially viewed the same resource. We proposed two ways that lecturers can direct their students’ attention towards the disciplinary affordances of a given resource. The first involves unpacking the disciplinary affordance {{in order to create a}} new resource with higher pedagogical affordance. Our second proposal involved the use of systematic variation in order to help students notice the disciplinary relevant aspects of a given resource. A total of 19 articles/book chapters were published as a direct result of this funding. Selected publications Airey, J., & Linder, C. (2017). Social Semiotics in University Physics Education. In D.
