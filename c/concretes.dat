A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} <b>concretes,</b> allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such <b>concretes</b> than can be held explicitly in mind.

Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E
