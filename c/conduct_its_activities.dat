40|$|Objective Regulation of the {{pharmaceutical}} {{system is a}} crucial, yet often neglected, component in ensuring access to safe and effective medicines. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an in-depth analysis of the existing pharmaceutical regulation, including recent changes, in the Republic of Moldova. Methods Data from field work conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) together with a review of policy documents and quantitative secondary data analysis was used to achieve this aim. Results This analysis identified several ways in which pharmaceutical regulation affects availability of quality medicines in the Republic of Moldova. These include lack of full implementation bioequivalence requirements for generics registration, incomplete implementation of good manufacturing practices and no implementation of good distribution practices, use of quality control instead of quality assurance as a method to ensure quality of medicines, frequent change of power within the Medicines and Medical Devices Agency (MMDA) leading to lack of long-term strategy and plans, conflict of interest between the different functions of the MMDA, the lack of sufficient funding for the MMDA to <b>conduct</b> <b>its</b> <b>activities</b> and to invest in continuous training of its staff (particularly inspectors) and very weak post-marketing control.

Ten CoPs were studied. While each of these CoPs is in a different stage of development, the analysis focuses on the Coalescing stage because it is considered the most critical. A detailed case study of each CoP, including a survey of moderators and members, and interviews with moderators is presented. Analysis of these cases indicated that use of IT [...] defined as communication, software, and hardware tools [...] has a reciprocal effect {{on the role of}} the moderator. In other words, a moderator can achieve CoP goals and <b>conduct</b> <b>its</b> <b>activities</b> more efficiently and effectively by use of various IT tools. A moderator 2 ̆ 7 s competence and inclination to using IT tools also affects his or her role and the way he or she conducts the activities and plans to achieve the CoP goals. Those moderators who used IT tools to conduct their CoP 2 ̆ 7 s activities perceived their CoPs to be more successful than those who did not. Other factors such as company support, moderator 2 ̆ 7 s position and influence in the company, and the resources available to the CoP were the deciding factors on the moderator 2 ̆ 7 s role in facilitating a successful CoP. This dissertation concludes with a list of future research possibilities, obstacles to moderators, and improvement opportunities for large companies with several CoPs. All of the research studies on communities of practice so far have assumed that each company has only one CoP.
