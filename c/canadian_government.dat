5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred.

5|$|After 1906, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Government</b> {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>government</b> began to make a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E
