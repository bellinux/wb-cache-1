40|$|Abstract. The polymer {{composites}} {{consist of}} phenolic resin, natural graphite, carbon fiber and copper powder, are fabricated by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> or <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites are analyzed {{to determine the}} influences of post-curing temperature and preparing method on the physical, electrical and mechanical properties of composites. It is found that the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites increase with increasing post-curing temperature for composites prepared by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The flexural strength is more strongly dependent on post-curing temperature. At 170 ℃, the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites were 1. 85 g/cm 3, 2. 94 × 103 S/m and 40 MPa respectively. The cross-linking skeleton structure well established in the composites could be {{the main reason for}} the largely increasing of flexural strength as post-curing temperature increases. The results also show that the properties of composites prepared by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> are higher than those of composites prepared by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing...|$|R

40|$|DC {{conductivity}} {{measurements are}} important for gain- ing fundamental understanding of conduction mecha- nisms of insulation materials, {{as well as in}} the develop- ment of HVDC power system components, such as extruded cable systems. In this study, the influence of sample processing on the morphology and DC conduc- tivity of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been studied. Direct <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> of LDPE pellets is commonly used in research laboratories for obtaining plaque samples, whereas extrusion is an additional commonly used technique for dispersion of particles in nanocomposites prior to the <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> process. In this study LDPE plaques have been obtained by either <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> directly from pellets, or by extrusion followed by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding.</b> The morphology obtained in the first case consisted of band- ed spherulites, whereas the latter method yielded a mor- phology of small axialites. The difference in sample processing had also an impact on the DC conductivity. The DC conductivity at 22 °C and 3. 3 kV mm- 1 was of the order of 4 x 10 – 18 S m- 1 for the plaques obtained by extrusion and <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> whereas the plaques obtained by direct <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> ex- hibited a conductivity of 1 x 10 – 16 S m- 1. In addition, the reproducibility of the performed DC conductivity meas- urements was also verified in a round robin test per- formed between the Royal Institute of Technology and Chalmers Technical University...|$|R

Manufacturing then shifted to producing entire steel guitars and operations moved to Gothenburg, Nebraska by 1947. Approximately one year later, production returned to Southern California. Sometime in 1949, factories moved once again to Baldwin Park, California. Kiesel then named the company Carvin, a portmanteau derived from the first names of his two eldest sons, Carson and Gavin. The company's current production facility occupies 82,000 square feet.|$|E
5000|$|Cooperalls were {{designed}} by Brian Heaton, the senior designer for Cooper Canada from 1972 to 1975. Promoted as [...] "a complete hockey uniform system" [...] it consisted of an elasticated girdle extending {{from the middle of}} the rib cage to the top of the knees, worn beneath a tracksuit-style woven nylon outer shell covering waist to ankle. The girdle had pockets in to which lightweight, <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> foam pads were placed and the close fitting nature of the garment ensured that the pads always stayed in contact with the areas of the body they {{were designed}} to protect. This replaced the traditional combination of short hockey pants and socks, and Cooper claimed that when combined with their own brand of extra light shin guards, shoulder pads and gloves the system weighed 40% less than a conventional uniform. As well as being considerably lighter, the system offered players greater freedom of movement and improved hip, pelvis and thigh protection.|$|E
50|$|Solid, {{one piece}} <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> mats {{are made from}} {{recycled}} or virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as well as recycled or virgin Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE). Solid mats are lighter in weight than hollow rig mats but due to the simpler connection system provide the same or similar usable working surface area per mat once connected (10’ x 8’, 13.5’ x 6.5’). Typically this means that a significantly greater number of solid mats can be loaded onto a truck resulting {{in a number of}} key benefits including larger working surface area per truckload, reduced number of transport trips per project, reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per project, and reduced transport costs per project.A simple connection system, using standard connectors and tools, is used which means that mats can easily be installed and connected on undulating as well as flat surfaces, avoiding the need to prepare the ground surface in advance of installation. This also results in project time and cost -savings.Unlike hollow mats, solid mats cannot be punctured and therefore do not take on water (which can increase mat weight) or other fluids (such as fuel or chemicals) that could adversely impact on sensitive sites.|$|E

40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted <b>Compression</b> <b>Moulding</b> (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{determine}} the thermo-mechanical properties of <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> composite parts. The flow-induced fibre orientation is first calculated by numerical simulation, and the resulting orientation state is used as input in a micromechanical model that predicts the thermo-mechanical properties of the part. A two-step homogenization scheme based on the grain model approach is followed. First, the properties of a reference composite with aligned fibres are estimated {{by means of a}} mixture rule between the upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman bounds (derived by Willis). This method is in agreement with the Mori-Tanaka estimates for moderate concentrations, and gives better results for higher concentrations. Next, the properties of the composite are obtained by averaging several reference composites with different fibre directions.

40|$|Gas {{assisted}} <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> (or GasComp) {{is a novel}} process {{based on}} the injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> cycle, a technique originally introduced in the injection moulding industry. The gas is injected into the molten material at a preset gas inlet point, hollowing out the part and thus assisting the compressive force of the press in generating material flow. This paper presents gas injection parameter studies on polypropylene based recycled glass mat-reinforced thermoplastic (GMT). The parameters investigated are gas ramp rate, gas injection delay time, and peak pressure. The size of cavity {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to gas injection delay time.

Although <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> was performed at 191 °C, thermal degradation was not apparent and materials with good tensile properties could be obtained. For compression-moulded poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens containing approximately 16 mol % lactide, the values for E-modulus, yield stress and elongation at break were respectively 17, 1. 7 MPa and 90 %. Also a very low long-term creep rate of 2. 2 × 10 – 7 s– 1 was determined when specimens were loaded to 20 % of the yield stress. When compared with compression-moulded poly(TMC), poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens deform {{at a rate that}} is one to two orders of magnitude lower. Furthermore, poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens showed complete dimensional recovery within 24 h after loading to 20 % and 40 % of the yield stress for 40 and 5. 5 h, respectively.

40|$|Two {{procedures}} {{conducive to}} blending wheat gluten with other polymers {{in view of}} enhancing the mechanical properties of rigid gluten materials, were investigated. Method 1 involved extrusion of an aqueous gluten dough at 30 – 110 °C. In method 2, gluten was processed in 70 % ethanol at temperatures ≤ 130 °C in a pressurised reactor. After solvent removal, the dried powders were <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> into products exhibiting fewer defects than gluten moulded directly without any pre-treatment, suggesting that application of either method improved polymer flow. In temperature regimes where little or no crosslinking occurred during the shear treatments, the mechanical properties of <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> samples were also better than those of directly moulded gluten. Further improvements were observed when glutenin aggregates depolymerised via breaking of disulfide bonds. This occurred in method 2 at temperatures exceeding 90 °C.
