50|$|In the decimal {{numbering}} system, the radix <b>complement</b> {{is called}} the ten's <b>complement</b> and the diminished radix <b>complement</b> the nines' <b>complement.</b> In binary, the radix <b>complement</b> {{is called the}} two's <b>complement</b> and the diminished radix <b>complement</b> the ones' <b>complement.</b> The naming of <b>complements</b> in other bases is similar. Some people, notably Donald Knuth, recommend using {{the placement of the}} apostrophe to distinguish between the radix <b>complement</b> and the diminished radix <b>complement.</b> In this usage, the four's <b>complement</b> refers to the radix <b>complement</b> of a number in base four while fours' <b>complement</b> is the diminished radix <b>complement</b> of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice.

5|$|During Romania's {{restrictive}} communist period, {{which lasted}} between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, <b>complementing</b> political developments. Throughout {{the first part}} of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (see Censorship in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>complement</b> {{system is}} {{composed}} of soluble factors in plasma that enhance or “complement” immune-mediated killing through innate and adaptive mechanisms. Activation of <b>complement</b> causes recruitment of immune cells; opsonization of coated cells; and direct killing of affected cells through a membrane attack complex (MAC). Tumor cells up-regulate <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors – one of several strategies to evade the immune system. In many cases as the tumor progresses, dramatic increases in <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors are found on these cells. This review focuses on the classic <b>complement</b> pathway {{and the role of}} major <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors in cancer immune evasion as well as on how current protein engineering efforts are being employed to increase <b>complement</b> fixing or to reverse <b>complement</b> resistance leading to better therapeutic outcomes in oncology.
