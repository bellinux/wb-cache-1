50|$|Coupling qubits is {{essential}} for implementing 2-qubit gates. Coupling two qubits may be achieved by connecting them to an intermediate electrical <b>coupling</b> <b>circuit.</b> The circuit might be a fixed element, such as a capacitor, or controllable, such as a DC-SQUID. In the first case, decoupling the qubits (during the time the gate is off) is achieved by tuning the qubits out of resonance one from another, i.e. making the energy gaps between their computational states different. This approach is inherently limited to allow nearest-neighbor coupling only, as a physical electrical circuit is to be lay out in between the connected qubits. Notably, D-Wave Systems' nearest-neighbor coupling achieves a highly connected unit cell of 8 qubits in the Chimera graph configuration. Generally, quantum algorithms require coupling between arbitrary qubits, therefore the connectivity limitation is likely to require multiple swap operations, limiting {{the length of the}} possible quantum computation before the processor decoherence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{use of a}} double-layer <b>coupling</b> <b>circuit</b> and {{additional}} patch conductors is proposed for improving the power handing capability of high-power high-temperature superconductor transmit filters with stripline (SL) structure. A double-layer <b>coupling</b> <b>circuit</b> is formed through the substrate between {{the edge of the}} resonator {{and the end of the}} feed line. This reduces the current concentration compared with that of a conventional gap-coupled circuit due to the large gap between the resonator and feed line of the double-layer <b>coupling</b> <b>circuit.</b> The additional patch conductors (placed in the upper layer of the resonator edge) improve the power handling capability by reducing the local magnetic field concentration. The current density distribution of two-pole SL dual-mode filters with a 5. 0 -GHz center frequency and 100 -MHz bandwidth and with an Al 2 O 3 substrate with a relative dielectric constant of 9. 9 was investigated. An electromagnetic simulator based on the moment method was used to design the filters, and the maximum current densities at the edges of the resonator as a function of frequency were simulated. The results showed that the maximum current density in an SL filter with a double-layer <b>coupling</b> <b>circuit</b> and patch conductors was approximately 30 % less than that of the conventional gap-coupled filter...|$|E
