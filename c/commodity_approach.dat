An important goal was to take advantages of <b>commodity</b> <b>approaches</b> wherever possible. In particular, we selected Linux, a commonly available operating system, for the compute nodes of Cplant tm. While the use of commodity solutions, including Linux, was critical to the success of Cplant tm, we believe that such an approach will not be viable in the development of the next generation of very large-scale systems. We present our definition of a balanced system and discuss several limitations of commodity operating systems in the context of balanced systems. These limitations are categorized into technical limitations (e. g., the structure of the virtual memory system) and social limitations (e. g., the kernel development process). While our direct experience is based on Linux, issues we have identified should be relevant to all commodity operating systems. 1...|$|R

We propose a strategic investment framework that is intended to support better management of national and international HIV/AIDS responses than exists with the present system. Our framework incorporates major efficiency gains through community mobilisation, synergies between programme elements, and benefits of the extension of antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV transmission. It proposes three categories of investment, consisting of six basic programmatic activities, interventions that create an enabling environment to achieve maximum effectiveness, and programmatic efforts in other health and development sectors related to HIV/AIDS. The yearly cost of achievement of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support by 2015 is estimated at no less than US$ 22 billion. Implementation of the new investment framework would avert 12. 2 million new HIV infections and 7. 4 million deaths from AIDS between 2011 and 2020 compared with continuation of present approaches, and result in 29. 4 million life-years gained. The framework is cost effective at $ 1060 per life-year gained, and the additional investment proposed would be largely offset from savings in treatment costs alone...|$|E

40|$|Routing {{policies}} {{used in the}} Internet can be restrictive, limiting {{communication between}} source-destination pairs to one path, when often better alternatives exist. To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be dampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to mitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing through an indirect-path via overlay peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in overlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring both availability and performance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive monitoring of all overlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An alternate technique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on physical disjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently, several techniques have emerged which can optimize {{the selection of a}} disjoint-path without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths. In this paper, we show that using only <b>commodity</b> <b>approaches,</b> i. e. running infrequent traceroutes between overlay hosts, a lot of information can be revealed about the underlying physical path diversity in the overlay network which {{can be used to make}} informed-guesses for alternate-path selection.

This in keeping with the conception of the maquiladora program as a way to attract labor-intensive production to Mexico in order to provide more jobs and their benefits to the Mexican economy. At {{the end of the century}} a more balanced judgment has emerged. Foreign plants have invested in more intensive production processes, and more sophisticated organizational procedures: Advanced product manufacturing, just-in-time methods, and ISO 9000 certification have become standard among a growing number of maquiladoras. As a consequence, knowledge of local engineers in industrial processes has remarkably increased in the last two decades. In our work we analyze those contradictory trends that make of the border region one of the most dynamic in the world. From the perspective of regional development it is necessary to asses if the industry will evolve into a more integrated network with old and new local industries, and if professional knowledge will be a more significant competitive advantage than low wages in the next few years. As Gereffi has stressed, there are different production roles among different countries;ranging from primary commodity exports to original brand-name manufacturing.

40|$|This paper explores and summarises the status, policies, {{challenges}} and {{reforms of the}} education systems in the Arab World. There is much that the systems have in common, especially in relation to cultural background, language and general strategies – this despite the striking differences {{that exist in the}} region in terms of the stage of development as reflected in such indicators as literacy rates, participation rates, gender issues, funding, and so on. The steady shift of the status of, and approach to education from being predominantly a social service reflecting mainly individual needs and human rights, and thus is mostly supply driven, to a balanced socioeconomic activity that incorporates the necessary aspects of a social service and economic investment has been a common phenomenon in Arab countries. One of the major developments in this respect is the growing privatisation and globalisation of educational services, especially in higher education. Modern technologies helped to support such developments and enhance a <b>commodity</b> <b>approach</b> with all its pros and cons which are clear mainly in distance and open education that utilises e-learning methodologies and which is spreading quickly, whether in open universities or as blended education in ordinary ones. The governance and structural aspects of the education systems in the Arab World have been characterised by some apparent weaknesses that are reflected in the ongoing efforts to improve their relevance to developmental needs and labour market requirements, enhance the decentralisation aspects and school empowerment, and develop the technical and vocational education systems. The relatively high population growth rate, coupled with the phenomenon of mass education and the lack of resources in the majority of Arab countries, have reflected negatively on the qualitative aspects of educational efforts and services, and have resulted, in many cases, in poor efficiency. This is clear for example in the modest achievements in the field of scientific research. In the educational field, the Arab World does not lack regional and sub-regional organisations and set-ups, although the effectiveness of such organisations has so far been subject to criticism despite many distinct efforts and achievements. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{an approach to}} high performance computing which makes extensive use of commodity technologies. In particular, we exploit new Web technolgies such as XML, CORBA and COM based distributed objects and Java. The use of commodity hardware (workstation and PC based MPP's) and operating systems (UNIX, Linux and Windows NT) is relatively well established. We propose extending this strategy to the programming and runtime environments supporting developers and users of both parallel computers and large scale distributed systems. We suggest that this will allow one to build systems that combine the functionality and attractive user environments of modern enterprise systems with delivery of high performance in those application components that need it. Critical to our strategy is the observation that HPCC applications are very complex but typically only require high performance {{in parts of the}} problem. These parts are dominant when measured in terms of compute cycles or data-points but often a modest part of the problem if measured in terms of lines of code or other measures of implementation effort. Thus rather than building such systems heroically from scratch, we suggest starting with a modest performance but user friendly system and then selectively enhancing performance when needed. In particular, we view the emergent generation of distributed object and component technologies as crucial for encapsulating performance critical software in the form of reusable plug-and play modules.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} history and {{evolution}} {{of the concept of}} ‘local food’ in Australia from the late 18 th to the early 21 st century. It does so by examining and explaining the meanings attached to and conveyed by local foods within their social-historical context. This is the first academic inquiry into the history of local foods in Australia and thus it makes an original contribution to the fields of Australian history, food history and marketing studies. The thesis argues that a preference for local food did exist in the post- 1788 environment and supports this argument with the identification of various factors that were responsible for distinguishing local foods in Australia, including government intervention, industrialisation, marketing and the desire to develop a cultural identity separate from Britain, promoting a fierce independence reflected in the production of branded Australian-made products starting around the time of Federation. Using a history of <b>commodities</b> <b>approach</b> to link the production and consumption of local food products in four case studies, the main forces driving the connections to local foods are documented. The thesis contends that definitions of ‘local’ and understandings of the benefits associated with local foods have clearly shifted over time and the changes in meanings make it confusing for today’s consumers, meaning {{there are a number of}} fundamental uncertainties relating to how the distinctive characteristics of local foods may be determined, and how the special end qualities of such products may be understood or identified.
