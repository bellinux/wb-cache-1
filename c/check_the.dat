50|$|<b>Checking</b> <b>the</b> box {{does not}} change the amount of an individual's tax or refund. The $3 is paid by the {{government}}. In other words, <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> box causes the federal government to receive $3 less in tax revenue for other spending, than if one hadn't <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> box.|$|R

5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it more difficult to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E
5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E

5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|Although downtrodden by 1986's playoff defeat, Cleveland {{continued}} {{to win the}} following season. Minnifield and Dixon excelled defending the pass, while Matthews and defensive tackle Bob Golic kept runners in <b>check.</b> <b>The</b> Browns finished with a 10–5 record in 1987 and won the AFC Central {{for the third year}} in a row. In the divisional playoff round, the Browns faced the Indianapolis Colts and won 38–21.|$|E
5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and because Belgium and France are not part of the Common Travel Area, all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the Schengen governments concerned (Belgium and France) have legal obligations to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> travel documents of those entering their respective countries (as well as those leaving, in the case of Belgium and France).|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{have been}} made by the Food and Agricultural Organization to improve {{relations}} between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|I-380 crosses two of Iowa's major rivers, the Iowa and the Cedar. Both rivers have {{affected}} the interstate during major floods, as the case was in 1993 and in 2008. During the Great Flood of 1993, I-380 and Iowa965 were both closed at the Iowa River's Coralville Lake reservoir between July 13 and July 28. The roads reopened after the lake's waters receded enough to allow Department of Transportation inspectors to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> three bridges over the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{internal}} politics {{he attempted}} to strengthen {{the power of the}} monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish Sejm (parliament) to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław was fed up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his position would be much stronger.|$|E
50|$|This {{function}} is not evasive, {{because there is}} a decision tree that solves it by checking exactly two variables: <b>The</b> algorithm first <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> value of x. If x is true, <b>the</b> algorithm <b>checks</b> <b>the</b> value of y and returns it.|$|R
50|$|When {{a player}} gives a <b>check</b> on <b>the</b> first move, he loses the second move of his turn. If a player is in check, he must {{move out of}} <b>check</b> on <b>the</b> first move of the turn. It {{is not allowed to}} move the king into <b>the</b> <b>check</b> on <b>the</b> first move of the turn and then move out of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> on <b>the</b> second one.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer guessed {{correctly}} at any point, {{the game}} {{ended with the}} audience member winning all prizes accumulated to that point and <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer earned <b>the</b> chance to place a fourth digit in their check. James then asked one last question to the gallery contestants. The correct respondent tried to guess the final digit selected by <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer for <b>the</b> thousands digit in their <b>check.</b> If successful, <b>the</b> respondent became <b>the</b> new <b>check</b> writer. If <b>the</b> correct digit was not guessed, the number was placed in <b>the</b> <b>check</b> and <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer won that amount in cash.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>check</b> <b>the</b> Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius {{had sent a}} massive {{expedition}} to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle {{is considered to be}} one of Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victories. It cemented his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer took {{particular}} care {{over the}} first London and Berlin productions. He travelled to London to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> singers and production for the original version, and requested that the German translation for Berlin be undertaken by the poet Ludwig Rellstab, strongly recommending that Taglioni and her father Fillipo be re-engaged, and that Ciceri's sets should be reproduced. Although Taglioni danced and the sets were retained, the translation was eventually carried out by Meyerbeer's friend Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for Taglioni for the Berlin production.|$|E
5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could <b>check</b> <b>the</b> aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E
5000|$|Blocking <b>the</b> <b>check.</b> This {{will only}} work if <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> piece is a queen, rook or bishop {{and there is}} at least one empty square in the line between this <b>checking</b> piece and <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> king. Blocking a check is done by moving a piece to a square in line in between <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> piece and <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> king. (<b>The</b> {{blocking}} piece is then pinned to the king by the attacking piece.) ...|$|R

5000|$|The person {{preparing}} a <b>check</b> positions <b>the</b> <b>check</b> in <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer so its print-heads are centered {{over the field}} on <b>the</b> <b>check</b> where <b>the</b> amount of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> would otherwise be written out in words. Using a series of levers or buttons on the checkwriter's control panel, the operator enters the monetary amount of <b>the</b> <b>check.</b> This amount is then printed onto <b>the</b> <b>check</b> by <b>the</b> operator pulling a lever {{on the side of}} the unit (or by pressing a button on electric units). This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits. Entering $6,762.64, for example, will produce text reading [...] "TheSum6762dol's64cts".|$|R
5|$|The Assaf dynasty (also called Banu Assaf) were a Sunni Muslim {{and ethnic}} Turkmen dynasty of chieftains {{based in the}} Keserwan region of Mount Lebanon.

During this period, they established their headquarters in Ghazir, which served as the Assafs' base throughout their rule.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The Scrutineers add {{up all of}} the votes, and the Revisers <b>check</b> <b>the</b> {{ballots and}} the names on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made. The ballots are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the {{assistance}} of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.|$|E
