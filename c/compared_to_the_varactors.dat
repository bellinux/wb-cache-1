This explains the importance of impedance matching networks and their continuously increasing use in many electronic applications, as for example RF power amplifi ers, source-pull and load-pull power transistor characterization or impedance matching devices such as Antenna Tuning Units. The focus of this thesis is on the design, fabrication and test of impedance matching networks.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents RF MEMS capacitive switches {{which are}} based on a thin-film aluminum circular beam geometry that exhibit reduced sensitivity to both initial residual stress and stress-changes versus ambient temperature. The device symmetry also facilitates low- series-inductance compact device arrays for high-value capacitances. These switches are built in the Raytheon RF MEMS process and show an 8 - 10 x improvement in temperature stability over the standard fixed-fixed beam designs. Also, cascadable RF MEMS switched capacitors are demonstrated that are suitable for VHF and UHF tunable filters and reconfigurable matching networks. These devices are fabricated in the UCSD and Raytheon RF MEMS processes and result in a near ideal capacitor impedance over a 30 : 1 frequency range. The circular geometry is then used to demonstrate an RF MEMS switched capacitor with 10 W power handling at 10 GHz under hot-switching conditions that maintains a relatively-low (< 30 V) pull-in voltage. The device consists of separate RF and DC electrodes, which are defined underneath a temperature-stable circular beam, to result in both increased restoring force above the RF electrode and higher RF self-actuation voltage. This thesis also presents a compact low-loss tunable X-Band bandstop filter that is implemented on a quartz substrate using both miniature RF-MEMS capacitive switches and GaAs <b>varactors.</b> <b>The</b> 2 -pole filter is based on capacitively loaded folded-[lambda] resonators that are coupled to a microstrip line, and the filter analysis includes the effects of non-adjacent inter-resonator coupling. The RF MEMS loaded filter results in a measured 25 dB improvement in power handling and linearity <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GaAs <b>varactor</b> design. Finally, a 1. 6 - 2. 4 GHz suspended 3 -pole RF MEMS tunable filter is presented. The filter results in an insertion loss of 1. 34 - 3. 03 dB over the tuning range and a 3 -dB bandwidth of 201 - 279 MHz. This design results in a tunable Q_u of 50 - 150 over the frequency range, and to our knowledge, is the first suspended RF MEMS filter with the best Q_u.

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of wireless communication, varactors {{can play an important}} role in enabling adaptive transceivers as well as phase-diversity systems. This thesis presents various varactor diode-based circuit topologies that facilitate RF adaptivity. <b>The</b> proposed <b>varactor</b> configurations can act as variable capacitors with high tuning range, low losses and ultra-low distortion, while being continuously tunable and facilitating fast modulation. Making use of these special components, we dealt with various RF applications that can benefit from their unique features, like power and impedance control in the mobile systems and multiple-standard modulators for transceivers and phase diversity systems. Chapter 1 provides an overview of challenges associated with {{the evolution}} of wireless communication. Through several case studies, it has been addressed how linear variable reactors (varactors) can enable RF reconfigurability for future telecommunication systems. <b>The</b> challenges on <b>varactors</b> for these applications are brought out, which suggests an urgent need for high-performance varactors. This chapter ends with a descriptive and flow-graph-like outline of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the state-of-the-art tunable elements such as BST varactors, MEMS based switches and varactors, and currently available semiconductor switches and varactors. Their advantages and drawbacks are extensively discussed. These surveys clarify the motivation and goal of this thesis, and can at the same time be used as a reference to place this research with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing literature. <b>To</b> overcome <b>the</b> limitations of currently available tunable elements, Chapter 3 deals with the theory of two novel extremely linear varactor diode configurations with complementary linearity properties in a single varactor diode technology. Both varactor configurations use anti-series varactor diode configurations, where the diodes share the same exponential C(VR) depletion capacitance relation. However, the proposed structures differ in their harmonic terminations and varactor area ratios, resulting in a fundamentally different linearity behavior versus tone spacing. It is this feature that makes it possible to address different requirements of transmit and receive chains in one single technology. In Chapter 4, all varactor configurations, aiming for the cancellation of third-order intermodulation distortion, are summarized and their performance are compared. It is shown that the unique feature of <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other “infinite” impedance center-tapped varactor stacks and MEMS varactors, is its high modulation frequency for operation and high linearity for signals with low tone spacing, making it perfectly suitable for many dynamic RF modulation applications. <b>The</b> wide tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack, which can be implemented in the same process technology as <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack, offers a complementary linearity behavior in terms of tone spacing and it can be regarded as a bonus, provided that the use of <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack is compulsory. In addition, their exponential C(VR) relationship generally yields larger tuning range <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uniformly doped <b>varactors,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> distortion-free <b>varactor</b> stack. When <b>the</b> multi-stack topology is used <b>to</b> further improve <b>the</b> IM 5 dominated linearity and power handling capability, it turns out that this stacking yields a linearity improvement that is the double of what is generally found for IM 3 dominated devices. The system-level responses of <b>the</b> different <b>varactor</b> configurations are investigated under different bandwidth or data-rate conditions. It reveals that <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack is suitable for both moderate and high data-rate applications, while varactor configurations with linearity limitations at low tone spacings, like <b>the</b> distortion-free <b>varactor</b> stack, may raise some in-band distortion when the bandwidth under consideration is relatively small. Chapter 5 discusses the technology implementation issues and provides the experimental verification of <b>the</b> proposed <b>varactor</b> configurations. <b>The</b> measurement results provide the experimental evidence for the predicted IM 3 cancellation, as well as, for the complementary linearity behavior of <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack and wide tone-spacing varactor stack. Their usability in practical circuit conditions was demonstrated through source-pull simulations and measurements, illustrating that high linearity can be maintained in all cases. The multi-stack topology is used <b>to</b> further reduce <b>the</b> IM 5 dominated nonlinearity of <b>the</b> narrow tone-spacing <b>varactor</b> stack, yielding a record high linearity for continuously tunable capacitances. Using <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> adjust <b>the</b> C-VR relationship through the doping profile, the desired capacitance control range and related control voltage are achieved for various practical applications. In particular, the measured data of Skyworks’ pre-production GaAs <b>varactors</b> represent <b>the</b> current state-of-the-art in tuning range, linearity and quality factor among all existing continuously tunable elements. As two application examples of <b>the</b> novel <b>varactors,</b> <b>the</b> adaptive matching networks for mobile handsets are demonstrated in Chapter 6, while a phase shifter and amplitude modulator are given in Chapter 7. The demonstrated adaptive matching networks in Chapter 6 are focused on the efficiency enhancement of the power amplifier in the presence of antenna mismatch. Making use of a varactor-based approach, the resulting networks are capable of dynamically correcting the antenna mismatch with the VSWR of 10 over the whole Smith-chart. For all these conditions, an optimum loading for a power level between 0. 5 W and 1 W is offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power amplifier stage along with a relatively high operating power gain. The proposed “whole Smith-chart” solution will ease the design of the RF frontend and antennas, yielding a significant reduction in the time-to-market of mobile phones. As another application example, given in Chapter 7, ultra linear low-loss varactors are applied for the implementation of amplitude and phase modulators, which can be used in phase diversity systems. The designed structures allow rapid amplitude and phase modulation with a very low distortion. These components can not only improve the performance of existing RF systems, like phased-array antennas and active load-pull system, but also facilitate other new circuit implementations or RF applications. As a demonstration, a novel polar modulator is proposed that can considerably simplify the structure of the traditional transmitter architecture, while being capable of generating the complex signals, which are typically in use in wireless communication systems. Chapter 8 presents the conclusions and recommendations of this research. The most important conclusion is that the linearization techniques proposed in this thesis has enabled the implementation of ultra linear low-loss varactors. Making use of these varactors, various adaptive circuits can be designed for adaptive RF systems. Microelectronics & Computer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{amplitude control}} (AAC) loop is an indispensable element for the practical realization of VCOs embedded in a complete transceiver. Its noise however can unacceptably degrade the single-sideband-to-carrier ratio (SSCR) performance of the oscillator, this problem being even exacerbated in low-voltage circuits. This paper addresses the design issues of a low-voltage low-noise differential LC-VCO with AAC, tunable within a 2. 3 - 2. 8 -GHz frequency range, fully integrated in bipolar technology with 2 -V power supply. First, the mechanisms through which the AAC noise affects the output phase are identified as the poor indirect stability and the AM-to-PM conversion due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>varactors.</b> <b>The</b> effect of the AAC noise is discussed and substantially reduced with suitable design choices.

When the the actuator is heated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> in-plane alignment temperature, maximum capacitance is obtatined. Simulations and analytic models are used <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> performance of <b>the</b> actuator and <b>varactor.</b> <b>The</b> analytic models presented and developed make development of out of plane curled varactors more efficient and simpler than with FEM simulations only. <b>The</b> complete <b>varactor</b> design was included in a test circuit sent to production in November 2008. Simulations and models yield good results for tuning range and Qualityfactor. The tuning range is predicted to be between 240 % and 325 % and the Q-factor is calculated to be 30 @ 1. 5 GHz. The tuning voltage required for operation of <b>the</b> <b>varactor</b> is within 8 V and <b>the</b> <b>varactor</b> does not suffer from pull-in, which is the case for electrostatic based varactors...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{reports a}} compact tunable ultra-wideband (UWB) notch filter using hybrid {{microstrip}} and coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure. The tunable notch is implemented <b>to</b> filter out <b>the</b> wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) channels from 5 GHz <b>to</b> 6 GHz. <b>The</b> proposed structure utilizes the resonance of open ended stubs to achieve transmission zeroes in <b>the</b> filter passband. <b>Varactors</b> and by-pass capacitors are then introduced for dynamic tunability of notch. Further, the electromagnetic decoupling of the two resonators leads to tunable bandwidth of notch. DC bias circuitry is implemented <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> <b>varactor</b> capacitances. Rejection levels up to 25 dB are attained using this technique while maintaining insertion loss levels below 2. 5 dB in the passband. The reconfigurability of bandwidth is shown by maintaining a constant bandwidth of 150 MHz across the WLAN band for the notch. The filter achieves an excellent wide bandwidth (from 2. 5 GHz to 8. 5 GHz) using multimode-resonator (MMR) based topology which makes the filter one wavelength long at the central frequency...|$|R

Any deviation of phase from 90 deg as detected by the phase detector will then produce an error signal that will change the reactance coupled into <b>the</b> resonant cavity <b>to</b> change its reactance, and thus correct its resonance frequency.
