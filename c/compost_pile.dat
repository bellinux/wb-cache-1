Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built <b>compost</b> <b>pile</b> or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.|$|E
25|$|According to Ronald Rychlak {{the clergy}} prisoners were treated {{marginally}} {{better than other}} prisoners, however treatment worsened {{in the wake of}} Papal or episcopal announcements critical of the Nazi regime, such as Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address. One Easter, the guards marked Good Friday by torturing 60 priests. Tying their hands behind their backs, chaining their wrists, and hoisting them up by the chains – tearing joints apart and killing and disabling several of the priests. The threat of further torture was used to keep the priests obedient. Food was so lacking, that prisoners would retrieve scraps from the <b>compost</b> <b>pile.</b>|$|E

30|$|An {{increase}} in pH of all <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> at {{the commencement of}} composting, especially during the thermophilic phase, was due likely to the metabolic degradation of organic acids Satisha and Devarajan (2007) and the ammonification process taking place during organic matter degradation Mahimairaja et al. (1994). After the 14 th day, the pH values of all piles were significantly declined {{which is likely to}} be a consequence of phenolic compound production and organic acid production during biodegradation of lignocellulose in the <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> Satisha and Devarajan (2007).|$|R

25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a <b>compost</b> <b>pile</b> due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E

40|$|The study {{objective}} was to identify blending ratio of T. diversifolia and maize stalks that optimizes <b>compost</b> <b>pile’s</b> heat built-up, precursor to compost maturity. In this study, 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % of T. diversifolia biomass were blended with maize stalks, and then composted using chimato composting technology. Temperatures were measured to determine heat built-up. TKN, nitrate-N and C/N ratios were determined using standard methods. Results showed high and more prolonged peak temperatures in <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> with T. diversifolia content of 0 %, 20 % and 40 % implying occurrence of more prolonged decomposition that generated prolonged heat. Resultant composts contained large amounts of non-compost materials (> 37 %) and less dark colour indicating high level of immaturity. High but less prolonged peak temperatures were observed in <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> with 50 % and 60 % T. diversifolia suggesting shortened active and rapid microbial activities that generated less heat. Their composts were very dark in colour and yielded least amounts of non-compost materials (< 17 %) which indicated high level of maturity. Significantly large quantities of TKN and nitrate-N and low values of C/N ratios were obtained in chimato <b>composts</b> whose <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> registered high but less prolonged peak temperatures. Optimal blending composition of 50 % and 60 % of T. diversifolia to maize stalks are judged to have significantly improved moisture content and porosity of feedstock which intensified and shortened active microbial activities leading to generation of optimal heat in chimato <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> as well as retain optimal TKN, nitrate-N and C/N ratios in resultant composts...|$|R

30|$|Co-composting of coir pith {{supplemented}} with cow manure, coconut juice, and rice bran under comparatively low initial C/N ratios, i.e., 20, 25, and 30, {{was investigated in}} this study. For the three <b>compost</b> <b>piles,</b> physical changes in terms of color, odor, and texture, and pH appeared to be of similar trend and reached maturity within 1 month. Further, initial C/N ratios posed significant influence on the composting performance assessed in terms of temperature evolution, OM degradation, and TN loss. The OM and TN losses observed for all <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> fitted well to the first-order kinetic. Pile 2 with the initial C/N ratio of 25, on the one hand, showed the fastest biodegradation rate during the initial (bio-oxidative) phase of composting and, on the other hand, led the highest TN losses during an entire <b>composting</b> process. <b>Pile</b> 1 with the initial C/N ratio of 30 allowed optimal composting process in that minimal TN loss and utilization of larger quantity of coir pith were accomplished.|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} {{increase}} in temperature in <b>compost</b> <b>piles</b> or landfill sites due to micro-organisms undergoing exothermic reactions. The model incorporates the heat release due to biological activity within the pile and the heat release due to the oxidation of cellulosic materials. The heat release rate due to biological activity is modelled by a function which is a monotonic increasing function of temperature over a particular range and followed by a monotone decreasing function of temperature. This functionality represents the fact that micro-organisms die or become dormant at high temperatures. The heat release due to the oxidation reaction is modelled by the usual manner using Arrhenius kinetics.

50|$|The Ecuador {{composting}} {{method is}} a common composting practice in the lowlands of Ecuador and Peru. The <b>compost</b> <b>pile</b> is embedded on the tree trunk or banana stalks, with a pale erected in the middle. Organic matter is placed in layers on the trunks or stalks, each layer being covered by mud, or inlaid via different types of organic matter. When the pile is about 1.2 meters high, it is watered and covered by big leaves. After some time, when the <b>compost</b> <b>pile</b> settles down, the central pale is removed for aeration. This composting method is typically done in a small-scale, by indigenous villagers.|$|E
50|$|Composting is {{the process}} of taking organic solid waste, like food, paper and {{landscaping}} waste and allowing it to be broken down by microorganisms, creating a nutrient rich fertilizer to be used in food production or in landscaping. Once organic waste is placed in a pile, millions of microorganisms come from the soil to help break down the food waste. There are different types of microorganisms that are found in compost piles, depending on the temperature and pH of the <b>compost</b> <b>pile,</b> which can be determined by the types of waste introduced to the <b>compost</b> <b>pile.</b> In the beginning phase, mesophilic bacteria jump-start the decomposition process by breaking down all of the most easily decompostable material, raising the temperature to a level that the next phase of microorganisms thrive in. In the next phase of decomposition, thermophilic microorganisms further break down fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. It is during this thermophilic phase that temperatures inside of a <b>compost</b> <b>pile</b> can reach above 60 °C, killing most human pathogens that may have been introduced. Once the maximum temperature has been reached, the thermophilic microorganisms tend to slow down and are replaced with more mesophilic bacteria, which continue organic breakdown. During these phases larger organisms like flies, mites and beetles also aid in the breakdown of organic matter. The time it takes for fresh organic waste to be completely decomposed is dependent on multiple factors: microorganisms present, water content, oxygen content, and surrounding air temperature, for example.|$|E

50|$|Uniform {{distribution}} of pathogen-killing temperatures may be aided by placing an insulating blanket of previously composted sludge over aerated <b>composting</b> <b>piles.</b> Initial moisture {{content of the}} composting mixture should be about 50 percent; but temperatures may be inadequate for pathogen reduction where wet sludge or precipitation raises compost moisture content above 60 percent. Composting mixtures may be piled on concrete pads with built-in air ducts to be covered by a layer of unmixed bulking agents. Odors may be minimized by using an aerating blower drawing vacuum through the <b>composting</b> <b>pile</b> via the underlying ducts and exhausting through a filtering <b>pile</b> of previously <b>composted</b> sludge to be replaced when moisture content reaches 70 percent.
