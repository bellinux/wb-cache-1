50|$|The main {{function}} of the cylinder body is to hold cylinder pressure. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> is mostly made from a seamless tube. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> is ground and/or honed internally with a typical surface finish of 4 to 16 microinch. The piston reciprocates in the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the AJS Model 16C was {{launched}} with a completely redesigned 348 cc engine {{in which the}} pushrods were housed in cast <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> 'tunnels'. The 16C also had a Norton-designed geared oil pump to improve lubrication.|$|E
50|$|The MZ 34 and 35 {{both have}} a <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> that is Nikasil-coated. The engine {{features}} a decompression channel to allow easier recoil starting, a tuned exhaust system and a belt-type reduction drive. Starting options include a recoil or electric starter.|$|E

50|$|The STC {{conversion}} on the Cessna 182 {{includes a}} new cowl, both {{to accommodate the}} different engine dimensions and to provide the required cooling airflow. Belly-mounted cowl flaps are still used, but less cooling airflow is directed over the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> and more cooling airflow is directed into side-mounted oil coolers. About one-third of the engine cooling is provided by airflow over the cylinders; the remainder is provided by engine oil. The engine's oil distribution system routes a large oil flow to hot zones in the cylinder heads and upper <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels,</b> carrying the heat away to the oil coolers.|$|R
25|$|Triples (four-stroke, pushrod, three-cylinder engines) - The BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident were {{developed}} together. The Rocket 3 shares {{a majority of}} engine components and other parts with the Trident T150, but has forward-inclined <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> and a BSA frame.|$|R

50|$|The engines {{fitted to}} the 190 and 195 became {{well known for}} their oil consumption. The {{aircraft}} has a 5 gal oil tank, with 2 gal the minimum for flight. Typical oil consumption with steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> is 2 USqt L per hour.|$|R
50|$|The Chevrolet Corvair {{engine is}} a flat-six boxer piston engine {{that was used}} in the 1960s Chevrolet Corvair automobile. It is a highly unusual engine for General Motors: It has {{overhead}} valves, air-cooling, uses a flat design, with aluminum heads (incorporating integral intake manifolds) and crankcase, with individual iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The MZ 301 has <b>{{cylinder}}</b> <b>barrels</b> {{that are}} Nikasil-coated. The {{bore and stroke}} {{are the same as}} the single cylinder MZ 34 engine and twin-cylinder MZ 201 and MZ 202 powerplants [...] The MZ 301 features electric starting and the RZ2 gearbox with optional reduction ratios of 2.18, 2.55, 2.88, 3.11 or 3.66 to 1.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, popular usage {{refers to}} the whole {{assembly}} of cylinder, piston, and piston rod (or more) collectively as a [...] "piston", which is incorrect. Instead, the piston is the short, cylindrical metal component that separates the {{two parts of the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> internally.|$|E
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{feature is the}} stationary slotted sleeve valve enclosing the single combustion chamber, and its co-axial slotted sleeve carried by the rotating <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel.</b> This feature enables the charging air to enter the combustion chamber and allows evacuation later of the products of combustion to the expander cylinders and pistons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company have}} {{produced}} the F-series hydraulic motors under the Volvo Flygmotor, [...] "Volvo Hydraulics" [...] and VOAC brands. The main feature for these products is the spherical pistons with laminated segment. This technology give {{the possibility to}} obtain a large angle (40°) between the shaft and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The last {{engines to}} make {{widespread}} use of monobloc cylinder heads were large air-cooled aircraft radial engines, such as the Wasp Major. These have individual <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels,</b> so access as a monobloc is less restricted than on inline engine. As they are also of high specific power and require the utmost reliability, {{the advantages of the}} monobloc remained attractive.|$|R

50|$|Welded body {{cylinders}} have no tie rods. The barrel is welded {{directly to}} the end caps. The ports are welded to the barrel. The front rod gland is usually threaded into or bolted to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel.</b> That allows the piston rod assembly and the rod seals to be removed for service.|$|E
50|$|When Triumph {{recovered}} and began production again at Meriden the Tiger 100 re-appeared {{with the new}} telescopic fork. In 1951 it gained a new close finned alloy <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and factory race kits for independent racers. In 1953 a fully race-kitted model, the Tiger 100C, was available although only 560 were made.|$|E
5000|$|Some (Wifredo Ricart, Alfa-Romeo) {{feared the}} {{build-up}} of heat inside the cylinder, however Ricardo proved that {{if only a}} thin oil film is retained and working clearance between the sleeve and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> was kept small, moving sleeves are almost transparent to heat, actually transporting heat from upper to lower parts of the system.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a modern}} {{revolver}} of Russian design, the OTs-38, which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case, making the gap between <b>cylinder</b> and <b>barrel</b> irrelevant {{as far as the}} suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>barrel</b> due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.|$|R
50|$|The 'Fury' {{name was}} revived by Enfield India for a {{licensed}} {{copy of the}} German Zündapp KS175. Royal Enfield (India) assembled the 163 cc Fury from parts imported from Germany when Zündapp Motorcycles ceased production and closed their factories in 1984. It had five-speed gearbox, a hydraulic Brembo disc brake and a sleeveless hard chromed <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel,</b> all were a first on a motorcycle in that country.|$|E
5000|$|Replace the <b>cylinder,</b> <b>barrel,</b> and wedge {{and with}} the hammer at half cock, place {{percussion}} caps on each tube using the Colt-designed capping tool. The revolvers came with spare cylinders, {{and the practice of}} the day was to carry spare cylinders loaded and capped for fast reloading. Period users had few qualms about this practice even though it presented a real hazard of accidental discharge if the caps were struck or the cylinder dropped.|$|E
50|$|Before {{reassembling}} all {{the parts}} of your cylinder, you should clean and dry the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> completely. Also clean the piston rod, shaft, {{and other parts of}} the cylinder. Get the broken and damaged seals repacked. Then assemble the parts back on the piston rod. The assembly needs to be done in a reverse order. Once you have assembled {{all the parts}} back, put the rod into the soft-jaw vise and screw back the bolts onto the piston rod.|$|E

25|$|The engine's design {{concentrated}} on the reduction of moving parts. The cooling fan and dynamo were built integrally with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for drive belts. The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are {{the two halves of}} the crankcase and other surface-to-surface joints.|$|R
50|$|The MZ 201 and 202 {{both have}} a <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> that are Nikasil-coated. The bore and stroke {{are the same as}} the single-cylinder MZ 34 engine. The MZ 201 {{features}} an optional recoil starter or electric starting, while the MZ 202 has electric starting only. The MZ 201 has a choice of a reduction drive belt or gearbox, while the MZ 202 offers just the gearbox with reduction ratios of 2.18, 2.55, 2.88, 3.11 or 3.66 to 1.|$|R
50|$|Tie rod style {{hydraulic}} cylinders use high strength threaded steel rods {{to hold the}} two end caps to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel.</b> They are most often seen in industrial factory applications. Small bore cylinders usually have 4 tie rods, and large bore cylinders may require as many as 16 or 20 tie rods in order to retain the end caps under the tremendous forces produced. Tie rod style cylinders can be completely disassembled for service and repair, {{and they are not}} always customizable.|$|E
50|$|Oil cooling is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, oil cooling requires additional oil capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an oil cooler (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|E
5000|$|The {{windlass}} [...] is {{an apparatus}} for moving heavy weights. Typically, a windlass {{consists of a}} horizontal <b>cylinder</b> (<b>barrel),</b> which is rotated {{by the turn of}} a crank or belt. A winch is affixed to one or both ends, and a cable or rope is wound around the winch, pulling a weight attached to the opposite end. The oldest depiction of a windlass for raising water {{can be found in the}} Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by the Chinese official Wang Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty ( [...] 1290-1333).|$|E
