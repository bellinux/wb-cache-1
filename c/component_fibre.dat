40|$|Velocity and {{turbulence}} {{measurements for}} flows in compound meandering channels {{of three different}} sinuosities (s) were undertaken in a relatively small scale laboratory flume. A 2 <b>component</b> <b>fibre</b> optic cable laser Doppler anemometer (FLDA) was employed for the measurements. Information on 3 dimensional structure of the flows in the channels were obtained. Growth and decay processes of secondary flow along the meandering channels were also clarified. It {{is of particular interest}} that secondary flow structures in the meandering channel of s= 1. 37 are totally different between before and after inundation. An area producing strong shearing is observed at around the bankfull level in the crossover region for overbank flows. These unique phenomena are introduced by horizontal interaction between the main channel flow and the flood plain flow at that level. Consequently, despite their geometrical similarities, dominant mechanism for compound meandering flow is dissimilar to that for straight compound flow...|$|E
40|$|A {{battery of}} histochemical stains {{was used to}} {{differentiate}} the <b>component</b> <b>fibre</b> populations in rat superior oblique muscle. Seven histochemical fibre types were identified and found to be comparable to those observed in a prior light and electron microscopic study of the muscle. The global region of the muscle contained three singly innervated fibre populations (pale, intermediate and red) and one of multiply innervated fibres. THe global singly innervated fibre populations produced a spectrum of fibre types with trichrome, succinate dehydrogenase and Sudan black. The overlying orbital surface layer contained two populations of singly innervated fibres and an additional population of multiply innervated fibres. All the singly innervated fibres (both global and orbital) exhibited a high mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and a low mATPase activity at pH 4. 6. The global multiply innervated fibres had low mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and high mATPase activity at pH 4. 6. The multiply innervated fibres of the orbital surface layer exhibited high mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and at pH 4. 6. The global multiply innervated fibres {{are similar to the}} tonic fibres found in amphibian muscle, both histochemically and ultrastructurally. Based upon their histochemical reactivities with the various stains, the multiply innervated fibres of the orbital surface layer appear to be faster acting than the global multiply innervated fibres. Furthermore, it is postulated that the former have polyneuronal innervation and are capable of dual mATPase synthesis...|$|E

These fibres {{have been used as}} the basis of a novel dosimeter architecture whereby the optical fibre acts as both the sensing and light guiding <b>component.</b> <b>Fibres</b> were fabricated from a commercially acquired glass and irradiated using a 90 Sr/ 90 Y source. Following optical stimulation with a 532 nm laser, optically stimulated luminescence of 483 ± 18 cnts/g/μJ was detected. In addition to OSL, scintillation of 6155 ± 78 cnts/s was also measured. A linear response between 0. 16 - 2 Gy of irradiation was measured, after which the intensity was observed to plateau. These results indicate the potential suitability of fluoride phosphate optical fibres for radiation sensing applications. Christopher A. G. Kalnins, Heike Ebendorff-Heidepriem, Nigel A.

40|$|The {{favourable}} effect that fibres provide at concrete crack initiation and propagation is especially notable in structures of high redundant supports, {{such is the}} case of concrete infrastructures surrounded by soil. If the design of these concrete structures is governed by crack width restrictions, fibre reinforced concrete is even a more competitive solution, since the stress redistribution provided by fibres bridging the micro-cracks allows the formation of diffuse crack patterns of reduced crack width. If these structures are precast with high strength concrete, and composed by thin walled <b>components,</b> <b>fibres</b> can effectively replace the total conventional transversal reinforcement, as well as a significant percentage of flexural reinforcement, resulting high competitive structures in economic and functional terms. However, to assess the fibre reinforcement benefits in this type of engineering problems, the concrete post-cracking behaviour and the soil-structure interaction behaviour need to be modelled as accurately as possible. In this paper, a FEM-based model is briefly developed and applied to box culvert structures. The model is described and a preliminary application is analysed.

40|$|International audienceActive bending {{structures}} need {{materials with}} specific mechanical properties such as large admissible strain and sufficiently high stiffness to prevent buckling. This paper proposes {{to investigate the}} materials {{that could be used}} following Ashby's selection method. Then it focuses on the most affordable materials which are glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) and natural fibre reinforced polymers (NFRP). As the initial selection is based on short term characteristics, the long term behaviour of fibre reinforced polymers is then addressed based on recent durability studies which are needed to ensure the performance, reliability and safety of a structure. It is shown that, depending on the loading type (tension, bending, torsion, alone or in combination [...] .) and {{on the nature of the}} <b>components</b> (<b>fibres,</b> matrix and interfaces), the material undergoes several phenomena reducing its mechanical performances and potentially leading to its failure. Finally, this knowledge of the materials, which allows for a better understanding of the specific relation between the material and the active bending structures, is used to give a framework for stress limitations and recommendations for further optimisation of reliable structures.

Data on yield, yield <b>components</b> and <b>fibre</b> properties were collected.

Seed cotton yield showed significant positive correlations with fibre fineness and fibre maturity ratio, while it had non-significant negative correlations with fibre length and strength. Positive correlations were also obtained {{for each of}} fibre fineness and maturity ratio with lint yield, lint index and ginning out-turn. On the other hand, fibre length and fibre strength exhibited negative correlations with lint yield and lint index. Fibre length and strength were positively associated {{with each other and}} negatively correlated with fibre fineness and maturity ratio. Positive correlations were obtained for fibre fineness with fibre maturity ratio. The fibre properties which had close associations with seed cotton yield and lint yield indicate that simultaneous improvement of yield and these quality characteristics is possible. However, special consideration should be given to those traits which are negatively associated with each other. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R

In this study, we assess the life cycle environmental implications of recovering carbon fibre and producing composite materials as substitutes for conventional and proposed lightweight materials in automotive applications (e. g., steel, aluminium, virgin carbon fibre). Key parameters for the recycled carbon fibre materials, including fibre volume fraction and fibre alignment, are investigated to identify beneficial uses of recycled carbon fibre in the automotive sector. Recycled carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>components</b> can achieve the lowest life cycle environmental impacts of all materials considered, although the actual impact is highly dependent on the design criteria (λ value) of the specific component. Low production impacts associated with recycled carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>components</b> are observed relative to lightweight competitor materials (e. g., aluminium, virgin carbon fibre reinforced plastic).

The nanoclay chosen is an organically modified montmorillonite clay, Cloisite 25 A. The effect of each additive system is analysed {{in terms of its}} ability to maximise both filament tensile properties relative to 100 % PA 6 and flame retardant behaviour of knitted fabrics in a vertical orientation. None of the AlPi-containing formulations achieved self-extinguishability, although the presence of nanoclay promoted lower burning and melt dripping rates. The AS/DP-containing formulations with total flame retardant levels of 5. 5 wt % or less showed far superior properties and with nanoclay, showed fabric extinction times ≤ 39 s and reduced melt dripping. The tensile and flammability results, supported by thermogravimetric analysis, have been interpreted in terms of the mechanism of action of each flame retardant/nanoclay type...|$|R
