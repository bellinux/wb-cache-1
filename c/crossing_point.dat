50|$|When {{we leave}} a few marbles {{on the first}} profile at point E, they {{distribute}} themselves on the plane showing preferential movements towards point B. However, if we apply the second profile {{when some of the}} marbles have <b>crossed</b> the <b>point</b> C, but none have <b>crossed</b> <b>point</b> D, we will end up having most marbles back at point E (where we started from initially) but some also in the valley towards point A given sufficient time for the marbles to roll to the valley. Then we again apply the first profile and repeat the steps (points C, D and E now shifted one step to refer to the final valley closest to A). If no marbles <b>cross</b> <b>point</b> C before the first marble <b>crosses</b> <b>point</b> D, we must apply the second profile shortly before the first marble <b>crosses</b> <b>point</b> D, to start over.|$|R

5|$|In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative <b>crossing</b> <b>point,</b> and established a bridgehead. This <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki, the far left formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April.|$|E
5|$|The river {{crossing}} was unopposed until 08:00, when the defending force launched a mortar {{attack against the}} <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b> Nonetheless, the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade cleared the river by 09:00 that morning and reached Stankovac.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article elaborates on the <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of the frequency–wavenumber {{branches}} for the symmetric and anti-symmetric Lamb modes in {{a homogeneous}} plate. It is shown both theoretically {{as well as}} experimentally that at these <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> either the normal or the longitudinal components of modal displacement attain an extreme value, i. e. a maximum or it vanishes. This behavior is assessed herein using a method due to Mindlin, who showed that the dispersion curves for a plate with mixed boundary conditions – which are associated with uncoupled shear and dilatational modes – provide bounds to the spectral lines of the free plate. Therefore, {{a subset of the}} <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of the symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb modes for a free plate coincide with the <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> for a plate with mixed boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the following question: Where {{and how often}} do distinct probability density functions cross? For example, what {{can be said about}} <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> between normal and Student’s t or chi-square densi-ties, respectively, and what are the asymptotic <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> if the degrees of freedom tend to infinity? <b>Crossing</b> <b>points</b> are especially of interest if, for instance, the normal is used as an approximation according to the central limit theorem because they determine the total variation distance and the areas of over- and underestimation of actual probabilities. They are strongly related to the behavior of the density ratio, a ubiquitous quantity in many fields of statistics like Neyman-Pearson or decision theory. We discuss sev-eral examples with respect to the standard normal density ϕ and provide elegant and appealing limiting forms for asymptotic <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of ϕ with respect to densities of standardized sums appearing in the central limit theorem. Finally, we derive and investigate the <b>crossing</b> <b>points</b> of ϕ with the t-density with ν degrees of freedom...|$|R

5|$|The optimal <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> {{ran over}} Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon {{in the middle}} of their area. The company offered the {{authorities}} free land on the condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E
5|$|The {{services}} are {{named after the}} nearby Watford Gap, a <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> of the limestone ridge {{just north of the}} village of Watford; the name is unrelated to the town of Watford in Hertfordshire. Watford Gap is considered by some to be on a dividing line that separates {{the north and the south}} of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} that grew to become Banagher, originated at a ford {{on the east}} bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this <b>crossing</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

5|$|The town of Bristol {{was settled}} {{at some time}} in the Anglo-Saxon period on the {{northern}} or Mercian side of a <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> of the River Avon, at or near to the present Bristol Bridge.

5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and walled towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E
5|$|Banagher is an {{important}} <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> on the River Shannon and consequently experiences a large volume of through traffic. Two regional roads meet in Banagher; the R356, which links the N62 and N65 national primary roads and is known as Harbour Street in Banagher and the R439 which links Birr with Banagher and is known as Main Street in Banagher. Harbour Street leads to the road to Shannon Harbour and Main Street begins at the hill at the southern entrance to the town and leads down to the bridge crossing the Shannon.|$|E

5|$|Before the English {{built the}} town of Conwy, Aberconwy Abbey, the site was {{occupied}} by a Cistercian monastery favoured by the Welsh princes. The location also controlled an important <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> over the River Conwy between the coastal and inland areas of North Wales, that Deganwy Castle for many years had defended. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied {{for control of the}} region since the 1070s and the conflict had resumed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282.|$|E
5|$|The HV 102nd Infantry Brigade {{arrived at}} the Sisak OG AOR on 11 December 1992, and was ordered to {{undertake}} the offensive on the same evening, at about 20:00, leaving no time for any preparation or reconnaissance. A reconnaissancesabotage detachment of the HV Glina Battalion and the special police force were ferried across the Kupa River {{on the night of}} 11/12 December, capturing the village of Stankovac and preparing to support the 102nd Infantry Brigade at the river crossing. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion completed a <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> in the village of Šišinec by 4:00 and the lead elements of the 102nd Infantry Brigade crossed the Kupa River a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E

5|$|The task {{of taking}} Villa Rogatti, the westernmost <b>crossing</b> <b>point,</b> {{was given to}} Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). Having {{conducted}} reconnaissance on their objective during the night of 5 December 1943, an attack plan was devised by the battalion's commander—Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Bethel Ware—detailing the objectives of all four rifle companies. Once the objectives had been secured by the early morning of 6 December, Anglo-Canadian reinforcements were to be moved into Villa Rogatti, {{with the intention of}} repulsing the expected potentially strong German counterattacks. Elements of three German regiments—the 200th and 361st Panzergrenadier, and 26th Panzer—maintained strong defences within the town.|$|E
5|$|The third British {{airborne}} mission planned was Operation Fustian, to {{be carried}} out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, and scheduled for the night of 13–14 July. The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the Simeto River, south of Catania. The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance. Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|Two recent discoveries {{indicate}} probable {{very early}} settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, {{the remains of}} a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. Dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural <b>crossing</b> <b>point</b> where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.|$|E
