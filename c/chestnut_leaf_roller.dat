Caterpillars of the Brazilian skipper butterfly (Calpodes ethlius), {{also known as the}} larger canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> cut the leaves and roll them over to live inside while pupating and eating the leaf. [...] In addition, caterpillars of the lesser canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Geshna cannalis), a grass moth, will sew the leaves shut before they can unfurl by spinning a silk thread around the leaf. The resultant leaf damage can be distressing to a gardener.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> significantly improved the survival of mealybugs in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at the University of Maiduguri to compared the efficacies of selected aqueous plant extracts on {{the management of the}} population of eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Eublemma olivacea Wlk.) infesting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). The extracts were from neem leaf; bitter melon; black current; ginger rhizome and wild onion. They were compared with a conventional insecticide, Lambdacot 500 EC and the absolute control. Extracts were applied at 5 % w/v while Lambdacot was applied at 1. 5 g a. i/ha. The results indicated that the mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> in treated plots were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the control. The highest mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> was 3. 01 and 3. 93. Lambdacot 500 EC had the lowest eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> counts per plant followed by neem, ginger rhizome and wild onion. The mean number of leaves damaged per plant followed similar trend. There was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield in the decreasing order of Lambdacot 500 EC, neem, wild onion, bitter melon and black current. The absolute control had the fewest number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield. These aqueous extracts should be adopted by eggplant farmers as they are cost effective and friendly to the environment. However, the actual quantities of these extracts to be applied per plant depending on the variety of eggplant, season and weather condition of the cropping season and canopy architecture remain to be critically explored...|$|R

40|$|Due to metastatic {{potential}} and drug resistance, cancer stem cells (CSCs) {{have become a}} critical target {{for the development of}} chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies showed that CSCs highly express NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) -mediated antioxidant enzymes and thereby retain relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since anticancer agents usually utilize ROS as an arsenal for killing cancer cells, we hypothesized that inhibition of Nrf 2 activity could increase the sensitivity of CSCs to anticancer drugs, and thus enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. We found that MCF- 7 -derived CSCs with a CD 44 high/CD 24 low phenotype formed mammospheres and highly expressed Nrf 2 compared to the adherent parental MCF- 7 cells. In a separate experiment, we screened 89 different edible plant extracts for inhibitory activity against the Nrf 2 signaling pathway by using an antioxidant response element (ARE) -luciferase assay system. Among those extracts, Castanea crenata (<b>chestnut)</b> <b>leaf</b> extract significantly decreased the nuclear translocation of Nrf 2 and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes in MCF- 7 -derived CSCs. The combined treatment of the CSCs with <b>chestnut</b> <b>leaf</b> extract and paclitaxel resulted in more effective cell death than the treatment with paclitaxel alone. These findings suggest that the <b>chestnut</b> <b>leaf</b> extract or its constituents could increase the susceptibility of breast CSCs to an anticancer drug, paclitaxel, through inhibition of the Nrf 2 signaling pathway, and could be utilized as an adjuvant for chemotherapy...|$|R

The horse chestnut leaves (Aesculus hippocastanum (L.)) were collected in November and stored after air drying under dry and dark conditions and at room temperature until use (20 °C[*]±[*] 2 °C). Whole horse chestnut leaves were used as food to maintain the organisms in the laboratory (pre-experimental feeding).
