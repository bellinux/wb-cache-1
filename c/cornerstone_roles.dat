Although several notations {{have been}} {{proposed}} to specify them, the kind of formal and tool support they provide is quite limited. In this paper we explore the use of Maude as a formal notation for describing models and metamodels. Maude is an executable rewriting logic language specially well suited for the specification of object-oriented open and distributed systems. We show how Maude offers a simple, natural, and accurate way of specifying models and metamodels, and offers good tool support for reasoning about them. In particular, we show how some basic operations on models, such as model subtyping, type inference, and metric evaluation, can be easily specified and implemented in Maude, and made available in development environments such as Eclipse. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Domain {{specific}} languages (DSLs) play a <b>cornerstone</b> <b>role</b> in Model-Driven Software Development for representing {{models and}} metamodels. DSLs are usually defined {{only in terms}} of their abstract and concrete syntaxes, although this hampers the development of formal analysis and simulation tools. In this paper we advocate the use of in-place model transformations to complement metamodels (the structural aspects of a DSL) with timed behavioral specifications. In particular, we propose an extension for in-place transformation rules to state action properties (not only model element properties), and to model time-dependent behavior. This approach avoids making unnatural changes to the DSL metamodels to represent behavioral and time aspects, and allows the resulting specifications to be translated into different semantic domains, such as Real-Time Maude, making them amenable to simulation and other kinds of formal analysis. ...|$|R

Unfortunately, a quick and easy way to check the correctness of model transformations is still missing, which compromises their quality (and in turn, the quality of the target models generated from them). In this paper we propose a lightweight and efficient method that performs a static analysis of the ATL rules with respect to two correctness properties we define: (1) weak executability, which determines if there is some scenario in which an ATL rule can be safely applied without breaking the target metamodel integrity constraints; and (2) coverage, which ensures a set of ATL rules allow addressing all elements of the source and target metamodels.

So far, {{most of the}} MDE community efforts {{have focused on the}} specification of the functional properties of systems. However, the correct and complete specification of some of their non-functional properties is critical in many important distributed application domains, such as embedded systems, multimedia applications or e-commerce services. In this paper we present an approach to specify QoS requirements, based on the observation of the system actions and of the state of its objects. We show how this approach can be used to extend languages which specify behavior in terms of rules, and how QoS characteristics can be easily expressed and reused across models. We show as well how this approach enables the specification of other important properties of systems, such as automatic reconfiguration of the system when some of the QoS properties change. ...|$|R

In this article, we propose a model that measures the fuzzy atomicity of a composite service based on transactional properties and on the checkpointing mechanism, relaxing the ”all-or-nothing” property into a new a fuzzy ”all-something-or-(almost) nothing” property.

So far, we know that GLP- 1 is secreted by the direct actions of luminal contents on the L cells in distal jejunum and proximal ileum. However, there is growing evidence now, which suggest that other mechanism via "neural" or "upper gut" signals may be playing a second fiddle and could stimulate GLP- 1 secretion even before the luminal contents have reached into the proximities of L cells. Therefore, the contribution of direct and indirect mechanism to GLP- 1 secretion remains elusive. Furthermore, no clear consensus exists about the pattern of GLP- 1 secretion, although many believe it is monophasic. One of the most exciting issues in incretin science is GLP- 1 level and GLP- 1 responsiveness. It is not exactly known as to what happens to endogenous GLP- 1 with progressive worsening of dysglycemia from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose to frank diabetes and furthermore with increasing duration of diabetes. Although, conventional wisdom suggests {{that there may be a}} decrease in endogenous GLP- 1 level with the worsening of dysglycemia, literature showed discordant results. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence to suggest that GLP- 1 response can vary with ethnicity. This mini review is an attempt to put a brief perspective on all these issues...|$|R
40|$|The ACID {{transaction}} {{model has}} played a <b>cornerstone</b> <b>role</b> in service composition to guarantee that composite services (CSs) have transactional support and consistent outcomes even in presence of failures. However, the classical ACID properties are too restrictive for independent and multi-proprietors services running on distributed environments, such clouds. Transactional properties allow a relaxed atomicity and isolation, providing an “all-or-(almost) nothing” model. In previous works, we proposed a model to relax atomicity, called fuzzy atomicity, according user requirements (acceptable fuzzy atomicity). In this article, we extend that model and propose an approach to measure the fuzzy atomicity. Our model allows to self-adapt the CS execution, {{taking into account the}} state of the CS execution and user preferences (ie, the acceptable fuzzy atomicity expressed in the user requirements). This fuzzy atomicity measure is applied in a self-adaptive CS execution model based on the transactional properties (pivot, compensatable, and retriable) of its component services and on a checkpointing mechanism. It is suitable to cloud computing, which offers cloud services on demand and in which CS execution should preserve the self-organizing and self-adaptivity properties of such environment, specially in the presence of failures. We show how it is possible to relax the retriable property in CSs execution, based on our fuzzy atomicity model. Additionally, in this work, we present a comparative analysis of the most recent works in the context of ACID properties relaxation for CS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) {{constitute}} an enormous burden for the society. The {{aim of the}} present study was to detect, document, assess and report the suspected ADRs and preparation of guidelines to minimize the incidence of ADRs. Methods: A prospective-observational study was conducted in the Department of General Medicine of a tertiary care hospital for 12 months from April 2008 to March 2009. Detected and suspected ADRs were analyzed for causality, se-verity and preventability using appropriate validated scales and were reported. ADR alert card was prepared and given to patients. Therapeutic guidelines were prepared and given to the relevant departments. Results: A total of 57 ADRs were detected, documented, assessed and reported during the study period the incidence was found to be 1. 8 %. Assessment of severity of the suspected ADRs revealed that 12 % of suspected ADRs were se-vere and 49 % of ADRs were moderate in severity. Causality assessment was done which revealed 63 % of ADRs were possibly drug-related. The majority of patients who had suffered from ADRs were above 60 years (56 %). Gastrointesti-nal system was most commonly affected (37 %) and the drug class mostly associated with ADRs was antibiotics (23 %). Preventability of ADRs was assessed; and the results revealed that 28 % of ADRs were definitely preventable. Conclusions: Measures to improve detection and reporting of adverse drug reactions by all health care professionals is recommended to be undertaken, to ensure, and improve patient′s safety.

However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their Validation and Verification (V&V), which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In order to fill this gap, we propose two complementary meta-model V&V languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, as it enables the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-) correctness. The second one is directed to express and verify expected properties of a meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. As a proof of concept, we have developed tooling for both languages in the Eclipse platform, and illustrate its use within an example-driven approach for meta-model construction. The expressiveness of our languages is demonstrated by their application to build a library of meta-model quality issues, which has been evaluated over the ATL zoo of meta-models and some OMG specifications. The results show that integrated support for meta-model V&V (as the one we propose here) is urgently needed in meta-modelling environments.

40|$|The role of {{nutrients}} {{and their impact}} on primary productivity and the fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 over glacial-interglacial periods are intensely debated. One of the <b>cornerstones</b> is the <b>role</b> of phosphorus (P; in the form of phosphate). Suggestions as to the importance of P evolved from an earlier proposal that P actively participated in changing productivity rates and therefore climate change, to the most recent one that changes in the glacial ocean inventory of phosphorus were small and not influential if compared to other macronutrients, such as nitrogen. Using new data coming from a selection of ODP sites, we illustrate oceanic P sedimentary phases distribution and reactive P burial fluxes, and we show how P burial fluxes changed over the last glacial-interglacial period. Concentrations of reactive P are generally lower during glacial times, while mass accumulation rates (MAR) show higher variability. On a global scale, glacial burial fluxes of reactive P are lower than those during interglacial periods by 7 – 10 %, because lack of burial of reactive P on the glacial reduced shelf was apparently not compensated by burial in other regions of the ocean. Using the calculated changes in P burial, we try to infer their possible impact on the phosphate inventory in the world oceans. Using a simple mathematical approach, we find that these changes alone could have increased the phosphate inventory of glacial ocean waters by 20 – 40 % compared to interglacial stages. Variations in the C/P reactive ratios and in the P sedimentary phases distribution at the investigated sites seem to indicate that at the onset of interglacial stages, shallower sites experienced an increase in reactive P concentrations. This seems to point to P-richer waters at glacial terminations, supporting the shelf-nutrient hypothesis and giving phosphorus a role as a potential player in climate change...|$|R
