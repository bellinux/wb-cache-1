40|$|The small throw fault zones {{cause serious}} {{problems}} for mining engineers. The {{knowledge about the}} range of fractured zone around the roadway and about roadway’s contour deformations helps a lot with the right support design or its reinforcement. The paper {{presents the results of}} numerical analysis of the effect of a small throw fault zone on the <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> the mining <b>roadway</b> and the extent of the fracturing induced around the roadway. The computations were performed on a dozen physical models featuring various parameters of rock mass and support for the purpose to select the settings that reflects most suitably the behavior of tectonically disturbed and undisturbed rocks around the roadway. Finally, the results of the calculations were verified by comparing them with in situ convergence measurements carried out in the maingate D- 2 in the “Borynia-Zofiówka-Jastrzębie” coal mine. Based on the results of measurements it may be concluded that the rock mass displacements around a roadway section within a fault zone during a year were four times in average greater than in the section tectonically unaffected. The results of numerical calculations show that extent of the yielding zone in the roof reaches two times the throw of the fault, in the floor 3 times the throw, and horizontally approx. 1. 5 to 1. 8 times the width of modelled fault zone. Only a few elasto-plastic models or models with joints between the rock beds can be recommended for predicting the performance <b>of</b> a <b>roadway</b> which is within a fault zone. It is possible, using these models, to design the <b>roadway</b> support <b>of</b> sufficient load bearing capacity at the tectonically disturbed section...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the procedures for design of supports and stabilization {{measures in the}} roadways. The procedures {{are based on the}} system developed in Ostrava-Karvina coal basin in Czech Republic. The calculation of load bearing capacity <b>of</b> <b>roadway</b> supports contains the period <b>of</b> <b>roadway</b> construction and mining in the vicinities, based {{on the size of the}} natural rock arch. The loading of supports during mining comes from a stress wave in the rock mass in the forefront of coalface and the caving area of mined-out panel. The input data for the calculation method are deduced according to in-situ measurements <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> and displacement in the roadways...|$|R
30|$|The latest {{statistical}} data (Pan et al. 2013) show that 87  % of the rockbursts occurred in roadways in China. Comparing with the 72.6  % in previous statistics (Dou and He 2001), this proportion saw certain increase. Therefore, rockburst researches should {{be focused on}} the prevention and control <b>of</b> <b>roadway</b> damage. The strong–soft–strong structure provides favorable guidance for the prevention <b>of</b> <b>roadway</b> rockburst. This structure is based on the recognition on the burst failure mechanism <b>of</b> <b>roadway,</b> that is, the propagation and disturbance of seismic stress wave generated by mine tremors is a key factor for the burst failure <b>of</b> <b>roadway.</b> As the total stress (due to the superposition of the seismic stress wave and the stress field <b>of</b> <b>roadway</b> surrounding) surpasses the bearing limit <b>of</b> surrounding supports, <b>roadway</b> rockburst is prone to be induced. The strong–soft–strong structure is proposed by Gao et al. (Gao 2006; Gao et al. 2008) and has been researched profoundly and comprehensively.|$|R
