However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki's true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi's army. As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight against Tobi. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed horrible deeds since Rin's death to destroy the world order that allowed their friend's demise to occur with Kakashi being left greatly stunned and also horrified at Obito's actions. Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi managing to impale Obito.

Relieving suffering of each individual is a principal goal of health team. It seems that chronic process of disease and numerous physical problems, along with psychological, social and economical problems in the chemical victims, each can by itself involves a source of suffering in this group of patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify chemical victims' experiences of the Iran-Iraq war in terms of nature and structure of suffering sources. Methods: This is a qualitative study with phenomenological method. Twelve military chemical victims were selected based on purposive sampling with the maximum variety. The study data were gathered through in-depth and non-structured interviews and, thus were analyzed by “Parse” method. Results: The findings of this study are summarized in these core concepts: “Suffering as a value resource”, “Physical problems as a source of suffering”, “society as a source of suffering”, “The economic problems as a source of suffering”, “Disturbance in family comfort as a source of suffering”. Conclusions: Participants' experiences reflect that victims need to be understood by health team, officials and members of the society. Moreover, some steps can be taken to reduce the suffering including increasing social respect, supporting family clubs. Also providing other social supports such as educational programs to improve their <b>caring</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and offering appropriate facilities proportionate with needs of victims can be mentioned...|$|R

2500|$|... "Any {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} evolution of slavery in Polyergus must account both for the origin of group raiding with brood capture, and for non-independent colony foundation by queens". Topoff gives an adequate hypothesis to {{the evolution of}} Polyergus by integrating three processes: queen takeover, olfactory imprinting, and territorial fighting. Here are his main points. A free-living ancestor of Polyergus, that is a scavenger, would band together with others for intraspecific contest. Occasionally a queen would invade colonies of Formica. Initially the queen would drive off the Formica queen and workers and appropriated the Formica pupae (he gives as example the queens of Formica wheeleri that do this now). The killing of the Formica queen and adoption by the workers would evolve from this. His previous work (which was presented earlier) shows what would have evolved for adaptation to occur: [...] "(1) sharp mandibles for killing the Formica queen, (2) a pheromone that reduces aggression from resident workers, (3) a tendency to hold onto the dead Formica queen long enough to absorb her odors...". The next step would be olfactory imprinting between the two species, a consequence of living one’s life from start to finish in the presence of both species. Polyergus’ ancestor then forages and encounters a colony of the same species. Again, they recruit nestmates to a territorial raid. In a brilliant insight, Topoff suggest this trait explains the raiding behavior. The Polyergus worker, raised by Formica as conspecifics, [...] "identifies individual of Formica as belonging to its own species, another territorial raid is incited. Thus from the standpoint of Polyergus... slave raids are equivalent to territorial raids". The captured brood is imprinted as well and they become workers in the original nest. As time went on [...] "Our ancestral Polyergus could easily slide in the direction of facultative parasitism". Eventually, Polyergus ancestors lost the ability to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and become the inquiline Polyergus we see today.|$|E
