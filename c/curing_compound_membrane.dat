Application of a liquid membrane-forming <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> is among the most widely used curing methods for concrete pavements and bridge decks. <b>Curing</b> <b>compounds</b> are economical, easy to apply, and maintenance free. However, limited research has been done to investigate the effectiveness of different <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> and their application technologies. No reliable standard testing method is available {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} curing, especially of the field concrete curing. The present research investigates the effects of <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> materials and application technologies on concrete properties, especially on the properties of surface concrete. This report presents a literature review of curing technology, with an emphasis on <b>curing</b> <b>compounds,</b> and the experimental results from the first part of this research—lab investigation. In the lab investigation, three <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> were selected and applied to mortar specimens at three different times after casting. Two application methods, single- and double-layer applications, were employed. Moisture content, conductivity, sorptivity, and degree of hydration were measured at different depths of the specimens. Flexural and compressive strength of the specimens were also tested. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between these material properties. The research results indicate that application of a <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> significantly increased moisture content and degree of cement hydration and reduced sorptivity of the near-surface-area concrete. For given concrete materials and mix proportions, optimal application time of <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> depended primarily upon the weather condition.

Among all test methods applied, the sorptivity test is the most sensitive one to provide good indication for the subtle changes in microstructure of the near-surface-area concrete caused by different curing materials and application methods.

Increasing the delay between concrete finishing steps and MFC application should serve to lessen scaling damage. However, there is currently no literature that sought to quantify a possible linkage between MFCC application time and the scaling resistance. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the influence of MFCC application time on the freeze-thaw scaling damage resistance of roadway concrete made with materials native to Wisconsin. A factorial experiment was designed to probe the effect of MFCC application time on scaling damage as measured by ASTM C 672. Three emulsion-based <b>curing</b> <b>compounds,</b> Linseed Oil, Wax, and Poly-alpha-methyl-styrene (PAMS) were evaluated at three application times on concrete specimens prepared with one of two sources of coarse aggregate and one of three cementitious materials. An Acrylic solvent-based sealing compound was evaluated at two application times with respect to concrete scaling resistance. Untreated specimens from each mix type were cured in a wet room and tested as controls. A secondary goal of this project was to evaluate a new method for determining the presence of bleed water on a concrete surface by constructing a device to detect changes in the relative humidity of the air above the concrete surface over time to more reliably determine the cessation of the bleeding than current methods. To achieve this goal, a device was built and its operational capability was tested during the study. ii Concrete mixes were designed and specimens were prepared according to WISDOT procedures to provide a good representation of the pavements within Wisconsin. Freeze-thaw scaling damage testing was performed on all specimens and data was recorded following the appropriate testing standard. Properties such as fresh concrete slump, air content, 28 -day compressive strength, and <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> application rates were measured and recorded to ensure compliance with WISDOT standards. Results in this study indicate that the influence of MFCC application time on the scaling resistance of concrete is dependent upon the compound chosen. The Linseed Oil and Acrylic formulations displayed significantly increased scaling resistance with an increase in application time. The Wax and PAMS formulations did not display significant increases in scaling resistance with an increase in application time. Results from the untreated wet room cured specimens indicate that <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> do not promote scaling resistance levels that compare favorably to the humidity control method wet room curing. Scaling resistance was also found to be dependent upon composition of the concrete, especially with respect to the coarse aggregate and cementitious material choice.

Results showed that <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> will improve the salt-scaling resistance of concrete containing a fly ash that only marginally exhibits salt scaling. However, the salt-scaling performance of concrete that contains fly ash from a source that performs poorly in ASTM C 672 is not markedly improved by using a <b>curing</b> <b>compound.</b> Additionally, results showed that salt-scaling resistance of concrete containing fly ash performs better when the total paste volume is not increased by the addition of fly ash to the mixture. The Kansas Outdoor Concrete Exposure Site (KOCE) at the Kansas State University Civil Infrastructure Systems Laboratory (CISL) was constructed to compare laboratory results to actual field conditions in the future. The site was developed based on experiences from the University of Texas-Austin outdoor exposure site and the CANMET exposure site in Ottawa, Canada. Alika silica reaction blocks were made to develop the procedure for future concrete durability testing at KOCE...|$|R

Mercury content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The highest concentration of mercury in raw materials (beef, pork, pork bacon) was detected in beef from foreign production. Increasing concentrations of mercury was found after the addition of additives, spices and <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> causing a threefold increase in {{the concentration of}} mercury in final products...|$|R
40|$|Fly ash is a {{by-product}} of coal-fired power plants. This material {{can be used as}} a partial cement substitute in portland cement concrete. Use of fly ash can improve concrete durability as well as utilize an industrial by-product that would otherwise be discarded in landfills. However, research on fly ash concrete has shown that in some cases, concrete with high volumes of fly ash can have deicer salt scaling problems. Salt-scaling is the flaking of a concrete surface that when severe enough may result in lower skid resistance and service life of the concrete. In this study, concrete mixtures with six different fly ashes were tested in a laboratory using the ASTM C 672 standard. <b>Curing</b> <b>compound,</b> a wax-based coating sprayed on the fresh concrete surface to reduce evaporation, was used to compare the effects of curing on salt scaling of concrete containing high volumes of fly ash. Different variables measured were the type of fly ash, curing conditions, and total paste volume included in the mix. Results showed that <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> will improve the salt-scaling resistance of concrete containing a fly ash that only marginally exhibits salt scaling. However, the salt-scaling performance of concrete that contains fly ash from a source that performs poorly in ASTM C 67...|$|R
40|$|The cell {{envelope}} of Halobacterium halobium {{was seen in}} thin sections of permanganate-fixed cells to consist of one membrane. This membrane appeared mostly as a unit membrane but in a few preparations it resembled a 5 -layered <b>compound</b> <b>membrane.</b> The cell {{envelope of}} Halobacterium salinarium at high resolution was always seen as a 5 - 1 ayered structure different in appearance from the apparent <b>compound</b> <b>membrane</b> of H. halobium. The "envelopes" which were isolated in 12. 5 per cent NaCI from each organism were indistinguishable {{from each other in}} the electron microscope and comprised, in each case, a single unit membrane with an over-all thickness of about 110 A. Some chemical analyses were made of isolated membranes after freeing them from salt by precipitating and washing with trichloroacetic acid. Such precipitated membranes consisted predominantly of protein, with little carbohydrate and no peptido-aminopolysaccharide (mucopeptide). Sectioned whole cells of H. halobium contained intracellular electron-opaque structures of unknown function...|$|R
40|$|Cells of Chondrococcus columnaris were {{sectioned}} and {{examined in the}} electron microscope after fixation by two different methods. After fixation with osmium tetroxide alone, the surface layers of the cells consisted of a plasma membrane, a dense layer (mucopeptide layer), and an outer unit membrane. The outer membrane appeared distorted and was widely separated {{from the rest of}} the cell. The intracytoplasmic membranes (mesosomes) appeared as convoluted tubules packaged up within the cytoplasm by a unit membrane. The unit membrane surrounding the tubules was continuous with the plasma membrane. When the cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde prior to fixation with osmium tetroxide, the outer membrane was not distorted and separated {{from the rest of the}} cell, structural elements (peripheral fibrils) were seen situated between the outer membrane and dense layer, and the mesosomes appeared as highly organized structures produced by the invagination and proliferation of the plasma membrane. The mesosomes were made up of a series of <b>compound</b> <b>membranes</b> bounded by unit <b>membranes.</b> The <b>compound</b> <b>membranes</b> were formed by the union of two unit membranes along their cytoplasmic surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) {{is highly}} {{workable}} concrete with high strength and high performance that can flow {{under its own}} weight through restricted sections without segregation and bleeding. SCC is achieved by reducing the volume ratio of aggregate to cementitious materials, increasing the paste volume and using various viscosity enhancing admixtures and superplasticizers. It is observed that the behaviour of the design concrete mix is significantly affected by variation in humidity and temperature both in fresh and hardened state. In this paper effect of three non-water-based curing techniques on mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and shear strength of M 30 grade self-compacting concrete (SCC) is discussed. For compressive strength {{it is observed that}} immersion method for curing gives maximum compressive strength while the lowest compressive strength is for no curing. Polyethylene film curing gives second highest strength at 28 days. Similarly for split tensile strength, flexural strength & shear strength, the maximum strength is also with immersion method of curing. For split tensile strength <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> gives almost at par with immersion method while no curing has least strength. Polyethylene film curing gives good results for flexural strength. For shear strength Polyethylene film gives about 82 % of immersion strength. It is concluded that although pond immersion method is best for curing, Polyethylene film and <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> can deliver more than 90 % compressive and other strengths compared to immersion method...|$|R
