5|$|Born on 14 August 1887 at Ironville, near Belper, Derbyshire, Frank Tarr was {{the only}} son of Frederick and Emma Tarr. His father was a <b>coal</b> <b>merchant.</b> He was educated at Stoneygate School, Leicester, where he began playing rugby, before moving up to Uppingham School in 1902, where he was Captain of Games and played three-quarter in the rugby team for two years, encountering a future Oxford and England {{teammate}} Ronald Poulton-Palmer playing for Rugby School. From 1906 to 1910 he read law at University College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

5|$|Dunball wharf {{was built}} in 1844 by Bridgwater <b>coal</b> <b>merchants,</b> and {{was linked to the}} Bristol and Exeter Railway by a rail track which crossed the A38. The link {{was built in}} 1876, also by <b>coal</b> <b>merchants,</b> and was {{originally}} operated as a horse-drawn tramway. In 1875, the local landowner built The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf.|$|R
25|$|In 1887, City of Adelaide {{was sold}} to Dover <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> Charles Havelock Mowll, {{for use in the}} collier trade {{carrying}} coal from the Tyne to Dover.|$|E
25|$|Born in Lyttelton on 8 May 1902, Page {{was the son}} of Olga Marguerite Smith and her husband, David Joseph Page, a {{produce and}} <b>coal</b> <b>merchant.</b> He was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School where he was a {{champion}} all-round sportsman.|$|E
25|$|That October, {{it emerged}} {{in the form of}} a new company called the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, a name which {{accurately}} reflected the physical reality of its route structure. One of the forces at work in the reorganization which engendered the BR was a Rochester <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> named Arthur Yates. Not coincidentally, Yates was the line's biggest coal shipper.|$|E
25|$|Away from cricket {{he became}} {{managing}} director of William France, Fenwick &. Co. Ltd., Fenchurch Street, London, <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> and ship owners.|$|R

25|$|The EKLR {{attracted}} no shop or pub {{to any of}} its stations. In fact, {{there is}} no evidence of any retail activity at any of them, not even a newspaper stand. Only three businesses seem to have been set up in response to the presence of a railway, all at Staple. A <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> operated there (elsewhere they stayed in the villages), and a trug basket manufacturers briefly operated in a large corrugated iron shed next to the sidings before this was taken over by a wholesale greengrocers' (C.W. Darley Ltd).|$|E
25|$|Meakin and Tinsley were {{released}} from prison on 15 December 1916. After release, Tinsley went straight back to working on the Caledonian railway as a lampman. He died in 1967. Meakin also returned to the railway, as a goods train guard. Some years later he was made redundant from that job and set himself up as a <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> trading from Quintinshill siding, {{right next to the}} scene of the crash. In the Second World War, he worked in the Gretna munitions factory until he retired due to ill health. He died in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Two coal {{companies}} {{accounted for}} the coal trade carried by the railroad. At first competitors, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company and the Bell, Lewis, and Yates Coal Mining Company became very good friends when Frederick Bell, George Lewis, and Arthur Yates took seats on the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway board of directors. In fact, with Iselin's resignation {{as president of the}} railway company, Yates took his place. The two coal companies then negotiated an agreement which eased competitive pressures and allocated access to the railroad's coal-transporting capacity. While Yates concentrated on <b>coal,</b> <b>Merchant</b> ran the railroad.|$|E
50|$|The {{village has}} been {{populated}} by Turkish <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> and Greek fishermen until the 1910s. Gradually, the original inhabitants have been evicted and Bulgarian settlers from Asia Minor coast and the Aegean Macedonia moved in.|$|R

50|$|In {{the station}} yard, {{there is another}} grade II listed {{building}} partly in random stone but mainly weather-boarded on a timber frame with a pitched slate roof. It is an early weighbridge house and <b>coal</b> <b>merchant's</b> office dating to around 1840.|$|R
25|$|U-66 left Lorient on 6 January 1943 {{for what}} was officially her seventh patrol. On 20 January, the ship landed an espionage agent {{on the coast of}} Mauritania, but the agent and two crewmen were {{immediately}} captured. Her first sinking came with the attack on the 113-ton French Joseph Elise on 1 February. On the 27th, U-66 attacked the 4,312-ton British <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> ship St. Margaret in mid-Atlantic near Bermuda, sinking her with one torpedo and, after several misses, a shell. Several survivors were captured and taken to the prison camp Marlag und Milag Nord. U-66 then returned to port, arriving on 24 March 1943.|$|E
25|$|The first Rotary Club {{was formed}} when {{attorney}} Paul P. Harris called together {{a meeting of}} three business acquaintances in downtown Chicago, United States, at Harris's friend Gustave Loehr's office in the Unity Building on Dearborn Street on February 23, 1905. In addition to Harris and Loehr (a mining engineer and freemason), Silvester Schiele (a <b>coal</b> <b>merchant),</b> and Hiram E. Shorey (a tailor) were the other two who attended this first meeting. The members chose the name Rotary because initially they rotated subsequent weekly club meetings to each other's offices, although within a year, the Chicago club became so large it became necessary to adopt the now-common practice of a regular meeting place.|$|E
25|$|The first coal to {{be shipped}} on the R went to the Rochester <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> Arthur G Yates. Such was the demand for coal that the coal {{shipments}} began well before track construction had been completed, leading to constant conflict in scheduling. By 1886, the railroad had some 4,182 freight cars, and 3,028 of them were coal cars. Of those, perhaps 500 belonged to the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company. By the mid-1880s, the railroad was running forty or more coal trains a day. Since coke was a valuable commodity, the coal company built {{a mile and a}} quarter long string of 475 coke furnaces, the largest in the world at the time, producing 22,000 tons a month, some of which was shipped out by train. Much of the coke, however, was consumed on-site in refining the iron ore brought in by lakes freighter and trans-shipped to the iron mills by the coal trains on their way back south.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, {{the council}} built Cefn Coed Road, which ran past the {{original}} (18th century, and still standing to this day), farmhouse, which allowed small builders to develop houses for <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> and exports {{who worked at}} the Coal Exchange.|$|R

6000|$|It {{was in that}} gloomy quarter called Golden-square, {{the murky}} repose of which strikes so mysteriously on the senses after the {{glittering}} bustle of the adjoining Regent-street, that Captain Armine stopped before a noble yet now dingy mansion, that in old and happier days might probably have been inhabited by his grandfather, or some of his gay friends. A brass plate on the door informed the world that here resided Messrs. Morris and Levison, following the not very ambitious calling of <b>coal</b> <b>merchants.</b> But if all the pursuers of that somewhat humble trade could manage to deal in coals with the same dexterity as Messrs. Morris and Levison, what very great <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> they would be! ...|$|R
25|$|Muybridge {{was born}} in Kingston upon Thames, in the county of Surrey in England, on 9 April 1830 to John and Susanna Muggeridge; he had three brothers. His father was a grain and <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> with {{business}} spaces {{on the ground floor}} of their house adjacent to the River Thames at No.30 High Street, and the family living in the rooms above. After his father died in 1843, his mother carried on the business. His cousin Norman Selfe who also grew up in Kingston upon Thames moved to Australia and, following a family tradition, became a renowned engineer. His great grandparents were Robert Muggeridge and Hannah Charman who were the parents of John Muggeridge (1756–1819). John and his siblings were Corn Merchants and in the City of London although all were born in Banstead, Surrey. Edwards younger brother George born in 1833 is found living with his Uncle Samuel in 1851 after the death of his Father in 1843 which establishes the lineage of Edward James Muggeridge.|$|E
500|$|North {{was born}} in Leeds, Yorkshire, on 30 January 1842, {{the son of a}} <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> and a churchwarden. [...] At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and {{engineers}} before working for several years as a mechanic. [...] He moved to Chile in South America at the age of 23 where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in Huasco. [...] He moved from Huasca to Iquique in the province of Tarapacá, which was then part of Peru. [...] Here North established what later became a large business empire, working as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.|$|E
500|$|The curate from 1823 to 1842, one John Jones, {{brought a}} {{significant}} turnaround in attendance; {{perhaps the most}} unusual innovation was a houseboat – the [...] "Boatmans' Floating Chapel" [...] – acquired in 1839, {{for use as a}} chapel serving the families working on the river and the Oxford Canal. This boat was St Thomas' first chapel of ease; it was donated by H. Ward, a local <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> and used until it sank in 1868. It was replaced by a chapel dedicated to St Nicholas that remained in use until 1892. A second chapel was built in 1860, dedicated to St Frideswide, later replaced by the new parish church of St Frideswide's, which took on the parish of New Osney in 1873.|$|E
50|$|Smallwood {{established}} himself in London in 1877 and spent his whole working {{life in the}} coal business. He was the first President of the Coal Merchants’ Federation of Great Britain from 1918-1921 and Chairman of the Society of <b>Coal</b> <b>Merchants,</b> London in 1931.|$|R
5000|$|McLennan was Manager and South Australian {{representative}} of Messers Howard W Smith and Sons and in 1900 moved to Victoria to manage its Melbourne office. [...] He later opened a Melbourne Office for <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> James and Alexander Brown of Newcastle, New South Wales.|$|R

500|$|Sargent {{was born}} in Bath Villas, Ashford, in Kent, England, to a working-class family. His father, Henry Sargent, was a <b>coal</b> <b>merchant,</b> amateur {{musician}} and part-time church organist; his mother, Agnes, [...] Hall, was the matron of a local school. Sargent {{was brought up in}} Stamford, Lincolnshire, where he joined the choir at Peterborough Cathedral, studied the organ and won a scholarship to Stamford School. At the age of 14, he accompanied rehearsals for amateur productions of The Gondoliers and The Yeomen of the Guard at Stamford. At the age of 16 he earned his diploma as Associate of the Royal College of Organists, and at 18 he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Music by the University of Durham.|$|E
500|$|So {{concerned}} was Acton for {{his reputation}} that he requested the indictments be read out in Latin, but his worries were misplaced. The government wanted an acquittal {{to protect the}} good name of the Knight Marshal, Sir Philip Meadows, who had hired John Darby as prison governor, who in turn had leased the prison to Acton. Acton's favoured prisoners had testified on his behalf, introducing contradictory evidence that the trial judge stressed to the jury. A stream of witnesses spoke of his good character, including a judge, an MP, his butcher, brewer, confectioner and solicitor—his <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> thought Acton [...] "improper for the post he was in from his too great compassion"—and he {{was found not guilty}} on all charges. The Gaols Committee had managed {{to draw attention to the}} plight of England's prisoners, but reform had eluded them.|$|E
500|$|Broderick {{joined the}} NYPD on January 16, 1923, {{and he became}} a detective third grade on April 2 of that year, obtaining {{in less than four}} months a {{promotion}} that would usually take five years. [...] The New York Herald Tribune [...] called his swift appointment as detective [...] "extraordinary luck or influence or both." [...] He continued to rise rapidly in rank. He was promoted to detective second grade in May 1925 and detective first grade in March 1926. The Daily News reported years later that [...] "no few of Detective Broderick's contemporaries [...] that he plainly had an angel somewhere in the city." [...] In 1934 it was reported that before joining the police department he was a chauffeur for a <b>coal</b> <b>merchant</b> who was close to chief inspector William J. Lahey, who was believed to be Broderick's sponsor in the department.|$|E
50|$|The {{site and}} CLR were {{taken over by}} <b>coal</b> <b>merchants</b> Cory Brothers Ltd of Cardiff to build an oil storage depot, with Kynochtown renamed Coryton.
