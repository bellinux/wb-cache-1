25|$|The {{magnitude}} and sign of both those parameters {{are controlled by}} the base current : since both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are inversely biased in the quiescent state, the equivalent circuit of the base input is simply a <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> shunted by base-emitter and base-collector junction capacitances and is therefore not analyzed in what follows.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze wave {{scattering}} from a conducting body surrounded by random media, we defined <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> as an operator that transforms incident waves into surface currents on the body. <b>Current</b> <b>generators</b> are usually {{expressed in terms}} of the inverse matrix of which each element is the inner product of basis functions called sometimes modal functions. If the body is a cylinder with circular or elliptic cross-section, the basis functions can be chosen to be orthogonal ones and the inverse matrix becomes diagonal one; consequently, <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> are expressed in infinite series. This paper deals with the infinite-series expressions of <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> for circular and elliptic cylinders by using cylindrical or Mathieu functions according as the circular or elliptic cross-section of cylinders. These explicit expressions are useful for the analysis of scattering problems...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E

Newly invented by Elihu Thomson, they weighed almost 30 tons each (57,887 pounds) and were 8.5 ft. These original AC generators used many DC generator components in their first design.

50|$|The total {{equivalent}} conductance of the supernode {{is the sum}} of the conductance of each branch, since all the branches are in parallel. When computing the {{equivalent conductance}} all the generators have to be switched off, so all voltage generators become short circuits and all <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> become s. That is why the resistances on the branches with <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> do not appear in the expression of the total equivalent conductance.|$|R
500|$|In an {{electrical}} network diagram, limited to linear systems, {{there are three}} passive elements: resistance, inductance, and capacitance; and two active elements: the voltage generator, and the <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> [...] The mechanical analogs of these elements {{can be used to}} construct a mechanical network diagram. [...] What the mechanical analogs of these elements are depends on what variables are chosen to be the fundamental variables. [...] There is a wide choice of variables that can be used, but most commonly used are a power conjugate pair of variables (described below) and the pair of Hamiltonian variables derived from these.|$|E

2500|$|The next new {{motive power}} to be {{acquired}} would be the EMD SD40 in 1969. These would be GTW's first six-axle locomotives and most would last on GTW {{for at least four}} decades. GTW's most dominate diesel locomotive in its fleet would be the 2,000 horsepower EMD GP38. The first GP38s were delivered in 1971 and were also the first locomotives to wear GTW's blue, red/orange and white scheme. [...] It proved to be a versatile locomotive for GTW used in switching and mainline service. [...] The GP38AC was the first version to be purchased by GTW which had an alternating current alternator instead of the typical direct <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> That followed with the acquisition of several GP38-2s into the 1980s. GTW would also purchase its new locomotives without dynamic brakes since the company did not have any significant grades on its routes. GTW also inherited several locomotives including its first 3,000 horsepower GP40-2s from its acquisition of Detroit Toledo and Ironton. It would also roster its first EMD GP7s when it obtained full ownership of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line in 1981. GTW management found it cost effective to lease or purchase second-hand diesel locomotives. It purchased several former Rock Island GP38-2s after that railroad closed in 1980. Union Pacific sold GTW several surplus former Missouri Pacific SD40-2s after it had acquired that railroad. [...] It was also common for GTW and CN to share steam and diesel locomotives when either of them was in need of extra motive power. GTW also sent diesel locomotives for use to its fellow GTC subsidiary railways Central Vermont and Duluth Winnipeg and Pacific. [...] many GTW GP38s still wear their original blue, red/orange and white paint scheme and have been found operating throughout CN's other US subsidiaries. However, since 1991 CN has gradually retired, sold or applied its own paint scheme to GTW locomotives.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Reliable {{estimation}} of the local spatial extent of neural activity {{is a key to}} the quantitative analysis of MEG sources across subjects and conditions. In association with an understanding of the temporal dynamics among multiple areas, this would represent a major advance in electrophysiological source imaging. Parametric current dipole approaches to MEG (and EEG) source localization can rapidly generate a physical model of neural <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> using a limited number of parameters. However, physiological interpretation of these models is often difficult, especially in terms of the spatial extent of the true cortical activity. In new approaches using multipolar source models [3, 5], similar problems remain in the analysis of the higher-order source moments as parameters of cortical extent. Imagebased approaches to the inverse problem provide a direct estimate of cortical <b>current</b> <b>generators,</b> but computationally expensive nonlinear methods are required to produce foca...|$|R
