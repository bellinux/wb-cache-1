40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of the first large-scale extraction and separation of metals from a complex matrix using an ionic liquid. The liquid was a deep eutectic solvent based on choline chloride. The hydrogen-bond donors were mixed to optimize solubility and fluid viscosity. It {{was found that the}} incorporation of a fine particulate dust actually decreased the viscosity of the fluid. The present paper shows that selective extraction of zinc and lead can be achieved through judicious choice of the hydrogen-bond donor and it is also shown that metals in solution can be separated using <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> powder. Electrowinning of pure zinc is demonstrated but scale-up tests suggest that the process is relatively slow and has poor current efficiency. An alternative methodology was developed to rapidly recover the zinc from solution using dilute ammonia solution. It is also shown {{for the first time that}} cementation can be efficiently carried out in ionic liquids because the recovered metal is porous and allows thick layers to be deposited...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recovery and {{separation}} of cobalt and manganese {{from one of}} zinc plant residues (ZPR), namely hot filter cake (HFC) using a hydrometallurgical process was studied. The process is carried out in four steps as follows: (1) washing zinc, (2) reductive leaching with hydrogen peroxide, (3) cadmium <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> powder and (4) separation of cobalt from manganese with beta naphthol. In this research, the separation between manganese and cobalt from the HFC using N-N reagent was investigated. The influence of several parameters on {{the course of the}} reaction such as N-N quantity, pH, temperature and reaction time was also examined. The optimum separation conditions were found to be N-N quantity: 8 times of stoichiometric value, time: 30 min, temperature: 25 °C and pH = 1. 5. Using the optimized conditions, the cobalt and manganese precipitation was nearly 99 % and 0 %, respectively. A kinetic study of manganese precipitation through N-N reagent has been carried out to assess the effect of kinetics parameters. The data obtained for the leaching kinetics indicated that the precipitation of manganese is an ash diffusion controlled reaction and the reaction activation energy is equal to 1. 4 kJ/mol...|$|E
40|$|In the {{electrolytic}} {{production of}} zinc, cobalt {{is removed from}} zinc electrolyte by <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> dust Prior to electrowinning. Although the thermodynamics for this reaction are favourable, kinetic barriers to cobalt reduction render the method impractical unless activators such as antimony or arsenic in conjunction with copper are used. There is {{a large body of}} work studying the effect of these additives, yet the mechanism by which they act is still poorly understood. Moreover, regardless of the beneficial effect of the activators, from time to time the process fails to meet the target level of 0. 1 mg/L cobalt in the purified electrolyte, with negative consequences in the electrowinning operation. Even when the target conditions are met, zinc dust consumption is excessively high: satisfactory operation requires up to 300 times the stoichiometric amount of zinc dust. In the present work the role of the antimony/copper activators was investigated in a batch cementation process using synthetic electrolyte. The objectives were to study the fundamentals of cobalt cementation in zinc sulfate electrolyte with conventional additives, to clarify the action of additives and their role in cementation, and to identify and test novel additives.

40|$|Effective {{recycling}} or {{disposal of}} flue dusts {{is a continuing}} problem for copper, brass, and bronze smelters. Over 300, 000 short tons (st) of dust is generated annually by U. S. secondary copper, brass, and bronze smelters. The Bureau of Mines has developed an alkaline leach method for recovering metal values from copper converter flue dust containing zinc, tin, lead, and copper. The dust was leached with a hot solution of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide to solubilize zno. All of the tin (as sNO 2) and the metallic copper, lead, and zinc, as well as possible insoluble compounds of each, report to the residue. Dissolved copper and lead salts are removed from the leachate by <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> granular <b>zinc.</b> Zinc oxide is precipitated by diluting the leachate with water. The tin-rich (9. 8 pct) residue has a ready market. The cement product is recyclable to the smelting operation. The zno is at least 97 pct pure and has potential marketability.

40|$|Cyanidation is {{the main}} process for gold and silver {{recovery}} from its ores. In this study, a process is proposed to recover copper and cyanide from barren solutions from the Merrill-Crowe <b>cementation</b> process <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> dust. This technology is based on inducing nucleated precipitation of copper and silver in a serpentine reactor, using sodium sulfide as the precipitator, and sulfuric acid for pH control. Results show that pH value has {{a significant effect on}} copper cyanide removal efficiency, and it was determined the optimal pH range to be 2. 5 - 3. At this pH value, the copper cyanide removal efficiency achieved was up to 97 and 99 %, when copper concentration in the influent was 636 and 900 ppm. respectively. In this process (sulphidization-acidification-thickening-HCN recycling), the cyanide associated with copper cyanide complexes, is released as HCN gas under weakly acidic conditions, allowing it to be recycled back to the cyanidation process as free cyanide. Cyanide recovery was 90 %. Finally, this procedure was successfully run at Minera William in México...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of steel in {{electric arc furnace}} (EAF) generates a by-product called EAF dusts. These steelmaking flue dusts are classified in most industrialized countries as hazardous residues because the heavy metals contained in them, tend to leach under slightly acidic rainfall conditions. However, {{and at the same}} time they contain zinc species which can be used as a source to obtain valuable by-products. The present investigation shows results on the processing of an EAF flue dust using ammonium carbonate solutions. Once zinc is dissolved: ZnO + 4 NH 3 +H 2 O → Zn(NH 3) 4 2 + + 2 OH− with other impurities (i. e. cadmium and copper), these are eliminated from the <b>zinc</b> solution via <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> metallic <b>zinc.</b> The purified zinc solution was evaporated (distilled) until precipitation of a zinc carbonate species, which then was calcined to yield a zinc oxide of a high grade. For the unattacked dust residue from the leaching operation, mainly composed of zinc ferrite, several options can be considered: back-recycling to the furnace, further treatment by sodium hydroxide processing or a more safely dumping due to its relatively inertness.

This paper deals with the reclamation of mercury from the used silver oxide quartz wristwatch batteries em-ploying leaching-cementation technique. The used batteries are first crushed to liberate the encapsulated active material from the case which is leached in nitric acid to bring all metal contents into solution. After the removal of silver in the solution as silver chloride by precipitation, the mercury which is present as Hg 2 + in the solution has been reclaimed through <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> dust. Various effects like zinc sheet and dust, zinc quantity, pH of the solution, duration and temperature have been carried out to standardise the conditions for maximum mercury reclamation. At a temperature of 45 ˚C and at 3. 9 pH, 92. 3 % of mercury was recovered using 74 µm size zinc dust with purity greater than 99. 78 % and the same is characterized by XRF and the results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Seven zinc oxide-eugenol cements with {{compressive}} strengths from 200 psi to 8, 000 psi {{were used}} for temporarily cementing completed inlays, crowns, and bridges. The effectiveness of each cement {{in a variety of}} clinical situations is presented. Cement of 1, 000 psi met the requirements of typical clinical cases most frequently. The cements of compressive strength 200, 400, 600, 2, 200, and 3, 500 psi were required in other clinical cases with sufficient frequency to justify their use. The cementation of dental restorations with zinc phosphate cement is often accom-panied by pain. It may be followed by hypersensitivity of the teeth and possible pulp death, which is caused by the irritant nature of the cement. These adverse effects of zinc phosphate cement are more decided in the extensive preparation that involves the cutting of many dentinal tubules than in the simple restoration. The effects are more noticeable in the teeth of young patients and in teeth free from previous caries or restorations. The increasing num-ber of fixed prostheses made in {{the last decade or so}} has indicated the nature of this clinical problem. Temporary cementa-tion with a sedative zinc oxide-eugenol mixture has become widely practiced to allow a period of time for reduction of the inflammation of the pulp before final <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> <b>zinc</b> phosphate. This pro-cedure has been described by Ewing, 1 Kazis and Kazis, 2 McCracken, 3 and Baraban. 4 Two clinical problems are recognized in temporary cementation of restorations...|$|E
40|$|Treball Final de Grau d'Odontologia, Facultat de Medicina i Ciències de la Salut, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2016 - 2017, Director: Rui Pedro Barbosa De FigueiredoObjectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} stainless steel explorers, waxed dental floss and teflon scalers in removing cement remnants from fixed implant restorations; To evaluate if these instruments produce surface alterations in the abutment surface. Materials and Methods: A preliminary in vitro study, involving 9 identical single-unit implant-supported crowns (upper central incisor), manufactured with CAD/CAM technology, was perfomed. After <b>cementation</b> <b>with</b> a <b>zinc</b> oxide eugenol cement, each crown was randomly allocated into 3 study groups, according to the instrument used to remove the cement remnants (teflon scaler, stainless steel explorer and waxed dental floss). An experienced professional removed the cement remnants. Afterwards, a blinded researcher evaluated the presence of cement using direct visual observation, standardized digital photographs and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images. In the latter analysis (SEM 75 x), surface alterations in the abutment surface caused by the employed instruments were also registered. A descriptive {{analysis of the data}} was performed. Results: After cementation, cement remnants were observed in all samples. The instrument that eliminated a higher percentage of cement remnants was the stainless steel explorer (59. 4 %) and the worst, the waxed dental floss (27. 6 %). The stainless steel explorer produced scratches in 100 % of the samples (5 to 10 scratches in each sample). Conclusions: Even though cement debris was observed in all samples, stainless steel explorers and teflon scalers seem to be the most effective instruments in the removal of cement remnants in implant-supported restorations. Since stainless steel explorers scratched the abutment surface, teflon scalers seem to be the best option for this particular indication. Dental floss is not a suitable alternative since it removed less cement than the other 2 instruments, and also left some material debris (small threads) over the abutment. A larger sample is required to confirm the present findings...|$|R
