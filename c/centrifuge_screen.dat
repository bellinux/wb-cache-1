40|$|The flow {{properties}} of sugar crystal beds {{and of the}} supporting screens are important in analysing {{the performance of a}} continuous sugar centrifuge separating crystals from molasses. This paper gives correlations in terms of basic measured quantities so that these resistances can be calculated. Flow through a bed of sugar crystals follows the Carman-Kozeny relation and best values are proposed for the voidage, sphericity and the Carman-Kozeny constant. The flow resistance of <b>centrifuge</b> <b>screens</b> follows the laminar flow orifice equation and a best value is given for this constant. In use, screens exhibit a much higher resistance due to 2 ̆ 7 blocking 2 ̆ 7 and values are also given for this effect...|$|R
40|$|A slide {{centrifuge}} Gram stain {{procedure was}} performed to screen for bacteriuria 4161 urine specimens submitted in urine preservative tubes for routine culture. For slide centrifuge Gram staining, each urine sample was mixed well. Thereafter, 0. 2 mL of each sample was placed, using a pipette, into a slide centrifuge chamber and centrifuged at 2, 000 rpm for 5 minutes. The slides were heat fixed, Gram stained, and read by laboratory personnel who scanned 12 consecutive oil-immersion fields using a set pattern. The presence of the same organism in six or more fields {{was defined as a}} positive urine screen. Urine samples were cultured using a 0. 001 -mL loop and a comparison of culture growth with slide <b>centrifuge</b> <b>screening</b> was made. When growth of 100, 000 or more colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 98 %, a specificity rate of 90 %, a negative predictive value of 99 %, and a positive predictive value of 65 %. When a lower colony count of 10, 000 or more CFU/mL was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 88 %, a specificity rate of 95 %, a negative predictive value of 96 %, and a positive predictive value of 84 %. The slide centrifuge Gram stain is a very sensitive screening method to detect bacteriuria in an adult male population. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Similar to a {{vertical}} <b>screen</b> scroll <b>centrifuge,</b> a horizontal <b>screen</b> scroll <b>centrifuge</b> is constructed of several main parts: screen, scroll, basket, housing, and helical screw. The screen and the basket with frustoconical geometry are assembled into the housing in a horizontal axis. Inside the frustoconical structure {{there is a}} tubular wall. Inside the tubular wall there is a cylinder of helical screw which flight on scroll pass. The tubular wall will have a slightly different angular speed to the helical screw.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{there are}} two types of centrifuges: the {{filtration}} and sedimentation centrifuges. For the filtration or the so-called <b>screen</b> <b>centrifuge</b> the drum is perforated and is inserted with a filter, for example a filter cloth, wire mesh or lot screen. The suspension flows through the filter and the drum with the perforated wall from the inside to the outside. In this way the solid material is restrained and can be removed. The kind of removing depends on the type of centrifuge, for example manually or periodically. Common types are: ...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{restrictive}} {{environmental regulations}} encourage paper mills {{to close their}} water systems. Closed water systems increase the level of contaminants significantly. Accumulations of solid suspensions are detrimental to both the papermaking process and the final products. To remove these solids, technologies such as flotation using dissolved air (DAF), <b>centrifuging,</b> and <b>screening</b> have been developed. Dissolved Air Flotation systems are commonly used to clarify whitewater. These passive systems use high pressure to dissolve air into whitewater. When the pressure is released, air micro-bubbles form and attach themselves to fibers and particles, which then float to the surface where they are mechanically skimmed off. There is an economic incentive to explore alternatives to the DAF technology to drive down the cost of whitewater processing and minimize the use of chemicals. The installed capital cost for a DAF system is significant and a typical DAF system takes up considerable space. An alternative approach, which {{is the subject of}} this project, involves a dual method combining the advantages of chemical flocculation and in-line ultrasonic clarification to efficiently remove flocculated contaminants from a water strea...|$|R
50|$|<b>Screen</b> scroll <b>centrifuge</b> is a {{filtering}} or <b>screen</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{which is}} also known as worm screen or conveyor discharge centrifuge. This centrifuge was first introduced in the midst of 19th century. After developing new technologies over the decades, it {{is now one of the}} widely used processes in many industries for the separation of crystalline, granular or fibrous materials from a solid-liquid mixture. Also, this process is considered to dry the solid material. This process has been some of the most frequently seen within, especially, coal preparation industry. Moreover, it can be found in other industries such as chemical, environmental, food and other mining fields.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the continuing problem of {{noise induced hearing loss}} NIHL among mine workers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has conducted numerous noise surveys in coal preparation plants. The research, consisting of worker dose monitoring, task observations, and equipment noise profiling, was completed in eight separate preparation plants. Worker dose monitoring was conducted for three shifts in most cases. Workers experiencing higher than allowable doses were task-observed for one full shift to correlate dose to noise source(s). Finally, noise levels on all floors, and in lunchrooms and control rooms, were characterized. Results indicate that only workers who routinely spend a significant portion of their shift in the plants (away from the control rooms) are susceptible to overexposure from noise. Certain pieces of equipment (<b>screens,</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> sieve bends) are the loudest primary noise sources responsible for the worker noise exposures...|$|R

The film follows the studies of pseudo-mad scientist Dr. Nick Laslowicz and his wild amusement park prototypes, brought to life by some impressive visual effects work."
