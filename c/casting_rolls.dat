40|$|Continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> are {{subjected}} to extreme temperature fl uctuations and harsh environmental conditions during service. High slab contact pressures, high surface temperatures, adhesive or abrasive wear by slag or oxides and thermal fatigue all contribute towards deterioration of the roll surface. Rolls may also suffer surface degradation {{as a result of}} corrosion. The slab is cooled using water spray, often containing hydrofl uoric acid as product of the reaction between water and the mould fl ux powder used to keep the molten metal from adhering to the copper mould plate. This results in an aggressive low pH environment that may promote pitting or crevice corrosion and stress corrosion cracking failures. In order to prolong the life of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> in service, the rolls are surfaced using martensitic stainless steel weld cladding. After surfacing, the roll may be given a post-weld heat treatment to temper the martensite to the required hardness level, or to relieve thermally-induced stresses. This investigation examined the submerged arc cladding of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> using nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steel, and focused on the effect of the weld thermal cycle and post-weld heat treatment on carbide precipitation in the clad layer. The precipitation of chromium-rich carbides during welding or post-weld heat treatment may lead to weld decay due to chromium depletion, rendering the roll surface susceptible to pit nucleation and crack initiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of the influence {{of the size of the}} strip electrode on the dilution of the base metal used in the process of submerged arc hardfacing of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> are presented. Increasing the thickness and decreasing the width of the strip electrode (60 ´ 0, 5 mm, 45 ´ 0, 7 mm, 30 ´ 1, 0 mm) results in the changing of the shape and dimensions of the fusion zone of the base metal to enhance the depth and reduce the non-uniformity of fusion penetration. The experimental data show that the dilution ratio of the base metal using the strip electrode 45 ´ 0, 7  mm, containing 13, 5  % chromium, made it possible to obtain more than 11  % chromium in the chemical composition of the third deposited layer. In the process of submerged arc hardfacing increasing the travel speed of the strip electrode (heat source) up to 12 m/hour enhance the dilution ratio of the base metal. Despite this, the chromium content of the third layer is not less than 11  %. At the same time, the improved parameters of the hardfacing process allowed to achieve the better weld shape and to reduce the number of welding defects.

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{consists}} of two separate and independent studies: One metallurgical study and one industrial buying behaviour study. Both studies concern continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls.</b> Metallurgical Study: The first objective {{of this study was}} to investigate two continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls,</b> consisting of different steel tubes with different martensitic stainless steel weld overlays. The second objective was to evaluate the methods employed in the study. The weld overlaps are clearly the weakest points of the weld overlay. They are sensitive to corrosion attacks, mainly due to sensitisation. The delta ferrite present in the welded overlay of both rolls is a preferential site for the corrosion attacks and the delta ferrite content depends primarily on the chemical composition of the weld overlay. The welding temperature may also have some influence on the delta ferrite content, but this has not been observed in this study. Both rolls have similar surface hardness. Roll no. 2 has more generalized corrosion attacks than roll no. 1. This is due to a higher delta ferrite content in roll no. 2 than in roll no. 1. The methods employed during the study proved to be adequate. In any future study, on condition that the visual inspection, diameter measurements, ultrasonic testing and surface hardness measurements show that all positions on the roll are similar, it will be sufficient to cut a bead and overlap sample from only one position. The rolls were investigated using macro etching, optical microscopy, Vickers hardness testing, ultrasonic testing ICP-OES analysis of nickel and chromium content and carbon content analysis by wet chemical method. Delta ferrite content was also calculated theoretically using a Schaeffler – DeLong diagram and a semi-empirical model. Industrial Buying Behaviour Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the industrial buying behaviour in slab casting steelworks in Western Europe when buying roll-lines. Case studies have been conducted at four steelworks belonging to different companies. Data was collected through personal interviews with people from production, maintenance and purchasing department and intermediate level management. A test consisting of a smaller amount of rolls is always performed before buying any larger quantities of rolls. Even though the test order has relatively low economic value, compared to a full-scale order, it is during this process that the relationships are established between the buying and the selling company. Findings show that the industrial buying behaviour of steelworks in Western Europe agrees well with the theory in this field. The buying process follows the steps in the buygrid model with only a few exceptions. The decision-making power lays in the intermediate level management, even though approval is required from upper level management. The most important factors affecting the buying behaviour are the relationship between the buyer and the seller, service-life and life cycle cost of the roll-line. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Profile Strip Casting is {{a process}} {{combining}} the advantages of tailored products with those of twin-roll strip casting. The feasibility of this process has been experimentally demonstrated and a profile with a thickness difference of one millimeter across the strip width could be obtained in a stable process. However, the dimensional precision and the properties uniformity along the {{cross section of the}} produced strip were not satisfactory. In this paper, two different strategies for the improvement of the profiled strip quality are presented. The first concept focuses on the variation of the geometrical parameters of the profile. Its application allowed to cast a strip with a thickness of 1. 5 mm in the thin and 2. 0 mm in the thick profile section maintaining the absolute geometrical error over the whole strip under 0. 1 mm and improving the internal microstructural homogeneity. The second approach identifies the precise control of the heat transfer occurring between casting roll and melt as the key factor to further improve the final profiled strip quality and will be implemented by selectively coating the <b>casting</b> <b>rolls.</b> The simulations performed show that the temperature difference between the cores of the thin and thick sections at the exit of the casting gap will be reduced by 60 % in the considered test case...|$|E
40|$|Melt {{extruded}} poly(vinylidene fluoride) cast {{films were}} prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperatures and speeds {{to study the}} effect of casting temperature and preorientation of the melt on the alpha- to beta-phase transformation in these films after uniaxial stretching. X-ray and {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} were used to identify the crystalline phases. The unstretched films were characterized using small angle light scattering (SALS). The films were stretched to a stretch ratio of 4. 2 and at 80 degrees C. Birefringence of the films and the fraction of beta-phase [F(beta) ] formed after uniaxial stretching increased with stretch ratio. The films showed increased crystallinity after stretching. For the films prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperatures, there was little change in F(beta) in the films having a <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperature between 75 and 120 degrees C, but for the film with a <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperature of 130 degrees C F(beta) decreased considerably. For the films prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> speeds, the F(beta) increased with stretch ratio as well as with <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> speed for a fixed stretch ratio. The primary effect of changing both the parameters is a change in the average spherulitic radius (R), in the unstretched films measured using SALS. The F(beta) obtained correlated well with R and lower spherulitic radii resulted in the higher conversion to the beta-phase. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 47 : 1992 - 2004, 2007.

30|$|Burns from {{orthopaedic}} {{plaster cast}} splints, although not common occurrences, {{have been reported}} [5, 6, 11]. Previous investigators have evaluated the exothermic properties of plaster or synthetic casting materials separately. Ganaway and Hunter [12] and Lavalette and Pope [1] demonstrated plaster could, under the right set of conditions, create temperatures {{at or above the}} burn threshold. Synthetic materials, however, have a smaller exothermic potential and even under the worst conditions did not create dangerous temperatures [2]. The important variables identified in previous studies which influenced the temperatures generated have been cast thickness, dip water temperature, type of casting material, and the presence of an insulator (pillow) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13]. Deignan et al. [14] were even able to show that pressure applied during themolding of casts results in a significant increase in temperature at the side where the mold was applied. Variables of lesser importance included the amount of cast padding, the room humidity, the room temperature, and the use of previously used dip water. Haasch [5] emphasized that when the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls</b> are soaked in hot water, they absorb water at a slower rate than when they are soaked in cold water. Also, if the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls</b> are dipped in water {{for a short period of}} time, they absorb less water. When less water is present in the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls,</b> the temperature of the cast increases. The specific heat capacity of water of 4, 190  J/kg K is very high, which means the more water is present, the more of a cooling effect the water has on the temperature of the cast.|$|R

By use of thin strip casting, magnesium alloy cast strip with a thickness {{of less than}} 8 mm can be produced and then rolled to the strip of the needed thickness, which is a short, energy saving and high effective process. In this paper, development of magnesium alloy strips prepared by single and twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> has been summarized.

Magnesium alloy strips prepared by single <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> are suitable for Mg-based functional materials but not for structural materials because of low quality or high cost.

40|$|Purpose: : The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{establish}} a manufacturing process and technology to facilitate the economical manufacture of high-quality magnesium sheet alloys. Design/methodology/approach: Magnesium alloy AZ 31 B was used to investigate the appropriate manufacturing conditions for use in twin-roll strip casting.
