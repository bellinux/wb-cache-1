In a habitat suitability model, Romme and others [...] recommended the ideal canopy cover for roosting Indiana bats as 60% to 80%. Actual roost sites in eastern Tennessee were very high in the tree, and Indiana bats were able to exit the roost above the surrounding canopy. Thus, canopy cover measurements taken from the bases of roost trees may overestimate the actual amount of cover required by roosting Indiana bats.|$|E

Subsequent surveys were conducted in the next year, after timbering was complete and the year following.|$|E

40|$|Using Landsat imagery, {{forest canopy}} density (FCD) {{estimated}} with the FCD Mapper®, {{was correlated with}} predominant height (PDH, measured as the average height of the tallest 50 trees per hectare) for 20 field plots measured in native forest at Noosa Heads, south-east Queensland, Australia. A corresponding image was used to calculate FCD in Leyte Island, the Philippines and was validated {{on the ground for}} accuracy. The FCD Mapper was produced for the International Tropical Timber Organisation and estimates FCD as an index of canopy density using reflectance characteristics of Landsat Enhanced Thematic (ETM) Mapper images. The FCD Mapper is a ‘semi-expert ’ computer program which uses interactive screens to allow the operator to make decisions concerning the classification of land into bare soil, grass and forest. At Noosa, a positive strong nonlinear relationship (r 2 = 0. 86) was found between FCD and PDH for 15 field plots with variable PDH but <b>complete</b> <b>canopy</b> closure. An additional five field plots were measured in forest with a broken canopy and the software assessed these plots as having a much lower FCD than forest with canopy closure. FCD estimates for forest and agricultural land in the island of Leyte and subsequent field validation showed that at appropriate settings, the FCD Mapper differentiated between tropical rainforest and banana or coconut plantation. These findings suggest that in forests with a closed canopy this remote sensing technique has promise for forest inventory and productivity assessment. The findings also suggest that the software has promise for discriminating between native forest with a <b>complete</b> <b>canopy</b> and forest which has a broken canopy, such as coconut or banana plantation...|$|E

40|$|Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) {{modelling}} may {{be applied}} in rural extension in situations where program outputs are influenced by variables which are sequentially influenced by other variables. For a recently completed agroforestry extension program in Leyte the Philippines, BBN modelling of site factors, establishment practices and risk, predicted widely different program outputs for different levels of extension assistance and farmer inputs. In a situation where very little was known about how farmers would respond to offers of extension assistance, monitoring of the program {{over a period of}} three years revealed that extended extension assistance was crucial in determining the likely survival and growth of trees. Extended extension assistance was also important for the elimination of unsuitable sites and the use of appropriate establishment procedures. Where extension support was not available, farmers displayed a poor knowledge of the principles of tree growth, planting trees underneath <b>complete</b> <b>canopies</b> and adjacent to mature coconut palms even though they could have been expected to have extensive local knowledge of raising and growing plants. Approximately one third of planting sites were infertile and eroded and growth of newly planted trees on these sites was poor, often because site preparation and maintenance was minimal. Newly established trees were also found to be at risk from fire, typhoon, and grazing and in situations where plantations were destroyed, farmers became antagonistic towards the program. The implications of the BBN modelling for a hypothetically expanded program are that extended assistance and site inspections are necessary to eliminate planting trees on inappropriate and unsuitable sites and to improve establishment practices and weed control in order to avoid plantations of suppressed and chlorotic trees which fail to meet the expectations of farmers, thus impinging on the success of the program...|$|R

These factors were identified in consultation with industry and a review of the scientific literature.

In a botanical survey of eighty-seven forest sites, sedimentary lithologies were found to differ in the species which dominate the forest canopy.

If farmers do not apply much fertilizers to cassava, soil fertility may decline while plant nutrients in the soil may be lost due to erosion when the crop is grown on slopes.

For this, provincial inventory information was analyzed together with information from permanent PEBANPA plots (plots of Ecology and Biodiversity, natural environments in Southern Patagonia) and studies of ecology and eco-physiology in ñire forests. This allowed the description of plant communities on these ecological sites and the history of natural disturbances.

40|$|Following {{wildfire}} in 2005 at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, {{we asked}} how fire severity affected the postfire regeneration of dominant woody species in two coastal plant communities. We documented {{the effects of}} fire severity (unburned, low, high) on stand mortality and seedling regeneration in shrublands dominated by the obligate seeder Leptospermum laevigatum (Myrtaceae) and woodlands dominated by the resprouting Banksia integrifolia var. integrifolia (Proteaceae). Leptospermum laevigatum is a range-expanding native species that has encroached into grassy Banksia woodland and hence, we were also interested whether fire severity affects post-fire succession in encroached and un-encroached stands. Fire severity impacted on all measures of post-fire recovery examined: stand mortality, seedling germination, seedling survival, seedling growth. High fire severity (<b>complete</b> <b>canopy</b> consumption) led to 100 % mortality of both species. Despite variable responses at the stand level, mean Leptospermum laevigatum seedling establishment, growth and survival all increased with increasing fire severity in shrublands, thus ensuring shrublands are replaced. Banksia integrifolia recruitment, however, was minimal in all stands and not fire-cued. Increasing fire severity enabled Leptospermum laevigatum to recruit into woodland sites from where it was previously absent and this establishment, coupled {{with the loss of}} overstorey Banksia trees, may rapidly transform woodlands into shrublands. Hence, fire severity-induced population responses were observed and these imprints are likely to affect longer-term succession by reinforcing site occupancy of the encroaching Leptospermum laevigatum while simultaneously leading to the potential decline of Banksia woodlands...|$|E

Logical and mathematical models consider the conceptual and show some {{of the results of}} their verification. It was found that the models include different laws and the parameters, the sum of which allows you to divide them into four categories: models of static states, development models, models of care for the natural forest and models of cultivation. Each category has fulfilled and fulfills its tasks in economic management. Thus, the model states in statics (table traverse growth) played a prominent role in figuring out what may be the most productive (full) stands in different regions of the country. However, they do not answer the question of what the initial states lead to the production of complete stands. In a study of the growth of stands used system analysis, and it is observed dominance of works studying static state, snatched from the biological time. Therefore, the real drama of the growth of stands remained almost unexplored. It is no accident there were «chrono-forestry» «plantation forestry» and even «non-traditional forestry», where there is a strong case of a number of new concepts of development stands. That is quite in keeping with Kuhn (Kuhn, 2009) in the forestry crisis began – there were alternative theories and coexist conflicting scientific schools. To develop models of stand development, it is proposed to use a well-known method of repeated observations within 10 – 20 years, in conjunction with the explanation {{of the history of the}} initial density. It mounted on the basis of studying the dynamics of its indicators: the trunk, crown overlap coefficient, the sum of volumes of all crowns and the relative length of the crown. According to these indicators, the researcher selects natural series of development stands with the same initial density.
