60|$|I {{found him}} in his study--a tall, handsome, white-haired old man, very feeble; he rose, and {{supporting}} his steps with a long staff, led me out into the grounds and talked about nature. But his memory, like his strength, was failing; he seemed, indeed, but the ruin of a man, although still of a very noble presence. What he called the vicarage gardens, where we strolled about among the trees, was a place without walks, all overgrown with grass and wildings; for roses and dahlias he showed me fennel, goat's-beard, henbane, and <b>common</b> <b>hound's</b> tongue; and when speaking of their nature he stroked their leaves and stems caressingly. He loved these better than the gardener's blooms, and so did I; but I wanted {{to hear about the}} vanished birds of the district, particularly the furze wren, which had survived all the others that were gone.|$|R
5000|$|In {{short-haired}} dogs (L/- w/w), {{this gene}} causes the smooth coat type that is <b>common</b> in <b>hounds</b> and pointers. Coat length is significantly reduced in animals homozygous for the smooth-coat allele, and of intermediate length in heterozygotes. Heterozygosity for long coat (L/l) dulls {{the effect on}} coat length. Typically, the undercoat is completely absent. Very few breeds (e.g., Chihuahua) have both smooth and non-smooth coat types.|$|R
50|$|The common smooth-hound has a grey-brown {{back and}} is white on its underneath. It is often {{confused}} with the starry smooth-hound which has white spots on its back. The starry smooth-hound can often have faded spots which leads to misidentification. Another shark it is often confused with is the tope shark although the <b>common</b> smooth <b>hound</b> has a larger second dorsal fin. Due to {{the similarities between the}} common smooth-hound and other sharks, misidentification occurred for a long time.|$|R
60|$|We thus see that, at {{a period}} between {{four and five}} {{thousand}} years ago, various breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, <b>common</b> <b>hounds,</b> mastiffs, house-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less closely resembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient evidence {{that any of these}} ancient dogs belonged to the same identical sub-varieties with our present dogs. (1/7. Berjeau gives facsimiles of the Egyptian drawings. Mr. C.L. Martin in his 'History of the Dog' 1845 copies several figures from the Egyptian monuments, and speaks with much confidence with respect to their identity with still living dogs. Messrs. Nott and Gliddon ('Types of Mankind' 1854 page 388) give still more numerous figures. Mr. Gliddon asserts that a curl-tailed greyhound, like that represented on the most ancient monuments, is common in Borneo; but the Rajah, Sir J. Brooke, informs me that no such dog exists there.) As long as man was believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years, this fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several wild sources, for there would not have been sufficient time for their divergence and modification. But now that we know, from the discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical changes, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period, and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess domestic dogs, the argument from insufficient time falls away greatly in value.|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by predomi-nantly vectorborne Leishmania spp. In the United States, canine visceral leishmaniasis is <b>common</b> among <b>hounds,</b> and L. infantum vertical transmission among hounds has been confirmed.

Canids are the reservoir for zoonotic human visceral leishmani-asis (VL) (2), and canine VL was detected in the United States in 1980 (3). Subsequent investigation demonstrated that many US hounds were infected with Leishmania infan-tum (4). Evidence has demonstrated that L. infantum was spread by vertical transmission over many canine genera-tions; no evidence of vector transmission has been reported (5, 6).

50|$|Cynoglossum grande is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by the <b>common</b> name Pacific <b>hound's</b> tongue. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California, where it grows in shady areas in woodland and chaparral. On the forest floor of California oak woodlands typical plant associates are Calochortus luteus, Delphinium variegatum and Calochortus amabilis. It is a perennial herb producing an erect stem 30 to 90 centimeters tall from a taproot. The leaves are mostly located {{around the base of}} the plant, each with an oval blade up to 15 centimeters long held on a petiole. The inflorescence is a panicle of flowers on individual pedicels. Each five-lobed flower is bright to deep blue with white appendages at the center. It is 1 to 1.5 centimeters wide. The fruit is an array of four slightly bristly nutlets.|$|R
2500|$|Irish Wolfhounds have {{a varied}} range of {{personal}}ities and {{are most often}} noted for their personal quirks and individualism. An Irish Wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone {{for long periods of}} time. An Irish Wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owner’s possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish Wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, “gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked”. [...] Despite the need for their own people, Wolfhounds generally are somewhat stand-offish with total strangers. They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is <b>common</b> for <b>hounds</b> at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.|$|R
30|$|The {{preoperative}} {{finding of}} hip dysplasia {{in the majority}} of dogs used in this study suggests that hip dysplasia may be <b>common</b> in <b>hounds</b> purpose-bred for research, and several groups have suggested that canine hip dysplasia is a complex genetic trait with high prevalence in large breeds. (Bartolomé, 2015) If this type of dog is used in the future to study tissue-engineered cartilage constructs and hip dysplasia is identified pre-operatively, wear patterns of any implant may approximate those seen in the population of human patients expected to benefit most from these technologies, but may also complicate analysis and increase variability of results, particularly of functional outcome measures. Spontaneous cartilage lesions in dogs with hip dysplasia are initiated in the dorsal femoral head, adjacent to the insertion of the ligamentum capitis femoris, in a similar location to the perifoveal location of cartilage fibrillation seen in human hip osteoarthritis (Maroudas et al. 1973; Burton-Wurster et al. 1999). The full effect of preexisting hip dysplasia on {{the results of this study}} is unknown, since no unaffected control group was available for comparison. However, based on radiographic scores as well as DIs (laxity) and CIs (congruency) of control limbs, we were unable to detect any progression of these abnormalities over the 6 -month duration of the study. In addition, DI (laxity), but not CI (congruency), was tightly correlated with radiographic score at both preoperative and 20 -week time points, for the control limb (Additional file 3 : Table S 2). These findings are consistent with previous studies (Gold et al. 2009). Interpretation of accelerometry data may have been confounded by preoperative hip dysplasia. For example, increased radiographic score of the control limb was correlated with increased number of preoperative daytime rest periods. Increased number of daytime rest periods preoperatively was associated with shorter total duration of daytime rest periods at 20  weeks postoperatively and increased overall daytime activity. In summary, hip osteoarthritis in dogs leads to complex changes in gait (Bockstahler et al. 2012), and in this study we found complex interactions of preexisting and induced osteoarthritis on functional outcome measures. Therefore, as has been suggested previously (Cook et al. 2010), dogs should be screened for preexisting hip dysplasia and if identified should not be used in feasibility studies to evaluate new joint therapeutics. Conversely, dysplasia is a major cause of hip osteoarthritis in humans and of abnormal joint mechanics in affected hips (Henak et al. 2014). In addition, dysplasia leads to premature wear and acetabular component fixation failure of both stemmed THA and hip resurfacing arthroplasty (Gross and Liu 2011). Therefore it could be argued that use of dogs with preexisting hip dysplasia could be a good model system to more accurately predict wear and failure modes of new joint repair technologies in patients.|$|R
