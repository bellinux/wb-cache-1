5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|While {{deleting}} files, BMO accidentally deletes {{its core}} system drivers. Finn and Jake decide to accompany BMO to the Mo Factory so that BMO <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> drivers re-installed; BMO cautions Finn and Jake that its memory will be erased, so the duo disguise themselves as robots and successfully sneak past DMO (voiced by Aziz Ansari) and infiltrate the facility. Once inside, {{they find the}} factory derelict and abandoned. DMO and the security SMOs (voiced by Paul F. Tompkins) soon catch onto Finn, Jake, and BMO's scheme and give chase. The three evade security and sneak into the SMO lounge.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{its efforts}} in the Positive Energy Buildings Consortium, Intel has been {{developing}} an application, called Personal Office Energy Monitor (POEM), to help office buildings to be more energy-efficient. With this application, employees <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> power consumption info for their office machines, {{so that they can}} figure out a better way to save energy in their working environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{balls are}} then hard ground. They are {{ground in the}} same type of machine as used before, but either an {{abrasive}} is introduced into coolant or the rotating plate is replaced with a very hard fine-grain grinding wheel. This step <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> balls within ±. If the balls need more precision then they are lapped, again in {{the same type of}} machine. However, this time the rill plates are made of a softer material, usually cast iron, less pressure is applied, the plate is rotated slowly. This step is what gives bearing balls their shiny appearance and can bring the balls between grades 10 and 48.|$|E
25|$|Gru and the Minions {{steal the}} shrink ray from a secret base in East Asia, but Vector {{intercepts}} them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts {{to break into}} Vector's fortress to recover the shrink ray but is defeated by numerous booby traps. However, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, {{who are able to}} easily walk into the base because they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning on using them to infiltrate Vector's base so he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> shrink ray back. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their rambunctiousness, their ballet classes, and his own ineptitude as a parent.|$|E

25|$|Price and Pavelich have {{an entirely}} {{different}} view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than they do on their print editions.|$|E
25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> desired signal.|$|E
25|$|ADEM's {{symptoms}} {{resemble the}} symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS. Unlike MS, ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever, although adolescents and adults <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> disease too. ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), {{over a long period}} of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these 'multiphasic' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases.|$|E

25|$|BMRCL {{began selling}} tokens through {{automatic}} ticket vending machines (ATVMs) on 4 December 2012 at the MG Road, Indiranagar and Baiyyappanahalli stations. The service {{will eventually be}} expanded to all metro stations. The touchscreen enabled ATVMs are available in 3 languages – English, Kannada and Hindi. Commuters can purchase a single journey token by selecting the destination station or the amount in the ATVM. They can also add value or add trips to the contactless smart card. Commuters can purchase up to 8 tickets {{at a time and}} <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> receipt print for card recharge. ATVMs accept coins of 5 and 10 denominations and 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 denominations of currency notes. However, the ATVM cannot differentiate between 1 and 2 coins.|$|E

Akin instructs his Assistant, Alex (Hafeez Oyetoro) to find out the venue for the retreat by any means. Akin arrives home one day and sees his girlfriend, Gina (Lydia Forson) drunk and she has also rearranged the living room. Akin gets upset and asks for his house keys. Gina gets angry, gives him the keys and leaves the house cussing him.|$|E

After Yukina blackmails him, Shigure does things to try to get out of it, one of them being finding out her glasses secret to no avail. Shigure denies that he has feelings for Yukina but for some reason can't understand why he feels he needs to keep Yukina to himself. He is also jealous of Akira and Hisame but denies it, he later on confesses his love to Yukina but because of her unsure feelings in the past, she did not respond to his feelings until after Shigure came back from his studies and told him her feelings. They started going out.|$|E
