40|$|In {{this paper}} {{monotonic}} and cyclic finite element (FE) analyses are presented {{for the development}} of an I-beam-to-CHS column steel moment joint for seismic actions. The development process for the final joint details includes: (1) eliminating two identified structural deficiencies of distortion in column web panel and strain concentrations in the external diaphragms; (2) creating a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism; (3) devising a joint to delay onset of beam yielding. Two external diaphragm collar plates are welded to the circumference of the CHS column for connection to beam flanges. Various <b>collar</b> <b>ring</b> widths are examined for these horizontal diaphragms and a width (based on achieving full strength of the beam flanges) is found to produce an acceptable web panel performance. Different types of stiffener geometries in the connection region are then trialed to eliminate strain concentrations in the diaphragms. Two pairs of triangular diaphragm stiffeners are found to provide the desired performance. In order to produce a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism, tapered cover plates (TCPs) equipped with vertical stiffeners (VSs) are integrated into the joint. Oversized web holes of 4 – 10 mm are required to enable inelastic deformation for an overall joint rotation of 60 – 100 mrad, without undesirable web distortion. Further FE analyses are used to design the TCPs and VSs so they can be replaceable link post-seismic actions. For the final joint detailing it is shown that 6 mm oversized holes for the TCPs will delay the occurrence of yielding in the beam until the joint rotation is 70 mrad...|$|E

5000|$|The first mass-produced shaft collars {{were set}} screw collars and were used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early shaft <b>collars</b> were solid <b>ring</b> types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the collar.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating <b>ring</b> <b>collar</b> is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating <b>ring</b> <b>collar.</b> When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating <b>ring</b> <b>collar</b> and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|R

2500|$|Four rungs on {{the side}} of the masks, above and below each ear, let the masks hang in {{suspension}} and indicate that the masks were suspended from a cord, though experts have disagreed on how they were worn. British Museum art historian William Fagg concluded that unlike the small brass pendant masks worn at the waist by modern kings, the ivory mask was likely worn around the neck. An 1830s drawing of a similar mask worn at the breast by a neighboring ruler confirms Fagg's theory. Based on the position of the rungs, Metropolitan curator Alisa LaGamma also affirmed the theory. Benin specialist and anthropologist Paula Ben-Amos, however, wrote that the masks were worn on the waist as pendants during the Ugie Iyoba and Emobo ceremonies. The hollow masks likely served as amuletic containers. [...] Below the mask's <b>collars,</b> the <b>ring</b> of small loops are attachment points for crotal bells.|$|R

2500|$|Dewan has {{suggested}} that obstruction in the posterior urethra is more appropriately termed congenital obstructions of the posterior urethral membrane (COPUMs), a concept that has come from an in-depth analysis of the historical papers, and evaluation of patients with a prenatal diagnosis that has facilitated video recording of the uninstrumented obstructed urethra.

Occeli placed located on a ridge of raised cuticle, between the elliptical shaped compound eyes. The twelve segmented antennae are approximately 3.79 mm long, and have a notably short scape. Of the segments, antennomeres four through eleven have small bases and widen unequally to the tops. The upper edges of the antennomeres have a point on the upper inner sides, giving the antennae a slightly serrate appearance. The mandibles have a distinct cup-like appearance, with the inner side of each cup towards the clypeal surface and a single tooth is present on the lower apex. [...] The front of the inner margins on the mandibles each have a row of thick setae while rows of denticles run along the dorsoventral edge. The modified labrum has a rounded, tongue like look extending between the mandibles. On each of the side edges of the labrum are a row of forward facing setae, while the front edge has many dense setae. The maxillary palps are composed of five segments and the labial palps are composed of three segments. The metapleural gland has a small slit like opening that has between three and four small setae on lower edge. The wings of the holotype are damaged and little is visible of the vein structure.

40|$|We have {{produced}} mosaics of the Great Red Spot (GRS) using images {{taken by the}} Galileo spacecraft in May 2000, and have measured the winds of the GRS using an automated algorithm that does not require manual cloud tracking. Our technique yields a high-density, regular grid of wind velocity vectors that is advantageous over {{a limited number of}} scattered wind vectors that result from manual cloud tracking. The high-velocity collar of the GRS is clearly seen from our velocity vector map, and highest wind velocities are measured to be around 170 m s− 1. The high resolution of the mosaics have also enabled us to map turbulent eddies inside the chaotic central region of the GRS, similar to those mapped by Sada et al. (1996) and Vasavada et al. (1998). Using the wind velocity measurements, we computed particle trajectories around the GRS as well as maps of relative and absolute vorticities.

40|$|Evapotranspiration from a grass-covered {{ground is}} known to induce suction by soil {{evaporation}} and grass transpiration. However, grass-induced suction in the ground when it is subjected to wetting and drying are not yet well understood. In this study, a laboratory test program was conducted to investigate the magnitude and distribution of suction induced by Bermuda grass growing in silty sand. In total, four test boxes compacted with silty sand were prepared, three of which covered with Bermuda grass while one test box was left bare as control. All the four test boxes were subjected to wetting and drying in a plant room with temperature and humidity controlled. Under identical atmospheric conditions and initial soil density and water content, peak suction induced within the root zone in grassed soil was 1. 5 times higher than that in bare soil after 20 days of drying. A vertical suction influence zone was identified {{to be up to}} four times the root depth while the lateral suction influence zone was one diameter of <b>ring</b> <b>collar</b> away from the centre of the plot. Upon wetting, suction retained at depth right below the root zone in grassed soil was found to be 40 % higher than that in bare soil. For three grass replicates that were germinated under identical atmospheric conditions, they produced different shoot lengths and induced different magnitudes of suction. No direct correlation between grass shoot length and grass-induced suction could be found. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
