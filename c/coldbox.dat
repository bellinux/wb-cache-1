40|$|In this master’s thesis a pinch {{targeting}} {{study of}} the Borealis AB cracker plant in Stenungsund has been carried out. The cracker plant uses large amounts of electricity (~ 400 GWh/year) and fuel (~ 4 300 GWh/year) and is therefore a large contributor to CO 2 emissions, 1. 2 % of the total emissions in Sweden. The plant {{was built in the}} 1960 ’s {{and as a result of}} the low fuel and electricity prices at the time energy efficiency was not a high priority. The energy market looks different today, and with the present focus on environmental issues the view on energy use has changed. The Swedish national gas grid has been extended to Stenungsund, which creates a possibility for Borealis to deliver fuel gas to the network. Therefore the aim of this study has been to identify process locations with potential for energy savings. To perform the study, data was collected from process design studies, historical process data and the experience of process engineers. The data was processed in ProPi where the pinch temperature, pinch violations and theoretical minimum hot and cold utility usage were calculated. The potential for hot and cold utility savings was investigated with a GCC (Grand Composite Curve) analysis. Some limitations were made to make the study feasible within the allocated time frame. The furnaces were left outside of the scope of the study as well as the already integrated <b>coldboxes</b> and intermittent heat exchangers. The study was limited to the onsite/offsite area and the by-product area. All other facilities were excluded. The results of the study show that there is a large potential for energy savings, with pinch violations of 94 MW in the onsite/offsite part of the cracker plant and 1. 5 MW in the by-product area. Several possible matches for additional internal heat exchange were identified. The by-product area was already rather well integrated, however a few possibilities for energy efficiency were found. In particular a single process integration measure was identified that could potentially reduce the pinch violations by 60 %. Another important result of the study is that there is no theoretical demand for external heating of the process in the onsite/offsite. Today 63 MW of steam is used for heating. The on-site utility boilers have a production that is equivalent to this number which means that theoretically there is no need for them. Decreasing of steam use will lead to a lower use of residual fuel gas, which could be upgraded to natural gas specifications and sold to the natural gas grid. Performing the internal heat exchanges with the largest potential could decrease the CO 2 emissions of Borealis by 15 %. In future work more thorough investigations of the suggested retrofits should be carried out with economical and mechanical evaluations. New regulations from the EU are likely to increase the prices of CO 2 emission allowances at the same time as fuel prices are rising, which will lead to increased profitability for energy savings. Therefore some of the energy efficiency measures that are not of economical interest today may be so in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Fermilab Central Helium Liquefier (CHL) {{facility}} is operated 24 hours-a-day to supply 4. 6 {degrees}K for the Fermilab Tevatron superconducting proton-antiproton collider Ring and to recover warm return gases. The centerpieces of the CHL are two independent cold boxes rated at 4000 and 5400 liters/hour with LN{sub 2 } precool. These coldboxes are Claude cycle and have identical heat exchangers trains, but different turbo-expanders. The Tevatron cryogenics demand for higher helium supply from CHL was {{the driving force}} to investigate an installation of an expansion engine {{in place of the}} Joule-Thompson valve. A mathematical model was developed to describe the thermo- and gas-dynamic processes for the equipment included in the helium <b>coldbox.</b> The model is based on a finite element approach, opposite to a global variables approach, thus providing for higher accuracy and conversion stability. Though the coefficients used in thermo- and gas-dynamic equations are unique for a given <b>coldbox,</b> the general approach, the equations, the methods of computations, and most of the subroutines written in FORTRAN can be readily applied to different coldboxes. The simulation results are compared against actual operating data to demonstrate applicability of the model...|$|E

Then, a known amount of power was applied to the samples while in the <b>coldbox</b> and the steady state temperatures measured. It was found that even a submonolayer of simulated lunar dust can significantly degrade the performance of both white paint and second-surface mirror type thermal control surfaces under these conditions. Contrary to earlier studies, dust was found to affect as well as. Dust lowered the emissivity by as much as 16 percent in the case of AZ- 93, and raised it by as much as 11 percent in the case of AgFEP. The degradation of thermal control surface by dust as measured by / rose linearly regardless of the thermal control coating or substrate, and extrapolated to degradation by a factor 3 at full coverage by dust.

A dynamic RGP model developed under HYSYS environment is utilized {{as a test}} bed. This model comprises 762 variables and 21 regulatory control loops. However, only 9 variables or factors with three level each are studied to determine their relative significance in maximizing RGP profit.

40|$|JSC- 1 A lunar {{simulant}} {{has been}} applied to AZ 93 and AgFEP thermal control surfaces on aluminum substrates in a simulated lunar environment. The temperature of these surfaces was monitored as they were heated with a solar simulator using varying angles of incidence and cooled in a 30 K <b>coldbox.</b> Thermal modeling was used to determine the solar absorptivity (a) and infrared emissivity (e) of the thermal control surfaces in both their clean and dusted states. It was found that even a submonolayer of dust can significantly raise the a of either type of surface. A full monolayer can increase the a/e ratio by a factor of 3 - 4 over a clean surface. Little angular dependence of the a of pristine thermal control surfaces for both AZ 93 and AgFEP was observed, at least until 300 from the surface. The dusted surfaces showed the most angular dependence of a when the incidence angle was in the range of 25 degrees to 35 degrees. Samples with a full monolayer, like those with no dust, showed little angular dependence in a. The e of the dusted thermal control surfaces was within the spread of clean surfaces, with the exception of high dust coverage, where a small increase was observed at shallow angles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe European Spallation Sourcein Lund, Sweden, {{will be a}} 5 MW beam power neutron {{spallation}} research center. As subsystem of {{the target}} station the moderators {{play a vital role}} by slowing down high energy neutrons set free during the spallation process. To provide maximum neutron flux intensities with high availability for scattering experiments a conceptual liquid hydrogen moderator cooling circulation design proposal was developed. Supercritical hydrogen at 17 K will be utilized to absorb energy of the incoming neutrons in two parallel moderator vessels. A helium refrigerator provides the necessary cooling capacity by implementing an additional helium expansion turbine downstream the refrigerator <b>coldbox.</b> Strategies for the mitigation of pressure fluctuations due to beam trips are being presented. Solutions in form of electrical heaters and an accumulator or an expansion vessel are discussed. Different supercritical hydrogen circulator implementation scenarios are being matched to indicate the most reliable setup. For an efficient moderation process parahydrogen concentrations higher than 99 % have to be guaranteed at the moderator inlet. Due to potential conversion of parahydrogen to orthohydrogen via irradiation processes the implementation of an ortho-parahydrogen catalyst bed is being evaluated. Methods for a continuous measurement of the apparent parahydrogen concentration at the moderator in- and outlet will be introduced. The arrangement and interaction of the components will be detailed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The ERL {{cryogenic}} {{system will}} supply cooling to a super-conducting RF (SCRF) gun and the 5 -cell super-conducting RF cavity system {{that need to}} be held cold at 2 K. The engineering of the cavity cryomodules were carried out by AES in collaboration with BNL. The 2 K superfluid bath is produced by pumping on the bath using a sub-atmospheric warm compression system. The cryogenic system makes use of mainly existing equipment relocated from other facilities: a 300 W 4. 5 K <b>coldbox,</b> an 45 g/s screw compressor, a 3800 liter liquid helium storage dewar, a 170 m{sup 3 } warm gas storage tank, and a 40, 000 liter vertical low pressure liquid nitrogen storage dewar. An existing wet expander obtained from another facility has been added to increase the plant capacity. In order to deliver the required 3 to 4 bar helium to the cryomodules while using up stored liquid capacity at low pressure, a new subcooler will be installed to function as the capacity transfer device. A 2 K to 4 K recovery heat exchanger is also implemented for each cryomodule to recover refrigeration below 4 K, thus maximizing 2 K cooling capacity with the given sub-atmospheric pump. No 4 K- 300 K refrigeration recovery is implemented {{at this time of the}} returning sub-atmospheric cold vapor, hence the 2 K load appears as a liquefaction 1 load on the cryogenic plant. A separate LN 2 cooling loop supplies liquid nitrogen to the superconducting gun's cathode tip...|$|E
