The module permitting from files with results of LAHET’s calculation {{to create a}} neutron-source (spallation) and to record him in an input file for further calculation over the program the REACTOR is developed. It is shown, that the detail count of source distribution over space increases accuracy of calculation of the main physical values: a neutron multiplication factor of a blanket, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> of energy release etc. The feature of neutron - physical calculation of hybrid system (target + blanket) is a slow convergence of iterative algorithms for solving the system of diffusive equations with an external source. For acceleration it is suggested to use trinomial universal algorithms of Chebyshev of 2 kind. The efficiency of such method of acceleration is demonstrated on results of calculation of IAEA test. The optimum length of a cycle is obtained. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Lublin Upland and Roztocze {{region are}} known for the {{occurrence}} {{of a large number}} of springs of high yield. These springs are fed mainly from Cretaceous or Tertiary water-bearing hori-zon. In order to determine variability of springs ’ yield, 61 selected springs were analysed in spring periods of the years 1998 – 2008. Collected hydrometric materials allowed for comparing average and extreme yield values of springs in various physiographic regions within the period of 11 years. Aver-age value was 76. 1 dm 3 ·s– 1, while the mean of the minimal yields was 44. 7 dm 3 ·s– 1 and of the maxi-mal – 132. 7 dm 3 ·s– 1. <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> of the springs ’ yield ranged from 1. 5 to 5. 0, which may lead to the conclusion that the springs ’ yield is constant or varies slightly. In some cases the irregularity was higher but it was determined by hydrogeological, meteorological and local factors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Neumann {{boundary value problem}} for an elliptic operator L=-div (A grad) + V on a bounded bi-Lipschitz domain in R^n. More generally, we will treat closed manifolds and manifolds with boundary. The eigenfunctions of L are often localized, {{as a result of}} disorder of the potential V, the matrix <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> A, <b>irregularities</b> <b>of</b> the boundary, or all of the above. In earlier work, two of us introduced the function u solving Lu= 1, and showed numerically that it strongly reflects this localization. In this paper, we deepen the connection between the eigenfunctions and this landscape function u by proving that its reciprocal 1 /u acts as an effective potential. The effective potential governs the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions of the system and delivers information on the distribution of eigenvalues {{near the bottom of the}} spectrum. (This version strengthens and simplifies the results by replacing a global bi-Lipschitz hypothesis on the domain with a local bi-Lipschitz hypothesis.) Comment: 33 page...|$|R

40|$|Spike trains from {{cortical}} neurons show a {{high degree}} <b>of</b> <b>irregularity,</b> with <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> variation (CV) of their interspike interval (ISI) distribution close to or higher than one. It {{has been suggested that}} this irregularity might be a reflection of a particular dynamical state of the local cortical circuit in which excitation and inhibition balance each other. In this “balanced ” state, the mean current to the neurons is below threshold, and firing is driven by current fluctuations, resulting in irregular Poisson-like spike trains. Recent data show that the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> in neuronal spike trains recorded during the delay period of working memory experiments is the same for both low-activity states of a few Hz and for elevated, persistent activity states of a few tens of Hz. Since the difference between these persistent activity states cannot be due to external factors coming from sensory inputs, this suggests that the underlyin...|$|R

The system consists of optical hardware to produce an image which characterises the yarn diameter and electronic hardware that converts the optical yarn diameter image into a proportional voltage. LabVIEW customised software was used to acquire and process the output voltage interfaced through a Data Acquisition Board. The system determines traditional commercial yarn irregularity parameters including Ud (Mean Deviation), CVd (<b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> Variation), SDd (Standard Deviation), types <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> frequency diagrams and spectral analysis based on FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).

40|$|Chile {{has a great}} {{diversity}} of climates. In average, the rainfall differs between 0. 7 mm (Iquique, North) and 1, 814. 8 mm (Valdivia, South) according to the main meteorological stations. The small rainfall amount in the North concentrates on few days, with only 3 days per year. In Central Chile, there are among 16 to 42 rainy days and in the South more than 150 days. In {{order to understand the}} correlation between precipitation totals (grouped into 1 -mm size classes) and the number of rain days, climatologists use the Concentration Index (CI). In the present study, this index was calculated for 17 meteorological stations across Chile for the period between 1965 - 2005, also using other indicators: <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> Variation, Temporal <b>irregularity</b> and the relation of precipitation with teleconnections. The results of the CI show a high variation among the regions (from 0. 51 to 0. 76). The highest one was recorded in La Serena (30 º S), with values higher than 0. 70. From La Serena, the CI decreases gradually, reaching values of about 0. 60 in the Atacama Region (North) and further South in the Biobío Region.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to {{determine the influence of}} Representative Volume Element (RVE) size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> polymer foam microstructure on its compressive mechanical properties, including stiffness, plateau stress and onset strain of densification. Periodic two-dimensional RVEs have been generated using a Voronoi-based numerical algorithm and compressed. Importantly, self-contact of the foam’s internal microstructure has been incorporated through the use of shell elements, allowing simulation of the foam well into the densification stage of compression; strains of up to 80 percent are applied. Results suggest that the stiffness of the foam RVE is relatively insensitive to RVE size but tends to soften as the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> increases. Both the shape of the plateau stress and the onset strain of densification are sensitive to both the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity.</b> Increasing the RVE size and decreasing the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to result in a decrease of the gradient of the plateau region, while increasing the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to decrease the onset strain of densification.

40|$|Purpose. State of {{railway track}} {{must meet the}} {{conditions}} of safety, comfort and smooth ride. The presence <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> deteriorates the dynamics of interaction of track and rolling stock, causes speed limiting, creates the possibility of movement safety violation. This brings up the question concerning {{the study of the}} factors leading to the possibility <b>of</b> track <b>irregularities</b> and the process of their development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the processes of emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the area of unequal vertical elasticity of railway track using mathematical modelling. Methodology. Railroad under the trains works as the system of elastic bodies, so the emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> can be represented as the transition from elastic to permanent strain. Irregularity development will affect the dynamics of interaction between track and rolling stock not only at the wheel location directly in the area <b>of</b> <b>irregularity,</b> but also at a certain distance beyond. Therefore, to study the development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> including those along the track, it is necessary to model the process of wheel load movement along the area. The adopted model consists of a wheel set moving on inertia-free beam and resting on individual supports. It is described by Lagrange differential equations. The work introduced the hypothesis that the level of permanent strain is distributed in proportion to the dynamic deflection derivative. Findings. Location <b>of</b> vertical longwise <b>irregularity</b> does not necessarily reproduce the location of the problem area. While in operation the vertical irregularity extends not only in depth but also along the track, herewith the increase in length is accompanied by the displacement of local maxima and the emergence of new ones. This leads to the development of so-called «pits» when approaching unequal-elastic areas. Originality. The work provides further development of tasks for track and rolling stock interaction modelling, in particular aimed to take into account the unequal elasticity areas and their influence on the formation <b>of</b> the track <b>irregularities.</b> The paper proposes new approaches to modelling the transition from elastic to permanent strain that allows predicting the development <b>of</b> track <b>irregularity</b> sizes depending on the area characteristics. Practical value. The results obtained by the author can be used to determine the schedule for track equal elasticity renovation works, as well as to analyse the measures aimed at the prevention <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in areas with variable elasticity of railway track...|$|R
