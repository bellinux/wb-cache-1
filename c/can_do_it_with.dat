If I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

In this case the dealer will push the top card upwards and strike the {{partially}} exposed second card. Although this method is usually employed {{with the use of}} a gaffed dealing shoe, an expert card mechanic <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a regular dealing shoe as well.|$|E

Further in May in an interview with ABC Radio Weiland said that he had reunited with the band permanently for a tour and an album, which however was denied a few days later by Slash in an interview with 93X.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. Did {{he do that}} because it {{made it easier to}} play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> one finger, you should. If you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, but now I think I do. I just have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet.

[...] Dungy said that his other hopes for You Can Do It were that it would encourage parents to read to their kids and that kids would learn the lesson of pursuing whatever field they were talented in, even if it might be not the popular thing to do.|$|E
2500|$|Uber {{announced}} on September 25, 2016, {{that it was}} looking into urban transportation with flying vehicles. At Re/code's Nantucket Conference, the head of Uber's products, Jeff Holden stated that the company wanted to [...] "someday offer our customers as many options as possible to move around ... {{doing it in a}} three-dimensional way is an obvious thing to look at." [...] A statement at the American Helicopter Society International-led joint workshop on Transformative Vertical Flight on September 29, Uber product manager Nikhil Goel stated that [...] "To us, urban air transportation is simply a key initiative or our mission, right? Not only because it can cut congestion – it's got massive potential to do that – but it allows us to move people from Point A to B much, much faster than you would otherwise. If you do it in all-electric vehicles, you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> zero emissions." [...] Uber published a 99-page [...] "white paper" [...] exploring the possibility of developing a [...] "fully electric, vertical-takeoff-and-landing plane" [...] network (called [...] "Elevate") within ten years, for use in short journeys. Although technically feasible, the development of such a program is expected to encounter safety and regulatory obstacles.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{distinct}} {{elements of the}} Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody. Jim Miller observed, [...] "On straight rockers they [...] sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead [...] … on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, [...] "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, [...] "Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn cliché into high art, so can the best pop music. Brian does that. He can take common or hackneyed material and raise it from a low place to the highest, and he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> an economy of imagery that speaks to the casual observer—bam! It's no coincidence that he was working {{at the same time that}} [...] Warhol and [...] Lichtenstein were doing pop art." [...] Wilson wrote in 1990: ...|$|E
