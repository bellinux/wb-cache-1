40|$|Regulation of Ca(2 +) {{homeostasis}} plays {{a critical}} role in oligodendrocyte function and survival. Cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors have been shown to regulate Ca(2 +) levels and/or K(+) currents in a variety of cell types. In this study we investigated the effect of cannabinoid compounds on the Ca(2 +) influx elicited in cultured oligodendrocytes by transient membrane depolarization with an elevated extracellular K(+) concentration (50 mM). The CB(1) receptor agonist arachidonoyl-chloro-ethanolamide (ACEA) elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of depolarization-evoked Ca(2 +) transients in oligodendroglial somata with a maximal effect (94 +/- 3) % and an EC(50) of 1. 3 +/- 0. 03 microM. This activity was mimicked by the CB(1) /CB(2) agonist CP 55, 940, {{as well as by the}} endocannabinoids N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), whereas the CB(2) receptor selective agonist JWH 133 was ineffective. The CB(1) receptor antagonist AM 251 (1 microM) also reduced the Ca(2 +) response evoked by high extracellular K(+) and did not prevent the inhibition elicited by ACEA (3 microM). Nevertheless, the ability of ACEA and AEA to reduce depolarization-evoked Ca(2 +) transients was significantly reduced in oligodendrocytes from CB(1) receptor knockout mice, as well as by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Bath application of the inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (Kir channels) blockers BaCl(2) (300 microM) and <b>CsCl(2)</b> (1 mM) reduced the size of voltage-induced Ca(2 +) influx and partially prevented the inhibitory effect of ACEA. Our results indicate that cannabinoids inhibit depolarization-evoked Ca(2 +) transients in oligodendrocytes via CB(1) receptor-independent and -dependent mechanisms that involve the activation of PTX-sensitive G(i/o) proteins and the blockade of Kir channels.
