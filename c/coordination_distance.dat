The EXAFS technique {{has been found to}} provide a very accurate determination of the next-neighbor <b>coordination</b> <b>distances,</b> but it is inconclusive in the determination of the coordination numbers and polyhedral environment. Conversely, quantitative analysis of the XANES spectra unambiguously shows the presence of an average 5 -fold coordination in both the MeOH and DMSO solution, ruling out the usually proposed octahedral Jahn-Teller distorted geometry. The EXAFS and XANES techniques provide coherent values of the Cu-O first-shell distances that are coincident in the two solvents.

In this work, aerosol samples collected in different seasons and at different locations in the Qingdao region were examined by means of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) K-edge analysis of Fe, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fe content analysis. The results showed that an iron ion in aerosol particles is surrounded on average by 5. 8 (coordinated) O ions. For the six samples examined, the coordination number of the first Fe-O coordination subshell is always 3 with a <b>coordination</b> <b>distance</b> (with O) in the range of 1. 952 ~ 1. 966 ± 0. 002 Å, while the coordination number of the second subshell varies from 2. 2 to 3. 0 with a <b>coordination</b> <b>distance</b> of 2. 108 ± 0. 002 Å. The coordination is approximately consistent with that of α-Fe 2 O 3, suggesting that iron in aerosol samples is mainly present in the form of α-Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|The {{structure}} and dispersion {{of the active}} phase present in carbon-supported Mo and Co-Mo sulfide catalysts were studied by means of Mo K-edge EXAFS. In situ EXAFS measurements were carried out at liquid N 2 temperature on freshly sulfided (at 673 K) catalysts. Due to the high signal-to-noise ratio of the experimental data, detailed information about the structural parameters of the active phase could be obtained. The catalysts probably consist of small MoS 2 -like particles with an auerage local ordered structure of 5 - 6 Mo atoms (Mo/C) and 7 - 8 Mo atoms (Co-Mo/C). Comparison with literature data shows that the MoS 2 dispersion in these carbon-supported catalysts is probably as good as in their alumina-supported counterparts. A detailed EXAFS data analysis shows the presence of carbon neighbors next to the Mo atoms in both catalysts with a Mc-C <b>coordination</b> <b>distance</b> of 2. 1 * 0. 1 A. This short distance could imply an intimate interaction between the active phase and the carbon support, which may explain the high active-phase dispersion.
