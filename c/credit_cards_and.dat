5|$|The A6 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A1 motorway. The two roads connect at the Bosiljevo2 interchange, forming a unified toll system. Since the A1 motorway is operated jointly by Autocesta RijekaZagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. As of October 2010, the toll charged along the A6 route between Bosiljevo2 interchange (A1 Bosiljevo exit) and the Kikovica mainline toll plaza varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled and ranges from 6.00 kuna (0.82 euros) to 33.00 kuna (4.52 euros) for passenger cars and 25.00 kuna (3.42 euro) to 139.00 kuna (19.04 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>and</b> debit cards. A number of prepaid toll collection systems are also used, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENCan electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>and</b> E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E
