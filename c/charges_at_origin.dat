Unit transportation costs, fixed <b>charges,</b> sources <b>at</b> <b>origins,</b> demands <b>at</b> destinations, conveyances capacities {{are assumed to}} be crisp or fuzzy. Budget constraints at destinations are imposed. It is also assumed that transported units are crisp. So the problem is formulated as constraint optimization programming problem in crisp and fuzzy environments. As optimization of fuzzy objective as well as consideration of fuzzy constraint is not well defined, credibility of fuzzy event are used to transform the problem into equivalent crisp problem. The reduced crisp problem is solved following Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method using lingo software. The models are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

In this paper, {{we would like to}} present new exact static antimonopole-monopole-antimonopole (A-M-A) configurations. The net magnetic charge of these configurations is always negative one, whilst the net magnetic <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> the <b>origin</b> is always positive one for all positive integer values of the solution parameter $m$. However, when $m$ increases beyond one, vortex rings appear coexisting with these A-M-A configurations. The number of vortex rings increases proportionally with the value of $m$. They are magnetically neutral and are located in space where the Higgs field vanishes. We also show that a single point singularity in the Higgs field need not corresponds to a structureless 1 -monopole <b>at</b> the <b>origin</b> but to a zero size monopole-antimonopole-monopole (MAM) structure. These exact solutions are a different kind of BPS solutions as they satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equation but possess infinite energy due to a point singularity <b>at</b> the <b>origin</b> of the coordinate axes.

In this classical problem, the quantum dot is modeled as a simple dielectric sphere (in place of a uniform, positively-charged sphere as in the plum pudding model) in which free, or excess, electrons reside. The electrostatic N-electron configurations {{are found to be}} exceptionally close to solutions found in the Thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere. Notably, the plotted distribution of geometry-dependent energetics has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbitals in natural atoms as arranged on the periodic table of elements. Of great interest, solutions of the Thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each N-electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring (N-1)-electron solution with one <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> the <b>origin.</b> However, when treated within a dielectric sphere model, the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity with respect to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} perturbative static {{solutions to}} the classical field equations of noncommutative U(1) gauge theory for the three cases: a) space-time noncommutativity, b) space-space noncommutativity and c) both a) and b). The solutions tend to the Coulomb solution at spatial infinity and are valid for intermediate values of the radial coordinate r. They yield a self-charge inside a sphere of radius r centered about the origin which increases with decreasing r for case a), and decreases with decreasing r for case b). For case a) this may mean that the exact solution screens an infinite <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> the <b>origin,</b> while for case b) it is plausible that the charge density is well behaved <b>at</b> the <b>origin,</b> as happens in Born-Infeld electrodynamics. For both cases a) and b) the self-energy in the intermediate region grows faster as r tends to the origin {{than that of the}} Coulomb solution. It then appears that the divergence of the classical self-energy is more severe in the noncommutative theory {{than it is in the}} corresponding commutative theory. We compute the lowest order effects of these solutions on the hydrogen atom spectrum and use them to put experimental bounds on the space-time and space-space noncommutative scales. For the former, we get a significant improvement over previous bounds. We find that cases a) and b) have different experimental signatures. 1...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{entering}} a star system, light sails {{are subject to}} both gravitational forces and radiation pressure, and can use both in concert to modify their trajectory. Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the sail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also. We investigate the dynamics of so-called "photogravimagnetic assists" of sailcraft around α Centauri A, a potential first destination en route to Proxima Centauri (the goal of the Breakthrough Starshot program). We find that a 10 m^ 2 sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 μC/g or higher will need {{to take account of}} magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The magnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and allow capture onto closer orbits around a target star. However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change resulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic field lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on well-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at α Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the final destination (Proxima) post-assist. Fortunately for Breakthrough Starshot, nanosails are less prone to charging en route than their heavier counterparts, but can still accrue relatively high <b>charge</b> <b>at</b> both the <b>origin</b> and destination, when travelling at low speeds. Photogravimagnetic assists are highly non-trivial, and require careful course correction to mitigate against unwanted changes in trajectory.

As a result, a particle is not a localized entity, in the classical sense, but has a localized energy extremum. The particle/wave aspect of matter is inherent in the particle/wave equation describing elementary particles. Furthermore, the Heisenberg uncertainty and Planck-Einstein-de Broglie relations, and the Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations follow naturally from the particle/wave equation. In addition, we incorporate a new and more physical interpretation of spin angular momentum. This is a proposed connection between my theory [1] and relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM).
