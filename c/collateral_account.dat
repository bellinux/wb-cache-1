5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a <b>collateral</b> <b>account</b> at a neutral third party.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between the use of <b>collateral</b> and <b>accounting</b> conservatism for a sample of Chinese firms during 2001 to 2006.

The negative relation is consistent with <b>collateral</b> and <b>accounting</b> conservatism being used as substitute mechanisms to reduce the agency cost of debt.

40|$|Background—The {{relationship}} between epicardial stenosis and microvascular resistance remains controversial. Exploring {{the relationship is}} critical, as many tools used in interventional cardiology imply minimal and constant resistance. However, variable collateralization may impact well on these measures. We hypothesized that when <b>collateral</b> supply was <b>accounted</b> for, microvascular resistance would be independent of epicardial stenosis. Methods and Results—Forty patients with stable angina were studied before and following percutaneous intervention. A temperature and pressure sensing guide wire was used to derive microvascular resistance using the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), defined as the hyperemic distal pressure multiplied by the hyperemic mean transit time. Lesion severity was assessed using fractional flow reserve. For comparison, evaluation of an angiographically normal reference vessel from the same subject also was undertaken. Both simple IMR (sIMR) and IMR corrected for collateral flow (cIMR) were calculated.

For (arbitrarily) small delays, the history effect offsets the growth benefits from international borrowing and dampens growth, and it leads to both leapfrogging in long-run levels and growth breaks. When large enough, the history effect originates growth reversals and we connect the latter to leapfrogging. Finally, we argue that the model accords with the reported evidence on changes in the growth rate at break dates.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} This paper investigates two conjectures from the theoretical literature on financial intermediation concerning the special role of banks in financing opaque {{and small business}} and thus fostering growth. The first is that more opaque firms borrow preferably from banks that should be better at collecting and processing soft information, i. e. small banks, banks that specialize in relationship-based lending, and banks that {{are close to the}} firm’s headquarters. The second is that the comparative advantage these banks have in screening and monitoring opaque borrowers should be reflected in the characteristics of the credit relationships they develop with such borrowers. The first step of the analysis consists of estimating the probability of a specific bank-firm matching, characterizing banks by size, specialization in small business lending and proximity. The second step estimates the effect of the bank-firm matching on the ratio of credit drawn from credit lines – an inverse measure of credit availability- and the amount of <b>collateral</b> posted, <b>accounting</b> for the non-randomness of the matching between banks and firms.

Central banks are susceptible to losses resulting from double default events where a reverse repo counterparty and the collateral default simultaneously. While there is a broad range of theoretical models for assessing and quantifying portfolio credit risk and double default, this paper aims to propose a practical framework that uses a portfolio of notional CDS contracts with dummy counterparties to represent collateral for loan exposures. A key advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented within CreditManager – a widely used risk IT application. Extensions to enable modelling of additional heterogeneous pools of <b>collateral</b> and to <b>account</b> for the effect of overcollateralisation are also outlined.

Since the bank monitors the value of <b>collateral</b> (defined as <b>accounts</b> receivable plus inventory) at high frequency through the transactions account of the borrower, this unique access to useful information gives banks an advantage over other lenders.

The basic argument of this paper is that a paradigm shift is urgently necessary: from the mainstream approach which tends to focus overwhelmingly on the material poverty and deprivation experienced by some children, deemed by definition to be those in households-in-poverty, to one that widens the field of vision to include both material and non-material dimensions of wellbeing of all children. Such a shift carries significant implications for modes of conceptualization and recognition; for the focus and substantive content of analysis, for the choice of methods and tools, for the framing and design of policies and interventions, and more generally for the scope of debates and discourse pertaining to the development rights of children.

40|$|Introduction: We {{discuss the}} case of a 51 year old former mid-wife {{presented}} to the NHS Luton and Bedfordshire psychiatric services with a 2 year history of increasing forgetfulness with significant impairment to her daily function. She was diagnosed with non-familial early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (EOAD) and started on 8 mg daily of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Galantamine. Methods: The information for this study was gathered from patient notes, consultant, <b>collateral</b> and personal <b>accounts.</b> Periodic outpatient consultations at the NHS Luton and Bedfordshire psychiatric services were used to monitor Mrs LF’s global, functional and behavioral progress. These were supplemented with the mini mental state examination (MMSE) at each outpatient appointment. Results: The graph of MMSE scores illustrates severe decline in scores, followed eventually by increase in score to sustained improvement while continuing on galantamine. Functionally, this lady has successfully negotiated a divorce, moved into her own accommodation, began travelling on holidays, including abroad, with friends, and has now embarked on a new relationship. Discussion: Whilst only being a single case study, this demonstrates the significant benefits which are attainable with Galantamine in EOAD. The extent of this improvement may be a result of individual variation, or perhaps a greater efficacy for this drug in the subset of ‘early-onset’ AD patients, which has long been thought to share the same mechanism as traditional AD. The responsiveness to Galantamine in this patient may suggest an alternative mechanism of Early Onset Alzheimer’s Disease to typical Alzheimer’s Disease in the over 65 ’s. Conclusion: The case raises interesting questions as to whether EOAD should be considered distinct to typical (over 65 ’s) AD, given the greater than expected response to Galantamine...|$|R
