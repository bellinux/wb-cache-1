25|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall).|$|E

50|$|In anatomy, the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> are {{the places}} where the {{diaphragm}} (-phrenic) meets the ribs (costo-).|$|R
50|$|Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) may exhibit deepened lateral <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> due to hyperaeration {{of the lungs}} and cause a false deep sulcus sign.|$|R
50|$|On {{radiological}} studies, thickening of the pleura can be visualized extending along various rib levels using conventional chest x-rays and CT scans. The lesion {{usually has}} calcification, poorly defined and irregular borders, and associated blunting of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> can {{normally}} {{be seen as}} on chest x-ray as a sharply-pointed, downward indentation (dark) between each hemi-diaphragm (white) and the adjacent chest wall (white). A small portion of each lung normally reaches into the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle.</b> The normal angle usually measures thirty degrees.|$|E
5000|$|In radiology, {{the deep}} sulcus sign on a supine chest {{radiograph}} is an indirect indicator of a pneumothorax. In a supine film, {{it appears as}} a deep, lucent, ipsilateral <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> within the nondependent portions of the pleural space {{as opposed to the}} apex (of the lung) when the patient is upright. The <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> is abnormally deepened when the pleural air collects laterally, producing the deep sulcus sign.|$|E
5000|$|Chest x-ray is {{the first}} test done to confirm the {{presence}} of pleural fluid. The lateral upright chest x-ray should be examined when a pleural effusion is suspected. In an upright x-ray, 75 mL of fluid blunts the posterior <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle.</b> Blunting of the lateral <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> usually requires about 175 mL but may take as much as 500 mL. Larger pleural effusions opacify portions of the hemithorax and may cause mediastinal shift; effusions > 4 L may cause complete opacification of the hemithorax and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side.|$|E
30|$|Chest {{radiography}} {{may show}} ill-defined nodules or reticulonodular changes [16]. Pulmonary alterations are generally symmetric, predominating at the upper-middle lungs and sparing the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles.</b> Initial radiographic findings {{may be just}} minimally {{or not at all}} significant, smoke-related emphysema being the only conspicuous finding.|$|R
3000|$|Chest X-ray (CXR), {{the most}} {{commonly}} used radiographic modality to detect pleural effusion, is able to detect only relatively large effusions.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the chest radiographs of 50 adult patients with histologically verified histiocytosis X, proposes a radiological classification, and examines {{the role of}} radiology in assessing the prognosis of the disease. Radiologically the lesions predominate {{in the middle and}} lower lung fields, usually sparing the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles,</b> and are typically micronodular, reticular, or cystic. These features are especially suggestive of histiocytosis X if lung volume is normal or increased, there is an associated pneumothorax, they occur in a young male and there are no other intrathoracic changes (pleural or mediastinal). The three evolutionary patterns of improvement, stabilisation, and worsening are analysed with respect to the initial radiological features; one which carries a good prognosis is sparing of both <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Pleural {{thickening}} {{may cause}} blunting of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle,</b> but is distinguished from pleural fluid {{by the fact}} that it occurs as a linear shadow ascending vertically and clinging to the ribs.|$|E
5000|$|With pleural effusion, fluid often {{builds up}} in the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> (due to gravity). This can push the lung upwards, {{resulting}} in [...] "blunting" [...] of the costophrenic angle.The posterior angle is the deepest.Obtuse angulation is sign of disease.|$|E
50|$|Pleural {{effusion}} - Presence of {{a significant}} amount of fluid within the pleural space. This finding must be distinguished from blunting of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle,</b> {{which may or may not}} represent a small amount of fluid within the pleural space (except in children when even minor blunting must be considered a finding that can suggest active TB).|$|E
30|$|Chest {{radiography}} in AIP shows bilateral airspace opacifications {{with air}} bronchograms, which usually spare the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> [80]. The lung volume may {{be lower than}} normal. Consolidations often become more diffuse and in progression to the organising stage the radiograph shows a ground-glass appearance with irregular linear opacities.|$|R
40|$|The 1980 International Labour Office (ILO) {{classification}} of posteroanterior chest radiographs {{was used to}} obtain the scores for profusion of small opacities and pleural abnormalities of 172 men with confirmed or suspected disease of the lungs due to asbestos. After allowance had been made for age, stature, and smoking habit the quantitative score for area of diffuse pleural thickening seen in profile on both lateral chest walls contributed to reductions in inspiratory capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and forced expiratory flow rates. Occlusion of one or both <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> {{in the presence of}} diffuse thickening was associated with further reduction in inspiratory capacity. Profusion of small opacities was associated with a reduction in transfer factor. Diffuse pleural thickening and occlusion of <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> were associated with relatively low values for the forced expiratory flow rates (MEF 50 FVC) and FEV 1 /FVC, whereas small opacities were associated with relatively high values. Thus overall increased, normal, or reduced values of MEF 50 FVC and FEV 1 /FVC might occur, depending on the distribution of the radiographic abnormalities. The findings contribute to the validation of the ILO pleural scores; those for diffuse pleural thickening and occlusion of <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> should be used jointly with the scores for profusion of parenchymal small opacities in interpreting the lung function of persons exposed to asbestos...|$|R
25|$|Decubitus – taken {{while the}} patient is lying down, {{typically}} on his side. useful for differentiating pleural effusions from consolidation (e.g. pneumonia) and loculated effusions from free fluid in the pleural space.

50|$|The costodiaphragmatic recess, {{also called}} the costophrenic recess or phrenicocostal sinus, is a {{potential}} space in the pleural cavity, at the posterior-most tips of the cavity, located at the junction of the costal pleura and diaphragmatic pleura (in the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle).</b> It measures approximately 5 cm vertically and extends from the eighth to the tenth rib along the mid-axillary line.|$|E
50|$|Blunting of <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> (in adults)—Loss of {{sharpness}} {{of one or}} both costophrenic angles. Blunting {{can be related to}} a small amount of fluid in the pleural space or to pleural thickening and, by itself, is a non-specific finding (except in children, when even minor blunting may suggest active TB). In contrast a large pleural effusion, or the presence of a significant amount of fluid in the pleural space, may be a sign of active TB at any age.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall).|$|E
30|$|Identification of a {{pneumothorax}} on portable radiographs can be challenging, {{and presence}} of a “deep sulcus” sign constitutes an important clue (Fig.  1 b). Expiratory radiographs are no longer recommended [12]. Note that the most nondependent portion of the pleural space is the inferior lateral hemithorax, especially in children. Therefore, {{it is important that}} the lateral <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> be included on all supine radiographs being used to evaluate for pneumothorax.|$|R

5000|$|These {{are short}} {{parallel}} {{lines at the}} lung periphery. These lines represent interlobular septa, which are usually less than 1 cm in length and {{parallel to one another}} at right angles to the pleura. They are located peripherally in contact with the pleura, but are generally absent along fissural surfaces. They may be seen in any zone but are most frequently observed at the lung bases at the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> on the PA radiograph, and in the substernal region on lateral radiographs. [...] Causes of Kerley B lines include; pulmonary edema, lymphangitis carcinomatosa and malignant lymphoma, viral and mycoplasmal pneumonia, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis. They can be an evanescent sign on the CXR of a patient in and out of heart failure.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis is {{confirmed}} histologically by tissue biopsy. Hematoxylin-eosin stain of biopsy slide will show features of Langerhans Cell e.g. distinct cell margin, pink granular cytoplasm. Presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy and immuno-cytochemical features e. g. CD1 positivity are more specific. Initially routine blood tests e.g. full blood count, liver function test, U&Es, bone profile are done to determine disease extent and rule out other causes. Radiology will show osteolytic bone lesions and {{damage to the}} lung. The latter may be evident in chest X-rays with micronodular and interstitial infiltrate in the mid and lower zone of lung, with sparing of the <b>Costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> or honeycomb appearance in older lesions. MRI and CT may show infiltration in sella turcica. Assessment of endocrine function and bonemarrow biopsy are also performed when indicated.|$|E
50|$|Chest {{radiography}} is {{the preferred}} means of initial diagnosis for hemothorax. Upright radiography is preferred but supine films may be taken when upright radiography is not feasible due to the clinical situation. Tube thoracostomy may be done prior to imaging when patients have sustained blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma and display unstable hemodynamics, have respiratory failure with absent or decreased breath sounds, show tracheal deviation, or have serious penetrating injuries. In upright radiography, hemothorax is suggested by blunting of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> or partial or complete opacification of the hemithorax, in which the lateral side of the chest appears bright and the lung appears pushed away toward the center; the air-filled lung normally appears as a dark space on radiographic film. In {{the case of a}} small hemothorax, several hundred milliliters of blood can be hidden by the diaphragm and abdominal viscera. In supine patients, signs of hemothorax may also be subtle on radiographic film, because the blood will layer in the pleural space, and {{can be seen as a}} haziness in one half of the thorax relative to the other side.|$|E
5000|$|A subpulmonic {{effusion}} is excess fluid that collects at {{the base}} of the lung, in the space between the pleura and diaphragm. It is a type of pleural effusion in which the fluid collects in this particular space, but can be [...] "layered out" [...] with decubitus chest radiographs. There is minimal nature of <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> blunting usually found with larger pleural effusions. The occult nature of the effusion can be suspected indirectly on radiograph by elevation of the right diaphragmatic border with a lateral peak and medial flattening. The presence of the gastric bubble on the left with an abnormalagm of more than 2 cm can also suggest the diagnosis. Lateral decubitus views, with the patient lying on their side, can confirm the effusion as it will layer along the lateral chest wall.also subpulmonic space-this refers to the space below the lungs in which the subpulmonic fluid fills.subpulmonic fluid are common particularly in trauma cases where the apparent hemidiaphragm appears defieted and the apex is displaced laterally.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} non-human primate model in biomedical research. As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25 - 36 months, 37 - 48 months, 49 - 60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to {{examine the effect of}} age, sex, and age × sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age × sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49 - 60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1. 00, and the angulation of bilateral <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles</b> were sharp. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracic radiographic parameters for the healthy cynomolgus monkey presented here should prove useful in veterinary practice, research involving non-human primate models of respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, and morphological studies on cynomolgus monkeys...|$|R
40|$|Metastatic prostatic {{adenocarcinoma}} presenting as {{a primary}} lung disease is rare. We present a 52 -year-old male with a 3 -month history of cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss with clinical and radiological findings suggestive of a primary lung disease: Bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities with blunting of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles,</b> multiple diffuse foci of consolidations and nodules, predominantly subpleural and located in the lower lobes, and diffuse interlobular septal thickening and peribronchial thickening. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained. Cytospin smears were diagnostic for a low-grade adenocarcinoma. Clinically, the patient had elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels greater than 5, 000 ng/mL. Because of this, immunocytochemistry for PSA was performed which was positive, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. This unusual case of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate first diagnosed by BAL highlights the significance of available clinical information {{and the use of}} immunocytochemistry for proper diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} is {{an uncommon}} diffuse cystic lung disease in adults. In rare cases, it can involve extrapulmonary organs {{and lead to}} endocrine abnormalities such as central diabetes insipidus. A 42 -year-old man presented with polyphagia and polydipsia, {{as well as a}} dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary system failed to show the posterior pituitary, which is a typical finding in patients with central diabetes insipidus. This condition was confirmed by a water deprivation test, and the patient was also found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Computed tomographic scanning of the lungs revealed multiple, irregularly shaped cystic lesions and small nodules bilaterally, with sparing of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles.</b> Lung biopsy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery revealed pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. On a follow-up visit, only 1 year after the patient had quit smoking, clinical and radiological improvement was significant.

5000|$|Diffuse pleural {{thickening}} (DPT) is non-circumscribed fibrous thickening of the visceral pleura with areas of {{adherence to the}} parietal pleura and obliteration of the pleural space. It often extends over the area of an entire lobe or lung, with fibrotic areas involving costophrenic angles, apices, lung bases, and interlobar fissures. The thickness ranges from less than 1 mm up to 1 cm or more and may extend for a few millimeters into the lung parenchyma. Fibrous strands (“crow's feet”) extending from the thickened pleura into the lung parenchyma can be often detected on CT scan. Diffuse {{pleural thickening}} develops 20 to 40 years after first exposure. [...] All types of asbestos can cause diffuse pleural thickening and a dose-related relationship has been described. It is thought that asbestos fibres that reach the pleura induce subpleural fibroblasts and mesothelial cells to produce scar tissue and collagen deposition, resulting in subpleural thickening. Pleural plaques often coexist with DPT although the latter is rare compared with pleural plaques. According to the Australian Surveillance of Australian Workplace Based Respiratory Events (SABRE) scheme, DPT accounted for 22% of all asbestos-related diseases. [...] It usually begins with an inflammation of the pleura that {{is accompanied by a}} pleural effusion. Most patients complain of exertional breathlessness, however, chest pain has been also associated with this disorder. DPT has a significant impact on pulmonary function, causing a decrease in forced vital capacity, reducing total lung capacity and diffusing capacity. The restrictive impairment is a result of adhesions of the parietal with the visceral pleura as well as possible diaphragmatic involvement. Medical imaging is needed for diagnosis of diffuse pleural thickening. The appearance on a postero-anterior chest radiograph is of a continuous, irregular pleural shadowing. In accordance with the International Labour Organization (2000) classification, diffuse pleural thickening is considered to be present if there is obliteration of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> in continuity with ≥3 mm pleural thickening. CT scanning is more sensitive than chest radiography and can detect early pleural thickening (i.e. 1-2mm in thickness). The most commonly used classification system defines diffuse pleural thickening as a continuous sheet of pleural thickening more than 5 cm wide, more than 8 cm in craniocaudal extent, and more than 3 mm thick. Most patients are only mildly impaired by diffuse pleural thickening. Treatment options are limited but any new onset or severe pain should be investigated to exclude malignancy. In most compensation systems, patients are eligible for compensation which corresponds to the severity of disability.|$|E
40|$|During a cross {{sectional}} medical survey of 2815 insulation workers with 30 {{years or more}} from onset of asbestos exposure conducted from 1981 to 1983, a positive history of benign pleural effusion was found in 20 (0. 71 %). Two or three such episodes had occurred in four of these 20 subjects. The chest x ray abnormalities in these cases were characterised by pleural fibrosis in 19 and diffuse pleural fibrosis with blunting of the corresponding <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> in 16. In the total group of 2815 insulation workers diffuse pleural fibrosis was found in 142 (5. 0 %). Thus diffuse pleural fibrosis with blunting of the corresponding <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angle</b> is a frequent residual abnormality after benign pleural effusion.

50|$|A pleural {{effusion}} appears {{as an area}} of whiteness on a standard posteroanterior chest X-ray. Normally, {{the space between the}} visceral pleura and the parietal pleura cannot be seen. A {{pleural effusion}} infiltrates the space between these layers. Because the pleural effusion has a density similar to water, it can be seen on radiographs. Since the effusion has greater density {{than the rest of the}} lung, it gravitates towards the lower portions of the pleural cavity. The pleural effusion behaves according to basic fluid dynamics, conforming to the shape of pleural space, which is determined by the lung and chest wall. If the pleural space contains both air and fluid, then an air-fluid level that is horizontal will be present, instead of conforming to the lung space. Chest radiographs in the lateral decubitus position (with the patient lying on the side of the pleural effusion) are more sensitive and can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid. At least 300 mL of fluid must be present before upright chest X-rays can detect a pleural effusion (e.g., blunted <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles).</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryWe {{report a}} {{nonsmoker}} adult with histologically proven pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax. An 18 -year-old, nonsmoker student had {{shortness of breath}} for a decade. PFTs and lung volume study (obtained one month post-operation) showed a mild obstructive airway with bronchodilator response and a decreased DLco with a positive methacholine challenge test (PC 20 < 8 mg/ml). Chest radiograph revealed right-sided pneumothorax and diffuse reticular infiltrates. HRCT revealed scattered, thin-walled lung cysts in all lobes without sparing of the <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles.</b> The patient underwent a thoracotomy for wedge resection and the diagnosis of PLCH was confirmed by {{a demonstration of the}} accumulated Langerhans cells histiocytes (positive CD 1 a) in lung tissue. Pneumothorax was managed by bleblectomy and pleurodesis. This case report demonstrates BHR concurrent with PLCH on a nonsmoker patient. The combination of BHR and PLCH may confer a detrimental synergistic effect on the respiratory symptoms, deterioration of lung function, lung cysts and hence spontaneous pneumothorax on these patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of ectopic kidneys {{is one in}} 900 autopsies. Thoracic kidney is the rarest form of all renal ectopias and is mostly asymptomatic. Intrathoracic kidneys may be congenital or acquired. We present here {{the case of a}} 13 -year-old boy who presented with the complaint of mild dyspnea even at rest, which had occurred periodically since birth. An X-ray showed obliterated <b>costophrenic</b> <b>angles.</b> He was referred to our department for ultrasound examination of the whole abdomen. Upon examination by ultrasound, both kidneys were not visualized in the lumbar region or in the lower abdomen. Therefore, color Doppler was used to locate the renal arteries. Both renal arteries were observed arising from their usual site and ascending upwards. The left kidney was visualized in the chest; it was malrotated and placed transversely above the diaphragm. The right kidney was visualized higher up in the chest but below the diaphragm. A computed tomography pyelogram and computed tomography angiogram also confirmed our findings. No intervention was required because the intrathoracic location of a kidney typically does not affect renal function and does not lead to other symptoms...|$|R
