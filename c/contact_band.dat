50|$|Anathyrosis is the {{technical}} term {{for how the}} ancients frequently dressed the joints of stone blocks. Since the blocks were set directly against each other {{without the use of}} mortar, the joint had to be exact. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} time required to form such a joint, the joining face of the stone was finished and smoothed only in a narrow <b>contact</b> <b>band</b> on the sides and top, while the interior of the face was recessed. The <b>contact</b> <b>band</b> looks somewhat like a doorframe, and the term - it was coined by the ancients - is allusive. Thyra (θύρα) is a Greek word for “door”, and so “door framing” is anathyrosis. This technique was frequently employed in the construction of walls, including ashlar construction, and might be used between the drums of columns as well. Close examination of where this technique was applied to a stone can help to reveal its place within a structure or whether other stones were joined to it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Quasi-elastic {{contact method}} {{can be used}} to study the wheel-rail contact {{relationship}} of worn tread. In this paper, wheel-rail contact relationship of standard and worn LMA tread have been calculated under the condition of rigid contact and quasi-elastic contact. By comparing with rigid contact which produces sharp contact points with a large dispersion, quasi-elastic contact results in uniformly smooth contact points without jump, what’s more, it’s more content with the real wheel-rail contact conditions. And also quasi-elastic contact has a significant effect on the worn tread under different operation mileage. Wheel-rail contact point distribution under different mileage is calculated, and according to tread band, a new measurement of wheelset lateral displacement is developed, which provides a simple way to determine the wheel set lateral displacement only by observing and measuring the tread <b>contact</b> <b>band</b> under different operation mileage. The wheel-rail contact relationship calculation method has been used to the real worn wheel profile test process, where the theory analysis results agreed with the real experiment results well to some extent...|$|E
40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear of unfilled and fiber-filled elastomers was studied both with experiments and with finite element simulations. Wear experiments with elastomer seals exhibited two distinct regimes: an initial, "break-in" period {{followed by an}} "aggressive wear" period. During the break-in period, few abrasive particles are able to penetrate the seal's <b>contact</b> <b>band,</b> and no substantial seal wear occurs. During the aggressive wear period, abrasive particles aggregate into distinct clusters which advance at a linear rate and abrasively wear the seal. Filled elastomer seals were shown to have break-in periods significantly longer than those of unfilled elastomer seals. The aggressive wear rates and mechanisms of filled and unfilled elastomer seals were determined to be virtually identical. Abrasion patterns typical of the {{abrasive wear}} of elastomers were observed. Micromechanical modeling of the abrasive wear of unfilled elastomers predicted {{the formation of the}} observed abrasion patterns. Modeling of fiber-filled elastomers indicated that fibers should have no effect on the aggressive wear process. Additional modeling of fiber-filled elastomers suggested several mechanisms by which the fibers might extend the break-in period of the seal. Seal wear experiments with well-defined slurries offered strong evidence that the fibers extend the break-in period of the seal by inhibiting particle ingestion and cluster formation. A seal lip surface geometry is proposed to simulate the effect of the fibers. by Ethan M. Parsons. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 165 - 167). Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} MML and the surrounding basement lead to observe that: 1) The MML is completely bounded by main fragile fault planes and ductile structures. 2) The main foliation of the MML is only partly aligned to the regional E-W trending S 2 foliation. 3) The MML has different N-S trending mylonitic foliation and fracture cleavage compared to S/SW dipping mylonitic foliation of the southern basement. 4) The apparent absence of garnet in the MML metabasites suggest a different metamorphic imprint in respect to the surrounding basements. 5) There are not sufficient petrographic data to determine the belonging of the MML to the different structural units recognized in the Southern Alpine basement. 6) The MML reached the Permo-Triassic thermal peak {{similar to that of}} surrounding basement. Within the MML, the marble-metabasite contact has locally characteristics that we interpreted as not correlated to the metamorphic evolution but resembling relicts of primary magmatic intrusion: i) lobes, ii) compositional layering parallel to the contact of the lobes, iii) diffuse sulphide mineralization at the metabasite-marble contact, iv) small interfingering of metabasite protruding within the marble resembling a fluidification of the hostrock, v) crosscutting of the dykes, vi) parallel tabular structures with geometry not related to any metamorphic event thus resembling dykes, vii) <b>contact</b> <b>band</b> characterized by mixing of phases suggesting a widespread mixing at the protoliths interface. The seven described structures, all found in the MML, resemble those of a basalt intrusion within a carbonatic sediment only partially lithified. Major, trace and REE elements of Musso and Lugano-Val Grande Fault Zone (LGFZ) metabasites, analyzed in this study, are compared to other metabasite and volcanics of the Southern Alps available in the literature: I) metabasites with and without cummingtonite from the Piona Peninsula (DOZ), II) metabasites from the Strona Ceneri Border Zone (SCBZ) and III) Triassic basaltic volcanics of the central Southern Alps. The LGFZ sample have very similar geochemical characteristics to SCBZ that allow to suppose a common origin. Musso samples show an in-between composition: they have similar Ba, Na, Al content to the SCBZ, LGFZ, and Triassic volcanics but have TiO 2, Zr, Nb, MgO and SiO 2 content similar to Anisian (a group belonging to the Triassic set) and part of the DOZ. This could be due to a partial metamorphic imprint with elements depletion, or a different volcano-tectonic origin, more {{similar to that of the}} Anisian basalts. Genetic diagrams, from literature, confirm the division between the DOZ and the SCBZ. SCBZ and LVGZ appear as a compact group with a MORB to tholeiitic composition. The Musso samples belong to intraplate products with alkali-basalt to tholeiitic composition. These data are only partially sufficient to suppose a particular role of the Musso marble lenses and the included metabasites but definitely testify the existence of this tectonic structure since at least Variscan age (Devonian-Early Carboniferous). In Chapter 3, the ductile and brittle structures mapped along the Musso Fault Zone (MFZ) are described and a hypothesis for the Musso fault evolution is presented, touching the following main stages: 1) Marble lenses (Musso marble) are boudinaged along the MFZ and represent the oldest rocks characterizing it. Their age is still not determined, but the included metabasites have unique geochemical characteristics that do not allow to attribute them nor to DOZ nor the Strona Ceneri Border Zone amphibolite suites. We speculate a Devonian perhaps to Early Carboniferous age for the marble and the included metabasites. 2) Geochronological and thermal data from literature shows that the Northern Lake Como region experienced a Triassic thermal peak and development of intra-basement shear zones, thinning the Adriatic crust. In this context the oldest structures directly and incontrovertibly connected to the MFZ are the Fe-carbonate veins, of Early Triassic age, which are preserved also boudinaged within the Musso mylonites. The same can be said also for the LGFZ, as demonstrated by extensive siderite mineralization presence in the Gaeta mine and Val Cavargna. 3) Fe-mineralized veins are found in similar extensional context in all the Southern Alps, along faults bordering Permo-Triassic continental basins. Therefore it is possible that also the MFZ was bordering a small basin to the N, nonetheless justifying the presence of the sedimentary Monte Pozzuolo and Sasso Pelo. In the Lake Como area continental extension started in the Norian and continued to Liassic. 4) The mylonites of the MFZ possibly developed after the Early Triassic thermal peak when temperature dropped to around 250 - 350 °C allowing crystallization of quartz-albite-chlorite-sericite associations, before the emplacement of the 220 Ma old Piona’s pegmatites which do not show mylonitization even near the MFZ. 5) From the Liassic to the onset of the Alpine compressive stage there is a long inactivity time span, with no records for the MFZ. 6) Alpine N-S contraction brought into a steep south dipping position the Paleozoic to Mesozoic rocks and lineaments and caused upper and middle crust to detach from their substratum along the MFZ. This contraction was responsible of the ductile-brittle deformation observed along the MFZ with development of widespread and abundant pseudotachylytes. Similar structures dated along the Orobic and Porcile thrusts yielded two sets of ages: an older Late Cretaceous and a younger Eocene ages. 7) Widespread distensive cataclastic bands along the Musso and contiguous faults, possibly indicating a distensive to transpressive stage, by correlation with nearby data of Val Morobbia, may belong to Oligocene. 8) Finally, right strike-slip dextral brittle deformation took place, visible along the largest fault planes, most probably driven by the Insubric Line...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTransthyretin (TTR) is an amyloidogenic protein whose {{aggregation}} {{is responsible}} for several familial amyloid diseases. Here, we use FTIR to describe the secondary structural changes that take place when wt TTR undergoes heat- or high-pressure-induced denaturation, as well as fibril formation. Upon thermal denaturation, TTR loses part of its intramolecular β-sheet structure followed {{by an increase in}} nonnative, probably antiparallel β-sheet <b>contacts</b> (<b>bands</b> at 1616 and 1686 cm− 1) and in the light scattering, suggesting its aggregation. Pressure-induced denaturation studies show that even at very elevated pressures (12 kbar), TTR loses only part of its β-sheet structure, suggesting that pressure leads to a partially unfolded species. On comparing the FTIR spectrum of the TTR amyloid fibril produced at atmospheric pressure upon acidification (pH 4. 4) with the one presented by the native tetramer, we find that the content of β-sheets does not change much upon fibrillization; however, the alignment of β-sheets is altered, resulting in the formation of distinct β-sheet <b>contacts</b> (<b>band</b> at 1625 cm− 1). The random-coil content also decreases in going from tetramers to fibrils. This means that, although part of the tertiary- and secondary-structure content of the TTR monomers has to be lost before fibril formation, as previously suggested, there must be a subsequent reorganization of part of the random-coil structure into a well-organized structure compatible with the amyloid fibril, as well as a readjustment of the alignment of the β-sheets. Interestingly, the infrared spectrum of the protein recovered from a cycle of compression-decompression at pD 5, 37 °C, is quite similar to that of fibrils produced at atmospheric pressure (pH 4. 4), which suggests that high hydrostatic pressure converts the tetramers of TTR into an amyloidogenic conformation...|$|R
