He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy, the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in <b>communality,</b> and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings.|$|E

After rotation, factor loadings are re-scaled so that the <b>communalities</b> have original values. Although the standard errors of rotated factor-loadings have been discussed from the general view point of estimation of parameters with restrictions, the actual standard errors for normalized rotation have not been provided. In this paper a method of estimating the asymptotic sandard errors in the normalized orthomax rotation is given. Two artificial examples are provided in which standard errors become extremely large with or without normalization...|$|R
40|$|A lot of {{different}} composition mechanisms claim to permit aspect-oriented software development because {{they are able to}} handle the problem of tangled code which was the original target of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, it becomes hard to compare those different approaches, because they usually focus on different kinds of tangled code. For comparing different approaches it is necessary to find some <b>communalities</b> between tangled code. Such <b>communalities</b> can be used to classify tangled code and in that way the impact of new aspect-oriented approaches can be determined in respect to what classes of tangled code they are able to handle. A general purpose aspectoriented approach should be able to handle all kinds of tangled code...|$|R

The present paper presents the first steps in the elaboration of a functional approach, which aims to uncover the <b>communalities</b> and differences between different cognitive control tasks and their effects. Based {{on the idea that}} responses in cognitive control tasks qualify as operant behaviour, we propose to reinterpret cognitive control tasks in terms of operant contingencies and cognitive control effects as instances of moderated stimulus control. We illustrate how our approach can be used to uncover <b>communalities</b> between topographically different cognitive control tasks and can lead to novel questions about the processes underlying cognitive control...|$|R

5000|$|Factor {{analysis}} {{depends on}} measuring distances between observations : {{the choice of}} a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis [...] ) are among the more widely used. More complicated models, using <b>communalities</b> or rotations have been proposed.|$|R
50|$|This is {{equivalent}} to minimizing the off-diagonal components of the error covariance which, in the model equations have expected values of zero. This is to be contrasted with principal component analysis which seeks to minimize the mean square error of all residuals. Before the advent of high speed computers, considerable effort was devoted to finding approximate solutions to the problem, particularly in estimating the <b>communalities</b> by other means, which then simplifies the problem considerably by yielding a known reduced correlation matrix. This was then used to estimate the factors and the loadings. With the advent of high-speed computers, the minimization problem can be solved iteratively with adequate speed, and the <b>communalities</b> are calculated in the process, rather than being needed beforehand. The MinRes algorithm is particularly suited to this problem, but is hardly the only iterative means of finding a solution.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the factor {{analysis}} showed that {{the choice of a}} factor explains 34.3  % of the total dispersion while the solution of two factors explains 63.6  %. The corresponding extraction <b>communalities</b> for the factor analysis ranged from 0.366 to 0.813, thus most of the variance of these variables was accounted for by this two-dimensional factor solution.|$|R
50|$|Females {{performed}} provisioning, cell closure, cell construction, and oviposition every day. Females who foraged {{came back}} and formed a pollen ball by shaping loose groups of pollen into a sphere. If a male was present, the female would mate with the male during departure from the cell. If the nest {{did not have a}} male, the female would groom themselves and then return to the cell to continue making pollen balls. 1 or 2 copulations would occur before an egg was laid, then after the egg was laid the cell was closed by the female bee. The females then left the cell again for a feeding trip, not returning with any pollen.Female observation thus demonstrates that Macrotera portalis is communal as there is no observed cooperative or agonistic behavior. Further, females did not open cells to care for larvae after ovipositing or show proof of kleptoparasitism or robbing. <b>Communality</b> has been proven as an advantage due to nest defense for certain wasps and bees, yet the lack of observation of females at the nest entrance for defense demonstrates that defense is not associated with <b>communality</b> for M. portalis. Rather, <b>communality</b> is most likely due to the high cost of solitary nest development.|$|E
