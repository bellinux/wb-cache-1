First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these <b>cast</b> top <b>deck</b> crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the <b>cast</b> top <b>deck</b> by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings."

Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members.

The Bridge The bridge bears the date 1813 and the name Salford Iron Works and was built as a carriage bridge over the river Goyt on the Brabyns estate of Nathaniel Wright, who from 1793 was connected with collieries in Poynton 1. The bridge spans about 46 feet and has three cast iron arch ribs, each made in two pieces. Circular cast iron rings frame the spandrels between the ribs and the <b>cast</b> iron <b>deck</b> beams. The deck is wooden, with stone edgings (possibly an addition), and the railings comprise four rows of wrought iron bars through cast iron posts. Simple but finely worked stone pillars flank {{the ends of the}} bridge, and the masonry abutments are equally substantial and impressive. The bridge stonework is echoed in the lower parts of the adjacent square gatehouse building, and again in the masonry of the surviving weir upstream (known as 'Wrights Folly'). Three factors have contributed to the survival of the Brabyns Park Bridge with all its original features intact, and generally in quite good condition. Firstly, as an estate bridge, the good initial design and detailing of the bridge has not been compromised by twentieth century modification and strengthening works carried out to meet onerous highway safety requirements.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Most of {{the modern}} medium-span bridges in the United States are {{constructed}} with precast, prestressed concrete girders. An accurate estimate of girder camber is important for all parties involved in the precast concrete industry for several reasons. The most important reason is that achieving vertical alignment, and <b>casting</b> the <b>deck,</b> becomes much more difficult if the cambers of two adjacent girders in the bridge are not the same, since the girders are generally too large to make the correction by brute force. In addition, any uncertainty of the estimated camber in the precast, prestressed concrete girders can lead to construction delays and can increase material and labor costs. However, the prediction and control of camber over time is difficult, because camber varies with many parameters, such as the concrete properties, curing methods, and temperature variations. The goal {{of this research is}} to improve the methods to predict camber in precast, prestressed concrete girders, with an emphasis on determining the effect of temperature on camber both during curing and in service. The research focused on monitoring and collecting fabrication camber to calibrate the current models for predicting camber. Temperature histories at release and service were also recorded to examine the effect of fabrication temperatures on initial camber and the effect of daily temperature variations on service camber. Two models were developed to predict daily camber changes under solar radiation based on ambient temperature data. The predictions of the models correlate well with the data collected during the research...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{concrete}} structures, that is built in {{the sixties and seventies}} of the twentieth century, need to be re-evaluated. It should be judged whether their capacity is still sufficient for the increased traffic loads. Acoustic emission (AE) is a non-destructive technique that can possibly be used to get a better insight in the structural state of these concrete structures. However, interpretation the AE measurements is challenging and is even more difficult when the concrete is cracked by for example alkali–silica reaction. Due to the existing cracks the wave attenuation affects the acoustic emission measurements. For an investigation into the capacity of pre-stressed <b>cast</b> in-between <b>decks</b> a 1 : 2 scale bridge was loaded in the Stevin laboratory of Delft University of Technology under two-way shear. In this preliminary research it was investigated whether AE-measurements can be used to get an idea about the structural condition of a structure, or more precise, to what extent the ultimate capacity is reached. For testing the concrete in-between decks a cyclic loading procedure is applied. It appeared that cyclic loading resulted in a lower capacity in comparison with the previously performed static loading experiments. There was no AE indication of early failure due to cyclic loading. Usually applied parameters, like ‘Kaiser Effect’ and ‘Calm Ratio’ are investigated. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the location of cracks could be determined by the emitted sound during the fracture process and applying a relatively large numbers of AE-sensors (so-called source location). In this article the performed AE measurements are reported and results discussed. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Reliable solution of fire resistance up to R 180, proved by several realized fire tests and supported by appropriate design procedures, eliminates any needs for special on fire case oriented additional structural improvements. Design process in agreement with EC 3 and EC 4 covers with complexity all the relevant bearing capacity and structural stiffness questions for beams and also for supported slab elements. Specific requirements on acceptable parameters of floor vibrations are covered by experience and tests, carried out on realized structures and supported by suitable calculation models. All unique solutions are verified as a standard by corresponding experimental methods. Utilization of Deltabeams in slim floors is saving constructional heights, reduces energy consumption in buildings, simplifies the realization of constructional cable and pipe lines; parallel to that it significantly reduces time of erection and total costs.
