This {{temperature was}} used to pasteurize composts for experiments. Of nine thermophilic fungal species, only S. thermophilum and Myriococcum thermophilum grew well on pasteurized compost in test tubes. The effect of both species on the crop yield of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms was studied. In solid-state fermentation rooms called tunnels, compost was pasteurized and inoculated. After incubation, the inoculated organisms were reisolated and counted, showing their successful colonization. The yield of mushrooms on inoculated composts was almost twice that on the pasteurized control. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of S. thermophilum in <b>compost</b> <b>preparation.</b> Inoculation is not necessary for traditional <b>compost</b> <b>preparation.</b> Naturally occurring strains of S. thermophilum, present in ingredients, readily colonize compost during preparation.

The mixture of wastewater sludge and some bulking agents produces a biosolid to be composted at adequate composting facilities. The composting process is chemically and microbiologically complex and requires an adequate aeration of the biosolid (e. g., with a turner machine) for proper maturation of the compost. Adequate (near) real-time monitoring of the compost maturity process is highly difficult and the operation of composting facilities is not as automatized as other industrial processes. Spectroscopic analysis of compost samples has been successfully employed for compost maturity assessment but {{the preparation of the}} solid compost samples is difficult and time-consuming. This manuscript presents a methodology based on a combination of a less time-consuming <b>compost</b> sample <b>preparation</b> and ultraviolet, visible and short-wave near-infrared spectroscopy. Spectroscopic measurements were performed with liquid compost extract instead of solid compost samples. Partial least square (PLS) models were developed to quantify chemical fractions commonly employed for compost maturity assessment.

40|$|Overreliance {{on fossil}} fuel based inputs, and {{transport}} of inputs and products {{is seen by}} many as a threat to long-term agricultural and food system sustainability. Many organic, biodynamic, and low-input farmers limit off-farm inputs, attempting instead to farm within the carrying capacity of their land or local environment. These farmers often accept lower farm productivity because they see reduced reliance on non-renewable inputs as more sustainable. Documentation of low-input agricultural systems through both replicated research trials and case studies is needed in order to better understand perceived and real advantages and tradeoffs. The goal of our study was twofold: (1) to compare liming and biodynamic (BD) preparations in improving pasture on a moderately acidic pasture soil through stimulation of soil microbial activity; (2) to place these findings {{within the context of a}} whole farm analysis of economic, plant, and animal health.

30|$|The {{bioconversion}} {{process can}} be fastened {{with the use of}} such functionally characterized microbial inoculants that possess high enzymatic activities for lignocellulosic degradation (Choudhary et al. 2016). Industrial composting for mushroom production is an established biological procedure to produce Agaricus bisporus (Jurak et al. 2014). Mushrooms are among the most fascinating fungal organisms to be used as pretreatment degraders of the lignocellulose constituents of crop residues and perform improved enzymatic release of monosaccharides for biofuels. It also helps to convert residual biomass into valuable protein-rich edible fruits of high nutritional importance (Jurak et al. 2015). <b>Compost</b> <b>preparation</b> for mushroom production involves microorganisms that decompose natural lignocellulose into simple mineral components, on which mushroom mycelial mass grows and produces fruiting bodies (Mouthier et al. 2017). Therefore, besides obtaining high-value protein-rich functional food product from the bioconversion of crop residues by mushroom fungi (Chang 2008), farmers can also get value-added compost for their farms to enhance crop production and soil fertility. Fortification of raw compost with plant growth-promoting bacteria and biocontrol agents like Trichoderma harzianum potentially enhance suppressiveness of soil-borne diseases and efficacy of compost microbiota against pathogenic diseases (Pugliese et al. 2011; Ros et al. 2017). Mushroom production is of high economic significance {{in many parts of the}} world (Marshall and Nair 2009; Zhang et al. 2014) and compost fortified with beneficial microorganisms also has potentials of enterprising (Awad and Khaled 2012; Sarkar and Chourasia 2017).|$|E

Additionally, these {{systems can be}} organically or conventionally managed. Although labour demand {{is one of the}} main activities contributing to the total production costs of the plantations and it may highly differ between production systems, there are still scarce data and information available. In this study we present the labour demands of five different production systems in a newly established cocoa plantation in Alto Beni, Bolivia. The trial was established in 2008 within the framework of the SysCom programme (www. systems-comparison. fibl. org) and comprises monoculture and agroforestry systems under organic and conventional management and one successional agroforestry system with organic management, each one replicated four times. From 2009 to 2013, the establishment phase of the plantation, the time spent in all the farming activities, mainly weeding, pruning, harvesting and fertilising was recorded separately for each plot. Overall, total labour demand was higher in the successional and agroforestry systems compared with the monocultures, mainly due to the time devoted to the management of the multifunctional trees and by crops. However, no significant differences were found between organic and conventional management under both agroforestry and monoculture systems. On the contrary, the time needed for pruning the cocoa trees was higher in the monocultures. Similarly, the time spent in cocoa harvesting was also higher in the monocultures, especially under conventional management, which well correspond to the yield obtained. Weeding was high time demanding the first years of the plantation but decreased with the time. However, no differences between the monoculture and agroforestry systems and between the organic and conventional management were found.

I explore the constraints to CA adoption through in-depth interviews with 18 CA farmers, four disadopters and 11 non-adopters in one community where two NGOs have been promoting CA. One NGO promotes the basin method with compost production while the other promotes direct seeding with herbicide use. Though the farmers described many benefits in using CA there was little sign of adoption beyond the plots where NGOs provided inputs. Most farmers were adamant that CA could perform better than conventional agriculture only if they applied fertilizer (or large quantities of compost). This constraint {{can be explained by the}} nutrient immobilizing effect caused by both reduced tillage and the retention of mulch. With planting basins, adoption is also constrained by increased labor requirements for land <b>preparation,</b> <b>compost</b> production and weeding.

What are the tasks of agricultural machinery and agricultural engineering research in organic farming? Which agricultural engineering results support {{the basic principles of}} organic farming? Hypothesis: Future agricultural engineering for organic farming embraces three essential areas: support of animal welfare, use of renewable energy, and strengthening sustainable crop production. Modern gantry technology offers ideal support for organic crop production objectives. Method: A literature review of scientific gantry research publications within the past ten years. Results/discussion: Present gantry research results show that gantry technology saves energy and work, increases profitability, improves and preserves soil structure, extends working time periods and assures timeliness of critical operations, offers independence frm weather and day light during field work, allows precise fertiliser distribution and irrigation, supports high precision intra-row weed control, field mapping for various objectives, automation of repeating work steps, automated ope rations by computer vision, and grants better working conditions. Gantry technology may in future support organic crop production by · continuous mapping of plot specific soil and flora data, · plot mapping for habitat specific operations, · cultivation of perennial vegetation covering, · mixed cropping/alley cropping systems using allelopathic effects for weed and pest resistance, · precise distribution of <b>compost</b> and <b>preparations,</b> · in time sowing, in time weed and pest control, · mulch based cultivating and fertilising. Gantry technology renders excellent opportunity for transdisciplinary research and co-operation between life scientists and engineers. Scientists from different disciplines are required for measuring and observation of biodiversity indicators, energy balance, soil tilth, nutrient balance, quality of work, and quality of products. Dynamic observation methods like appearance of plants during all stages of development using computer vision and image-processing methods may support human observation. The habitat specific information can be used to plan a crop rotation including mixed cropping or strip cultivation solu-tions, green mulch fertilisation, and allelopathic effects best suited for a given plot or even for a specific location of a given plot.

NT and RT may improve {{the environmental and}} economic performance of organic farming, {{but they are still}} not common practice among organic farmers. This paper presents the effects of tillage [RT versus conventional tillage (CT) ], fertilization (slurry versus manure <b>compost)</b> and biodynamic <b>preparations</b> (with versus without) on soil fertility indicators such as soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial biomass and microbial activity, soil nutrients and nutrient budgets in an organic farming system during the first six-year crop rotation period of a long-term experiment on a clayey soil in a temperate climate. RT caused stratification of soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial properties and soil nutrients in the soil profile. Under RT, Corg in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer increased from 2. 19 to 2. 61 % (w/w) from 2002 to 2008, whereas it remained constant under CT. In both tillage treatments, Corg remained constant in the 10 - 20 cm soil depth. Microbial biomass C increased by 37 % under RT in the 0 - 10 cm soil depth and microbial activity [dehydrogenase activity (DHA) ] was enhanced by 57 %. Soil microbial biomass C and DHA in the 10 - 20 cm soil depth were also higher under RT (+ 10 and + 17 %, respectively). Soluble soil P and K were 72 and 40 %, respectively, higher in 0 - 10 cm soil depth under RT when compared with CT. Fertilization showed no effects on the measured soil properties. Biodynamic preparations increased solely the Cmic-to-Nmic (soil microbial biomass C to soil microbial biomass N) ratio by 7 % in the 0 - 10 cm soil depth. Nutrient budgets for P were balanced in all treatments, but N and K exports were higher under RT compared to CT. We conclude that RT is a suitable method for increasing indicators of soil fertility in organic farming systems. The combined effects of RT and an organic farming system with a diverse, ley-based crop rotation and organic fertilization merit further promotion and it may be considered for supporting actions by the agricultural policy scheme...|$|R

One of the methods of transferring this agricultural knowledge is by publishing a series of simple, low-priced manuals on agricultural practices in the tropics, entitled Agrodok. In collaboration with Agromisa, CTA has funded the translation of several publications in their Agrodok series. In 1987 two of these books were translated into French: La defense des sols contre ['erosion sous les tropiques (Tropical soil erosion control) and the most recent Beekeeping in the tropics. There are some 15 other titles available, including Soya Backyard rabbit farming in the tropics, Preparation and use of <b>compost,</b> and Small-scale <b>preparation</b> of dairy products. This booklet, Beekeeping in the tropics provides information on how to work with the western honeybee, Apis mellifera, with further notes on Apis cerana the eastern honeybee. It makes the point that, although the information is gathered from different parts of the world, the management of bees must be adapted to the species and race of bee, climate and vegetation. It is designed to take beginners through everything they need to know from simple recognition and practice to necessary techniques and identification and treatment of pests and diseases, with chapters on economics of beekeeping the composition of the colony, species and races of bees, daily life of the colony, practice, the first season, the harvest, wax, and pollen. However, the point is made emphatically that only by working for at least one year with an experienced beekeeper can the finer skills be learned.

Our objective was to adapt reduced tillage to organic farming by quantifying effects of tillage (plough versus chisel), fertilization (slurry versus manure <b>compost)</b> and biodynamic <b>preparations</b> (with versus without) on soil fertility indicators and crop yield. The experiment was initiated in 2002 on a Stagnic Eutric Cambisol (45 % clay content) near Frick (Switzerland) where the average annual precipitation is 1000 mm. This report focuses on the conversion period and examines changes as tillage intensity was reduced. Soil samples were taken from the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depths and analysed for soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial biomass (Cmic), dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and earthworm density and biomass. Among the components tested, only tillage had any influence on these soil fertility indicators. Corg in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer increased by 7. 4 % (1. 5 g Corg kg- 1 soil, p < 0. 001) with reduced tillage between 2002 and 2005, but remained constant with conventional tillage. Similarly, Cmic was 28 % higher and DHA 27 % (p < 0. 001) higher with reduced than with conventional tillage in the soil layer 0 - 10 cm. In the 10 - 20 cm layer, {{there were no significant differences}} for these soil parameters between the tillage treatments. Tillage had no significant effect on total earthworm density and biomass. The abundance of endogeic, horizontally burrowing adult earthworms was 70 % higher under reduced than conventional tillage but their biomass was 53 % lower with reduced tillage. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spelt (Triticum spelta L.) yield decreased by 14 % (p < 0. 001) and 8 % (p < 0. 05), respectively, with reduced tillage, but sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) yield was slightly higher with reduced tillage. Slurry fertilization enhanced wheat yield by 5 % (p < 0. 001) compared to compost fertilization. Overall, Corg, Cmic, and DHA improved and yields showed only a small reduction with reduced tillage under organic management, but long-term effects such as weed competition remain unknown...|$|R
