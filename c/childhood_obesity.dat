5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of <b>childhood</b> <b>obesity.</b> Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because <b>childhood</b> <b>obesity</b> often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{nutrition}} {{of children and}} reducing rates of <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> have been high priorities for the New Zealand Government since 2000. The rates of <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> vary by ethnic group and socio-economic status, and reducing inequalities in the burden of <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> is an explicit aim of the Government. This paper aims to identify policy options that {{will have an impact}} on the economic drivers of <b>childhood</b> nutrition and <b>obesity.</b> A qualitative model of the economic determinants of childhood nutrition within a household setting is presented. The model identifies cost barriers to sufficient healthy food as a key factor in the foods purchased and consumed within a household. An analysis of New Zealand household economic and nutritional data then identifies policy options to improve childhood nutrition and reduce rates of overweight and obesity. These policy options focus on cost subsidies for non-discretionary household expenditure and reducing the price of food to increase access to nutritious foods, including frui...|$|R
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. <b>Childhood</b> <b>obesity</b> has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with <b>childhood</b> <b>obesity,</b> challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E
5|$|Ofuji was {{responsible}} for creating the basic scenario from which Brotherhoods main writers would work: working from the character sheets created by the writers of Final Fantasy XV, he created the entire scenario based on each character's background characteristics, such as Ignis' love of baking and Prompto's <b>childhood</b> <b>obesity.</b> The anime focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and includes interpersonal scenes {{that could not be}} included in the game. Its storyline details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes tie directly into the events of , a free tech demo showing Noctis' journey through a dreamworld during a near-death experience. The anime also serves as an introduction for potential players to the characters. In previous Final Fantasy games, the player party was built up gradually {{over the course of the}} game. In Final Fantasy XV, the complete party will be available from the start, and since the backstory moments could not be fitted into the game, the anime serves as a similar means of allowing players to sympathize with them. Each episode's event also helped detail some of the characters' different social classes, with the cited example being the contrast between Prompto's small house and hard-working parents when compared to Gladiolus' more luxurious life.|$|E
40|$|Background This {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} investigates {{the feasibility of}} using established methods and routinely generated data from the statutory primary school health-screening programme to estimate prevalence rates for <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> in children from a rural area in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Method Paper-based records in the primary school health service for County Leitrim and parts of County Cavan in north-west of ROI were hand searched to identify children attending senior infant classes during academic year 2001 / 2002. Electronic calculation of body mass index (BMI) and age at examination was carried out. Application of age- and sex-specific cut-off points from international Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and United Kingdom (UK) standard definitions for <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> {{was used to determine}} age- and sex-specific prevalence rates for <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity.</b> Results The eligible cohort was almost completely identified and consisted of 361 children. Weight and height measurements were available on 328 (91 %) children aged between 4. 22 and 7. 92 years. IOTF standard application gave prevalence rates of 25 % for obesity and overweight in boys and 26 % in girls. With the UK growth standard, this increased to 34 % in boys and reduced to 23 % in girls. Conclusion It is feasible to generate prevalence rates for <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> from data routinely obtained through the statutory school health-screening programme in ROI. This study suggests levels of <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> comparable to other Western societies.

40|$|We {{systematically}} reviewed {{research examining}} {{the association between}} gestational diabetes (GDM) and <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity.</b> We identified studies from three sources: (1) a PubMed search of articles published between January 1990 -January 2011, (2) reference lists of publications from the PubMed search, and (3) reference lists of review articles. We included studies that examined GDM separately from pregestational diabetes and <b>childhood</b> overweight or <b>obesity</b> defined as BMI > 85 th or 95 th percentile. A total of 12 studies {{were included in the}} systematic review. Crude odds ratios for the relationship between GDM and <b>childhood</b> overweight or <b>obesity</b> ranged from 0. 7 to 6. 3; in 8 studies, the associations were not statistically significant.

40|$|Children?s {{risk for}} {{overweight}} and obesity is particularly high {{in rural areas}} of the United States. Many health, psychosocial, and economic consequences are associated with <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity,</b> which concerns health researchers and professionals. But how and why might rural children be more at risk for being overweight and obese? This dissertation investigates <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> in rural settings through three separate studies. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify determinants and mechanisms of childhood obesity-related behaviors that are specific to rural locations. The findings from the review show that lack of health resources and poverty within the rural environment may impact children?s social environment and individual factors. However, results are inconclusive and there {{continues to be a}} lack of studies focusing on linking environmental influence with individual factors. Second, a meta-analysis of current research evidence was conducted to assess the efficacy of rural interventions designed to reduce <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity.</b> Results showed that interventions have been efficacious yet modest, with a mean effect size of 0. 18. Moderating variables were also examined. Mean intervention effect size was moderated by children?s age and intervention duration. Last, secondary data were used to examine the association between rural food stores and availability and affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables. A multilevel analytical approach was used to determine if rural location was associated with availability and affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables. After controlling for other variables, results showed that rural location was not associated with fruit and vegetable availability and affordability. The findings from this dissertation suggest that the area of rural <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity</b> remains understudied. More research is needed {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms of social ecological influences on diet, physical activity, and <b>childhood</b> overweight and <b>obesity.</b> This area of research, however, is rife with opportunities for public health education and promotion.
