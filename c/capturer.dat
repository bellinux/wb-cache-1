Riddick is resourceful, {{and seeks to}} break out of the prison by any means necessary. His <b>capturer</b> is the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters. Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, who lives in the sewer tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E

Within minutes, the soldiers had been overpowered without casualties on either side and the ship was turned towards Tallinn. When a German plane was spotted approaching the ship, the <b>capturers</b> panicked as the largely red temporary state flag of Finland could be mistaken for the red Soviet revolutionary flag, and hastily {{replaced it with a}} large white tablecloth. The German pilot later commented that he would have attacked Tarmo if he had not dropped all his bombs on the Soviet icebreaker Yermak earlier that day.|$|R

60|$|But my correspondent's second {{objection}} is more important. He charges me with actually {{ignoring the}} value of communication (if it exists) between this world and the next. I do not ignore it. But I do say this--That a different principle attaches to investigation in this spiritual field from investigation in any other. If a man baits a line for fish, the fish will come, even if he declares {{there are no such}} things as fishes. If a man limes a twig for birds, the birds will be caught, even if he thinks it superstitious to believe in birds at all. But a man cannot bait a line for souls. A man cannot lime a twig to catch gods. All wise schools have agreed that this latter capture depends to some extent on the faith of the <b>capturer.</b> So it comes to this: If you have no faith in the spirits your appeal is in vain; and if you have--is it needed? If you do not believe, you cannot. If you do--you will not.|$|E

5000|$|... • Hawkins: The second hostage {{made his}} <b>capturers</b> look like fools {{when he showed}} that he knew the country better than they did. Hawkins knew Mary Brigid O’Connell and had learned to dance {{traditional}} dances such as the Walls of Limerick. Hawkins had too much old talk {{and as a result}} lost at cards. He always argued with Noble into the early hours. He worried Noble about Religion with a string of questions that would puzzle a cardinal. He had a deplorable tone and he could throw bad language into any conversation. A communist and agnostic, Hawkins always argued with Noble about capitalism and Religion. When it came to his execution Hawkins could not believe his fate and thought his friends were joking. Hawkins terror at the prospect of death highlights the futility of the conflict in terms of humanity and the friendships that developed between the <b>capturers</b> and hostages. The actual execution of Hawkins provides a chilling climax to this episode.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} staff experiences in managing data and/or information when utilising the District Health Information System (DHIS) as a support mechanism for data quality improvement, including the strengths and weaknesses of current data management processes. It was also aimed to identify key barriers and to make recommendations on how data management can be strengthened. Key informants included in this study were those based at the district office (health programme managers and information officers) and at the primary health care (PHC) facilities (facility managers, clinical nurse practitioners and data <b>capturers).</b> An exploratory, descriptive and generic qualitative study was conducted. Consent was requested from each participant. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The study findings highlighted strengths, weaknesses and key barriers as experienced by the staff. Strengths, such as having data <b>capturers</b> and DHIS software at most if not all facilities, were highlighted. The weaknesses and key barriers highlighted were staff shortages of both clinical and health management information staff (HMIS), shortage of resources such as computers and Internet access, poor feedback, training needs and data quality issues. Most of the weaknesses and key barriers called for further and proper implementation of the District Health Management Information Systems (DHMIS) policy, the standard operating procedures (SOP), the eHealth strategy and training of the staff, due to the reported gaps between the policy and the reality and/or practice at the facilityHealth StudiesM.

After both commanders agreed with the takeover, Telegin obtained a forged travel order for Tarmo to head to the Gulf of Finland on 3 March 1918 to assist icebound Soviet transport ships. He also sent two of his soldiers ashore, reducing the number of enemy soldiers to six. Shortly before the departure, Roos brought Senators Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the future President of Finland, and Jalmar Castrén to Tarmo disguised as engineers who had arrived to investigate ships damaged by ice.
