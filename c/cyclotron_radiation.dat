5|$|Decimetric radio {{emission}} (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959. The origin of this signal {{was from a}} torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator. This signal is caused by <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|In megatesla {{magnetic}} fields a quantum mechanical effect may suppress energy transfer from the ions to the electrons. According to one calculation, bremsstrahlung losses {{could be reduced}} to half the fusion power or less. In a strong magnetic field <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> is even larger than the bremsstrahlung. In a megatesla field, an electron would lose its energy to <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> in a few picoseconds if the radiation could escape. However, in a sufficiently dense plasma (ne > 2.5×1030 m−3, a density {{greater than that of}} a solid), the cyclotron frequency is less than twice the plasma frequency. In this well-known case, the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> is trapped inside the plasmoid and cannot escape, except from a very thin surface layer.|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, {{bremsstrahlung}} or braking {{radiation is}} any radiation produced {{due to the}} deceleration (negative acceleration) of a charged particle, which includes synchrotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a relativistic particle), <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of electrons and positrons during beta decay. However, the term is frequently used in the more narrow sense of radiation from electrons (from whatever source) slowing in matter.|$|E

25|$|X-ray {{detector}} All plasma loses {{energy by}} emitting light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, for any reason. If {{the reason is}} deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is <b>Cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> at low speeds and Synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as Bremsstrahlung radiation. X-rays are termed in both hard and soft, based on their energy.|$|E
25|$|Deceleration {{of a free}} charged particle, such as an electron, {{can produce}} visible radiation: <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation,</b> {{synchrotron}} radiation, and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster {{than the speed of}} light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.|$|E
25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles. These speed changes {{can be caused by}} Bremsstrahlung radiation or <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> or synchrotron radiation or electric field interactions. The radiation can be estimated using the Larmor formula and comes in the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some of their energy to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E
40|$|The Fourier series {{expansions}} {{are used}} to obtain the expressions for {{the components of the}} electromagnetic field at an arbitrary point of observation and for the total energy loss of a gyrating charged particle in a non-ionized medium having a uniform magnetic field. For a non-relativistic particle, it is shown that the total energy loss is split into the collision loss, whose formula is found to be the familiar one for linear motion, and the loss due to <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiations.</b> The relative magnitude of the latter to the former is less than (wo/wp) 2, where Wo is the cyclotron frequency and wT}= 4 rrnee~/me where ne and me are the density and mass of electrons in the medium. In the relativistic case, we get the explicit formula of the polarization loss, depending upon the external magnetic field, and of the losses due to the Cerenkov and synchrotron radiations. The spectral and angular distributions of these two radiations are discussed...|$|R

Therefore the CYTRAN routine was coupled with the ASTRA transport code.

25|$|It was {{noticed that}} when the {{magnetron}} was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the radio frequency spectrum. This occurs because {{a few of the}} electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation,</b> these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is {{a small percentage of the}} overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the microwave region.|$|E
2500|$|The antiprotons {{are still}} hot when {{initially}} trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation,</b> and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via Coulomb collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by {{the application of}} short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than [...] While the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap, a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a Surko-style positron accumulator. This cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons. Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, {{and within a few}} microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid on the {{radiation}} of a charged particle moving in a constant uniform magnetic field.

Considering non-relativistic and relativistic approximations, we analyze <b>cyclotron</b> and synchrotron <b>radiations</b> in detail. Radiation peculiarities caused by the presence of the solenoid may be considered as a manifestation of Aharonov-Bohm effect in the radiation.

50|$|<b>Cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> has a {{spectrum}} with its main spike at thesame fundamental frequency as the particle's orbit, and harmonics at higher integral factors. Harmonics {{are the result}} of imperfections in the actual emission environment, which also create a broadening of the spectral lines. The most obvious source of line broadening is non-uniformities in the magnetic field; as an electron passesfrom one area of the field to another, its emission frequency will change with the strength of the field. Other sources of broadening include collisional broadening as the electron will invariably fail to follow a perfect orbit, distortions of the emission caused by interactions with the surrounding plasma, and relativistic effects if the charged particles are sufficiently energetic. When the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, <b>cyclotron</b> <b>radiation</b> is known as synchrotron radiation.|$|E
