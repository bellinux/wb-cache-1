5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than <b>conservative</b> <b>management,</b> which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non <b>conservative</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E

30|$|During {{the first}} hours of severe sepsis, venodilatation, transudation of fluid from the {{vascular}} space into the tissues, reduced oral intake, and increased insensible loss combine to produce hypovolemia [17]. Ventricular dysfunction and arteriolar dilation volume depletion contribute to impaired global perfusion and organ function. Treating hypovolemia {{is the most}} important component of the early management of severe sepsis. However, once the patient has received an adequate fluid challenge, further fluid challenges may not increase cardiac output and global perfusion [13]. Additional fluid may increase interstitial edema and further comprise the microvascular dysfunction that characterizes severe sepsis. The current paradigm of fluid management in patients with sepsis is one of adequate initial fluid resuscitation followed by <b>conservative</b> late-fluid <b>management.</b> <b>Conservative</b> late-fluid <b>management</b> is defined as even-to-negative fluid balance measured on at least 2 consecutive days during the first 7 days after septic shock onset. In a retrospective cohort study, Murphy and colleagues demonstrated that an approach that combines both adequate initial fluid resuscitation followed by <b>conservative</b> late-fluid <b>management</b> was associated with improved survival [18]. A retrospective analysis of the Vasopressin in Septic Shock Trial (VASST) demonstrated that those patients in the quartile with the largest positive fluid balance at both 12 hours and 72 hours had the highest mortality [19]. Additional studies have demonstrated that those patients who have the largest cumulative fluid balance have an increased mortality [20 – 22].|$|R
30|$|Our {{study is}} limited by {{the fact that we have}} only {{included}} women who have had a surgically managed EP. Therefore, we are missing women with a recurrent EP who had <b>conservative</b> or medical <b>management</b> of their EP. At our unit, we have been collecting data on <b>conservative</b> or medical <b>management</b> since 2009 —during this period there have been 13 recurrent EPs that were managed with <b>conservative</b> or medical <b>management.</b> Nevertheless, our cohort represents the largest study of recurrent EP in the literature. Expecting a recurrent EP pre operatively is of importance in planning the surgical outcome as many tubal preservation techniques are being used successfully (Watrowski 2014).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThoracic outlet {{syndrome}} (TOS) is a well-discussed neurovascular {{condition in}} upper limbs {{that prompted the}} scientists to conduct several reviews and to write articles on the topic {{during the last three}} decades. Most of the treatments are surgery and a series of conservative treatments. However, the variation of conservative treatments is wide and not defined. The aim of this systematic review was to define the effectiveness of physical treatments, as one of the <b>conservative</b> <b>managements,</b> for patients with TOS, in terms of pain relief. Eleven articles published during the period 1990 – 2009 were selected for this review. Results show that physical treatments can reduce the pain of patients with TOS, which is the primary outcome. However, there is no firm evidence to support their effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous {{origin of}} the left {{coronary}} artery from the pulmonary artery is rare congenital abnormality that most commonly presents in childhood and {{is associated with a}} high mortality. In the elderly, patients may present acutely with arrhythmias or signs of ischemia or with vague chronic presentations of shortness of breath and fatigue. In the high-risk elderly population, it is unclear as to whether <b>conservative</b> surgical <b>management</b> by means of suture ligation of the left coronary artery is associated with positive long-term outcomes. We present a case of a 69 -year-old patient diagnosed with anomalous {{origin of the}} left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, which was treated with <b>conservative</b> surgical <b>management</b> and followed up for 15 years with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, with positive outcomes...|$|R
25|$|If {{the impact}} of {{symptoms}} of osteoarthritis on {{quality of life is}} significant and more <b>conservative</b> <b>management</b> is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective, and cost-effective. Surgery to transfer articular cartilage from a non-weight-bearing area to the damaged area is one possible procedure that has some success, but there are problems getting the transferred cartilage to integrate well with the existing cartilage at the transfer site.|$|E
25|$|Endovascular repair {{first became}} {{practical}} in the 1990s {{and although it}} is now an established alternative to open repair, its role {{is yet to be}} clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive care, less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus <b>conservative</b> <b>management</b> was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to <b>conservative</b> <b>management</b> alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the utilization and impact of a <b>conservative</b> medical <b>management</b> strategy for patients with non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) and significant coronary artery disease on early angiography. BackgroundPractice guidelines recommend an early invasive management strategy for NSTE ACS, but revascularization procedures {{may not always be}} performed after early angiography, even when significant coronary artery disease is present. MethodsWe evaluated 8, 225 intermediate- to high-risk NSTE ACS patients with at least 1 coronary lesion > 50 % stenosis on early angiography from the SYNERGY (Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization, and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors) trial (2001 to 2003), comparing patients treated with <b>conservative</b> medical <b>management</b> with those who underwent in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within 7 days of randomization. ResultsA total of 2, 633 patients (32 %) were medically managed, 4, 294 (52 %) underwent PCI, and 1, 298 (16 %) underwent CABG. The strongest independent predictors of <b>conservative</b> medical <b>management</b> versus any intervention were prior CABG, lower body weight, lack of a reinfarction between randomization and catheterization, and 3 -vessel disease. With <b>conservative</b> medical <b>management,</b> the cumulative risk of 1 -year mortality after discharge increased rapidly during the first 90 days and thereafter remained higher at 7. 7 % compared with that seen in patients treated with PCI (3. 6 %) or CABG (6. 2 %). ConclusionsOne-third of patients with NSTE ACS and significant coronary disease on early angiography were managed without in-hospital revascularization in the SYNERGY trial, and these patients had an increased risk of late mortality. These findings highlight the need for novel treatment approaches for NSTE ACS patients who are not candidates for revascularization. (SYNERGY trial; NCT 00043784...|$|R

2500|$|FI is {{generally}} treatable with <b>conservative</b> <b>management,</b> surgery or both. [...] The success of treatment {{depends upon the}} exact causes and how easily these are corrected. [...] Treatment choice depends on the cause and severity of disease, and the motivation and general health of the person effected. Commonly, conservative measures are used together, and if appropriate surgery carried out. Treatments may be attempted until symptoms are satisfactorily controlled. A treatment algorithm based upon the cause has been proposed, including conservative, non-operative and surgical measures (neosphincter refers to either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial bowel sphincter, lavage refers to retrograde rectal irrigation). Conservative measures include dietary modification, drug treatment, retrograde anal irrigation, biofeedback retraining anal sphincter exercises. Incontinence products refer to devices such as anal plugs and perineal pads and garments such as diapers/nappies. Perineal pads are efficient and acceptable for only minor incontinence. If all other measures are ineffective removing the entire colon may be an option.|$|E
2500|$|Chiropractors {{emphasize}} the <b>conservative</b> <b>management</b> of the neuromusculoskeletal system {{without the use}} of medicines or surgery, with special emphasis on the spine. Back and neck pain are the specialties of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. There is a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others disagreed. For example, while one 2009 survey of American chiropractors had found that 73% classified themselves as [...] "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", the label [...] "back and neck pain specialists" [...] was regarded by 47% of them as a least desirable description in a 2005 international survey. Chiropractic combines aspects from mainstream and alternative medicine, and there is no agreement about how to define the profession: although chiropractors have many attributes of primary care providers, chiropractic has more of the attributes of a medical specialty like dentistry or podiatry. It has been proposed that chiropractors specialize in nonsurgical spine care, instead of attempting to also treat other problems, but the more expansive view of chiropractic is still widespread.|$|E
