50|$|The {{industrial}} sector contributed an estimated 32.2 {{percent to the}} country's GDP in 1999, led by mining (ferronickel, gold, and silver) and the manufacture of goods for export to the United States. To a lesser extent, there is the manufacture of food products, <b>consumer</b> <b>non-durables,</b> and building materials for the local market and for neighboring Haiti. The sector employed an estimated 24.3 percent of the workforce in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Club's early {{supporters}} in Congress included such distinguished figures as Miguel Cané, José Hernández, Vicente Fidel López and Carlos Pellegrini, and through their support the Club obtained {{the passage of}} a customs reform bill that included protective tariffs on an array of <b>consumer</b> <b>non-durables</b> (such as processed foods and textiles). The Industrial Club organized its first exposition in 1877; but differences among its membership over support for President Nicolás Avellaneda led to the group's 1878 division. An initiative led by Corrientes Province Senator Antonio Cambaceres resulted in the February 7, 1887, establishment of the UIA, whose membership reflected a reunified industrial lobby.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of this definition, assets only have {{positive}} futures prices. This is analogous to the distinction between <b>consumer</b> durables and <b>non-durables.</b> Durables last more than one year. A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon. In a simple Walrasian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices. In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period. Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow. Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.|$|R

Planning for {{development}} in a mixed economy required that {{a good deal of}} survey-assisted research be undertaken into problems in applied economics, both for {{the public and private sectors}} on themes that were directly relevant to the formulation of plans, particularly at the regional level. The transition from a planned economy to a liberalized economy since 1991 has further reinforced the role of NCAER in the creation of a knowledge base in crucial areas of research and study. NCAER has earned a unique place in the country for its expertise and organizational resources in the design and execution of large-scale sample surveys on regional development and planning, human development, demography, demand variations for specific products as well as for a whole range of <b>consumer</b> durables and <b>non-durables.</b> More specifically, NCAER has built up a rich database on income, consumption, savings and investment of households. Over the years NCAER has promoted a vast research agenda. • Generating social and economic data through designing and executing large surveys.

Prahalad also “four billion poor can be {{the engine}} of {{the next round of}} global trade and prosperity. ” As in India maximum numbers of poor is still dual in the rural market and most of the {{companies}} like Mahindra & Mahindra, HLL, ICICI, ITC, IFFCO, etc. are focusing their operations in rural India, a new market has emerged out of the blue. In this market the customer is not only becoming aware what is available but a long term bond between the company and the consumer is developing. This relationship is taking away the traditional “features and benefit” marketing toward creating experiences for their consumers. India has more than 0. 6 million villages, housing two third of its people, earning one-third of the national income. All the income groups consume FMCG products though brands will be different. They prefer to purchase form the Haats, which is good channel of distribution. Moreover some youths, are also influenced by City culture and it is also reflected in their purchasing decision. The marketer should understand the psychology of rural customers before entering into the market. The objectives of the study are to know the brand preferences of rural customers, the mode of communication in rural markets, and penetration rates for various <b>consumer</b> durables and <b>non-durables...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} in global trade during the 2008 – 09 crisis {{has been widely}} studied using the developed nation(s) data. I use firm-level data from Indian manufacturers to show that: (a) Indian firms experience strong negative demand shocks concerning their exports to the USA and the EU, the effect being significantly higher in case of the USA. Results assert that 1 % increase in the exposure towards the crisis-affected zones (the USA and the EU combined) reduces an average Indian manufacturing firm's export earnings by 1. 17 %– 1. 36 %; (b) trade in <b>consumer</b> <b>non-durables</b> and durables {{are the two most}} affected sectors, impact being higher for the latter; (c) evidence in support of similar effects throughout the size distribution of firms, with the effect being highest for small or the most vulnerable firms; (d) drop in demand, {{as a result of the}} 2008 – 09 crisis, only affects the high-exposure industries. My results are robust to IV analysis and a variety of checks...|$|E
40|$|Buyers of <b>consumer</b> <b>non-durables</b> tend to buy several {{brands of}} a product {{category}} {{in the course of}} a year, though a few are exclusive buyers of particular brands. The present research investigated the dynamics of successive repeat-buying and penetration levels of groups of brands belonging to similar levels of brand differentiation. It examined the probability of buying brands belonging to the same level of differentiation on successive shopping occasions. Consumer panel data for 80 consumers for weekly purchases of eight product categories over a period of 16 weeks were analysed. Since the number of exclusive buyers of a brand decreases as the duration of sales increases, we hypothesized a decrease in the probability of sequential repeat-buying of brands belonging to the same level of brand differentiation with increases in the number of successive shopping occasions. Similar analysis was undertaken to examine the penetration level of groups of similar brands, which were expected to increase with the period chosen for analysis. Two equations, constructed to describe the dynamics of repeat-buying for groups of brands, were applied to the description of the dynamics of repeat-buying and penetration level of particular brands. The results suggest several managerial applications including the estimation of the proportion of sequential repeat buyers and non-repeat buyers during the product shopping cycle...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a test of}} the applicability of a model developed from a qualitative study of a market for consumer nondurables to two other markets for <b>consumer</b> <b>non-durables.</b> The model was developed to explain the effect of public relations information on housewives 1 buying decisions. The results of two questionnaire surveys of fifty housewives each were analysed. Results from the first market study were to be confirmed by the second study before acceptance. The relationships specified in the model were not identified in the tests. It is suggested that the relationship between perceived risk and openness to information was not supported because of the low risk in the present studies and that relationships concerning usage strategies were not identified because {{it was not possible to}} group individual strategies. In the light of the results the problems of developing a generalisable model from a qualitative study of one situation and ways of tackling these problems are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages to the project of using a market research firm for the survey and of having commercial sponsors are identified. This thesis provides several criteria for distinguishing between the diverse conceptualisations of perceived risk reviewed. It points out why the uncertainty component and not the probability component is consistent with perceived risk theory. It shows that there is little conclusive evidence of a relationship between consumer perceived risk and information handling due to a lack of quality programmatic research, although that relationship is often held to be true. The above point highlights a general problem in consumer behaviour research exemplified by a lack of programmatic research, by exploratory studies which are not followed up and by many measures of concepts none of which are validated...|$|E
40|$|For U. S. {{annual data}} that include WWII, the {{estimated}} multiplier for temporary defense spending is 0. 4 - 0. 5 contemporaneously and 0. 6 - 0. 7 over two years. If {{the change in}} defense spending is “permanent” (gauged by Ramey’s defense-news variable), the multipliers are higher by 0. 1 - 0. 2. The estimated multipliers are all significantly less than one and apply for given average marginal income-tax rates. We cannot estimate reliable multipliers for non-defense purchases {{because of the lack}} of good instruments. Since the defense-spending multipliers are less than one, greater spending crowds out other components of GDP, mainly investment, but also non-defense government purchases and net exports. <b>Consumer</b> expenditure on <b>non-durables</b> and services has only a small response. In a post- 1950 sample, increases in average marginal income-tax rates (measured by a newly constructed time series) have significantly negative effects on GDP. When interpreted as a tax multiplier, the magnitude is around 1. 1. When we hold constant marginal tax rates, we find no statistically significant effects on GDP from changes in federal tax revenue (using the Romer-Romer exogenous federal tax-revenue change as an instrument). In contrast, with revenue held constant, increases in marginal tax rates still have a statistically significant negative effect on GDP. Therefore, tax changes seem to affect GDP mainly through substitution effects, rather than wealth effects. The combination of the estimated spending and tax multipliers implies that balanced-budget multipliers for defense spending are negative. ...|$|R
