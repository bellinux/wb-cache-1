5|$|It targets {{the poorest}} of the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

Specifically, this study focuses on new <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> approval, <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> renewal provided by financial institutions and trade credit provided by suppliers. Using data from the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF), I find that in new <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> approval, black owned businesses face unfair outcomes; while in <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> renewal, women owned firms are slightly favored by lenders. In trade credit approval, no minority owned firms appear to be discriminated against. I also present evidence that discrimination against minority groups is mostly likely {{to be based on}} statistical reasons instead of prejudice...|$|R

Individuals in the default state use their <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> 59 % more than those in the non-default state, and full utilization of the <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> increases the default probability on the loan by 46 % when compared with non-utilization.

40|$|Managing {{the credit}} risk {{inherent}} to a corporate <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> {{is similar to}} that of a term loan, but with one key difference. For both instruments, the bank should know the borrower's probability of default (PD) and the facility's loss given default (LGD). However, since a <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> allows the borrowers to draw down the committed funds according to their own needs, the bank must also have a measure of the line's exposure at default (EAD). Our study, which is based on a census of all corporate lending within Spain over the last 20 years, provides the most comprehensive overview of corporate <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> use and EAD calculations to date. Our analysis shows that defaulting firms have significantly higher <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> usage rates and EAD values up to five years prior to their actual default. Furthermore, we find that there are important variations in EAD values due to <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> size, collateralization, and maturity. While our results are derived from data for a single country, they should provide useful benchmarks for further academic, business and policy research into this underdeveloped area of credit risk management.

Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited {{if there was a}} reduction or elimination of its <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> with competitors. In a conference call, S affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was [...] "nothing wrong with Enron's business". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year.
