25|$|The word robot was {{introduced}} to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a <b>chemical</b> <b>substitute</b> for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).|$|E

5000|$|The 19th century {{brought about}} the {{so-called}} [...] "backward classes movement", {{a direct result of}} the hegemony in employment (in educational and government sectors) by the wealthy few and the loss of jobs across southern India due to the Industrial Revolution in England. This movement was heralded first by the Lingayats followed by the Vokkaligas and the Kurubas. The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British caused massive deindustrialization in India, especially in the textile sector. For example, Bangalore was known to have had a flourishing textile industry prior to 1800 and the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, a state of events that changed significantly when the British began ruling the area.

In addition, it is a renewable energy source which is unlike fossil fuels that is finite. Biodiesel obtained from energy crops also produces favorable effects on the environment, such as a decrease in acid rain and greenhouse effect caused by combustion [2]. Due to these factors and to its biodegradability, the production of biodiesel is considered an advantage than to that of fossil fuels [2]. Biodiesel is also nontoxic, eco-friendly, and useful in CO 2 recycling over short periods [3, 4].

40|$|Growth {{factors and}} {{transcription}} factors {{are well known}} to regulate pluripotent stem cells, but less is known about translational control in stem cells. Here, we use embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to investigate a connection between ESC growth factors and eIF 2 α-mediated translational control (eIF 2 α phosphorylation promotes protein expression from mRNAs with upstream open-reading frames, or uORFs). We find abundant phosphorylated P-eIF 2 α (P-eIF 2 α) in both pluripotent mouse and human ESCs, but little P-eIF 2 α in ESCs triggered to differentiate. We show that the growth factors LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and BMP 4 (bone morphogenic protein 4) both maintain P-eIF 2 α in mESCs, but use distinct mechanisms: LIF inhibits an eIF 2 α phosphatase whereas BMP 4 activates an eIF 2 α kinase. The mRNAs encoding the pluripotency factors Nanog and c-Myc possess uORFs while Oct 4 mRNA does not. We find that salubrinal, a chemical that increases eIF 2 α phosphorylation, promotes Nanog and c-Myc expression, but not Oct 4 expression. These experiments connect ESC growth factors to eIF 2 α phosphorylation and suggest a <b>chemical</b> <b>substitute</b> for LIF to enhance Nanog and c-Myc expression...|$|E
40|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} {{processes are}} currently being replaced in many industrial sectors because of the recognized adverse {{effect on the environment}} and health of used hexavalent chromium compounds. The environmental impacts of the existing processes must, however, be quantified in order to constitute a baseline against which the environmental performance of potential alternative options could be compared. The whole life cycle of the process should also be taken into account to ensure that the possible chosen solution for eliminating or lowering chromium (VI) emissions would not drastically damage the overall process performance in other environmental areas. In our study, we used a simplified life cycle assessment methodology that only took into account the key environmental issues of the considered industrial sector. Both the scope and the data needs were reduced by focusing only on significant flows and by using a generic database for steps other than the anodizing one. A precise literature review was carried out to evaluate bath atmospheric emissions. The results of the performed assessment confirmed {{that the only way to}} efficiently deal with hexavalent chromium compounds is to substitute the electrolyte used in the bath as the most Cr(VI) emissions are caused by other stages than the main one.

Since cross-{{resistance is}} a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids. The first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. We periodically drove along the national road from the north end to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and collected mosquito larvae from used tires. Simplified susceptibility tests were performed using the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Compared with the other species, Ae. aegypti demonstrated the most prominent reduction in susceptibility. For Ae. aegypti, significant increases in the susceptibility indices with a decrease in the latitude of collection points were observed, indicating that the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti against d-allethrin was lower in the southern part, including mountainous areas, as compared to that {{in the northern part of}} Vietnam. There was a significant correlation between the susceptibility indices in Ae. aegypti and the sum of annual pyrethroid use for malaria control (1998 – 2002). This might explain that the use of pyrethroids as residual treatment inside houses and pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets for malaria control is attributable to low pyrethroid susceptibility in Ae. aegypti.
