40|$|Abstract—Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) {{could be}} a new {{communication}} paradigm that allows the <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> moving at high speeds on the roads. This has brought new challenges to develop many applications like, traffic engineering, traffic management, broadcasting emergency information to avoid hazardous situations and other user applications. The <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> is the core concept of VANETs, because the <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> is used for safety, comfort, and for handling emergency situations as well. Routing protocols are used to carry out communication by routing data between vehicles. There are various categories of routing protocols in VANETs. Based on the topology, there are three types of routing protocols in VANET. They are named as Proactive, Reactive and ZRP routing protocol. The paper presents comparative analysis of existing routing protocols like Ad Hoc on Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV), Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) and Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP). Network Simulator (NS- 2) is used to carried out the simulation. The performance evaluation metrics used are packet delivery ratio, end to end delay and throughput. To achieve scalability the simulation is also carried out with varying number of nodes. Simulation results show that AOMDV performs better than DSDV and ZRP protocol by above 14 % and 59 % respectively in packet delivery ratio and AOMDV, DSDV both perform better than ZRP in terms of Throughput and average End-To-End Delay...|$|E

40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) {{has emerged}} to {{establish}} <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> intelligent <b>vehicles.</b> The high mobility of vehicles and existing of obstacles in urban area make the <b>communication</b> link <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> to be unreliable.

40|$|Vehicle safety {{applications}} such as collision avoidance, emergency braking etc., based on vehicle-to-vehicle communications are promising new technology, diminishing the number of accidents on roads. The functioning of these safety applications depends on continuous exchange of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) <b>between</b> the <b>vehicles</b> through wireless communications making them aware of each other. Messages are also logged by each vehicle in their log files. However reliability and availability of these applications depends {{on the quality of}} wireless <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> the <b>vehicles.</b> Wireless link tends to get vulnerable due to a number of static (building, terrains etc.) and dynamic obstacles (climatic conditions, traffic environments etc.) causing the effects of shadowing, reflection, scattering etc. These are examples of the different causes to <b>communication</b> disturbances <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> that indirectly also influence safety applications. It is therefore important to have better tools to examine the communication quality which might not be possible by manually scanning the log files. Our thesis work uses Visualisation technology to efficiently display the quality of communication within a range using log files generated from measuring the <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> the <b>vehicles.</b> We have investigated various Visualisation techniques and approaches appropriate for our task. However we choose to use the Pixel Map based approach, which is a combination of two technologies, Maps and computer graphics to precisely visualize quality at each location.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{is likely}} to be one key area where mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} will be used in the near future. Currently there are several projects ([1, 3]) that investigate this application area, while car manufacturers and their suppliers aim at the development of products within the next few years. This raises the question what kind of routing algorithm is suited for <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Existing performance studies for various ad-hoc routing protocols do not use movement patterns which resemble the movement of cars and are thus not well suited to answer this question. We have conducted an extensive simulation study based on realistic vehicle movement patterns.

As representatives we have chosen DSR [4] as a topology-based approach and GPSR [5] complemented with a simple location service as a location-base...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThrough <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>{{vehicles}}</b> and infrastructure, vehicles {{can receive}} real-time warnings on incidents and dangerous situations, and can send own sensor data and observed incident information to other road users. Information between vehicles and infrastructures can be exchanged either using ITS-G 5 or cellular communications.

A hardware-in-the-loop driving simulator has been utilized to test the transmission of vehicle data. Performance measurements of the <b>communication</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> and infrastructure have been made for both ITS-G 5 and LTE. LTE and the future 5 G will provide lower latency, and hence may become the preferred solution especially for road side unit to vehicle communications. Providing seamless connectivity between different network technologies, a mobile IP based solution is utilized with Quality-of-Service (QoS) assisted handovers. Real-time QoS measurements with fast handovers enable the system to react rapidly to changing circumstances. Our solution can exploit multiple networks and prioritize them by quantities such as preference, signal strength and geotagged formerly measured link quality...|$|E
