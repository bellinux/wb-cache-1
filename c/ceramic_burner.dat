40|$|Abstract: The {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} surface flames in a perforated <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner,</b> {{which can be}} used as the main burner of a fuel reformer in fuel cell systems are experimentally investigated. The effects of the equivalence ratio and heating rate were studied to find less emis-sion and a more stable surface flame. A specially designed fuel/air mixer was fabricated to pro-duce a stable surface flame. The results show that surface flames can be classified into green, red radiant, and blue surface flames as the equivalence ratio decreases. Each flame is main-tained very stable at the specified equivalence ratio and has the same flame characteristics at any orientation of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner.</b> In particular, the blue surface flame is found to be very stable at a very lean equivalence ratio at 8 to 23. 2 kW heating rates. The exhausted NOx measurement shows that the blue surface flame represents the lowest NOx emission since it remains very stable at a lean mixture ratio. CO emission is also much lower compared with the bunsen flame due to lean combustion...|$|E
40|$|For an ultra {{lean mixture}} of liquid fuel (Kerosene) mist and air, {{adiabatic}} combustion technology was studied experimentally using a simple perforated cylindrical hot porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner.</b> During the steady lean combustion, high excess air ratios; 2. 8 ～ 3. 6 {{could be achieved}} through the range of fuel now rate; 0. 8 ～ 4 g/min. The emission levels of CO and NOx under the excess air ratios less than 2. 0 were satisfactorily low. The effects of fuel flow rate on the emission levels were examined, and the mechanisms of flame confinement in the perforated cylindrical hot porous ceramic were discussed in detail. It was shown that the adiabatic combustion method of liquid fuel mist in a hot porous ceramics can be promising combustion technology for many applications owing to the ultra lean mixture condition, the strong light emission and the strong thermal radiation...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} wherein wood shavings and Ponderosa pine needles in quiescent air {{were subjected to}} a steady radiation heat flux from a planar <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner.</b> The internal temperature of these particles was measured using fine diameter (0. 076 mm diameter) type K thermocouples.

A model was developed to predict the steady-state temperature of a cylindrical particle with an imposed radiation heat flux under both quiesc-ent air (buoyancy-induced cooling) and windy (forced convection cooling) conditions. Excellent agreement was observed between the model predictions and the experimental data. Parametric studies using the validated model explore the effect of burner (flame) tem-perature and distance, fuel size, and wind speed. The data suggest that ignition of the fuel element by radiation heating alone is likely only under circumstances where the fire is very intense (such as crown fires), and even then may still be dependent on pilot ignition sources...|$|E

40|$|Gas-fired radiant burners {{are used}} to convert fuel {{chemical}} energy into radiation energy for various applications. The radiation output of a radiant burner largely depends on {{the temperature of the}} combustion flame. In fact, the radiation output and, thus, the radiant efficiency increase to a great extent with flame temperature. Oxygen-enriched combustion can increase the flame temperature without increasing fuel cost. However, it has not been widely applied because of the high cost of oxygen production. In the present work, oxygen-enriched combustion of natural gas in porous radiant burners was studied. The oxygen-enriched air was produced passively, using polymer membranes. The membranes were shown to be an effective means of obtaining an oxygen-enriched environment for gas combustion in the radiant burners. Two different porous radiant burners were used in this study. One is a reticulated <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner</b> and the other is a ceramic fibre burner. The experimental results showed that the radiation output and the radiant efficiency of these burners increased markedly with rising oxygen concentrations in the combustion air. Also investigated were the effects of oxygen enrichment on combustion mode, and flame stability on the porous media. Radiant burners Membranes Oxygen-enriched combustion...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of syngas from hydrocarbons {{is an important}} part of the hydrogen infrastructure. Previous experimental studies have shown that rich mixtures of methane, heptane, and ethanol are successfully converted to syngas in non-catalytic heat recirculating reactors but existing models fail to predict the efficiency of the conversion. Although the reactor designs vary, the primary feature is the recirculation of exhaust heat to preheat the reactants such that the flammability limits are extended and the burning rate is increased. Detailed modeling of these reactors, however, is complicated by the complex heat transfer processes. To understand modeling deficiencies, we are beginning an investigation of the conversion of rich mixtures of methane in a relatively simple flat flame burner with externally preheated reactants. The goal of this initial investigation with methane is to determine the similarity between the two burners that we use (an actively cooled McKenna burner and a ceramic matrix burner) and the computational model and to determine the effect of preheating on the expansion of the operating conditions of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner.</b> Experimental data include species measurements and operating range determinations. Additionally, we present results from computational modeling of the process for comparison with experimental data. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of acoustically driven flat flames has been analyzed experimentally. In this study, pressure transducers and laser Doppler velocimetry {{are used to}} characterize the acoustical waves upstream and downstream of a flat flame stabilized on a flame holder. Two different flame holders have been used, a perforated brass plate and a ceramic foam, exhibiting very different surface temperatures. From these experiments, the acoustical transfer function can be derived. This transfer function shows a resonance-like behavior, of which the shape and peak frequency is governed mainly by the surface temperature of the burner and the velocity of the unburned mixture. The brass burner exhibits a resonance frequency around 140 Hz, where the resonance of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner</b> seems to have shifted to much higher frequencies and is much more damped. All results can be understood very well with an analytical model in terms of Zeldovich number, standoff distance, and heat conductivity. Apart from the analytical model for the brass flame holder, numerical simulations with detailed chemistry have also been performed. Again, the corre-spondence is good. The most interesting application is the acoustic {{behavior of}} central heating systems, in which these burners are frequently used. For the purpose of modeling the acoustical behavior of complete boiler systems, the analytical model {{can be used with}} minor adjustments to the Zeldovich number and heat conductivity, yielding a fairly accurate semiempirical model describing the transfer function...|$|E

Before modification the furnace, {{which was used}} for pre-heating stock, was limited to a maximum working temperature of 1, 000 oC.

The principal aim was to reduce energy costs. However, in addition, it was planned that the furnace temperature specification be increased to allow steel ingot to be forged directly from the furnace.

40|$|Measurements of {{temperature}} and NO concentration in laminar, partially premixed methane-air flames stabilized on a <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner</b> in coflow are reported. The NO concentration and temperature {{were determined by}} laser- induced fluorescence (LIF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering: (CARS), respectively. Upstream heat loss to the burner was varied by changing the exit velocity of the fuel-air mixture at a constant equivalence ratio of 1. 3; this alters {{the structure of the}} flame from an axisymmetric Bunsen-type to a strongly stabilized flat flame. To facilitate analysis of the results, a method is derived for separating the effects of dilution from those of chemical reaction based on the relation between the measured temperature and the local mixture fraction, including the effects of upstream heat loss. Using this method, the amount of NO formed during burnout of the hot, fuel- rich combustion products can be ascertained. In the Bunsen-type flame, it is seen that ~ 40 ppm of NO are produced in this burnout region, at temperatures between ~ 2100 K and ~ 1900 K, probably via the Zeldovich mechanism. Reducing the exit velocity to 12 cm/s reduces the flame temperature substantially, and effectively eliminates this contribution. At velocities of 12 and 8 cm/s, ~ 10 ppm of NO are formed in the burnout region, even though the gas temperatures are too low for 'Zeldovich' NO to be significant. Although the mechanism responsible for these observations is as yet unclear, the results are consistent with the idea that the low temperatures in the fuel-rich gases caused by upstream heat loss retard the conversion of HCN (formed via the Fenimore mechanism) to NO, with this 'residual' HCN then being converted to NO during burnout...|$|E
40|$|Combustion of a lean {{premixed}} methane–air mixture stabilized on {{a ceramic}} foam burner has been studied. The stabilization {{of the flame}} in the radiant mode has been simulated using a one-dimensional numerical model for a burner stabilized flat-flame, {{taking into account the}} heat transfer between the gas and the burner and the radiative properties of the ceramic material. The combustion has been modeled with the skeletal mechanism and the nitrogen chemistry using an accurate postprocessing technique based on the reaction mechanism of Glarborg et al. [16]. It is shown that the flue gas temperature is decreased significantly in the radiant mode. The emissions of CO and NO are therefore considerably lower compared to combustion in the blue-flame mode. The numerical results are validated with experiments. The temperature of the flue gases and the surface are measured in combination with the concentrations of the pollutants CO and NO. The temperatures have been obtained with nonintrusive techniques. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) has been used for the gas temperature and infrared pyrometry for the surface temperature measurements. Gas samples have been obtained with a suction probe and analyzed further by an infrared absorption technique (CO) and by a chemiluminescence analyzer (NO). From a comparison of the experimental and computational results it is concluded that the <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner</b> is chemically inert, since the results are similar to those for water cooled flat-flame burners. It is shown that modeling of the gas radiation is essential for an accurate prediction of CO in the postflame zone. Furthermore, it is shown that prompt NO, as well as the thermal NO, mechanisms are important for an accurate prediction of the total NO emission for combustion in the radiant mode...|$|E
40|$|Porous radiant burners {{are used}} in drying, preheating, curing and baking {{processes}} in the manufacturing industry. Most burners presently used are of the surface flame type. Burners with flames stabilized inside reticulated (cellular, foam) ceramics are expected to offer possible advantages over these burners. However, little knowledge is available about the operating characteristics {{and the structure of}} flames stabilized inside porous ceramic radiant burners. ^ The objective of the present work is to investigate the global performance characteristics of the reticulated ceramic burners. A detailed study which includes the operating range, radiation efficiency, spectral intensity, exit gas temperature and velocity, and pollutant emission indices measurement has been carried out. Another objective is to study the flame structure of the submerged names by measuring the local gas temperature and species profiles. Results indicate that reticulated ceramic burners do offer a 30 - 40 % gain in radiation efficiency and a wider operating range than the surface flame type burners. Local temperature measurements show an upstream motion of the flame at the higher firing rates revealing insights into the flashback problem. Local species measurements show that the submerged flame has a much broader reaction zone than the adiabatic laminar flat flame. Measurements are also conducted on a honeycomb <b>ceramic</b> <b>burner</b> of similar porosity. The limited flame stability range of this burner highlights the importance of the tortuous flow paths for flame stabilization in the reticulated ceramic burners. ^ The present theoretical study involves asymptotic analysis using two approximations. The first method yields an equation that is mathematically similar to the adiabatic premixed flame propagation problem, and predicts within 15 % of the experimentally observed flame speed. The second approximate analysis involves the treatment of radiation from the burner as a surface phenomenon. The solid phase and the gas phase energy equations are solved asymptotically. The predictions of flame position are within 20 %, those for radiant efficiency are within 25 %, and those of measured peak temperature are within 15 % of the experimental data. Based on these results, the present simplified models can be used as engineering tools for radiant burner design. ...|$|E

50|$|By the Classic period (c.AD 250-900) {{iron pyrite}} was the mineral {{of choice for}} {{fashioning}} mirrors. Instead of crafting the mirror from {{a single piece of}} pyrite, pre-cut pieces of pyrite would be fixed to a piece of slate, forming a mosaic mirror fashioned from finely fitted pieces. The slate was often finely sculpted and circular in shape; these mirrors could be much larger than earlier mirrors and mosaic mirrors represented in Mesoamerican art suggest that they may have reached sizes of over 30 cm. Mosaic mirrors using iron pyrite are not well preserved in the archaeological record due to the instability of the mineral, which rapidly oxidises. Usually these mirrors survive only as the slate backing with a red or yellow stain where the mirror was fitted. This has led to the frequent misidentification of mirror backs as paint palettes, painted discs or pot lids. During the Classic period circular pyrite mirrors were worn over the small of the back by Mesoamerican nobles and they have been found thus positioned in burials dating to the Early Classic (c.AD 250-600) at the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and at the Maya city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala. <b>Ceramic</b> incense <b>burner</b> figurines from the Escuintla region of Pacific Guatemala frequently depict the wearing of mirrors upon the chest.

Prior to the start of this project, Alzeta had developed and commercialized a porous surface radiant burner, the Pyrocore{trademark} burner. The product had been commercially available for approximately 5 years and had achieved commercial success in a number of applications ranging from small burners for commercial cooking equipment to large burners for low temperature industrial fluid heating applications. The burner was not recommended for use in applications with process temperatures above 1000 {degrees}F, which prevented the burner from being used in intermediate to high temperature processes in the chemical and petroleum refining industries.

40|$|Since its inception, the low-swirl burner (LSB) {{has shown}} to be a useful {{laboratory}} apparatus for fundamental studies of premixed turbulent flames. The LSB operates under wide ranges of equivalence ratios, flow rates, and turbulence intensities. Its flame is lifted and detached from the burner and allows easy access for laser diagnostics. The flame brush is axisymmetric and propagates normal to the incident reactants. Therefore, the LSB is well suited for investigating detailed flame structures and empirical coefficients such as flame speed, turbulence transport, and flame generated turbulence. Due to its capability to stabilize ultra-lean premixed turbulent flames (phi approx. = 0. 55), the LSB has generated interest from the gas appliance industry for use as an economical low-NO(x) burner. Lean premixed combustion emits low levels of NO(x), due primarily to the low flame temperature. Therefore, it is a very effective NO(x) prevention method without involving selective catalytic reduction (SCR), fuel-air staging, or flue gas recirculation (FGR). En the gas turbine industry, substantial research efforts have already been undertaken and engines with lean premixed combustors are already in use. For commercial and residential applications, premixed pulsed combustors and premixed <b>ceramic</b> matrix <b>burners</b> are commercially available. These lean premixed combustion technologies, however, tend to be elaborate but have relatively limited operational flexibility, and higher capital, operating and maintenance costs. Consequently, these industries are continuing the development of lean premixed combustion technologies as well as exploring new concepts. This paper summarizes the research effects we have undertaken {{in the past few years}} to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the low-swirl flame stabilization method for a wide range of heating and power generation systems. The principle of flame stabilization by low-swirl is counter to the conventional high-swirl methods that rely on a recirculation zone to anchor the flame. In LSBS, flow recirculation is not promoted to allow the premixed turbulent flames to propagate freely. A LSB with an air-jet swirler is essentially an open tube with the swirler at its mid section. The small air-jets generate swirling motion only in the annular region and leaving the central core of the flow undisturbed, When this flow exits the burner tube, the angular momentum generates radial mean pressure gradient to diverge the non-swirling reactants stream. Consequently, the mean flow velocity decreases linearly. Propagating against this decelerating flow, the flame self-sustains at the position where the local flow velocity equals the flame speed, S(sub f). The LSB operates with a swirl number, S, between 0. 02 to 0. 1. This is much lower than the minimum S of 0. 6 required for the high-swirl burners. We found that the swirl number needed for flame stabilization varies only slightly with fuel type, flow velocity, turbulent conditions and burner dimensions (i. e. throat diameter and swirl injection angle) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of an instantaneous gas-fired water heater {{was developed and}} verified experimentally. The water heater employed a <b>ceramic</b> fiber matrix <b>burner,</b> which emitted significant infrared radiation when heated by combustion. A copper finned tube multi-pass heat exchanger, located within the refractory-lined combustion chamber, was used to transmit thermal energy from the products of combustion to the water. The coil was designed to condense the water vapor present in the flue gases, thereby extracting the latent heat. Due to the high heat exchanger surface area to thermal input ratio, the water heater performed with a high efficiency (typically 90 % or higher). The small surface area of the combustion chamber ensured low jacket losses. ^ Convective transfer to the coil was described by means of experimentally determined coefficients obtained in a wind tunnel. The heat exchanger was operated at moderately low gas-side flow rates, under various degrees of surface wetting. Coils of several geometries were examined, {{and the influence of}} flow circuiting and external baffles was also studied. Correlations of Colburn j-factors for heat and mass transfer versus Reynolds number are presented. ^ The model employed the experimental j-factors to describe the convective transfer occurring at the outer coil surface. The rectangular combustion chamber was modeled as a six surface enclosure bounding a uniform mixture of combustion product gases. All possible thermal radiation inter-reflections were accounted for by means of energy balances performed at each surface. Gas radiation was calculated by the exponential wide band model. The combustion gas temperature was obtained by performing an overall energy balance on the system. Flue losses were obtained by means of an empirical flue loss equation which accounts for vapor condensation. ^ Two separate heat exchangers were installed in a prototype of the water heater, and baseline performance data were obtained. Model predictions were compared to these data, and in many cases close agreement was found. A model sensivity analysis indicated that improved predictions of heater performance could be obtained provided more accurate surface emissivity data were employed. ...|$|R
