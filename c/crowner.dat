The aims are 1) to review the specific requirements of <b>crown</b> shape models and ground measurement techniques in optical remote sensing, and 2) to present preliminary results from empirical, parametric <b>crown</b> shape and volume modeling of Scots pine and Norway spruce applicable in Finland. Results indicated that the basic dimensions (maximum radius, its height and <b>crown</b> length) of tree <b>crowns</b> were better predicted for pines, but the profile shape of {{the upper part of the}} <b>crowns</b> varied more than in spruce. Pine <b>crowns</b> were also slightly less concave than spruce <b>crowns.</b> No regularities were observed concerning the lower part of the <b>crowns.</b> The asymmetry of <b>crowns</b> increased as a function of tree age for both species, spruce <b>crowns</b> being more asymmetric than pine <b>crowns.</b> A comparison of measured <b>crown</b> volume with several simple geometrical <b>crown</b> shape envelopes showed that using a cone as a <b>crown</b> shape model for Scots pine and Norway spruce underestimates <b>crown</b> volume most severely.

40|$|Abstract Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to provide data on the {{fracture}} strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> and porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and to compare that data with the fracture strength of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic <b>crowns.</b> Materials and methods. Sixty standardized <b>crowns</b> divided into six groups (n = 10) were fabricated: monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand A, monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand B, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand A, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand B, heat-pressed monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns</b> and veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores. All <b>crowns</b> were thermocycled, cemented onto dies, cyclically pre-loaded and finally loaded to fracture. Results. The monolithic Y-TZP groups showed significantly higher fracture strength (2795 N and 3038 N) compared to all other groups. The fracture strength in the veneered Y-TZP group (2229 N) was significantly higher than the monolithic lithium disilicate group (1856 N) and the veneered high translucent Y-TZP groups (1480 N and 1808 N). Conclusions. The fracture strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> is considerably higher than that of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns.</b> The fracture strength of a <b>crown</b> made of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP is, with a large safety margin, sufficient for clinical use for the majority of patients. Porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores show higher fracture resistance than monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns...</b>|$|R
