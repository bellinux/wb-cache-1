Low {{molecular weight}} dicarboxylic acids of various chain lengths and water solubility were chosen to coat a water droplet consisting of 2440 water molecules.

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} play {{an important}} role in atmospheric processes. These aerosol particles can affect climate through scattering, transmission and absorption of radiation as well as acting as cloud condensation nuclei. It has recently been found that fatty acids reside on the surfaces of marine and continental aerosols. In this research, an attempt has been made to understand the structures and properties of such organic <b>coated</b> <b>aerosols</b> using Molecular Dynamics simulation. The model particle consisted of a water droplet coated with fatty acid. The density profile (using both Coarse-Grained and Atomistic/United atom models) demonstrated that such aerosol particles have an inverted micelle structure consisting of an aqueous core and with the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails exposed to the atmosphere. For smaller chains, with the organic molecules directed radially outwards from the water - organic interface) the normal pressure profile showed that the organic coating is under tension resulting in a 'negative' surface tension. As a result, such particles would have an inverse Kelvin vapor pressure effect and would be able to process water vapor despite the hydrophobic surface. Following the work on surface tension, the rate of water uptake by <b>coated</b> <b>aerosols</b> was computed. It was found that the sticking coefficient of water vapor on such particles was about a sixth of that on pure water droplets. This may seem to imply that the net condensation rate is lower, but we also need to take into account the evaporation of water from such particles. With a significant reduction in the evaporation rate (the coating lends greater stability to the particle resulting in reduced evaporation rate), the equilibrium vapor pressure of water on such particles reduced, resulting in a "net water attractor". Thus if such structures were created in sufficient concentration, they might be important contributors in the cloud condensation process. Next the effect of longer Fatty acid molecules and branched surfactants on the structure and properties of coated particles was studied. It was found that in either case, due to stronger organic - organic interactions, the surfactant molecules tend to align themselves parallel to each other forcing local flattening of the underlying water substrate and consequently such particles behaved in a manner consistent with an "oily" drop, in sharp contrast to the case of shorter chains, where the particle was a "net water attractor". Finally, the effect of organic coating on the Stokes drag of functionalized nanoparticles was studied. This work was motivated by a recent experimental study in which the thickness of Self Assembled Monolayers on Gold nanoparticles was characterized using a measurement process that relies on the determination of the size of a charged particle through knowledge of the drag force. The thickness of the coating was found to ~ 35 % less than that predicted by a rigid core-shell model. This suggests that the functionalized Au-NP would have an inverted micelle structure. The MD simulations showed that the drag on the coated particle was indeed less than that on the corresponding pure particle, consistent with the experimental observation...|$|R

40|$|We report {{airborne}} organic aerosol (OA) measurements over Los Angeles {{carried out}} in May 2010 {{as part of the}} CalNex field campaign. The principal platform for the airborne data reported here was the CIRPAS Twin Otter (TO); airborne data from NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft and Pasadena CalNex ground-site data acquired during simultaneous TO flybys are also presented. Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer measurements constitute the main source of data analyzed. The increase in organic aerosol oxidation from west to east in the basin was sensitive to OA mass loading, with a greater spatial trend in O:C associated with lower mass concentration. Three positive matrix factorization (PMF) components (hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), semi-volatile oxidized organic aerosol (SVOOA), and low volatility oxidized organic aerosol (LVOOA)) were resolved for the one flight that exhibited the largest variability in estimated O:C ratio. Comparison of the PMF factors with two optical modes of refractory black carbon (rBC) -containing aerosol revealed that the coating of thinly <b>coated</b> rBC-containing <b>aerosol,</b> dominant in the downtown region, is likely composed of HOA, whereas more thickly <b>coated</b> rBC-containing <b>aerosol,</b> dominant in the Banning pass outflow, is composed of SVOOA and LVOOA.

40|$|Next to {{the coating}} formulation, process {{conditions}} play {{important roles in}} determining coating quality. This study aims to develop an operational window that separates layering from agglomeration regimes and, furthermore, the one {{that leads to the}} best coating quality in a fluidized bed coater. The bed relative humidity and the droplet size of the <b>coating</b> <b>aerosol</b> were predicted using a set of engineering models. The coating quality was characterized using a quantitative image analysis method, which measures the coating thickness distribution, the total porosity, and the pore size in the coating. The layering regime can be achieved by performing the coating process at a certain excess of the viscous Stokes number (ΔStv). This excess is dependent on the given bed relative humidity and droplet size. The higher the bed relative humidity, the higher is the ΔStv required to keep the process in the layering regime. Further, it is shown that using bed relative humidity and droplet size alone is not enough to obtain constant coating quality. The changes in bed relative humidity and droplet size have been identified to correlate to the fractional area of particles sprayed per unit of time. This parameter can effectively serve as an additional parameter to be considered for a better control on the coating quality. High coating quality is shown to be achieved by performing the process close to saturation and spraying droplets small enough to obtain high spraying rate, but not too small to cause incomplete coverage of the core particles...|$|R

Here, we measured the hygroscopicity and Raman spectra of solid ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) (2) -SO 4) particles initially coated with water-soluble glutaric acid in two consecutive cycles of deliquescence and crystallization utilizing an electrodynamic balance. (NH 4) (2) SO 4 particles with glutaric acid coating (49 wt % glutaric acid) had different hygroscopicity and morphology in the two cycles. Once the particles deliquesced, the dissolution of the solid (NH 4) (2) SO 4 core and the glutaric acid coating formed mixed (NH 4) (2) SO 4 -glutaric acid solution droplets, which was confirmed by Raman characterization.

Aerosol particles deposited on the impactor stages according to their aerodynamic diameters and their charges were simultaneously measured by the electrometers. The deposited drug mass was assayed chemically using HPLC. The surface potential on the inner spacer wall was measured with an electrostatic probe before and after aerosol actuation. High surface potentials {{were found on the}} new spacers whereas the detergent-coated spacers had minimal charges due to the conductive <b>coating.</b> MDI <b>aerosol</b> charges were decreased when spacers were used but the charge profiles of the aerosols were not altered qualitatively. New spacers had the lowest throat deposition, fine particle dose, and net aerosol and fine particle charges as a result of high spacer retention. These trends were partially reversed by the detergent-coated spacers. In general, the charge per mass of drug (charge-to-mass ratio) for particles from detergent-coated spacers was higher than those from new spacers. This was thought to be due to the reduction of electrostatic deposition inside the spacer thus leading to particles carrying higher charges being sampled. The calculated number of elementary charges per drug particle ranged from zero to several hundred, which is sufficiently high to potentially affect lung deposition.

They are also used to estimate the median ages of EC affecting the specific absorption of light, &alpha;ABS, at 870 nm as well as to identify periods when the urban plume from the MCMA was likely to have been advected over T 1 and T 2.

40|$|Abstract. We {{suggest a}} {{chemical}} {{model for the}} composition, structure, and atmospheric processing of organic aerosols. This model is stimulated by recent field measurements showing that organic compounds are a significant component of atmospheric aerosols. The proposed model organic aerosol is an “inverted micelle ” consisting of an aqueous core that is encapsulated in an inert, hydrophobic organic monolayer. The organic materials that <b>coat</b> the <b>aerosol</b> particles are surfactants of biological origin. We propose a chemical mechanism by which the organic surface layer will be processed by reactions with atmospheric radicals. The net result of an organic aerosol being exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere is the transformation of an inert hydrophobic film to a reactive, optically active hydrophilic layer. Consequently, processed organic aerosols can grow by water accretion and form cloud condensation nuclei, influencing atmospheric radiative transfer. Radiative transfer may be affected directly by the chromophores left {{on the surface of}} the aerosol after chemical transformation. The chemical model yields certain predictions which are testable by observations. Among them is a curve of the percent organic material as a function of particle diameter which predicts that a high fraction of the mass of the upper tropospheric aerosol will be organic. Atmospheric processing of organic aerosols will lead to the release of small organic fragments into the troposphere which will play a subsequent role in homogeneous chemistry. Organic aerosols are likely to act as a transport vehicle of organics and other water insoluble compounds into the atmosphere. We speculate that biomass burning will produce a similar coating of surfactants derived from land sources. Finally, it is pointed out that the radical-induced transformation of the surface layer of aerosol particles from hydrophobic to hydrophilic offers an additional means by which the biosphere, through atmospheric chemistry, can affect the radiative balance. 1...|$|R

A scalable and inexpensive {{renewable energy source}} is needed to meet the expected increase in electricity demand throughout the developed and developing world in the next 15 years without contributing further to global warming through CO 2 emissions. Photovoltaics may meet this need but current technologies are less than ideal requiring complex manufacturing processes and/or use of toxic, rare-earth materials. Copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4, CZTS) solar cells offer a true "green" alternative based upon non-toxic and abundant elements. Solution-based processes utilizing CZTS nanocrystal dispersions followed by high temperature annealing have received significant research attention due to their compatibility with traditional roll-to-roll coating processes. In this work, CZTS nanocrystal (5 – 35 nm diameters) dispersions were utilized as a production pathway to form solar absorber layers. Aerosol-based <b>coating</b> methods (<b>aerosol</b> jet printing and ultrasonic spray coating) were optimized for formation of dense, crack-free CZTS nanocrystal coatings.

Soot aged through contact with oxygenated organic compounds may become hydrophilic enough to promote water uptake. In this study, the tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) and differential mobility analyzer?aerosol particle mass analyzer (DMA?APM) were employed to measure the changes in morphology and hygroscopicity of soot <b>aerosol</b> particles upon <b>coating</b> with succinic and glutaric acids. The effective densities, fractal dimensions and dynamic shape factors of fresh and <b>coated</b> soot <b>aerosol</b> particles have been determined. Significant size-dependent increases of soot particle mobility diameter, mass, and effective density (?eff) were observed upon coating of aggregates with succinic acid. These properties were restored back to their initial states once the acid was removed by heating, suggesting no restructuring of the soot core had occurred. Coating of soot with glutaric acid, on the other hand, leads to a strong size shrinking with a diameter growth factor ~ 0. 60, even after the acid has been removed by heating suggesting the strong restructuring of the soot agglomerate. The additional 90 % RH cycle can evidently enhance the restructuring process. The extinction and scattering properties at 532 nm of soot particles internally mixed with dicarboxylic acids were investigated experimentally using a cavity ring-down spectrometer and an integrating nephelometer, respectively, and the absorption is derived as the difference between extinction and scattering.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding sources, concentrations, and {{transformation}} of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in the atmosphere is important because of their potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. The measurement of particle-bound PAHs by three different methods during the Mexico City Metropolitan Area field campaign in April 2003 presents a unique opportunity for characterization of these compounds and assessment of the methods. The three methods are (1) collection and analysis of bulk samples for time-integrated gas- and particle-phase speciation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; (2) aerosol photoionization for fast detection of PAHs on particles' surfaces; and (3) aerosol mass spectrometry for fast analysis of size and chemical composition. This research represents the first time aerosol mass spectrometry {{has been used to}} measure ambient PAH concentrations and the first time that fast, real-time methods have been used to quantify PAHs alongside traditional filter-based measurements in an extended field campaign. Speciated PAH measurements suggest that motor vehicles and garbage and wood burning are important sources in Mexico City. The diurnal concentration patterns captured by aerosol photoionization and aerosol mass spectrometry are generally consistent. Ambient concentrations typically peak at ~ 110 ng m ? 3 during the morning rush hour and rapidly decay due to changes in source activity patterns and dilution as the boundary layer rises, although surface-bound PAH concentrations decay faster. The more rapid decrease in surface versus bulk PAH concentrations during the late morning suggests that freshly emitted combustion-related particles are quickly <b>coated</b> by secondary <b>aerosol</b> material in Mexico City's atmosphere and may also be transformed by heterogeneous reactions...|$|R
40|$|A new Accelerated Site Technology Deployment (ASTD) {{project was}} awarded in FY 2002 to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to deploy {{technologies}} that decrease pollution and {{waste in the}} areas of facility characterization, sludge treatment, dust and contamination control, and concrete demolition. This project was called "D&D Technologies for Pollution Prevention" and planned to deploy four different technologies. To reduce protective equipment requirements, waste generation, and risk of radiation exposure during facility characterization, the Russian Gamma Locater Device (GLD) and Isotopic Identification Device (IID) for remote characterization was investigated. The GLD detects gamma ray readings and video images remotely and uses radio communication to transmit the readings to personnel located a safe distance from the contaminated area. The IID, {{an integral part of the}} GLD, provides real-time spectrometric analysis of radiation sources for remotely identifying the specific radioactive isotopes present in the facility. At the INEEL, sludge has accumulated in the bottom of a fuel storage pool and the presence of heavy metals in the sludge makes it a mixed waste. This project planned to use LEADX® to treat sludge in place to effectively make all heavy metals in the sludge insoluble. LEADX® is a dry granular chemical additive (apatite) used for in-situ treatment of heavy-metal-contaminated material. LEADX® chemically bonds to any free heavy metals that it contacts and forms a stable, non-leachable molecule. After treating the sludge with LEADX®, it was to be left in the basin and the pool filled with grout. The successful treatment of the sludge with LEADX® will reduce the amount of waste to be disposed at the burial ground by eliminating the need to remove the sludge from the basin. Many off-gas and duct systems being dismantled contain dust and lint that has been contaminated. Encapsulation Technologies, LLC has developed a patented process for eliminating airborne radioactivity and fixing contamination in place remotely without the need for people or equipment to enter the area being treated. The process uses a device called the Passive Aerosol Generator (PAG) to create an aerosol of a capture <b>coating.</b> The <b>aerosol</b> condenses on surfaces, capturing the contaminants in place. Use of this fogging technology will reduce or eliminate the requirement for glovebags and extensive contamination control during cutting and removal of ductwork. Demolition of building slabs and foundations is necessary at most DOE facilities undergoing D&D. The baseline method for their demolition at the INEEL is to use a hydraulic hammer on the end of a backhoe or trackhoe. However, the vibration of the hammer typically cause...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Megacities Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) {{study in}} the Mexico City Metropolitan Area in March 2006, we {{measured}} particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other gaseous species and particulate properties at six locations throughout the city. The measurements were intended to support the following objectives: to describe spatial and temporal patterns in PAH concentrations, to gain insight into sources and transformations of PAHs, and to quantify the relationships between PAHs and other pollutants. Total particulate PAHs at the Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo (T 0 supersite) located near downtown averaged 50 ng m&minus; 3 , and aerosol active surface area averaged 80 mm 2 m&minus; 3 . PAHs were also measured on board the Aerodyne Mobile Laboratory, which visited six sites encompassing a mixture of different land uses {{and a range of}} ages of air parcels transported from the city core. Weak intersite correlations suggest that local sources are important and variable and that exposure to PAHs cannot be represented by a single regional-scale value. The relationships between PAHs and other pollutants suggest that a variety of sources and ages of particles are present. Among carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide, particulate PAHs are most strongly correlated with NOx. Mexico City's PAH-to-black carbon mass ratio of 0. 01 is similar to that found on a freeway loop in the Los Angeles area and approximately 8 &ndash; 30 times higher than that found in other cities. Ratios also indicate that primary combustion particles are rapidly <b>coated</b> by secondary <b>aerosol</b> in Mexico City. If so, the lifetime of PAHs may be prolonged if the coating protects them against photodegradation or heterogeneous reactions...|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{observational}} {{studies have}} shown organic carbon aerosols {{to be a significant}} source of absorption of solar radiation. The absorbing part of organic aerosols is referred to as "brown" carbon (BrC). Using a global chemical transport model and a radiative transfer model, we estimate {{for the first time the}} enhanced absorption of solar radiation due to BrC in a global model. The simulated wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption, as measured by the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), increases from 0. 9 for non-absorbing organic carbon to 1. 2 (1. 0) for strongly (moderately) absorbing BrC. The calculated AAE for the strongly absorbing BrC agrees with AERONET spectral observations at 440 – 870 nm over most regions but overpredicts for the biomass burning-dominated South America and southern Africa, in which the inclusion of moderately absorbing BrC has better agreement. The resulting aerosol absorption optical depth increases by 18 % (3 %) at 550 nm and 56 % (38 %) at 380 nm for strongly (moderately) absorbing BrC. The global simulations suggest that the strongly absorbing BrC contributes up to + 0. 25 W m − 2 or 19 % of the absorption by anthropogenic aerosols, while 72 % is attributed to black carbon, and 9 % is due to sulfate and non-absorbing organic <b>aerosols</b> <b>coated</b> on black carbon. Like black carbon, the absorption of BrC (moderately to strongly) inserts a warming effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) (0. 04 to 0. 11 W m − 2), while the effect at the surface is a reduction (− 0. 06 to − 0. 14 W m − 2). Inclusion of the strongly absorption of BrC in our model causes the direct radiative forcing (global mean) of organic carbon aerosols at the TOA to change from cooling (− 0. 08 W m − 2) to warming (+ 0. 025 W m − 2). Over source regions and above clouds, the absorption of BrC is higher and thus can play an important role in photochemistry and the hydrologic cycle...|$|R
40|$|Black carbon is {{a primary}} aerosol tracer for {{high-temperature}} combustion emissions {{and can be used}} to characterize the time evolution of its sources. It is correlated with a decrease in public health and contributes to atmospheric warming. Black carbon measurements are usually conducted with absorption filter photometers, which are prone to several artifacts, including the filter-loading effect – a saturation of the instrumental response due to the accumulation of the sample in the filter matrix. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this filter-loading effect depends on the optical properties of particles present in the filter matrix, especially on the black carbon particle coating. We conducted field campaigns in contrasting environments to determine the influence of source characteristics, particle age and coating on the magnitude of the filter-loading effect. High-time-resolution measurements of the filter-loading parameter in filter absorption photometers show daily and seasonal variations of the effect. The variation is most pronounced in the near-infrared region, where the black carbon mass concentration is determined. During winter, the filter-loading parameter value increases with the absorption Ångström exponent. It is suggested that this effect is related {{to the size of the}} black carbon particle core as the wood burning (with higher values of the absorption Ångström exponent) produces soot particles with larger diameters. A reduction of the filter-loading effect is correlated with the availability of the coating material. As the <b>coating</b> of ambient <b>aerosols</b> is reduced or removed, the filter-loading parameter increases. Coatings composed of ammonium sulfate and secondary organics seem to be responsible for the variation of the loading effect. The potential source contribution function analysis shows that high values of the filter-loading parameter in the infrared are indicative of local pollution, whereas low values of the filter-loading parameter result from ageing and coating during long-range transport. Our results show that the filter-loading parameter can be used as a proxy for determination of the particle coating, thus allowing for differentiation between local/fresh and transported/aged particles...|$|R
40|$|The mass {{absorption}} efficiency (MAE) of {{elemental carbon}} (EC) in Beijing was quantified using a thermal-optical carbon analyzer. The MAE measured at 632 nm was 8. 45 &plusmn; 1. 71 and 9. 41 &plusmn; 1. 92 m 2 g− 1 during winter and summer respectively. The daily variation of MAE {{was found to}} coincide with the abundance of organic carbon (OC), especially the OC to EC ratio, perhaps due to the enhancement by <b>coating</b> with organic <b>aerosol</b> (especially secondary organic aerosol, SOA) or the artifacts resulting from the redistribution of liquid-like organic particles during the filter-based absorption measurements. Using a converting approach that accounts for the discrepancy caused by measurements methods of both light absorption and EC concentration, previously published MAE values were converted to the equivalent-MAE, which is the estimated value if using the same measurement methods as used in this study. The equivalent-MAE was found to be much lower in the regions heavily impacted by biomass burning (e. g., below 2. 7 m 2 g− 1 for two Indian cities). Results from source samples (including diesel exhaust samples and biomass smoke samples) also demonstrated that emissions from biomass burning would decrease the MAE of EC. Moreover, optical properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in Beijing were presented. Light absorption by WSOC exhibited strong wavelength (λ) dependence such that absorption varied approximately as &lambda;&minus; 7 , which was characteristic of the brown carbon spectra. The MAE of WSOC (measured at 365 nm) was 1. 79 &plusmn; 0. 24 and 0. 71 &plusmn; 0. 20 m 2 g− 1 during winter and summer respectively. The large discrepancy between the MAE of WSOC during winter and summer was attributed to the difference in the precursors of SOA such that anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) should be more important as the precursors of SOA in winter. The MAE of WSOC in Beijing was much higher than results from the southeastern United States which were obtained using the same method as used in this study, perhaps due to the stronger emissions of biomass burning in China...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study aims at {{investigating}} {{and testing}} the tentative antimicrobial efficacy; in vitro and in- hospital applications of apatite coated ferrum titanate {{which is one}} of the new generation photocatalysts. Material and Methods: 30 sterile petri dishes were kept under florescent light for 4 days following the application of 20 ppm apatite <b>coated</b> ferrum titanate <b>aerosol.</b> 0. 5 McFarland (1. 5 X 108 CFU/mL -CFU=colony forming unit) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 0. 5 McFarland Acinetobacter baumannii were cultured on 10 separate dishes. 10 unprocessed dishes were used as controls. Samples were evaluated for bacterial survival rate (CFUX 100 /CFU) after application. In the second step, same photocatalyst aerosol was applied as 0. 012 L/m 2 with the specific kit on the surfaces of different units within the hospital. Particle count was measured and&nbsp; compared before and one-month after the photocatalyst application by lumimeter. Results: Bacterial survival rate was significantly lower on photocatalyst applied surfaces versus control for Pseudomonas aeruginosa after second day of application (p&lt; 0. 001) (60 &plusmn; 8 % / 95 &plusmn; 9 %). This difference continued up to the 4 th day gradually (3. day: 35 &plusmn; 5 % / 90 &plusmn; 9 %; 4. day: 22 &plusmn; 5 % / 85 &plusmn; 8 %). Bacterial survival rate was significantly lower on photocatalyst applied surfaces versus control for Acinetobacter baumannii after the second day of application (55 &plusmn; 7 % / 87 &plusmn; 8 %) (p&lt; 0. 01). This difference continued up to the 4 th day gradually (3. day: 40 &plusmn; 5 % / 80 &plusmn; 8 %; 4. day: 15 &plusmn; 5 % / 78 &plusmn; 7 %). Particle count on photocatalyst applied surfaces diminished 97. 15 % in operating room, 95. 61 % in ICU, 98. 30 in physicians&rsquo; room, 94. 13 % in wards and 97. 04 % in hospital kitchen. Conclusions: As a result of our pioneering study on the evaluation of photocatalyst, we think that it may be one of the economic and safe alternative methods of hospital sterilization based on bactericidal and bacteriostatic efficacy confirmed in both laboratory and clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from both ozonolysis and hydroxyl radical (OH) -initiated oxidation of α-pinene {{under conditions of}} high nitric oxide (NO) concentrations with varying relative humidity (RH) and aerosol acidity was investigated in the University of North Carolina dual outdoor smog chamber facility. SOA formation from ozonolysis of α-pinene was enhanced relative to that from OH-initiated oxidation {{in the presence of}} initially high-NO conditions. However, no effect of RH on SOA mass was evident. Ozone (O 3) -initiated oxidation of α-pinene in the presence of ammonium sulfate (AS) seed <b>coated</b> with organic <b>aerosol</b> from OH-initiated oxidation of α-pinene showed reduced nucleation compared to ozonolysis in the presence of pure AS seed aerosol. The chemical composition of α-pinene SOA was investigated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-HR-Q-TOFMS), with a focus on the {{formation of}} carboxylic acids and high-molecular weight dimers. A total of eight carboxylic acids and four dimers were identified, constituting between 8 and 12 % of the total α-pinene SOA mass. OH-initiated oxidation of α-pinene in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NO x) resulted in the formation of highly oxidized carboxylic acids, such as 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 3 -butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA) and diaterpenylic acid acetate (DTAA). The formation of dimers was observed only in SOA produced from the ozonolysis of α-pinene in the absence of NO x, with increased concentrations by a factor of two at higher RH (50 – 90 %) relative to lower RH (30 – 50 %). The increased formation of dimers correlates with an observed increase in new particle formation at higher RH due to nucleation. Increased aerosol acidity was found to have a negligible effect on the formation of the dimers. SOA mass yield did not influence the chemical composition of SOA formed from α-pinene ozonolysis with respect to carboxylic acids and dimers. The results support the formation of the high-molecular weight dimers through gas-phase reactions of the stabilized Criegee Intermediate (sCI) formed from the ozonolysis of α-pinene. The high molecular weight and polar nature of dimers formed in the gas phase may explain increased particle number concentration as a result of homogenous nucleation. Since three of these dimers (i. e. pinyl-diaterpenyl dimer (MW 358), pinyl-diaterebyl dimer (MW 344) and pinonyl-pinyl dimer (MW 368)) have been observed in both laboratory-generated and ambient fine organic aerosol samples, we conclude that the dimers observed in this study can be used as tracers for the O 3 -initiated oxidation of α-pinene, and are therefore indicative of enhanced anthropogenic activities, and that the high molecular weight and low volatility dimers result in homogenous nucleation under laboratory conditions, increasing the particle number concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to document and evaluate recent changes and updates to the module for aerosols and aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions in the atmospheric module CAM 4 -Oslo of the core version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), NorESM 1 -M. Particular attention is paid to the role of natural organics, sea salt, and mineral dust in determining the gross aerosol properties as well as the anthropogenic contribution to these properties and the associated direct and indirect radiative forcing. The aerosol module is extended from earlier versions that have been published, and includes life-cycling of sea salt, mineral dust, particulate sulphate, black carbon, and primary and secondary organics. The impacts of most of the numerous changes since previous versions are thoroughly explored by sensitivity experiments. The most important changes are: modified prognostic sea salt emissions; updated treatment of precipitation scavenging and gravitational settling; inclusion of biogenic primary organics and methane sulphonic acid (MSA) from oceans; almost doubled production of land-based biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA); and increased ratio of organic matter to organic carbon (OM/OC) for biomass burning aerosols from 1. 4 to 2. 6. Compared with in situ measurements and remotely sensed data, the new treatments of sea salt and dust aerosols give smaller biases in near-surface mass concentrations and aerosol optical depth than in the earlier model version. The model biases for mass concentrations are approximately unchanged for sulphate and BC. The enhanced levels of modeled OM yield improved overall statistics, even though OM is still underestimated in Europe and overestimated in North America. The global anthropogenic aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) at the top of the atmosphere has changed from a small positive value to − 0. 08 W m− 2 in CAM 4 -Oslo. The sensitivity tests suggest that this change can be attributed to the new treatment of biomass burning aerosols and gravitational settling. Although it has not been a goal in this study, the new DRF estimate is closer both to the median model estimate from the AeroCom intercomparison and the best estimate in IPCC AR 4. Estimated DRF at the ground surface has increased by ca. 60 %, to − 1. 89 W m− 2 . We show that this can be explained by new emission data and omitted mixing of constituents between updrafts and downdrafts in convective clouds. The increased abundance of natural OM and the introduction of a cloud droplet spectral dispersion formulation are the most important contributions to a considerably decreased estimate of the indirect radiative forcing (IndRF). The IndRF is also found to be sensitive to assumptions about the <b>coating</b> of insoluble <b>aerosols</b> by sulphate and OM. The IndRF of − 1. 2 W m− 2 , which is closer to the IPCC AR 4 estimates than the previous estimate of − 1. 9 W m− 2 , has thus been obtained without imposing unrealistic artificial lower bounds on cloud droplet number concentrations...|$|R
