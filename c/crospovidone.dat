50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression tabletting, {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the die wall. Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as <b>crospovidone,</b> and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate, for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E

Tablet weight variation, content uniformity, crushing strength, disintegration time, wetting time, and in vitro release were measured for each formulation at each compression force. A linear increase in compression force resulted in an exponential increase in hardness for all formulations, a linear increase in disintegration and wetting times was observed for the formulations F 0, F 1, F 3 with the increase in compression force. The tablet formulation F 7 indicated, there was no effect of compression force on disintegration and wetting time. The in vitro release of the drug was increased with increase in concentration of <b>crospovidone</b> irrespective the compression force. However, storage under high humidity conditions caused the softening of the tablets containing the high amount of <b>crospovidone,</b> leading to softening of tablets.

Complex was characterizedusing infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, % drug release study, gustatoryevaluation for taste masking. A 32 full factorial design was applied to systematically optimize the drugdisintegration time. The concentration of <b>Crospovidone</b> (X 1) and concentration of Croscarmellose (X 2) were selected as independent variables. The Disintegration time (Y 1) and Wetting time (Y 2) wereselected as dependent variables. The prepared tablets were evaluated for hardness, friability,disintegration time, wetting time and In-vitro drug release. FT-IR studies and physical compatibilitystudy were conducted for drug, and drug excipient mixture for interactions if any. The differentformulations showed disintegration time between 12 to 58 sec. The results indicated that concentrationof <b>Crospovidone</b> (X 1) and concentration of Croscarmellose (X 2) significantly affected theDisintegration time (Y 1) and Wetting time (Y 2). Regression analysis and numerical optimization wereperformed to identify the best formulation. Formulation F 10 prepared with croscarmellose (4. 23 %) &crospovidone (6. 74 %) {{was found to be}} the best formulation with disintegration time 16 sec, wetting time 21 sec and % drug release in 10 min 94. 23 %...|$|E
40|$|Pulsatile drug {{delivery}} system is required to satisfy the needs of chronotherapy. Among solids, multiparticulates have its own advantages. Pulsatile {{drug delivery}} system provides better therapy {{with many of the}} actives. Rupturable pulsatile {{drug delivery system}} consists of a drug core; swelling layer of a super disintegrant; and an insoluble, water-permeable polymeric coating. Upon water ingress, the swellable layer expands, resulting in the rupturing of outer membrane followed by drug release. The active pharmaceutical ingredient selected was Carvedilol Phosphate, deposited on sugar pellets as first layer. The second layer composed of swelling excipient, had <b>crospovidone,</b> L–substituted hydroxy propyl cellulose and sodium starch glycolate. Third and the outer most layer was based on ethyl cellulose. The release after lag time was fast and complete, when <b>crospovidone</b> was used as a swelling agent. In contrast, a sustained release was achieved after the lag time, when L–substituted hydroxy propyl cellulose and sodium starch glycolate were used as swelling agents. Fast release would be preferable in the present case. Optimal level of <b>crospovidone</b> to achieve a fast and complete release of Carvedilol phosphate was 33 %. Outer membrane, formed using aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose was suitable enough to rupture sufficiently ensuring fast drug release, compared to stronger ethyl cellulose membrane formed using organic solution. It was possible to design multiparticulates of carvedilol phosphate having a suitable release profile...|$|E
40|$|Clobazam is a newer 1, 5 -benzodiazepine {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of epilepsy. It is better tolerated and less sedating than other benzodiazepines. Absorption of the drug can be impacted by oral fast dissolving dosage form; this may have implications for epilepsy in pediatrics and those having difficulty in swallowing tablets/capsules resulting in improved patient compliance. The purpose of the present investigation was to formulate and optimize clobazam oro-dissolving tablets by direct compression method using response surface methodology (RSM). Oro-dispersible tablets of clobazam were prepared by direct compression method using <b>crospovidone</b> (2 - 6 %) as a superdisintegrant, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (20 - 40 %) was used as diluents along with directly compressible mannitol to enhance mouth feel. A 3 2 full factorial design was applied to investigate the combined effect of two formulation variables: amount of <b>crospovidone</b> and MCC over the independent variables disintegration time, wetting time and percent drug release. Disintegration time showed by all formulations was found to be in the range of 24. 3 - 193 s based on evaluation parameters the formulation containing 6 % of <b>crospovidone</b> and 30 % of MCC showed promising performance against all other formulations. The results demonstrated that the RSM could efficiently be applied for the formulation of clobazam oro-dispersible tablets; therefore, constitute an advance in the management of epileptic attacks...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop fast dissolving tablets of etoricoxib. Granules containing etoricoxib, menthol, <b>crospovidone,</b> aspartame and mannitol were prepared by wet granulation technique. Menthol was sublimed from the granules by exposing the granules to vacuum. The porous granules were then compressed in to tablets. Alternatively, tablets were first prepared and later exposed to vacuum. The tablets were evaluated for percentage friability and disintegration time. A 3 2 full factorial design was applied to investigate the combined effect of 2 formulation variables: amount of menthol and <b>crospovidone.</b> The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that for obtaining fast dissolving tablets; optimum amount of menthol and higher percentage of <b>crospovidone</b> should be used. A surface response plots are also presented to graphically represent the effect of the independent variables on the percentage friability and disintegration time. The validity of a generated mathematical model was tested by preparing a checkpoint batch. Sublimation of menthol from tablets resulted in rapid disintegration as compared with the tablets prepared from granules that were exposed to vacuum. The optimized tablet formulation was compared with conventional marketed tablets for percentage drug dissolved in 30 min (Q 30) and dissolution efficiency after 30 min (DE 30). From the results, it was concluded that fast dissolving tablets with improved etoricoxib dissolution could be prepared by sublimation of tablets containing suitable subliming agent...|$|E
