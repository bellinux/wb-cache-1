5|$|The Jordan Park {{founded in}} 1889 by Dr Henryk Jordan, {{was the first}} public park {{of its kind in}} Europe. The park built {{on the banks of the}} Rudawa river was {{equipped}} with running and exercise tracks, playgrounds, the swimming pool, amphitheatre, pavilions, and a pond for boat rowing and water bicycles. It is located on the grounds of a larger Kraków’s Błonia Park. The less prominent Park Krakowski was founded in 1885 by Stanisław Rehman but has since been greatly reduced in size because of rapid real estate development. It was a popular destination point with many <b>Cracovians</b> at the end of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In the {{historical}} 1931 census preceding World War II, 78.1% of <b>Cracovians</b> declared Polish {{as their primary}} language, with Yiddish or Hebrew at 20.9%, Ukrainian 0.4%, German 0.3%, and Russian 0.1%. The ravages of history have greatly reduced the percentage of ethnic minorities living in Kraków. The official and unofficial numbers differ, {{as in the case}} of Romani people. Hence, according to the 2002 census, among those who have declared their national identity (irrespective of language and religion) in Kraków Voivodeship, 1,572 were Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians (472), Jews (50) and Armenians (22). Romani people, officially numbered at 1,678, are estimated at over 5,000. Statistics collected by the Ministry of Education reveal that, even though only 1% of adults (as per above) officially claim minority status, as many as 3% of students participate in programmes designed for ethnic minorities.|$|E

5000|$|Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474 (<b>Cracovian</b> Almanac for the Year 1474) is a {{broadside}} astronomical wall calendar for {{the year}} 1474, and Polands oldest known print. [...] This single-sheet incunable, known also as the Calendarium cracoviense (<b>Cracovian</b> Calendar), was published at Kraków in 1473 by Kasper Straube, an itinerant Bavarian printer who worked in Kraków between 1473 and 1476.|$|R
50|$|Poland's first-ever opera {{written in}} 1794 by Wojciech Bogusławski, called The Presumed Miracle, or the <b>Cracovians</b> and the Highlanders (Cud mniemany, czyli Krakowiacy i Górale), {{is set in}} the {{historic}} village of Mogiła where Nowa Huta was built. The two newest housing estates are named after the play: osiedle Krakowiaków (the <b>Cracovians</b> Estate) and osiedle Górali (the Highlanders Estate). The opera by Bogusławski was also the first theatre production played upon the opening the district's legendary Ludowy Theatre.|$|E
50|$|Since (AB)T = BTAT, the {{products}} (A ∧ B) ∧ C and A ∧ (B ∧ C) will generally be different; thus, Cracovian multiplication is non-associative. <b>Cracovians</b> are {{an example of}} a quasigroup.|$|E

50|$|The boulevards {{around the}} river channel of the Vistula and the Rudawa {{are part of}} an area of parkland, being a popular {{recreational}} area for <b>Cracovians</b> and tourists alike. The boulevards are pedestrianised, with bicycle routes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cracovians</b> {{adopted a}} column-row {{convention}} for designating individual elements {{as opposed to}} the standard row-column convention of matrix analysis. This made manual multiplication easier, as one needed to follow two parallel columns (instead of a vertical column and a horizontal row in the matrix notation.) It also sped up computer calculations, because both factors' elements were used in a similar order, which was more compatible with the sequential access memory in computers of those times — mostly magnetic tape memory and drum memory. Use of <b>Cracovians</b> in astronomy faded as computers with bigger random access memory came into general use. Any modern reference to them is in connection with their non-associative multiplication.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{equipped with a}} concert bowl, an ice and bicycle rink, a swimming pool, a bowling alley, a restaurant, cafés, a summer theatre (since 1890), and a zoo. It was a popular destination point with many Fin de siècle <b>Cracovians.</b>|$|E

50|$|In astronomical and {{geodetic}} calculations, <b>Cracovians</b> are a clerical convenience {{introduced in}} the 1930s by Tadeusz Banachiewicz for solving systems of linear equations by hand. Such systems can be written as Ax = b in matrix notation where x and b are column vectors and the evaluation of b requires the multiplication of the rows of A by the vector x.|$|E
50|$|The village lies {{along the}} Bystra stream, left {{tributary}} of Biała River that historically divided the village into two parts: Bystra Krakowska (<b>Cracovian</b> Bystra) and Bystra Śląska (Silesian Bystra).

50|$|<b>Cracovian</b> village {{lying on}} the right {{southern}} bank of the Bystra stream was also established in the 16th century.

50|$|Pan Twardowski is also {{a popular}} {{character}} in the folk art of the Kraków region. He may be found, for example, {{in some of the}} famous <b>Cracovian</b> cribs (szopki). He is typically depicted as a Polish noble either riding a rooster or standing on the Moon.|$|R

50|$|In 1905 the cabaret Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) {{started to}} perform here. As a {{highlight}} of every cabaret evening was {{the appearance of a}} puppet theatre designed and produced for widely popular shows against bigotry and imperial censorship, by Bronisława Janowska among others. Some of the dolls depicted prominent <b>Cracovians.</b> A selection of those historic puppets are displayed at the cafe. The interior is decorated with Art Nouveau furniture, mirrors, stained glass, lamps and cabinets.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Vistula-Oder Offensive in 1945, the Communist {{authorities}} had encountered substantial resistance {{to their new}} regime from middle-class <b>Cracovians.</b> A referendum held by the authorities was soundly defeated {{by the people of}} Kraków - a major cause of embarrassment to the government. To [...] "correct the class imbalance", the authorities commenced building a satellite industrial town to attract people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to the region, such as peasants and the working-class.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cracovians</b> {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} using the transpose of A, AT, and multiplying the columns of AT by the column x. This amounts to the definition of a new type of matrix multiplication denoted here by '∧'. Thus x ∧ AT = b = Ax. The Cracovian products of two matrices, say A and B, is defined by A ∧ B = BTA, where BT and A are assumed compatible for the common (Cayley) type of matrix multiplication.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{well-known}} innkeeper in Bieńczyce country near Kraków. In 1908, he organised (together with Władysław Bogacki) a famous <b>Cracovian</b> wedding in Wien to honor emperor of Austria Franz Joseph I. Ptak's daughter Zofia was a bride, painter Henryk Uziembło was the groom, and Wojciech Kossak {{played a part}} of a starost.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 {{she married}} Tadeusz Rychter, a painter like herself, {{the son of}} a Lwów professor. She {{rejected}} a marriage proposal from renowned <b>Cracovian</b> actor Ludwik Solski, even though they loved each other, because Solski was divorced and a Catholic church wedding would be out of the question. Incidentally, her subsequent marriage to Rychter was childless and openly unhappy. It lasted only for eight years.|$|R
50|$|Alongside his {{academic}} work {{he was involved}} in events benefitting the city as well as architecture and landmark conservation all over Poland.
