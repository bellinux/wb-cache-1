40|$|Among {{the various}} hazards {{occurring}} in fish and seafood chemical hazards {{and in particular}} toxins (<b>ciguatera,</b> scombroid <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning,</b> paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic (brevetoxic) shellfish <b>poisoning,</b> puffer <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning,</b> diarrhetic shellfish poisoning) have an important place in food poisoning cases. On the other hand, some of the chemical hazards are often due to the pollution of the environment (heavy metals, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons) and their detection is neither rapid nor facile. As a result {{there was a great}} need for developing new rapid and effective methods toward the chemical hazards determination mainly because of their high toxicity. The aim of this review is to provide the information about the new up-to-date detection techniques (Immunological, Chemical and Biochemical, and Molecular assays) in conjunction with detection limits. The latter is made possible by means of inclusion of seven comprehensive and, in most case cases, very extended tables. A reference is also made on the risk characterization of toxins as regards their importance to food contamination or poisoning...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ciguatera</b> reef <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning</b> is a {{debilitating}} human illness in tropical and some subtropical regions. Toxic precursors produced by tropical benthic dinoflagellates are bio-converted to often more potent toxins and bioaccumulate via the food web in highly sought after table fish. Rising sea surface temperatures are predicted to induce phase shifts on coral reefs. These changes offer increased substrate availability for benthic, toxic dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus, Ostreopsis, Prorocentrum and Coolia spp. resulting in range expansions of the causative agents of ciguatera. Ocean currents critically shape {{the chemical and}} physical ocean â€“ and coastal environments. Climate change affects wind patterns, which strengthens the East Australian Current forcing warm tropical waters further south. This in turn allows range expansions of ciguatera-associated dinoflagellates and presumably toxin vectors into nonendemic coastal regions changing the ciguatera-risk profile for humans and regional and commercial fisheries in affected coastal areas...|$|R

50|$|Gambierol is {{a marine}} {{polycyclic}} ether toxin which {{is produced by}} the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. Gambierol is collected from the sea at the Rangiroa Peninsula in French Polynesia. The toxins are accumulated in fish through the food chain and can therefore cause human intoxication. The symptoms of the toxicity resample those of ciguatoxins, which are extremely potent neurotoxins that bind to voltage-sensitive sodium channels and alter their function. These ciguatoxins cause <b>ciguatera</b> <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Because of the resemblance, {{there is a possibility}} that gambierol is also responsible for <b>ciguatera</b> <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Because the natural source of gambierol is limited, biological studies are hampered.

50|$|Octopus bush {{is used in}} many Pacific islands as a {{traditional}} medicine to treat <b>ciguatera</b> <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning,</b> which is caused by powerful ciguatoxins produced by microscopic Gambierdiscus algae. Scientists from the Institute of Research for Development (IRD) and the Louis Malarde Institute in French Polynesia and Pasteur Institute in New Caledonia are researching the plant chemistry and believe that senescent leaves contain rosmarinic acid and derivatives, which are known for its antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

50|$|Dinoflagellates {{normally}} {{have a low}} toxin production rate, therefore in small concentrations their toxins are not potent. However their toxins are highly poisonous in large concentrations. They are capable of poisoning various species of marine life such as many fish and shellfish, and affecting the nervous system of any wildlife or humans that consume the infected marine life, or drink the contaminated water. Under bloom conditions, {{commonly referred to as}} red tides or harmful algal blooms, dinoflagellates are capable of producing immense dinotoxin concentrations causing large fish die-offs, and contamination of shellfish. This contamination of shellfish leads to multiple severe human related illnesses. These illnesses include paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, and <b>ciguatera</b> <b>fish</b> <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E
