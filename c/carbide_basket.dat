Purpose of the work: {{development}} of {{the basis of the}} crystallization process control technology with the aid of an external magnetic field in order to obtain cast metal with a prescribed (predicted) structure and a degree of chemical inhomogeneity. The work makes a hypothesis about the interaction of the magnetic field and the melt being crystallized and develops a mathematical model for calculating the optimum parameters of the effect for obtaining the prescribed structure. New experimental data are obtained which comply with the proposed mechanism. The field parameters are calculated to provide for changes in the phase distribution and density of the <b>carbide</b> <b>basket</b> in steel R 6 M 5. Recommendations are developed for designing equipment and creating a technology of production of ingots with the required structure. A unit for implementation of the above-described technology is being assembled at one of the plants.
