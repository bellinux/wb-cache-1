Tainted meat has been imported according to Iranian authorities. Uncontrolled use of pesticides is also a problem. Despite the potential health hazards caused by GM food and government restrictions on the production of biotech products, Iran imports $5 billion of genetically modified crops a year because of laxed laws (2015).|$|E

The Codex has been in existence for 40 years, under the joint auspices of the FAO and WHO, and now counts 168 member states. It defines international food standards but has no power to ensure that they are followed. The (complex) work of the <b>Codex</b> <b>Commission</b> is of high importance because the World Trade Organization (WTO) has decided that all food importers have to justify any law which requires more rigorous rules for food safety and labelling than provided for under Codex. The Codex standards should thus be the basis for a clear and non-discriminatory trading system. But can we speak of equity when some countries are not even able to attend the meetings which draw up these rules? The new fund should help deal with that. It will be available to help 120 developing countries and countries in transition (the former member states of the Soviet Union) participate effectively in the Commission s essential work. One idea behind the fund is that countries will not have to seek private funding for their involvement, or at least accept such funding only under very strict conditions. Concern has been expressed about the possible excessive influence of large food corporations.

40|$|States have {{regulated}} {{public health}} for centuries by providing public goods such as clean air, water, and food to their citizens. Governments mandate {{levels of quality}} in food to prevent poisoning and deception of their people. In the United States, public health regulation {{has been one of}} the few areas where the courts have recognized a subjugation of individual rights to the common good, beginning in 1905 in a case which found that the state has a right to vaccinate a child against his parents' wishes (Gostin 2000). Thus the study of public health regulation, and within that food safety and quality, is an important one to understanding the state. Unlike efforts in some areas to de-regulate and/or move from command-and-control to market-based regulatory instruments [...] such as the areas of telecommunications and environmental issues [...] the trend in food safety regulation is increased regulatory attention in countries all around the world. The European Union is in the process of creating a new Food Safety Agency as part of an effort to avoid some of its recent food safety scares. The United States Department of Agriculture is under increasing pressure to conduct more microbiological inspections at food processing plants as well as to obtain statutory authority to recall tainted food, rather than the voluntary process that currently exists. And in countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, strengthening food regulatory systems is of deep interest for countries that want to increase their trade in food. Moreover, regional integration organizations and trade agreements such as the European Union, Mercosur, and the Free Trade Area of the Americas all have a component of food standards. This paper asks whether international standards for food safety and quality affect domestic policies, and if so, how. The paper is organized as follows. The first section describes the Codex Alimentarius Commission and its role in international food safety and quality standards. The second section outlines the theoretical model for thinking about diffusion of these standards and the different ways they might influence domestic policies. The next three sections briefly describe how Argentina and the Dominican Republic relate to the <b>Codex</b> <b>Commission,</b> assess the level of influence of international standards in those countries, and outline some factors that contribute to the influence of standards. The paper concludes with some thoughts about the mechanisms by which diffusion of standards occurs. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

In particular, we discuss the processes leading to policy conclusions on the basis of scientific evidence, with a focus on the interactions involved between private and public sector actors and those between "scientific experts" and others. We identify weaknesses in the current institutional set-up and provide suggestions on how to improve the interaction between different players at the national and international level so as to strengthen the existing system and increase its cost efficiency.

The Compilation accepts different approaches to labelling and comprises ten guidelines {{that need to be}} adopted in national labelling policies. Two models of labelling are prevalent. The voluntary model of labelling allows corporations the choice to label. The mandatory model provides more precise criteria for labelling.
