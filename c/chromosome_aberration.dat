The {{aim of this study}} was to compare frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in peripheral blood lymphocytes between young smokers and non-smokes groups. Methods: The study was conducted with 30 smokers (average age 26. 93 years) and 30 non-smokers (average age 26. 96 years), and included the analysis of 100 metaphases per each blood sample. Differences in the arithmetic means of determined frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were tested by two-tailed t -test for independent samples with the significance level of p < 0. 05. Results: The results showed a significant increase in the frequencies of chromatid-type aberrations and total structural <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in smoker group.

Analysis of chromosome structure in {{a large number of}} LOH clones by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR showed that chromosome loss, allelic recombination, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> were the major classes of genetic alterations leading to LOH. The frequencies of chromosome loss and <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> were significantly affected when the marker was located in different chromosomes, suggesting that chromosome-specific elements may affect the processes that led to these alterations.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the chromosome aberrations were further investigated by studying the fate of two other genetic markers on chromosome III. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> caused by intrachromosomal rearrangements was predominantly due to a deletion between the MAT and HMR loci that occurred at a frequency of 3. 1 x 10 (- 6).

40|$|Radiation induced cancer {{risks are}} driven by genetic instability. It is not well {{understood}} how different radiation sources induce genetic instability in cells with different genetic background. Here we report our studies on genetic instability, particularly chromosome instability using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), in human primary lymphocytes, normal human fibroblasts, and transformed human mammary epithelial cells in a temporal manner after exposure to high energy protons and Fe ions. The chromosome spread was prepared 48 hours, 1 week, 2 week, and 1 month after radiation exposure. Chromosome aberrations were analyzed with whole chromosome specific probes (chr. 3 and chr. 6). After exposure to protons and Fe ions of similar cumulative energy (??), Fe ions induced more chromosomal aberrations at early time point (48 hours) in all three types of cells. Over time (after 1 month), more chromosome aberrations were observed in cells exposed to Fe ions than in the same type of cells exposed to protons. While the mammary epithelial cells have higher intrinsic genetic instability and higher rate of initial chromosome aberrations than the fibroblasts, the fibroblasts retained more chromosomal aberration after long term cell culture (1 month) in comparison to their initial frequency of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration.</b> In lymphocytes, the <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency at 1 month after exposure to Fe ions was close to unexposed background, and the <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency at 1 month after exposure to proton was much higher.

Includes bibliographical references (page 62 - 71). Chromosomal aberration is an important biomarker for carcinogenesis. The study of DNA damage at the chromosomal level {{is an essential part}} of genetic toxicology. Different Chromium compounds are used in tanneries. Hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI) is considered as a human lung carcinogen with potentially widespread exposure. This study was designed specifically to evaluate cytogenotoxicity of chromium compounds used in leather industries on human peripheral blood lymphocytes by using a series of cytogenotoxic assays such as micronucleus test, <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> test and alkaline Comet assay. These tests are proved to be extremely useful techniques in cytogenotoxicity measurements. The micronucleus test assesses chromosomal damage by the formation of micronucleus on once-divided binucleatetd cells, whereas various types of structural chromosome aberrations and extent of DNA damage are detected by <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> and comet assay respectively. Different types of structural damages like Break, Gap and dicentric chromosomes were detected by <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> test. Micronucleus test also revealed significant chromosomal damage in chromium exposed human blood cells. In line with results of Micronucleus test and <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> test, significant DNA damage was also detected by Comet assay. The results of Comet assay indicate that chromium compounds induced significant increase in the comet tail DNA (%), tail moment and Olive tail moment; the parameters used to determine genotoxicity. These results from all three tests provide evidence that exposure to chromium and chromium compounds in human peripheral lymphocytes results in induction of DNA damage. Therefore the present study gives an indication of an association between chromium induced DNA damage and chromosomal instability. Mohammad Habibur RahmanM. Biotechnolog...|$|E
