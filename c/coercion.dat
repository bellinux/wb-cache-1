The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of <b>coercion.</b> This was used by magistrates to maintain public order.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} deriving metonymic <b>coercions</b> from the knowledge available in WordNet.

When a person gets mentally ill, {{up to the point}} when they can no longer care for them selves they can be treated under The Compulsory Mental Care Act. In the swedish closed psychiatric wards approximatly twenty percent of all patients are being treated under The Compulsory Mental Care Act. Sometimes the nursing staff needs to use coercive measures against the patients will. This puts great emotional, physical and psychcolgical pressure on the nursing staff. Aim: To describe nursing staffs’ experience of participating in <b>coercions.</b> Method: Literature study based on eight scientific articles with a qualitative approach. Findings: <b>Coercions</b> induced negative emotions like fear, discomfort, helplessness and powerlessness and it also resulted in feelings of guilt and bad conscience. It also had a negative effect in the daily work and there were a need for enhanced knowledge and experience. The personal approach could either ease or aggravate the percieved experience during <b>coercions.</b> The nursing staff also stated that a good relation with doctors, cheifs and patients was important. Conclusion: The physical and the emotional stress could decrease if the staff received therapeutic counselling and education which could result in fewer people quitting their jobs and fewer sick-leaves. It may also {{have a positive effect on}} patient care because the nursing staff would have recieved tools for managing their own and their patients emotions.

In this paper, we incorporate the idea of coercive subtyping into the traditional Hindley-Milner type systems in functional programming languages. This results in a typing system with <b>coercions,</b> {{an extension of the}} Hindley-Milner type system. A type inference algorithm is developed and shown to be sound and complete with respect to the typing system. A notion of derivational coherence is developed {{to deal with the problem}} of ambiguity and the corresponding type inference algorithm is shown to be sound and complete. 1 Introduction The Hindley-Milner type system (HM system for short) [8] is the standard core of the modern typed functional programming languages. Various extensions to the HM system have been proposed in order to enrich a programming language with new and more powerful features. These include, for example, Haskell's class mechanism [10], which provides convenient overloading facilities among other things. Coercive subtyping [14] {{is a theory}} of abbreviation developed in the setting of dependent type theories, where <b>coercions</b> are regarded as abbreviation mechanisms and directly characterised in the proof system (type theory) extended with <b>coercions.</b> It has been implemented in several proof development systems [1, 19, 4] and effectively used in proof development (e. g., [1]) ...|$|R
