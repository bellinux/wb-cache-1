5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
25|$|Yellowjackets {{are social}} hunters living in colonies {{containing}} workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens overwintering. Fertilized queens {{are found in}} protected places such as in hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20days. Larvae pupate, then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by {{the work}} ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had {{committed}} to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped {{in front of a}} studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, <b>Chewed</b> <b>Up,</b> which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special.|$|E
25|$|L. vechti {{frequently}} request trophallaxis {{from other}} members within their colonies. This behavior is most exhibited whenever a forager {{returns to the}} colony. A fellow colony member may solicit food from the individual {{in a variety of}} ways. The solicitor may approach the forager and bite her on her clypeus or her mouthparts. The two wasps may also push their heads against each other as if they are fighting. While this happens, they either do not move their antennae or hold them quivering to one side, and their abdomens are pointed downwards slightly. A wasp might also solicit food by rubbing the sides of the other individual's head with her front legs and flapping her wings vigorously. Trophallaxis usually happens too quickly to be observed, and a forager will often leave the nest a few seconds after arriving because she is often rushed by many wasps at the same time. Foragers also often return with insects (such as ants or termites) which they have <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> and feed to the larvae.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, writer Peter Benchley {{published}} Jaws, a {{novel about}} a rogue great white shark that terrorizes the fictional coastal community of Amity Island. Chief of police Martin Brody, biologist Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint hunt the shark after it kills four people. The novel was adapted as the film Jaws by Steven Spielberg in 1975. Spielberg's film makes reference {{to the events of}} 1916: Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) urge Amity's Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to close the beaches on the Fourth of July after the deaths of two swimmers and a fisherman. Hooper explains to the mayor, [...] "Look, the situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. And he's going to continue to feed here {{as long as there is}} food in the water." [...] Brody adds, [...] "And there's no limit to what he's gonna do! I mean we've already had three incidents, two people killed inside of a week. And it's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach!... 1916! Five people <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> on the surf!" [...] Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and Michael Capuzzo suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman Frank Mundus inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916. [...] The attacks are also briefly referred to in Benchley's novel White Shark (1994).|$|E

500|$|Film noir, {{to which}} lower budgets lent themselves, became {{something}} of a house style at the studio, indeed, the RKO B Stranger on the Third Floor (1940) is widely seen as initiating noir's classic period. Its cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954, is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir. Design chief Albert D'Agostino—another long-termer, who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941—and art director Walter Keller, along {{with others in the}} department, such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera, are similarly credited. The studio's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars: Robert Mitchum (who graduated to major star status) and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO. Gloria Grahame, Jane Greer, and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field. Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits: Johnny Angel (1945) and Nocturne (1946). Tourneur, Musuraca, Mitchum, and Greer, along with D'Agostino's design group, joined to make the A-budgeted Out of the Past (1947), now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs. Nicholas Ray began his directing career with the noir They Live by Night (1948), the first of a number of well-received films he made for RKO. [...] A big money maker were the dark and moody Dick Tracy detective film series; [...] Dick Tracy, Detective [...] (1945), Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) (as [...] "Filthy Flora", character actress Esther Howard <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> the scenery in this one), Dick Tracy's Dilemma (1947), and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (1947), (RKO wanted to title this feature [...] "Dick Tracy vs Karloff", but Boris Karloff nixed that idea, even though he did play the part of Gruesome).|$|E

2500|$|Despite Japan's loss of Mount Suribachi on {{the south}} end of the island, the Japanese still held strong {{positions}} on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much easier to hit with naval artillery fire. Coupled with this, the fortifications constructed by Kuribayashi were more impressive than at the southern end of the island. Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the [...] "meatgrinder". While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every [...] "penetration seemed to become a disaster" [...] as [...] "units were raked from the flanks, <b>chewed</b> <b>up,</b> and sometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines". As a result, the fighting bogged down, with American casualties piling up. Even capturing these points was not a solution to the problem since a previously secured position could be attacked from the rear by the use of the tunnels and hidden pillboxes. As such, it was said that [...] "they could take these heights at will, and then regret it".|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} game {{starting}} middle linebacker Chris Borland was ruled out. The Badgers would start with the ball. On the third play of the game, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave was hit as he attempted a third down pass. The ball fluttered and was off target and was intercepted by Iowa at the Wisconsin 49-yard line. Iowas was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover as they punted. The Badgers would go three-and-out and punt into the wind. The punt would only travel 23 yards and the Hawkeyes took over at the Wisconsin 39-yard line. Iowa would get down to the Wisconsin 11-yard line but would have to settle for a 28-yard field goal by K Mike Meyer. Once again, Wisconsin would go three-and-out and punt a 27-yarder into the wind. Wisconsin's defense would force and Iowa three-and-out, Iowa would do the same and then again the Badgers. The first quarter would end with Iowa leading 3–0 in a defensive struggle. The Badgers would start the second quarter at their own 8-yard line. They would finally pick up their first first down of the game on the drive but would later punt. The Hawkeyes would put together a nice 13-play drive that <b>chewed</b> <b>up</b> almost six and a half minutes and got down to the Wisconsin 4-yard line but again Iowa would have to settle for a 22-yard field goal. The Badgers would answer with a 44-yard touchdown pass to TE Jacob Pedersen from Joel Stave. The Hawkeyes would get the ball with less than two minutes until the half. They would be forced to punt and Wisconsin took over at their own 42-yard line with 1:17 left until half. The Badgers got to the Iowa 36-yard line with one second left. Wisconsin K Jack Russell came out to attempt a 54-yard field goal with the wind at his back. Just before the ball was snapped, Iowa called a timeout but Russell kicked the ball anyway and the kick would have been good. Iowa would use another two timeout to try and [...] "Ice" [...] the kicker. It worked as Russell attempt was short and the Badgers led 7–6 at halftime.|$|E
