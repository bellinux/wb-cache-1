40|$|The I/O {{subsystem}} {{is becoming}} a major bottleneck in {{an increasing number of}} computer systems. To provide improved I/O performance, as well as to accommodate growing storage requirements, disk subsystems are increasing in size. A major hurdle to obtaining the performance available from these large disk subsystems is load imbalance, or disk skew. Dynamic data placement, the conventional load balancing technique, is usually inadequate to deal with load imbalance because it is forced to accept atomic data sets with rapidly changing access patterns. We name this rapid fluctuation <b>floating</b> <b>load</b> imbalance and distinguish it from the conventional view of load imbalance, referred to as fixed load imbalance. Dynamic data placement also becomes increasingly difficult as the number of disks in the subsystem grows. Disk striping at a high granularity is suggested as a solution to <b>floating</b> <b>load</b> imbalance, the atomic data set problem and the complexity of balancing large disk subsystems.

50|$|In this bipolar {{junction}} transistor (BJT) implementation (Figure 4) of the general idea above, a Zener voltage stabilizer (R1 and DZ1) drives an emitter follower (Q1) loaded by a constant emitter resistor (R2) sensing the load current. The external (<b>floating)</b> <b>load</b> of this current source {{is connected to the}} collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they {{can be thought of as}} connected in series). The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.|$|R

40|$|Hybrid DC-DC {{converter}} topologies, combining inductor-based switching {{cells with}} Switched-Capacitor cells, are gaining an increasing attention in low to medium power applications where the miniaturization and possible {{integration of the}} power supply call for a reduction of the magnetic element energy and volume {{as well as an}} increase of the switching frequency.

In this paper, a family of step-up DC-DC converters are derived combining a basic Buck and Boost cell with a charge pump. Lower DC and AC current levels are obtained in the filter inductor as well as lower device voltage stress compared to an equivalent standard Boost topology.
