5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments</b> presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Independently of {{the method}} used to signify royal assent, it is the {{responsibility}} of the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary peers {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments.</b> As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who {{are not part of the}} House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|The {{elections}} for {{officers of the}} House were held on 27 and 28 October 1999, while those for peers elected by party were held on 3 and 4 November; the results were proclaimed to the House on 29 October and 5 November. Voters were required to rank in order of preference, on a ballot prepared by the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> as many candidates as there were places to be filled. The candidates receiving {{the greatest number of}} votes (without regard to the ranking on the ballots, so in effect block voting) were declared elected. Only if there were ties would the ranking be examined. Thereafter, until November 2002, if a vacancy occurred, the next-highest vote-getter (the rankings being examined, again, only in the case of ties) in the original election would fill the seat. This procedure was used on two occasions.|$|E
25|$|James Anderson {{had access}} to the Cooke {{manuscript}} when he produced his 1723 Constitutions. He quotes the final sixty lines in a footnote to his description of the York assembly.

500|$|The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> an {{official}} of the House of Lords, traditionally states a formula in Anglo-Norman Law French, indicating the sovereign's decision. The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words [...] "La Reyne remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult", translated as [...] "The Queen thanks her good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so." [...] For other public or private bills, the formula is simply [...] "La Reyne le veult" [...] ("the Queen wills it"). For personal bills, the phrase is [...] "Soit fait comme il est désiré" [...] ("let it be as it is desired"). The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic [...] "La Reyne s'avisera" [...] ("the Queen will consider it"). When the sovereign is male, Le Roy is substituted for La Reyne.|$|E
