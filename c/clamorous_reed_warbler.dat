50|$|Like most warblers, <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is insectivorous, {{but will}} take other small prey items.|$|E
50|$|The <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus stentoreus) is an Old World warbler in {{the genus}} Acrocephalus. It breeds from Egypt eastwards through Pakistan, Afghanistan and northernmost India to south China, {{southeast}} Asia and south to Australia. A. s. meridionalis is an endemic race in Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|The Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> Aguiguan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and Saipan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> are {{considered}} subspecies by some taxonomists.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> looks {{similar to}} the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> but the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is larger in size and has a {{stronger}} supercilium.|$|R
50|$|The Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus orientalis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia {{belonging to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> genus Acrocephalus. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. arundinaceus) of western Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is a large}} song thrush-sized warbler at 18-20 cm. The adult has an unstreaked brown {{back and}} whitish underparts. The {{forehead}} is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers. It is very like great reed warbler, but that species has richer coloured underparts.|$|E
50|$|It is {{slightly}} smaller, slenderer and shorter-winged than the great reed warbler. Its tail is shorter and more square-ended {{than that of}} the <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. stentoreus) and it has a slightly longer primary projection and a slightly shorter and thicker bill. The pale tip to the tail separates it from both species.|$|E
50|$|With the {{presence}} of maturing nectar bearing and insect attracting flora, {{an increasing number of}} bush birds can also be seen in the different seasons. For example, when the eucalpytus are flowering the New Holland honeyeater, musk lorikeet and rainbow lorikeet are frequent visitors. Breeding of some species is occurring in the Wetland, including the, dusky moorhen, Eurasian coot, Australasian grebe, <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> magpie-lark, willie wagtail, crested pigeon and spotted turtle dove.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus percernis) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae. It was formerly considered conspecific with the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and together known as the Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the second case of a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> x great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> hybrid (Acrocephalus scirpaceus and A. arundinaceus). The bird was {{captured}} during a standardised ringing session in Belgium in autumn 1999, and fell between the parental species in all measurements. Molecular analyses of two microsatellite loci verified that the bird was a female that had a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> father and a great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> mother...|$|R
50|$|Most taxonomists regard Garrett's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and the Moorea <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> as distinct. They {{used to be}} {{considered}} subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{collected}} by Allan Octavian Hume in the Sutlej Valley near Rampur, Himachal Pradesh, India on 13 November 1867. This specimen (BMNH registration no. 1886.7.8. 1742) was first provisionally described as Phyllopneuste macrorhyncha (Hume, 1869) {{but the name}} was changed two years later to Acrocephalus macrorhynchus (Hume, 1871). H C Oberholser however pointed out in 1905 that this was unacceptable because a specimen from Egypt described by von Müller in 1853 as Calamoherpe macrorhyncha {{turned out to be}} Acrocephalus stentoreus; Acrocephalus macrorhynchus was abandoned in favour of A. orinus. The identity of the species was in question and until 2002 was considered as a synonym of the <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus stentoreus). [...] Some others considered it an aberrant Blyth's reed warbler. A recent re-check of the morphology and the mtDNA suggested that it was a distinct species. An additional ten new specimens in collections were identified in 2008. These included specimens collected by John Biddulph from Gilgit and W N Koelz from Zebak.|$|E
40|$|Hybridization is {{observed}} frequently in birds, but {{often it is}} not known whether the hybrids are fertile and if backcrossing occurs. The breeding ranges of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and the <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. stentoreus) overlap in southern Kazakhstan and a previous study has documented hybridization in a sympatric population. In the present study, we first present a large set of novel microsatellite loci isolated and characterised in great reed warblers. Secondly, we evaluate whether hybridization in the sympatric breeding population has been followed by backcrossing and introgression...|$|E
40|$|We present {{morphological}} {{and molecular}} {{evidence of the}} occurrence of hybrids between great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus and clamorous reed warblers A. stentoreus in Kazakhstan where both species breed. Three males and one female of 249 examined individuals had wing characteristics that were intermediate between the parental species. Molecular analyses of a nuclear microsatellite locus and a mitochondria) gene confirmed that these four individuals were hybrids: genetic material came from both parental species. Three hybrids carried <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> mitochondria and one carried great reed warbler mitochondria. Our finding does not support hypotheses suggesting that hybridisation occurs {{as a last resort}} when conspecific mates are rare, because both species were common in the area. Instead, we suggest that hybridisation might have resulted from mistakes in mate recognition in general and/or that the highly variable song of male great reed warblers might have acted as a supernormal mate choice stimulus for female clamorous reed warblers...|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and together known as the Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is substantially larger, and the Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{speckled}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or streaked <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus sorghophilus) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{the stable}} isotope {{composition}} of feathers can provide significant {{insight into the}} spatial structure of bird migration. We collected feathers from Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus, Clamorous Reed Warblers A. stentoreus and {{a small sample of}} their hybrids in a sympatric breeding population in Kazakhstan to assess natural variation in stable isotope signatures and delineate wintering sites. The Great Reed Warbler is a long-distance migrant that overwinters in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the <b>Clamorous</b> <b>Reed</b> <b>Warbler</b> performs a short-distance migration to the Indian sub-continent. Carbon (d 13 C), nitrogen (d 15 N) and deuterium (dD) isotope signatures were obtained from winter-grown feathers of adult birds. There were highly significant differences in dD and less significant differences in d 13 C between Great and Clamorous Reed Warblers. Thus, our results show that the stable isotope technique, and in particular the deuterium (dD) signal, resolves continental variation in winter distribution between these closely related Acrocephalus species with sympatric natal origin. The isotope signatures of hybrid Great · Clamorous Reed Warblers clustered with those of the Great Reed Warblers. Hence, a parsimonious suggestion is that the hybrids undergo moult in Afrotropical wintering grounds, as do the Great Reed Warblers. The observed dD values fell within the range of expected values based on available precipitation data collected at precipita-tion stations across the wintering continents of each species. However, the power to predict the winter origin of birds in our study system using these data was weak as the expected values ranged widely at this broad continental scale...|$|E

The breeding ranges of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and the <b>clamorous</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. stentoreus) overlap in southern Kazakhstan and a previous study has documented hybridization in a sympatric population. In the present study, we first present a large set of novel microsatellite loci isolated and characterised in great reed warblers. Secondly, we evaluate whether hybridization in the sympatric breeding population has been followed by backcrossing and introgression. We isolated 181 unique microsatellite loci in great reed warblers. Of 41 loci evaluated, 40 amplified and 30 were polymorphic. Bayesian clustering analyses based on genotype data from 23 autosomal loci recognised two well-defined genetic clusters corresponding to the two species. Individuals clustered to a very high extent to either of these clusters (admixture proportions $ 0. 984) {{with the exception of}} four previously suggested arundinaceus–stentoreus hybrid birds that showed mixed ancestry (admixture proportions 0. 495 – 0. 619). Analyses of simulated hybrids and backcrossed individuals showed that the sampled birds do not correspond to first–fourth-generation backcrosses, and that fifth or higher generation backcrosses to a high extent resemble ‘pure ’ birds at this set of markers. We conclude that these novel microsatellite loci provide a useful molecular resource for Acrocephalus warblers. The time to reach reproductive isolation is believed to be very long in birds, approximately 5 Myrs, and with an estimated divergence time of 2 Myrs between these warblers, some backcrossing and introgression coul...|$|E

However, there was no evidence for backcrossing and introgression suggesting that hybrids are either infertile or their progeny inviable. Very low levels of introgression cannot be excluded, which still may be an important factor as a source of new genetic variation...|$|E
500|$|A 2009 phylogenic {{study of}} the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as {{recently}} as 2010 its relation {{with other members of}} the genus was unknown.
