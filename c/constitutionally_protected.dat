5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protected</b> parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protected</b> speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protected</b> right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E

5000|$|In further {{attempts}} to minimize antisemitism within government, the United States' Declaration of Independence embraced the liberal principles {{put forth by}} England and formed a republic that had executive, judicial, and legislative powers and even [...] "forbid the establishment of any religion or any official religious test for office holding." [...] Having a government that respected and protected civil liberties, especially those pertaining to religious liberties, reduced blatant antisemitism by <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protecting</b> the right to practice different faiths.

40|$|In Canada, {{a liberal}} {{democracy}} that <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protects</b> liberal freedoms and civic equality, {{how should the}} government respond to culturally based demands for accommodation? Should culture be recognized by a liberal democratic government? Does such recognition challenge liberal freedoms and civic equality? In this thesis I argue {{that there may be}} times when the Canadian government ought to acknowledge cultural differences for the purposes of legislating and creating public policy in the interest of fairness and to achieve good outcomes. Previous attempts at reconciling cultural diversity with public institutions have focused on protecting and affirming cultural identities. I critically examine three such approaches and argue that cultural identification is tied to fundamental liberal freedoms such that fixing cultural identities in bureaucratic and legislative frameworks conflicts with liberal freedoms in a problematic way. I propose an alternative approach to cultural accommodation that avoids the problems of cultural identification by focusing on concrete relationships between citizens and the practical consequences of cultural practices...|$|R

40|$|Three {{philosophical}} rationales [...] search-for-truth, self-governance, and self-fulfillment [...] have animated {{discussions of}} free expression for decades. Each rationale emerged and attained prominence in American jurisprudence in specific {{political and cultural}} circumstances. Moreover, each rationale shares a foundational commitment to the classical liberal (modernist) self. But the three traditional rationales are incompatible with our digital age. IN particular, {{the idea of the}} classical liberal self enjoying maximum liberty in a private sphere does not fit in the postmodern information society. The time for a new rationale has arrived. The same sociocultural conditions that undermine the traditional rationales suggest a self-emergence rationale built on the feminist concept of relational autonomy. This novel rationale <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protects</b> expression that fosters the ongoing creative and dynamic process of self-emergence. As such, the rationale justifies protecting expression concerned with the emergent self 2 ̆ 7 s struggle to define itself and broader culture. The self-emergence rationale has important ramifications, especially for free-expression issues related to the Internet. The Roberts Court has invoked the traditional rationales in granting expansive first-amendment protections to corporations. May Internet-related issues involve multinational corporations, such as Google, Verizon, and Facebook. But under the self-emergence rationale, publicly held business corporations should not have free-speech rights for two reasons. First, they have fixed rather than emergent natures. Second, they manipulate and limit the sociocultural space available for the autonomous self-emergence of individuals...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has a tense {{relationship}} with migrants. It is attractive {{because of its}} status as an African financial powerhouse and the ‘Rainbow Nation’ image it has projected to the world. It {{is the land of}} opportunity where extensive constitutional protections are believed to be able to provide tangible forms of safety. Yet, migrants are regularly accused of a variety of social ills and in recent years have been {{on the receiving end of}} several mass scale xenophobic attacks. South Africa is also unique on the African continent in relation to refugee regimes in that it is the only country that recognises and <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protects</b> transgender refugees/asylum seekers. In light of this in recent years it has seen a marked rise in the emergence of transgender migrants within the country. The refugee system though is plagued with issues of corruption and many migrants choose rather to exist in a zone of illegality, outside the system. Drawing on research carried out in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2014 this paper focuses on two such cases that of Trisha and Musa - undocumented transgender migrant sex workers. Being undocumented and practicing a trade that is illegal in South Africa - sex work - leaves Trisha and Musa particularly vulnerable to arrest and deportation. Yet, Trisha and Musa are among several transgender migrants that have been arrested and sent to South Africa’s lone deportation facility - Lindela - only to be released. This paper considers what citizenship, rights and the socio-spatial borders of belonging might mean when transgender migrants come to understand themselves as immune to deportation...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{laws are}} {{normally}} enacted by a legislature or {{developed by a}} judiciary. However, there has been another traditional source of social order throughout history-customs, which are "popular, normative pattern[s] that reflect the common understandings of valid, compulsory rights and obligations. " 1 Although such customs and customary rights have long {{been part of the}} law applicable to land, water, and resources connected thereto, the Supreme Court of the United States' decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council 2 has elevated the importance of custom by naming it as a potential defense to categorical takings claims. A customary-or customary law-most broadly defined, is a practice or right of use exercised by a discrete and identifiable group of people (a tribe or native peoples, for example) over a particular area of land {{for a very long time}} and is recognized for certain purposes in a local court or tribunal. In most countries, the customary law may be modified or abolished by statute, ordinance, or rule enacted by government, generally through a legislative act. Thereafter, the precise definition and scope of custom as law usually depends upon the nature and history of the nation in which customary rights are claimed or exercised. This Article summarizes the modern emergence of customary law in the United States and internationally. It discusses two distinct forms of customary law, the first being custom, as recognized in English common law and discussed by Blackstone and the second being "native customs" that are exercised by indigenous peoples. Section II discusses Blackstone's definition of custom and the importance ofcustom in real property as a source of law in derogation of so-called common law. Section III explores native custom, with emphasis on the State of Hawai'i, which <b>constitutionally</b> <b>protects</b> the "traditional and customary" rights of Native Hawaiians, and on select foreign jurisdictions in which custom, often exercised by or in favor of indigenous peoples, plays a strong role in the law relating to land, water, natural resources, and self-government. Section IV analyzes the significance of custom within the United States as a background principle of a state's law of property, which gives state and local government a safe haven from liability under the categorical or total regulatory taking rules set out by the Supreme Court of the United States in Lucas. As this Article will demonstrate, poorly defined customary law runs the risk of intruding onto fundamental property rights such as the right to exclude. Judicial adherence to some form of the Blackstonian criteria for good customs would significantly ameliorate such dangers...|$|R

Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas offered similar declarations when they seceded, following South Carolina's example.|$|R
