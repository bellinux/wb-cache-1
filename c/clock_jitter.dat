50|$|For <b>clock</b> <b>jitter,</b> {{there are}} three {{commonly}} used metrics: absolute jitter, period jitter, and cycle to cycle jitter.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in {{the usual}} case of sending and {{receiving}} registers at different locations, {{there is no clear}} way to separate the total clock timing uncertainty into spatial skew and jitter. Thus some authors use the term clock skew to describe the sum of spatial clock skew and <b>clock</b> <b>jitter.</b> This of course means that the clock skew between two points varies from cycle to cycle, which is a complexity that is rarely mentioned. Many other authors use the term clock skew only for the spatial variation of clock times, and use the term <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> to represent the rest of the total clock timing uncertainty. This of course means that the <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> must be different at each component, which again is rarely discussed.|$|E

50|$|In {{a digital}} receiver, the analog to digital {{converter}} (ADC) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency {{tends to be}} lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency. However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause <b>clock</b> <b>jitters.</b>|$|R

Subsequently, a vernier ring oscillator (VRO) {{is used as a}} time-to-digital converter (TDC) to quantize the jitter information into digital codes. The proposed self-referred architecture with a cycle-controlled delay line doesn’t require an external reference clock to measure the jitter of the on-chip signals. Therefore, the BIJM circuit design complexity is greatly reduced by the proposed architecture. The proposed all-digital BIJM is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, and the input frequency range is 100 MHz to 300 MHz.

40|$|A general {{method to}} design continuous-time Sigma [...] Delta (ΣΔ) {{modulators}} with delayed return-to-zero (RZ) feedback pulse is presented.

It is shown that the keypoint to avoid the degrading effects of <b>clock</b> <b>jitters,</b> is to generate a low jitter feedback pulse-width, using a monostable multivibrator. 1. INTRODUCTION Recently, continuous-time ΣΔ modulators have received increasing attention for either high-speed [1] or low-power [2] applications. The main advantages of continuous-time ΣΔ modulators over their discrete-time counterparts are: higher sampling rate [3], lower thermal noise [4] and intrinsic anti-aliasing filtering [5, 6]. The first major problem encountered in the implementation of continuous-time ΣΔ modulators is the quantizer delay. In a classical continuous-time ΣΔ modulator [7], the D/A is driven directly by the quantizer output. The D [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Digital {{systems have}} their own problems. Digitizing adds noise, which is {{measurable}} and depends on the audio bit depth of the system, regardless of other quality issues. Timing errors in sampling <b>clocks</b> (<b>jitter)</b> result in non-linear distortion (FM modulation) of the signal. One quality measurement for a digital system (Bit Error Rate) relates to the probability of an error in transmission or reception. Other metrics {{on the quality of}} the system are defined by the sample rate and bit depth. In general, digital systems are much less prone to error than analog systems; However, nearly all digital systems have analog inputs and/or outputs, and certainly all of those that interact with the analog world do so. These analog components of the digital system can suffer analog effects and potentially compromise the integrity of a well designed digital system.|$|R

As the clock information is synthesized into the data bit stream, rather than explicitly embedding it, the serializer (transmitter) <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> tolerance is to 5-10 ps rms and the reference clock disparity at the deserializer is +/-100ppm.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to clock skew due to static {{differences in the}} clock latency from the clock source to each clocked register, no clock signal is perfectly periodic, so that the clock period or clock cycle time varies even at a single component, and this variation is known as <b>clock</b> <b>Jitter.</b> At a particular point in a clock distribution network, jitter is the only contributor to the clock timing uncertainty.|$|E
50|$|As an approximation, it {{is often}} useful to discuss the total clock timing {{uncertainty}} between two registers as the sum of spatial clock skew (the spatial differences in clock latency from the clock source), and <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> (meaning the non-periodicity of the clock at a particular point in the network). Unfortunately, spatial clock skew varies in time from one cycle to the next due to local time-dependent variations in the power supply, local temperature, and noise coupling to other signals.|$|E
40|$|High density {{multilink}} interfaces such as QPI and HyperTransport {{include a}} ded-icated link {{to carry a}} synchronous clock from the transmitter to receiver and shared by 5 - 20 data transceivers. Sub-rate <b>clocks</b> ameliorate <b>jitter</b> amplification in lossy channels. The forwarded clock must be frequency-multiplied and aligned with the data at each receiver. Per pin deskewing is done at startup [1]; the optimum deskew setting is stored and the calibration circuitry turned off dur-ing normal operation. Jitter on the forwarded clock is correlated with jitter on the data because both are generated by the same transmitter. Hence, jitter tolerance is improved by retiming the data with a clock that tracks correlated jitter on the forwarded clock [2]. However, since the delay of the data and clock paths typi-cally differ by several UI, very high frequency jitter will appear out-of-phase at the receiver {{and should not be}} tracked. For a delay mismatch of L UI between <b>clock</b> and data, <b>jitter</b> tolerance is improved by tracking jitter up to fbit / 4 L [2]. If the mismatch is 5 UI, at 4 Gb/s and 8 Gb/s the <b>clock</b> path <b>jitter</b> tracking bandwidth (JTB) should be 200 MHz and 400 MHz respectively. In summary, the clock pat...|$|R
40|$|ICs are {{required}} to satisfy always increasing performance needs for modern electronic applications. This results in higher operating frequencies for digital circuits, thus increasing the generated Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI). International standards and industrial regulations, in domains such as automotive applications, enforce strict rules about the EMI behavior of electronic systems. Thus, EMI is becoming a major concern for designers, with direct implications on the commercial viability of a product. In this paper, we apply the desynchronization methodology, down to the physical layout level, to an industrial microprocessor used in automotive applications. The results show that we can both use the advantages from desynchronization, i. e., average case performance and better variability tolerance, and achieve significant EMI reductions, without excessive costs in area or power consumption. While our paper confirms earlier claims that indeed asynchronous circuits reduce EMI, it also shows clearly that {{by far the largest}} EMI gain can be obtained by adding dynamically varying delays (which in turn cause local <b>clock</b> <b>jittering)</b> on top of desynchronizatio...|$|R

As the clock is explicitly embedded and can be recovered from the bit stream, the serializer (transmitter) <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> tolerance is relaxed to 80-120 ps rms, while the reference clock disparity at the deserializer can be +/-50000 ppm (i.e. 5%).|$|E

By storing the carrier phase measurements and differentially post-processing the data, positioning errors on the order of 10 centimeters are possible with these receivers.|$|E

Provided that the actual sampling time uncertainty due to the <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> is , the error caused by this phenomenon can be estimated as [...] This will result in additional recorded noise that will reduce the effective number of bits (ENOB) below that predicted by quantization error alone. The error is zero for DC, small at low frequencies, but significant when high frequencies have high amplitudes. This effect can be ignored if it is drowned out by the quantizing error. Jitter requirements can be calculated using the following formula: , where q is the number of ADC bits.|$|E

5000|$|The {{superior}} close-in {{phase noise}} {{performance of a}} DDS {{stems from the fact}} that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the reference oscillator and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS on the other hand, reduces the reference clock phase noise by the ratio [...] because its output is derived by fractional division of the clock. Reference <b>clock</b> <b>jitter</b> translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to , the output phase noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6dB below the reference clock phase-noise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Accurate clock skew {{budgets are}} {{important}} for microprocessor designers to avoid hold-time failures and to properly allocate resources when optimizing global and local paths. Many published clock skew budgets neglect voltage jitter and process variation, which are becoming dominant factors in otherwise balanced-trees. However, worst-case process variation assumptions are severely pessimistic. This paper describes the major sources of clock skew in a microprocessor using a modified-tree and applies the model to a second-generation Itanium-M processor family microprocessor currently under design. Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop statistical clock skew budgets for setup and hold time constraints in a four-level skew hierarchy. Voltage jitter through the phase locked loop (PLL) and clock buffers accounts {{for the majority of}} skew budgets. We show that taking into account the number of nearly critical paths between clocked elements at each level of the skew hierarchy and variations in the data delays of these paths reduces the difference between global and local skew budgets by more than a factor of two. Another insight is that data path delay variability limits the potential cycle-time benefits of active deskew circuits because the paths with the worst skew are unlikely to also be the paths with the longest data delays.
