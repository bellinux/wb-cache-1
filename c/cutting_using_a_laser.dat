40|$|A {{new method}} for {{fabrication}} of microelectrode arrays comprised of traditional implant materials is presented. The main construction principle {{is the use}} of spun-on medical grade silicone rubber as insulating substrate material and platinum foil as conductor (tracks, pads and electrodes). The silicone rubber and the platinum foil are patterned by <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> and <b>a</b> microcontroller-driven, stepper-motor operated x-y table. The method does not require expensive clean room facilities and offers an extremely short design-to-prototype time of below 1 day. First prototypes demonstrate a minimal achievable feature size of about 30 ?m...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{are applied}} {{more and more}} in the aircraft industry {{as well as in the}} automobile industry. The principal reason is the highly mechanical load capacity along with the low density. Moreover, the corrosion resistance plus the damping behavior of the material can be utilized fully in highly stressed structures. However, the concept of manufacture CFRP-parts close to the final contour does not substitute the need of cutting them. The different properties of fiberand matrix-material constitute an ambitious challenge while <b>cutting</b> CFRP <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> beam. This paper deals with elementary analysis of the laser remote cutting process and the gas assisted laser cutting of CFRP...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the utility}} of a {{metamodel}} in gaining valuable information relating to the optimization of <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> process <b>using</b> <b>a</b> CW <b>laser</b> source is analyzed. The simulation itself {{is characterized by a}} high dimensional input parameter set. Each parameter has its own range, and thus the complete parameter sets with their ranges form the full parameter domain space. The quality criteria are analyzed and used as objective function to optimize the process. Simulation results can only help in the build-up of process understanding, if they can be presented in their entirety and together with their origin in the parameter domain. For this purpose a metamodeling concept is presented, which takes the results from simulations and generates a process map that clearly indicates the process domains. For gaining insights, the Elementary Effect method is applied to screen the important parameters that exhibit the greater impact on the process...|$|R
40|$|Soft linear gold {{microelectrode}} arrays {{for high}} throughput scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging were fabricated using the Aerosol Jet® printing technology. Nanoparticulate gold ink was printed on polyimide Kapton HN® thin films. After sintering, a 200 nm thick Parylene C coating was deposited to cover and seal the gold tracks. A cross-section of {{the array of}} microelectrodes was exposed by <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> ArF excimer <b>laser</b> beam directed onto a metallic mask. Cyclic voltammograms, approach curves and SECM images in feedback mode demonstrate the capability of the arrays as SECM probes. Reactivity imaging of a platinum band structure on glass was performed with Parylene C coating facing the substrate providing an almost constant working distance. The softness of the array leads to a bending and allows scanning in contact mode like brushing the sample surface. For hard surfaces such as array electrode structures and similar materials, this occurs without detectable damage to the sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the cutting properties of <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> scalpel by applying heavily absorbing coatings (HAC) on an operating silica fiber end. Materials and Methods. In {{the investigation}} we <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> scalpel with wavelength 0. 97 μm and output power 3 and 7 W. Tissue was incised by a fiber without coating and coated by a carbon layer or graphite-based HAC. Results. The assessment of ex vivo tissue incision rate showed <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> scalpel with HAC on a fiber tip to provide maximum cutting rate. Moreover, the mode was characterized by the minimum coagulation area. Incision width is slightly less than that resulted from <b>using</b> <b>a</b> clean fiber end. HAC was more resistant to mechanical and laser action, and persisted on a fiber tip far longer than carbon. In vivo studies on animal skin showed all tissue incision modes to exhibit high coagulability. Histological analysis revealed that <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> fiber tip having different coatings formed similar tissue structural changes. Skin appeared to have burn destruction of epidermis along the laser exposure width. Derma {{was found to have}} visible coagulation morphological changes of the structure. Beneath the coagulation area there were collagen fibers with altered properties: areas with swollen fibers, as well as destruction areas with disruptions and ruptures. HAC application enabled to reduce laser radiation power to provide effective tissue incision...|$|R
