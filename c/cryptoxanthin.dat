At {{the end of}} 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59 % (p < 0. 001), 46 % (p = 0. 018), and 22 % (p < 0. 001), and 8 -fold (p = 0. 045), respectively. Flavanones were excreted in urine 9 -fold more {{at the end of}} the intervention (p = 0. 01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 8 -Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16 % (p = 0. 38; n = 11), and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29 % (p = 0. 36; n = 7), respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change significantly.

40|$|As part of {{a series}} of studies on the {{analytical}} and nutritional aspects of carotenoids and retinoids in foods, seventeen types of legumes and their products and 9 tubers and starchy roots were studied for their carotenoid composition and content by HPLC. All samples were saponified and subsequently chromatographed using a reverse-phase HPLC method previously developed in this laboratory in which carotenoids were separated isocratically on an octadecylsilane (C 18) column using a ternary mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and ethyl acetate (88 : 10 : 2) as the mobile phase. Carotenoid peaks obtained were tentatively identified using 6 reference standards similarly chromatographed. The HPLC method used enabled the separation and quantitation of the major carotenoids present, namely, lutein, <b>cryptoxanthin,</b> lycopene, g-, a- and b-carotenes. For most of the legumes, the major carotenoids detected were b-carotene, lutein and <b>cryptoxanthin.</b> Lutein was found in all the legumes studied, and was clearly the major carotenoid in most of the legumes, followed by unidentified carotenoids, b-carotene and cryptoxanthi. The other carotenoids were encountered infrequently and at low levels. The starchy roots and tubers gave a different carotenoid composition from those obtained for the legumes: lycopene and b-carotene were detected in all the samples except in sago. There was no clear pattern of carotenoids present in the samples studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biochemical {{measurement}} of fat-soluble vitamins would allow direct assessment in epidemiological studies of {{their association with}} disease. However, the perceived instability of these compounds and typically high cost of collection and analysis may make their measurement impractical, particularly in large-scale studies. Using a high performance liquid chromatography assay developed in-house, we have investigated the separate effects of temperature and light on the stability of vitamins in whole blood over several days. METHODS: Multiple blood samples from 10 volunteers were stored at 20 degrees C or 4 degrees C and in dark or light conditions. Immediately after collection and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days later, samples stored under each condition were centrifuged, and the plasma was aliquoted and stored at - 80 degrees C. Subsequently, all aliquots from each individual were analysed in one analytical run. RESULTS: In whole blood stored under {{any of the four}} conditions for up to 7 days, concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol changed by less than 8 %, and <b>cryptoxanthin</b> and gamma-tocopherol by less than 11 %. Although significant temperature effects were observed for alpha-carotene, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, and a significant effect of light was observed for alpha-carotene, <b>cryptoxanthin,</b> and lycopene, these analytes changed by less than 1 % per day under all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of these fat-soluble vitamins change by only a few per cent in whole blood during storage at room temperature for several days. Hence, delayed separation of blood samples (which may be required for practical reasons in large-scale epidemiological studies) does not preclude reliable {{measurement of}} fat-soluble vitamins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractComparative lipid {{analysis}} demonstrated reduced {{amount of}} PG (50 %) and lower ratio of MGDG/DGDG in iron-stressed Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells compared to cells grown under iron sufficient conditions. In parallel, the monoenoic (C: 1) fatty acids in MGDG, DGDG and PG increased from 46. 8 %, 43. 7 % and 45. 6 %, respectively in control cells to 51. 6 %, 48. 8 % and 48. 7 %, respectively in iron-stressed cells. This suggests increased membrane dynamics, which may facilitate {{the diffusion of}} PQ and keep the PQ pool in relatively more oxidized state in iron-stressed compared to control cells. This was confirmed by chlorophyll fluorescence and thermoluminescence measurements. Analysis of carotenoid composition demonstrated that the induction of isiA (CP 43 ′) protein in response to iron stress is accompanied by significant increase of the relative abundance of all carotenoids. The quantity of carotenoids calculated on a Chl basis increased differentially with nostoxanthin, <b>cryptoxanthin,</b> zeaxanthin and β-carotene showing 2. 6 -, 3. 1 -, 1. 9 - and 1. 9 -fold increases, respectively, while the relative amount of caloxanthin was increased only by 30 %. HPLC analyses of the pigment composition of Chl–protein complexes separated by non-denaturating SDS-PAGE demonstrated even higher relative carotenoids content, especially of <b>cryptoxanthin,</b> in trimer and monomer PSI Chl–protein complexes co-migrating with CP 43 ′ from iron-stressed cells than in PSI complexes from control cells where CP 43 ′ is not present. This implies a carotenoid-binding role for the CP 43 ′ protein which supports our previous suggestion for effective energy quenching and photoprotective role of CP 43 ′ protein in cyanobacteria under iron stress...|$|E

Samples (50 4) are injected onto a 250 x 4. 6 mm column of 5 -p. m-particle Spherisorb ODS 1 (Phase Separations) that had been equilibrated with solvent mixture A:B (90 : 10 by vol) [A = 100 mmol/L ammonium acetate in methanol: acetonitrile (80 : 20 by vol) and B = 100 mmol/L ammo-nium acetate in water] at 2 mL/min. The analytes are eluted by running a 12 -mm linear gradient to 100 % A; solvent A is then maintained for 10 mi Intrabatch CVs were 2. 3 %, 3. 3 %, 2. 8 %, 3. 6 %, 3. 6 %, and 3. 0 % for retinol, a-tocopherol, Iutein/zeaxanthin, <b>cryptoxanthin,</b> lycopene...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{fast and}} {{high-resolution}} UPLC-MSE {{analysis was used}} to identify phytoplankton pigments in an ethanol extract of Porphyridium purpureum (Pp) devoid of phycobiliproteins. In a first step, 22 standard pigments were analyzed by UPLC-MSE to build a database including retention time and accurate masses of parent and fragment ions. Using this database, seven pigments or derivatives previously reported in Pp were unequivocally identified: β,β-carotene, chlorophyll a, zeaxanthin, chlorophyllide a, pheophorbide a, pheophytin a, and <b>cryptoxanthin.</b> Minor amounts of Divinyl chlorophyll a, a chemotaxonomic pigment marker for prochlorophytes, were also unequivocally identified using the database. Additional analysis of ionization and fragmentation patterns indicated the presence of ions that could correspond to hydroxylated derivatives of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, produced during the ethanolic extraction, as well as previously described galactosyldiacylglycerols, the thylakoid coenzyme plastoquinone, and gracilamide B, a molecule previously reported in the red seaweed Gracillaria asiatica. These data point to UPLC-MSE as an efficient technique to identify phytoplankton pigments for which standards are available, and demonstrate its major interest as a complementary method for the structural elucidation of ionizable marine molecules...|$|E
40|$|Cronobacter sakazakii {{could form}} yellow-pigmented colonies. However, the {{chemical}} {{structure and the}} biosynthetic pathway of the yellow pigments have not been identified. In this study, the yellow pigments of C. sakazakii BAA 894 were purified and analyzed. The major components of the yellow pigments were confirmed as zeaxanthin-monoglycoside and zeaxanthin-diglycoside. A gene cluster containing seven genes responsible for the yellow pigmentation in C. sakazakii BAA 894 was identified. The seven genes of C. sakazakii BAA 894 or parts of them were reconstructed in a heterologous host Escherichia coli DH 5 a. The pigments formed in these E. coli strains were isolated and analyzed by thin layer chromatography, UV-visible spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry. These redesigned E. coli strains could produce different carotenoids. E. coli strain expressing all the seven genes could produce zeaxanthin-monoglycoside and zeaxanthin-diglycoside; E. coli strains expressing parts of the seven genes could produce lycopene, b-carotene, <b>cryptoxanthin</b> or zeaxanthin. This study identified the gene cluster responsible for the yellow pigmentation in C. sakazakii BAA 894...|$|E
