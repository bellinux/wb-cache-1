5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That {{was a very different}} depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{tidal bore}} – {{a wall or}} undulating wave of water moves {{upstream}} against water flowing downstream as shown in Figures 3 and 4.

25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, {{from our}} experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{there must have been}} an initial mover.

25|$|In general, having {{good grades}} does not {{necessarily}} translate into having good aggregate scores. From the data, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> students with lower grades have achieved better aggregate scores than others with better grades. For example, a particular Student X scored 233 with grades of 2As and 2Bs, bettering a Student Y who scored 221 with 4As.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies that}} there is a {{function}} of state which is conserved over a complete cycle of the Carnot cycle. Clausius called this state function entropy. One <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{definition}} of the Reynolds number we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a large diameter with rapid flow, where the density of the blood is high, tends towards turbulence. Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to turbulent flow, for instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of atheroma may be the cause of turbulent flow, where audible turbulence may be detected with a stethoscope.|$|E

Moreover, it <b>can</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> threads vels_th suffer higher delays (81 % slower) than diff_th threads (48 % slower). This is because these threads, being all clones, compete for the same functional units of virtual processors, producing conflicts and delays.|$|R

One of the trainers models the desired student behavior, and {{is seen by}} the student as a rival for the other trainer's attention. The trainer and model/rival exchange roles so the student <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the process is interactive. Pepperberg reported that during times when she and an assistant were having a conversation and made mistakes, Alex would correct them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} point {{to consider is}} that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we now know that a diamond's appearance is composed of many light paths that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room.
