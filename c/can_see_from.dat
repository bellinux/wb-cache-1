Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E
