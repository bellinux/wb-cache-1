The main propose of this project is to assess performance of {{active suspension}} system in comparison and passive suspension system by implementing Fuzzy and Proportional-Integral-Derivative. The quarter car system is designed and constructed based on the four wheel independent suspension. Mathematic model that used in simulation {{is based on the}} dynamic diagram of quarter car system. Passive suspension is a system that not equipped with any controller but there are two controllers that used in active suspension system. The two controllers that applied to simulate the action of active system are Fuzzy Logic controller and Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller. First controller that used in active system is PID controller. This controller design deals with the selection of proportional gain, derivative gain and integral gain parameters (K_p,〖 K〗_(d) and〖 K〗_i). The parameter of this control is adjusted by tuning the PID controller using the heuristic method. Fuzzy Logic controller is applied to the block diagram that <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>PID</b> controller to improve the active suspension system.

40|$|The glazed {{window in}} a {{building}} system is used to allow natural daylight to penetrate through the external envelope to minimise the use of artificial lighting. Generally the glazed elements of the building system have poor heat resisting capability which leads to heat flowing {{in or out of}} a building system depending on the local climate conditions. An innovative approach is made to reduce the heat flow through the glazing by providing an evacuated narrow space (approximately 0. 15 mm) between two layers of float glass. In the process of fabrication the edges of the two glass panes are sealed using a transition metal and by means of a pump-out device the glass pane assembly is evacuated. Suitable spacer pillars are uniformly spaced to maintain a constant spacing between two glass sheets which would otherwise touch under atmospheric pressure. During the fabrication, temperature and pressure are continuously monitored to determine the optimum process parameters. The out-gassing of the glazing is also observed during the fabrication process. When the glazing sample is heated in an evacuated chamber, the internal pressure of the chamber is observed to increase by a measurable amount. In the fabrication process of evacuated glazing samples, a pump-out device is incorporated to achieve the desired level of evacuation. The pumping out device has provision for measurement of the process parameters locally along with heater temperature for sealing the evacuation hole. The entire heating process is <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>PID</b> controller along with logging of all the process parameters...|$|E
