40|$|Critical {{infrastructures}} {{are based}} on complex systems that provide vital services to the nation. The complexities of the interconnected networks, each managed by individual organisations, if not properly secured, could offer vulnerabilities that threaten other organisations’ systems that depend on their services. This thesis argues that the awareness of interdependencies among critical sectors needs to be increased. Managing and securing critical infrastructure is not isolated responsibility of a government or an individual organisation. There {{is a need for}} a strong collaboration among critical service providers of public and private organisations in protecting critical information infrastructure. Cyber exercises have been incorporated in national cyber security strategies as part of critical information infrastructure protection. However, organising a <b>cyber</b> <b>exercise</b> involved multi sectors is challenging due to the diversity of participants’ background, working environments and incidents response policies. How well the lessons learned from the <b>cyber</b> <b>exercise</b> and how it can be transferred to the participating organisations is still a looming question. In order to understand the implications of cyber exercises on what participants have learnt and how it benefits participants’ organisation, a <b>Cyber</b> <b>Exercise</b> Post Assessment (CEPA) framework was proposed in this research. The CEPA framework consists of two parts. The first part aims to investigate the lessons learnt by participants from a <b>cyber</b> <b>exercise</b> using the four levels of the Kirkpatrick Training Model to identify their perceptions on reaction, learning, behaviour and results of the exercise. The second part investigates the Organisation Cyber Resilience (OCR) of participating sectors. The framework was used to study the impact of the <b>cyber</b> <b>exercise</b> called X Maya in Malaysia. Data collected through interviews with X Maya 5 participants were coded and categorised based on four levels according to the Kirkpatrick Training Model, while online surveys distributed to ten Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) sectors participated in the exercise. The survey used the C-Suite Executive Checklist developed by World Economic Forum in 2012. To ensure the suitability of the tool used to investigate the OCR, a reliability test conducted on the survey items showed high internal consistency results. Finally, individual OCR scores were used to develop the OCR Maturity Model to provide the organisation cyber resilience perspectives of the ten CNII sectors...|$|E

To effectively counter potentially decisive and skilled attackers it is necessary to understand, or at least model, their behavior.

Although their architecture may differ, the following four types of services are usually provided: (a) Resource management, i. e. the allocation of network infrastructure with requested topology and running applications. (b) Interaction of users with hosts, i. e. allowing users to log into hosts and run applications {{in the same way}} they interact in real computer networks. (c) Monitoring services, when network activities are monitored on the fly and measured data are stored and mediated to end users on demand. (d) Learning and understanding of cyber security processes by providing users with a continuous overview of events and developments by means of analytic tools, interactive visualizations, and other enhanced user interfaces. This paper deals with (c) and (d) service types. The low-level infrastructure of modern cyber ranges is usually generic, enabling to instantiate topologies and hosts of many types and then to support end user with variable objectives and tasks. However, this diversity of objectives put big demands on the design of a monitoring subsystem and corresponding user interfaces providing insight into the measured data and cyber security processes. It is because the monitored data and their manipulation strategies may differ scenario to scenario. This paper discusses a generic approach to data storage using traditional entity-relationship databases. Our approach exploits data analysis patterns enabling us to define scenario-specific security phenomena without modifying rational scheme or other parts of the cyber range architecture. A flexible web-based system of user interfaces adaptable to the variable data is discussed as well. Our approach has been developed as part of a KYPO Cyber Range.

The increasing usage of digital control and computer systems, for supervisory control and data acquisition in the control rooms of new generation nuclear reactors, has introduced several cyber security issues that must be addressed. One {{of the most significant}} problems is that this new technology has increased the vulnerability of the nuclear power plant to cyber security threats. Furthermore, this exposed vulnerability {{is one of the main}} reasons that the transition to digital control rooms connected to enterprise network (or the internet) has been slow and hesitant. In order to address these issues and ensure that a digital control system is safe and secure from undesirable intrusions, the system must go through extensive tests and validation. These tests will verify that systems are safe and properly functioning. The vulnerabilities of a nuclear power plant can be determined through conducting <b>cyber</b> security <b>exercises,</b> <b>cyber</b> security attacks scenarios, and simulated attacks.

40|$|AbstractCyber {{security}} is a pervasive issue that impacts public and private organizations. While several published accounts describe the task demands of cyber security analysts, it is only recently that research has begun to investigate the cognitive and performance factors that distinguish novice from expert cyber security analysts. Research {{in this area is}} motivated by the need to understand how to better structure the education and training of cyber security professionals, a desire to identify selection factors that are predictive of professional success in cyber security and questions related to the development of software tools to augment human performance of cyber security tasks. However, a common hurdle faced by researchers involves gaining access to cyber security professionals for data collection activities, whether controlled experiments or semi-naturalistic observations. An often readily available and potentially valuable source of data may be found in the records generated through <b>cyber</b> security training <b>exercises.</b> These events frequently entail semi-realistic challenges that may be modeled on real-world occurrences, and occur outside normal operational settings, freeing participants from the sensitivities regarding information disclosure within operational environments.

The results provide insights that go beyond current descriptive accounts of the cognitive processes and demands associated with cyber security job performance, providing quantitative characterizations of the activities undertaken in solving problems within this domain...|$|R
