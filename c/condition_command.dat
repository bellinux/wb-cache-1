40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} design of byte code {{interpreter}} for 8051 microcontroller. We developed a program based on Java language “write once, run everywhere”. It {{can be employed}} to operate with another system since the program interfaces directly to the interpreter, instead of the real system. There are two instruction sets provided in the program. The first is <b>condition</b> <b>commands</b> such as IF and ELSE. The second is the commands for peripheral interfacing such as I 2 C, RS 232 interface, for parallel port, timer and LCD interface. Interpreter is developed with C language, due to its simple structure. It is easy to develop and to modify the code. From the results, <b>condition</b> <b>commands</b> and no <b>condition</b> <b>commands</b> can be execute correctly. Index Terms — Byte code, Interpreter, Byte code. I...|$|R

5000|$|The GB500's {{engine was}} derived from the Honda XL600 engine, a dry-sump {{four-stroke}} dirt bike. The four-valve single cylinder engine featured a radial four-valve combustion chamber, along with a tubular frame, wire-spoked wheels with alloy rims, clip-on handlebars, solo seat, seat hump, and pin-striped fuel tank. The styling resembled TT single-cylinder racing bikes (such as the Manx Norton, the BSA Gold Star and the AJS 7R) that were prominent in the TT until the 1960s. The GB500 was a fine-handling machine: by contrast, its sibling, the XBR500, had a 10mm shorter wheelbase which [...] "made the steering very edgy".

Underlying all these illusions was the unstated assumption that Americans were active and Asians passive and that the outcome of any transaction was determined by what Americans thought and did. This assumption united the missionary enthusiasts of the 19th century, the exponents of the United States as China's political savior and guide to the 20th century, the McCarthyites searching for those who 'lost China,' and the Johnsonian visionaries dreaming of Mekong River Authorities while directing the fighting in Vietnam from computerized and air <b>conditioned</b> <b>command</b> centers." ...|$|R

40|$|Tactical {{operations}} require {{military commanders}} to be mobile {{and have a}} high level of independence in their actions. Communications capabilities providing intelligence and command orders in these tactical situations have been limited to simple voice communications or low-rate narrow bandwidth communications because of the need for immediate reliable connectivity. The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) has brought an improved communications tool to the tactical commander giving the ability to gain access to a global communications system using high data rates and wide bandwidths. The Army has successfully tested this new capability of bandwidth-on-demand and high data rates for commanders in real-world conditions during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti during the fall and winter of 1994.

5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation.

The manufacturing of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under GMP <b>conditions</b> <b>commands</b> to control adequately {{the quality of the}} different ingredients happening in the synthesis. Organic solvents have therefore to be controlled and their purity has to be determined before any GMP synthesis. A selective gas chromatography (GC) method has been developed to determine the purity of acetone, dichloromethane, methanol and toluene. Using this method, the main contaminants of each organic solvent can be quantified. Moreover, the developed method allows the simultaneous determination of ethanol, isopropanol, chloroform, benzene, acetone, dichloromethane, methanol and toluene. Propionitrile was used as the internal standard. The separation was obtained on a CP-SIL 8 -CB low bleed/MS column (60 m x 0. 32 mm, i. d. x 1. 0 mu m coating thickness). The GC method was fully validated using a new approach based on the accuracy profile as a decision tool. The determination of P-expectation tolerance intervals for the estimation of total error - including both bias and precision - is used to better reflect the actual performances of the method, which is definitively the objective of the validation. The different validation criteria such as selectivity, response function, trueness, precision, accuracy, linearity or limits of detection and quantification were considered. The method was found to be able to quantitate with a good accuracy impurities around the 0. 1 % (v/v) concentration level for the different solvents. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The RoboCup Simulation League {{was created}} around the mid- 90 ’s, {{it was the}} first {{competition}} focusing on the new proposed problem for A. I. and Robotics, Soccer. The main tool of the League is the use of the RoboCup soccerserver, that simulates the actions of players in a virtual environment. The server provides an excellent way of working on aspects of soccer that does not require the knowledge of mechanics and/or electronics. Still, to work with the server requires the knowledge of specific things such as how the server works, which variables are available, how can we synchronize with the server, etc. Things that some people might want skip and go directly to the problem of creating teams of players, deal with the strategies and the way players behave in the field. This report describes {{the development and implementation of}} a high level language, based on rules, for the RoboCup soccerserver. The main objective is to provide directives, in the form of <b>conditions</b> and <b>commands,</b> to create players, and ultimately a team, in an easy and fast way without having to know or understand all the specific details found in the simulation server.
