5000|$|In 1996, two espionage scandals broke.

50|$|During the 1933-1934 period, the Defense Ministry created {{three more}} {{intercept}} stations: one Feste was at Hersbruck, (that was later moved to Lauf) {{with the other}} two located at Striegau and Chemnitz. Using the ten intercept stations to intercept foreign military and diplomatic communications, the Defense Ministry created its own military code and cipher section, <b>called</b> <b>Intercept</b> Control Station (HLS) (Horchleitstelle) in 1933/34. To run the control station, the Ministry reassigned several trained cryptanalysts from the Ministry of the Reichswehr Codes and Cipher Section. All Army intercepts were forwarded to the HLS, but other intercept traffic types were forwarded to the Commander-In-Chief aligned agency, e.g. Foreign Air Force traffic was sent to chi-stelle, the Luftwaffe Cipher Bureau. Diplomatic intercepts were sent to both German War Ministry (Reichskriegsministerium) and to Foreign Office civilian cipher bureau AA/Pers Z S.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} notable {{successes of the}} German navy's {{decryption}} services, there were also some results from the other institutions. For example, the Reichspost was able to descramble scrambled voice transmission of the transatlantic telephone connection between the USA and Great Britain. For this purpose, an interception and descrambling facility was built in Noordwijk, in occupied Holland. From 1940, the Mail Service's descrambling specialists intercepted and understood classified telephone conversation between President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The facility relocated to a purpose built bunker facility in Valkenswaard where it remained until August 1944 when the facility had to relocate to Germany, the interception potential decreased, so did the number of phone <b>calls</b> <b>intercepted.</b> This was not classic codebreaking since none was involved; instead it was the exploitation of knowledge about a sophisticated technology.|$|R

5000|$|On October 29, 2010, Inafune {{announced}} on his blog {{that he would}} be leaving Capcom with the intention of [...] "starting his life over". He had been with the company for 23 years. On December 15, 2010, Inafune launched a new company called Comcept, and he launched another new company <b>called</b> <b>Intercept.</b> Comcept is a design and production studio, which does not develop games internally, but rather pairs up with studios to co-develop them. Inafune's guiding philosophy behind Comcept was to work on multiple games at once, work on ideas they themselves created, and to have flexibility of doing multiple genres. Inafune cites the need for flexibility as being neccesary for the company to survive.

40|$|To build survivable {{information}} systems (i. e., systems {{that continue to}} provide their services in spite of coordinated attacks), {{it is necessary to}} detect and isolate intrusions before they impact system performance or functionality. Previous research in this area has focussed primarily on detecting intrusions after the fact, rather than preventing them in the first place. We have developed a new approach based on specifying intended program behaviors using patterns over sequences of system calls. The patterns can also capture conditions on the values of system-call arguments. At runtime, we <b>intercept</b> the system <b>calls</b> made by processes, compare them against specifications, and disallow (or otherwise modify) those calls that deviate from specifications. Since our approach is capable of modifying a system call before it is delivered to the operating system kernel, it is capable of reacting before any damage-causing system call is executed by a process under attack. We present our specification language and illustrate its use by developing a specification for the ftp server. Observe that in our approach, every system <b>call</b> is <b>intercepted</b> and subject to potentially expensive operations for matching against many patterns that specify normal/abnormal behavior. Thus, minimizing the overheads incurred for pattern-matching is critical for the viability of our approach. We solve this problem by developing a new, low-overhead algorithm for matching runtime behaviors against specifications. A salient feature of our algorithm is that its runtime is almost independent of the number of patterns. In most cases, it uses a constant amount of time per system <b>call</b> <b>intercepted,</b> and uses a constant amount of storage, both independent of either the size or number of patterns. These benefits m [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Estimating multivariate {{location}} and scatter with both affine equivariance and po-sitive breakdown {{has always been}} difficult. A well-known estimator which satisfies both properties is the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid Estimator (MVE). Computing the exact MVE is often not feasible, so one usually resorts to an approximate algorithm. In the regression setup, algorithms for positive-breakdown estimators like Least Median of Squares typically recompute the intercept at each step, to improve the result. This approach is <b>called</b> <b>intercept</b> adjustment. In this paper we show that a similar technique, called location adjustment, {{can be applied to}} the MVE. For this purpose we use the Minimum Volume Ball (MVB), in order to lower the MVE objective function. An exact algorithm for calculating the MVB is presented. As an alternative to MVB location adjustment we propose L 1 location adjustment, which does not necessarily lower the MVE objective function but yields more efficient estimates for the location part. Simulations compare the two types of location adjustment. We also obtain the maxbias curve of both L 1 and the MVB in the multivariate setting, revealing the superiority of L 1...|$|R
