[...] He later campaigned {{to become a}} school trustee for North York's first ward in the 1985 and 1988 {{municipal}} elections, losing to Sheila Lambrinos both times. He was sixty years old in the 1988 campaign, and spoke out against selling schools to balance the board's budget. [...] In 1989, when serving {{as president of the}} Oakdale Acres Ratepayers Association, Wray opposed a school tax increase and argued that the board was not spending money productively. [...] He later called for election signs to be banned to reduce pollution.|$|E
50|$|A cost {{estimate}} is the approximation {{of the cost}} of a program, project, or operation. The {{cost estimate}} is the product of the cost estimating process. The cost estimate has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a cost overrun can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate cost estimate. A cost estimator is the professional who prepares cost estimates. There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as building estimator, or electrical estimator, or <b>chief</b> <b>estimator.</b> Other professional titles may also prepare cost estimates or contribute to cost estimates, such as quantity surveyors, cost engineers, etc. In the US, there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010. There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors working in the UK.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes the results of research analysing the sub-contractor's risk elements in refurbishment projects. One of the main characteristics of refurbishment projects is that work is usually in small packages and scattered throughout the building making it unprofitable for one contractor to undertake. It is argued that the selection and appointment of the most suitable sub-contractors {{is very important in}} refurbishment projects as all other control measures have little effect once a totally unsuitable subcontractor has been appointed. The research methodology involved the extensive collaboration of a retired <b>chief</b> <b>estimator</b> with over thirty years experience in one of Britain's biggest construction firms with extensive knowledge in the management of sub-contractors and several other refurbishment contractors' senior management staff who were involved in choosing subcontractors for their contracts. Knowledge acquisition and representation and the evaluation of expert system shells are extensively reviewed. One of the important features of knowledge based systems is its ability to handle uncertain knowledge. Fuzzy set theory is shown to have certain advantages over other methods of dealing with uncertainty and has been employed in developing this knowledge based system. The research began with an evaluation of sub-contractors' selection and appointment as it is currently performed by refurbishment contractors. This exercise consisted {{of a wide range of}} criteria of which information is both qualitative and subjective in an unstructured intuitive manner with considerable reliance on the judgement of the evaluee. Thus, the research focused on a more formalised approach to the subcontractor's appointment. An adaptation of the Repertory Grid knowledge elicitation technique and subsequent grid analysis provides a methodology for organising logically related propositions into a hierarchical structure. A prototype knowledge based decision support system SSARC, for the selection and appointment of the most suitable sub-contractors for refurbishment projects, has been developed. This system represents a contribution in this area of research into refurbishment contracts which has been largely neglected to date...|$|E
