5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs</b> that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} short, stiff, <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs</b> of the pig {{are called}} bristles, and were once so {{commonly used in}} paintbrushes that in 1946 the Australian Government launched Operation Pig Bristle. In May 1946, {{in response to a}} shortage of pig bristles for paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 short tons of pig bristles from China, their only commercially available source at the time.|$|E
25|$|It has {{a highly}} {{variable}} habit, {{ranging from a}} very low, almost prostrate lignotuberous shrub in B.fraseri var. crebra and B.fraseri var. effusa, to an upright non-lignotuberous shrub up to six metre high in B.fraseri var. oxycedra. Young stems are covered in a mat of <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs,</b> but these are lost as the stems age. The leaves are from five to ten centimetres long, and eight to 40 millimetres wide; pinnatisect, with 4 to 18 narrow lobes on each side; on a petiole up to three centimetres long.|$|E

The odor and taste of the fruit bodies is indistinct.|$|E
500|$|Crinipellis zonata, {{commonly}} known as the zoned Crinipellis or the zoned-cap Collybia, is a species of gilled mushroom in the Marasmiaceae family. Though considered a little brown mushroom of unknown edibility, it is distinctive because of its thick covering of <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs,</b> and differentiated from other members of Crinipellis by its slightly larger cap size, which reaches up to [...] in diameter. The white gills {{on the underside of the}} cap are crowded closely together, and are free from attachment to the stem. Saprobic, it grows on the dead wood of deciduous trees from late summer to autumn. The fungus is found commonly in eastern North America, but has also been collected in Portugal and Korea. The variety C.zonata var. cremoricolor, found in eastern North America, may be distinguished microscopically by its longer spores.|$|E
500|$|The head is {{somewhat}} large {{in proportion to}} the body, with small ears, and has a unique feature called a [...] "toad eye" [...] caused by extra fleshiness of the eyelids, which helps to deflect water and provide extra insulation. As with most cold-weather pony breeds, the Exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly underlayer and a topcoat of longer, oily hairs that prevent the undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water down the sides of the animal to fall from just a few drip areas. The mane and tail are thick and long, and the dock of the tail is of a type common in cold-weather ponies, having <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs,</b> called a [...] "frost cap," [...] "snow chute," [...] or [...] "ice tail" [...] that deflects rainwater away from the groin and underbelly areas to fall from the long hairs {{on the back of the}} hind legs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The coat {{characteristic}} of yak mainta-ined in {{conditions of the}} Gdańsk zoological gar-den. The investigation concerned the analysis of chosen coat features of yak maintained in totally different environment than they naturally exists. The study {{has been carried out}} on all adult yak in-dividuals (4 females and 4 males) kept in Gdańsk zoological garden The coat samples have been ta-ken in autumn form middle of the left side of ani-mal to determine the proportion of hair fractions, length and fi bre thickness within fraction, fi bre surface features and cross section. The fractions were separated based on the length of the fi bre wi-thin sample. Proportion of fraction was calculated from the fi bre number within it. Fibre diameter of each fraction has been measured using micropro-jection method. The fraction length was determi-nated measuring fi bre bunches with accuracy to 0. 5 cm. The scales on the fi bre surface as well as shape of cross-section were observed using scan-ning microscope. Two fi bre fractions were deter-minated: <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> (25 %) and mid-type fi bres (75 %). The down fi bres has not been found. The diameter of <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> and mid-type fraction ave-raged out 58. 21 μm and 36. 52 μm respectively. The <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> thickness in males was greater than in females (P < 0. 01). Fibres belonging to mid-type fraction were characterized by clear sca-les and more regular, circular shape. In <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> disappearance of scales, medullation and eliptical cross section has been recorded. The <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> fraction was much longer than mid-type fi bres (P ≤ 0. 01). There was not statistical difference in fraction length depending on sex of animals...|$|R

500|$|The {{mushroom}} flesh {{can range}} from pale {{to the color of}} red wine (vinaceous), and has no distinctive odor. It oozes a red latex when cut. The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem, meaning they are more or less directly attached to it. They are initially whitish or [...] "grayish vinaceous" [...] in color, and can develop reddish-brown stains. Between 20 and 30 gills reach from the cap edge to the stem, resulting in a gill spacing that is described as [...] "close to subdistant"—gaps are visible between adjacent gills. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend directly from the margin to the stem; these are arranged in two or three series (tiers) of equal length. The stem is up to [...] tall and [...] thick, hollow and brittle, and a dark reddish-brown color. In young fruit bodies, {{the upper part of the}} stem is densely covered with a pale cinnamon-colored powder which wears off with age. The stem has a mass of <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs</b> at the base. Like the cap, the stem also bleeds a red latex when it is cut or broken.|$|E
500|$|The coat {{consisted}} of an outer layer of long, coarse [...] "guard hair", which was [...] {{on the upper}} part of the body, up to [...] in length on the flanks and underside, and [...] in diameter, and a denser inner layer of shorter, slightly curly under-wool, up to [...] long and [...] in diameter. The hairs on the upper leg were up to [...] long, and those of the feet were [...] long, reaching the toes. The hairs on the head were relatively short, but longer on the underside and the sides of the trunk. The tail was extended by <b>coarse</b> <b>hairs</b> up to [...] long, which were thicker than the guard hairs. It is likely that the woolly mammoth moulted seasonally, and that the heaviest fur was shed during spring. Since mammoth carcasses were more likely to be preserved during autumn, it is possible that only the winter coat has been preserved in frozen specimens. Modern elephants have much less hair, though juveniles have a more extensive covering of hair than adults. Comparison between the over-hairs of woolly mammoths and extant elephants show that they did not differ much in overall morphology. Woolly mammoths had numerous sebaceous glands in their skin, which secreted oils into their hair; this would have improved the wool's insulation, repelled water, and given the fur a glossy sheen.|$|E

50|$|In some regions, {{the mixed}} mass of down and <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> is removed by {{hand with a}} coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The {{collected}} fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, <b>coarse</b> guard <b>hair</b> is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, interfacings and other non-apparel uses. Animals in Iran, Afghanistan, New Zealand, and Australia are typically shorn of their fleece, resulting in a higher <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, {{it is possible to}} comb the fibers out in about a week.|$|R
