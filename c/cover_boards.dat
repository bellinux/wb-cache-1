500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the <b>cover</b> <b>boards.</b> Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of the cords or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{conducted}} before 1950 on sharp-tailed grouse habitat {{assessment was}} done visually. Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting {{due to lack}} of adequate cover. Habitat generalizations were formed {{based on the number of}} individuals found at a given local. These assumptions were if more birds were present at one location and less at another, then the first must be the better habitat. Hamerstrom (1963) observed 119 of 207 (57%) grouse broods frequenting savannah style habitat. He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. As the research on habitat for grouse species matured, so did the techniques used for assessment. <b>Cover</b> <b>boards</b> and Robel poles were developed to measure visual obstruction (VO) and create habitat indices. <b>Cover</b> <b>boards</b> were developed as early as 1938 by Wight (1938) to study white-tailed deer habitat. Wight’s (1938) cover board was 6 feet in height, marked and numbered every foot. Visible marks were counted to measure obstruction by plants. Kobriger (1965) developed a 4×4-foot board marked at 3-inch intervals with alternating white and black squares. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. He then placed the cover board 30 feet away taking photographs of the cover board. After compiling all the photographs, they were analyzed with a hand lens to assess the number of squares visible. This number gave him a vegetation index of cover classes. This method has been modified by Limb et al. (2007). Instead of taking photographs 30 feet away like Kobriger (1965), Limb et al. (2007) took photographs of vegetation back-dropped by a 1×1-meter cover board at a height of 1 meter, 4 meters away. These digital photographs were uploaded to Adobe Acrobat and digitized to the 1×1-meter backdrop (Limb et al. 2007). Robel et al. (1970) developed a pole to determine height based on correlated vegetation weight. The pole was duly named the Robel pole. Robel et al. (1970) found that VO measurements taken at a height of 1 m and a distance of 4 m from the pole gave a reliable index of the amount of vegetation production at a location. Hamerstrom et al. (1957) were quoted as saying [...] "Height and density of grass were clearly more important to the prairie chickens than species composition" [...] as reported by Robel et al. (1970). This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds cover board, and Limb et al. digital photography method effectively and efficiently.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{apparent}} {{that the effects of}} habitat fragmentation across all habitat types selected by sharp-tailed grouse are impacting this species. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to more hands on approach. The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The development of the Robel pole and <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density. The Robel pole has become the more favored of the two methods in recent years for habitat assessment. The United States forest Service (USFS) uses visual obstruction readings (VOR) to set stocking densities for cattle based on the current years standing residual vegetation [...] This method is currently conducted on the USFS Little Missouri Grasslands, Sheyenne National Grasslands, Cedar River National Grassland, and Grand River National Grassland, all found in the Dakota Prairie National Grasslands in North and South Dakota(Forest Service, Northern Region (USDA).2001) [...]The Robel pole is a non-destructive method for inventorying vegetative biomass (Robel 1970; Benkobi et al. 2000). This method was used to create a habitat suitability index based on vegetation visual obstruction (VO), ranging from 0-30.5 cm with a suitability index rating of 0-1.0 (Prose 1987). Studies of nesting habitat by Prose et al. (2002) in the Nebraska Sandhills found that nesting sharp-tailed grouse selected nest sites with visual obstruction readings (VOR) of more than 4 cm. Similarly, Clawson and Rottella (1998) observed that 58% of nests (432 of 741) in Southwestern Montana were located in sites with an average VOR of 24 cm. The other nests in this study were located in sites with VOR’s of 11-18 cm. Reece et al. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined. The use of the Robel pole to assess habitat for sharp-tailed grouse has given managers a target height of vegetation structure to have {{at the end of the}} grazing season. This allows managers to set the appropriate stocking rate to best attain a desired vegetation height. As a rule of thumb, the average VOR reading for suitable grouse nesting habitat is 3.5in (8.89 cm). Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of tree encroachment (Manzer and Hannon 2005).|$|E

40|$|Arboreal {{reptiles}} {{are often}} difficult to capture because of their cryptic nature and propensity to flee out of reach when approached. In addition, arboreal lizards often seek refuge under loose or peeling tree bark; therefore researchers often remove it to catch them, thereby potentially damaging habitat. Using arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards,</b> or "artificial bark," might reduce damage to natural shelter sites, allowing repeated surveys. We compared capture success and population structure of samples obtained by two capture methods-active searches (visual encounter surveys [VES]) and arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> used as artificial bark-on two species of arboreal lizards, Inland Snake-eyed Skinks (Cryptoblepharus australis) and Dubious Dtellas (Gehyra dubia). Two types of arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> (cardboard and closed-cell foam) were strapped around the main trunks of trees with elastic straps. Systematic VES during the day (for Cryptoblepharus) and at night (for Gehyra) were conducted in conjunction with monitoring of arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards.</b> Diurnal VES for Cryptoblepharus had low capture success (17. 1 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> (49. 6 %). Nocturnal spotlight surveys for Gehyra resulted in {{a high number of}} observations, but low capture success (44. 9 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> (83. 5 %). There was no difference in the capture success between cover board materials. Using arboreal <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> as artificial bark increased hand captures of arboreal lizards, and preserved natural bark shelters that would have otherwise been destroyed by peeling bark during visual encounter surveys...|$|E
40|$|Herpetologists and {{conservation}} biologists frequently use convenient and cost-effective, but less accurate, abundance indices (e. g., {{number of individuals}} collected under artificial <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> or during natural objects surveys) in lieu of more accurate, but costly and destructive, population size estimators to detect and monitor size, state, and trends of amphibian populations. Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, reliable use of abundance indices requires that they be calibrated with accurate population estimators. Such calibrations, however, are rare. The red back salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is an ecologically useful indicator species of forest dynamics, and accurate calibration of indices of salamander abundance could increase the reliability of abundance indices used in monitoring programs. We calibrated abundance indices derived from surveys of P. cinereus under artificial <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> or natural objects with a more accurate estimator of their population size in a New England forest. Average densities/m 2 and capture probabilities of P. cinereus under natural objects or <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> in independent, replicate sites at the Harvard Forest (Petersham, Massachusetts, USA) were similar in stands dominated by Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) and deciduous hardwood species (predominantly Quercus rubra [red oak] and Acer rubrum [red maple]). The abundance index based on salamanders surveyed under natural objects {{was significantly associated with}} density estimates of P. cinereus derived from depletion (removal) surveys, but underestimated true density by 50 %. In contrast, the abundance index based on cover-board surveys overestimated true density by a factor of 8 and the association between the cover-board index and the density estimates was not statistically significant. We conclude that when calibrated and used appropriately, some abundance indices may provide cost-effective and reliable measures of P. cinereus abundance {{that could be used in}} conservation assessments and long-term monitoring at Harvard Forest and other northeastern USA forests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —We {{investigated}} habitat use {{and movements}} of the wandering salamander, Aneides vagrans, in an old-growth forestcanopy. We conducted a mark-recapture study of salamanders in the crowns of five large redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) inPrairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California. This represented a first attempt to document the residency and behavior ofA. vagrans in a canopy environment. We placed litter bags on 65 fern (Polypodium scouleri) mats, covering 10 % of their totalsurface area in each tree. Also, we set <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> on one fern mat in each of two trees. We checked cover objects 2 – 4 timesper month during fall and winter seasons. We marked 40 individuals with elastomer tags and recaptured 13. Only onerecaptured salamander moved (vertically 7 m) from its original point of capture. We compared habitats associated withsalamander captures using correlation analysis and stepwise regression. At the tree-level, {{the best predictor of}} salamanderabundance was water storage by fern mats. At the fern mat-level, the presence of <b>cover</b> <b>boards</b> accounted for 85 % of thevariability observed in captures. Population estimates indicated that individual trees had up to 29 salamanders. Large fernmats have high water-holding capacities, which likely enable year-round occupation of the canopy by A. vagrans. Otherobservations indicate that A. vagrans and its close relative A. ferreus also occupy additional habitats in forest canopies,especially moist cavities inside decaying wood...|$|E
