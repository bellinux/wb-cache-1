40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{complementarity}} between two kin categories, i. e. laiul mwal (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> men) and laiul shoabut (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> women), {{found in the}} formation of land-holding groups in Falalap, Woleai Atoll, Central Caroline Islands. The fundamental units in Falalap social structure are matrilineal clans (gailang) and matrilineages or uxorilocal extended families. However, according to Falalap people, one does not belong exclusively to mother's group, but to both mother's and father's groups. Two categories are recognized among the members of a matrilineal clan. The <b>children</b> <b>of</b> male members are called laiul mwal (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> men) and the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> female members are called laiul shoabut (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> women). These two categories show oppositions in the complementary contexts of respect-avoidance behaviors and the formation of land-holding groups. Strict respect-avoidance behaviors are stipulated between brothers and sisters. In this context, the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men are superior to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women. On the other hand, {{in the formation of}} land-holding groups, the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women are superior to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men. A segment is formed only when certain members within a lineage receives land from their father's lineage. When the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men received certain land from their father's group, they had certain obligations towards their father's group before World War II. When the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men could not meet these obligations, the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women could chase the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men out. This relation between the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women and the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men is in sharp contrast with the cross-sibling relationship in the respect-avoidance behaviors, so {{that it is possible to}} say the cross-sibling relation in Falalap, Woleai shows complementarity across the contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the psychological effect of working mothers upon children living in joint and nuclear family structures of Pakistan. After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that (1) <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure will have more psychological problems as compared to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure. (2) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure. (3) <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non-working mothers in joint family structure. (4) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non- working mothers in joint family structure. (5) <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non-working mothers in nuclear family structure. (6) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure as compared to the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non- working mothers in nuclear family structure. On hypothesis 1, 3 and 5 the difference will be evident on the variables of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problems, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment Sample of the present research consisted <b>of</b> 256 Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> the working and non working mothers, including 64 <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female), and 64 <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female). Their age range was from 12 years to 18 years. Subjects were interviewed & then SPM, WRAT-R & RASSI were administered according to standard procedure test was calculated {{in order to determine the}} difference of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problem, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment between the Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and non working mothers in joint family structure and Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and non working mothers in nuclear family structure. Pearson Product Moment Coefficient Correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between the intellectual capacity and academic achievement <b>of</b> Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and non working mothers in joint family structure and Adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and non working mothers in nuclear family structure. Further z-test was calculated to determine the significant difference between correlations of above mentioned groups. The results showed significant differences between adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> employed mothers of two family structures (Joint and nuclear) on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems, Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment. There was a significant difference on the variables of Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment and insignificant differences on other two variables i. e. of Antisocial behavior and Anger control problems, between adolescents <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and Non-working mothers in joint family structures. There was also significant differences on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems and Adjustment and insignificant differences on the variables of, Emotional distress and Positive self between adolescent <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working and Non- working mothers in nuclear family structures. Further the correlation of intellectual capacity and academic achievement was more positive (i) for <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure as compared to <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure. (ii) for <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in joint family structure as compared to <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non working mothers in joint family structure and (iii) for <b>children</b> <b>of</b> working mothers in nuclear family structure as compared to <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non working mothers in nuclear family structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} adult <b>children</b> <b>of</b> alcoholics and neurotic perfectionism. Neurotic perfectionism was determined by examining five different areas of the Almost Perfect Scale- Revised which are Standards and Order, Discrepancy, Relationships, Procrastination, and Anxiety. One hundred and nineteen students enrolled in the general psychology course at the university chosen participated in this study. Of the total participants, nineteen were identified as adult <b>children</b> <b>of</b> alcoholics by their scores on the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST). Adult <b>children</b> <b>of</b> alcoholics were identified as those individuals scoring a 6 orii higher on the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST). Participants were administered the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST), the Almost Perfect Scale – Revised (APS-R), and a Demographic Questionnaire. Based on the results of the study, adult <b>children</b> <b>of</b> alcoholics tend to have higher perfectionism levels on the Discrepancy scale than adult <b>children</b> <b>of</b> non-alcoholics.
