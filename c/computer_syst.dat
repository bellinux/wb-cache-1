40|$|The {{notion of}} {{dynamical}} consistency [3] is extended to hybrid systems {{so as to}} define the set of dynamically consistent hybrid partition machines associated with a continuous system S. After the presentation of some basic results on the algebraic structure of discrete partition machines, dynamical consistency is defined for hybrid systems, and the lattice HIBC(S) of hybrid in-block controllable partition machines is investigated. A sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} a non-trivial HIBC(S) is presented. 1 Introduction An important class of hybrid systems is that characterised by a continuous system in a feedback configuration with a discrete controller, see, for instance, [1], [2], [9], [10], [11]. These works present decompositions of the state spaces of continuous systems with the ultimate objective being the effective design of discrete controllers. If successful, the advantage of such an approach would evidently be the enhanced realizability of controllers by <b>computer</b> <b>syst</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first {{results of an}} {{investigation}} into solutions to problems of security in computer systems; it establishes the basis for rigorous investigation by providing a general descriptive model of a computer system. Borrowing basic concepts and constructs from general systems theory, we present a basic result concerning security in computer systems, using precise notions of "security" and "compromise". We also demonstrate how a change in requirements can {{be reflected in the}} resulting mathematical model. A lengthy introductory section is included in order {{to bridge the gap between}} general systems theory and practical problem solving. ii PREFACE General systems theory is a relatively new and rapidly growing mathematical discipline which shows great promise for application in the computer sciences. The discipline includes both "general systems-theory" and "general-systems-theory": that is, one may properly read the phrase "general systems theory" in both ways. In this paper, we have borrowed from the works of general systems theorists, principally from the basic work of Mesarovic, to formulate a mathematical framework within which to deal with the problems of secure computer systems. At the present time we feel that the mathematical representation developed herein is adequate to deal with most if not all of the security problems one may wish to pose. In Section III we have given a result which deals with the most trivial of the secure computer systems one might find viable in actual use. In the concluding section we review the application of our mathematical methodology and suggest major areas of concern in the design of a secure system. The results reported in this paper lay the groundwork for further, more specific investigation into secure <b>computer</b> <b>syst</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} lifting voltage digraphs {{provides}} {{a useful tool for}} constructing large digraphs with given properties from suitable small base digraphs endowed with an assignment of voltages (=elements of a finite group) on arcs. We revisit the degree/diameter problem for digraphs from this new perspective and prove a general upper bound on diameter of a lifted digraph in terms of properties of the base digraph and voltage assignment. In addition, we show that all currently known largest vertex-transitive Cayley digraphs for semidirect products of groups can be described by means of a voltage assignment construction using simpler groups. This research was done while J. Plesn'ik and J. Sir'an were visiting the Department of Computer Science of the University of Newcastle NSW Australia, supported by small ARC grant. 1 Introduction One fruitful application of graph theory to communication problems is in the design of interconnection networks, such as parallel <b>computers,</b> switching <b>syst</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|MPEG- 4 {{addresses}} coding {{of digital}} hybrids {{of natural and}} synthetic, Aural and Visual (A/V) information. The objective of this Synthetic/Natural Hybrid Coding (SNHC) is to facilitate content-based manipulation, interoperability, and wider user access {{in the delivery of}} animated mixed media. SNHC will support non-real-time and passive media delivery, as well as more interactive, real-time applications. Integrated spatial-temporal coding is sought for audio, video, and 2 D/ 3 D computer graphics as standardized A/V objects. Targets of standardization include mesh-segmented video coding, compression of geometry, synchronization between A/V objects, multiplexing of streamed A/V objects, and spatialtemporal integration of mixed media types. Composition, interactivity, and scripting of A/V objects can thus be supported in client terminals, as well as in content production for servers, also more effectively enabling terminals as servers. Such A/V objects can exhibit high efficiency in transmission and storage, plus content-based interactivity, spatial-temporal scalability, and combinations of transient dynamic data and persistent downloaded data. This approach can lower bandwidth of mixed media, offer tradeoffs in quality vs. update for specific terminals, and foster varied distribution methods for content that exploit spatial and temporal coherence over busses and networks.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of creep forces {{is a complex}} task and their calculation is a time-consuming process for multibody simulation (MBS). A methodology of creep forces modelling at large traction creepages has been proposed by Polach [Creep forces in simulations of traction vehicles running on adhesion limit. Wear. 2005; 258 : 992 – 1000; Influence of locomotive tractive effort on the forces between wheel and rail. Veh Syst Dyn. 2001 (Suppl); 35 : 7 – 22] adapting his previously published algorithm [Polach O. A fast wheel–rail forces calculation <b>computer</b> code. Veh <b>Syst</b> Dyn. 1999 (Suppl); 33 : 728 – 739]. The most common method for creep force modelling used by software packages for MBS of running dynamics is the Fastsim algorithm by Kalker [A fast algorithm for the simplified theory of rolling contact. Veh Syst Dyn. 1982; 11 : 1 – 13]. However, the Fastsim code has some limitations which do not allow modelling the creep force – creep characteristic in agreement with measurements for locomotives and other highpower traction vehicles, mainly for large traction creep at low-adhesion conditions. This paper describes a newly developed methodology based on a variable contact flexibility increasing with {{the ratio of the}} slip area to the area of adhesion. This variable contact flexibility is introduced in a modification of Kalker’s code Fastsim by replacing the constant Kalker’s reduction factor, widely used in MBS, by a variable reduction factor together with a slip-velocity-dependent friction coefficient decreasing with increasing global creepage. The proposed methodology is presented in this work and compared with measurements for different locomotives. The modification allows use of the well recognised Fastsim code for simulation of creep forces at large creepages in agreement with measurements without modifying the proven modelling methodology at small creepages...|$|R
