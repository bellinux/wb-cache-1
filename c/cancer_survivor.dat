40|$|Introduction: <b>Cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> may {{experience}} long-term depression or anxiety, however, {{there is little}} previous research {{on the use of}} services in this area. We explored consultation and prescribing behaviour for depression and anxiety amongst <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> in British primary health care. Methods: This study uses data on 26, 213 survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer at least 5 years post-diagnosis, matched to four controls without cancer, from the UK General Practice Research Database. We compared consultations for depression and anxiety, and prescribing for anti-depressants and anxiolytics between <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and controls. Results: Multivariate, matched regression models showed no difference in consulting for depression or anxiety between any <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and matched controls. However, breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 10 - 1. 22) and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> (OR 1. 31, 95 % CI 1. 16 - 1. 47) were more likely to receive a prescription for an antidepressant. Breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> (IRR 2. 49, 95 % CI 1. 82 - 3. 42) and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> (IRR 2. 84, 95 % CI 1. 94 - 4. 17) who died received significantly more antidepressants than controls who died. There were no differences in anxiolytic prescribing for colorectal and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> compared to controls. However, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> nearing the end of life received a greater number of anxiolytic prescriptions compared to controls (IRR 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 36 - 2. 49). Conclusions: In this cohort of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> there were no differences in consultation behaviour for depression and anxiety compared to controls. However, breast and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> access more antidepressants, and those nearing the end of life received the highest volume of prescriptions. Breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> {{at the end of life}} also receive more anxiolytics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|More than 10 million <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> are {{now living}} in the United States. Using the QOL-CS, a measure of {{quality of life of}} <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> the current study {{considered}} quality of life differences in 115 <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> based upon three cancer types (breast, prostate, and colon cancers) and number of types of cancer treatments received. It was hypothesized that differences in HRQOL would be found between the cancer type and number of treatment types received. Results were mixed. MANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant differences based upon cancer type. Breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> had significantly higher scores than prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> on social well-being, and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> demonstrated significantly higher scores on psychological well-being than breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> No differences in HRQOL were found between the two groups based upon the number of treatment types received.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this {{meta-analysis}} {{was to examine the}} efficacy of exercise to reduce depressive symptoms among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> In addition, we examined the extent to which exercise dose and clinical characteristics of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> influence the relationship between exercise and reductions in depressive symptoms. Methods We conducted a systematic search identifying randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions among adult <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> examining depressive symptoms as an outcome. We calculated effect sizes for each study and performed weighted multiple regression moderator analysis. Results We identified 40 exercise interventions including 2, 929 <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> Diverse groups of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> were examined in seven exercise interventions; breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> were examined in 26; prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were examined in two; and colorectal cancer in one. <b>Cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> who completed an exercise intervention reduced depression more than controls, d+=− 0. 13 (95 % CI: − 0. 26, − 0. 01). Increases in weekly volume of aerobic exercise reduced depressive symptoms in dose-response fashion (β=− 0. 24, p= 0. 03), a pattern evident only in higher quality trials. Exercise reduced depressive symptoms most when exercise sessions were supervised (β=− 0. 26, p= 0. 01) and when <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> were between 47 – 62 yr (β= 0. 27, p= 0. 01). Conclusion Exercise training provides a small overall reduction in depressive symptoms among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> but one that increased in dose-response fashion with weekly volume of aerobic exercise in high quality trials. Depressive symptoms were reduced to the greatest degree among breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> aged between 47 – 62 yr, or when exercise sessions were supervised...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> {{steadily}} increases. The long‐term planning of {{care in the}} survivorship phase necessitates a different approach than the short‐term planning in the treatment phase. Principles of disease management programs could provide an interesting perspective to improve care for <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> It would therefore be interesting to know in which aspects <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> resemble patients with a chronic disease and in which aspects they differ. Research question: Is health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health care use in <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> {{similar to that of}} patients with a chronic disease? Methods: 1) Patients diagnosed above age 18 with a cancer type with a 5 ‐year survival rate > 20 % and no distant metastases at diagnosis and 2) patients above age 18 with a physician diagnosed somatic chronic disease were sent a questionnaire. HRQoL was measured with the SF‐ 36. Self‐reported health care use was measured for GP care, specialist care, rehabilitative care, physical therapy, ambulatory mental health care and occupational health care. Results: We included 601 <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and 1052 patients with a chronic disease without cancer. 63 % of the <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and 61 % of the patients with a chronic disease were multimorbid. HRQoL of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> was significantly better than that of patients with a chronic disease, also after correction for age and sex. For the subscale ‘mental functioning’ we found no significant differences. <b>Cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> were less likely to visit a GP or cardiologist than patients with a chronic disease. Conclusion: Considering their HRQoL and health care use, <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> differ from patients with chronic disease. For <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> without a chronic condition, who are generally in good physical health, a comprehensive disease management approach may not be necessary. However, many <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> do have chronic diseases besides cancer and may benefit from patient‐centred proactive multidisciplinary care...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that there are approximately 12 million <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> in the United States. Continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis is linked to adverse effects among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> on overall survival, treatment effectiveness, and quality of life. Little is known about who is more likely to quit smoking after his/her cancer diagnosis. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate factors associated with smoking cessation in <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> which to date has not been well studied. Method The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 – 2008 surveys were used in this study. A total of 2, 374 <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> aged 20 and over with valid smoking status in the NHANES 99 – 08 survey were included in this study. Among them, 566 <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> who regularly smoked at the time of their cancer diagnosis were included in the analyses. Results Around 50. 6 % of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> smoked regularly prior to their cancer diagnosis and only 36. 1 % of them quit smoking after their cancer diagnosis. Racial disparity was observed in smoking cessation among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> Hispanics (OR[*]=[*] 0. 23, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 10 - 0. 57) were less likely to quit smoking than Whites after their cancer diagnosis. Conclusion Two-thirds of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> continued smoking after cancer diagnosis. Our study observed that the high risk group of continued smokers among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> is made up of those who are female, younger, Hispanic, with longer smoking history, underweight or with normal weight and without smoking-related cancer. These findings suggest that smoking cessation for <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> should target on the high risk subgroups. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{intersect}} {{among three}} factors: aging, cancer, and co-morbid conditions represent {{characteristics of a}} growing population of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> having unique survivorship needs that may place them at {{a higher risk of}} vulnerability, economic changes, and decline in social support after treatment ends. The implications and need for future research into {{the quality of life of}} older breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> are broad as the population continues to age and people live longer after diagnosis. The complexity of needs experienced by aging breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> need to be addressed. Because of the multifaceted nature of health in <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> follow-up and survivorship care for older breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> would ideally include comorbid disease, social support, and adverse changes in economic lifestyle.|$|R

Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 62. 7 % of <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and 67. 1 % of controls. Among <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors,</b> vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent among 19 - 44 year olds (76. 2 %) and among managers, professionals, and related workers (79. 3 %). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that younger <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and those who work indoors were predisposed to vitamin D deficiency.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-term <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> in the United Kingdom {{are mostly}} {{followed}} up {{in a primary}} care setting by their general practitioner; however, there is little research {{on the use of}} services. This study examines whether <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> receive adequate screening and preventative care in UK primary care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified a cohort of long-term survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer with at least a 5 -year survival using the General Practice Research Database, with controls matched for age, gender and practice. We compared adherence with cancer screening and the use of preventative care between <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> and controls. RESULTS: The cancer survivors' cohort consisted of 18 612 breast, 5764 colorectal and 4868 prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors.</b> Most <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> receive <b>cancer</b> screening at the same levels as controls, except for breast <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> who were less likely to receive a mammogram than controls (OR= 0. 78, 95 % CI: 0. 66 - 0. 92). Long-term <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> received comparable levels of influenza vaccinations and cholesterol tests, but breast (OR 0. 81, 95 % CI: 0. 74 - 0. 87) and prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>survivors</b> (OR= 0. 70, 95 % CI: 0. 57 - 0. 87) were less likely to receive a blood pressure test.
