5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as <b>clorazepate</b> dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E

Other classical benzodiazepines include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, bromazepam and flurazepam. <b>Clorazepate</b> is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. <b>Clorazepate</b> {{produces the}} active metabolite desmethyl-diazepam, {{which is a}} partial agonist of the GABAA receptor and has a half life of 20 - 179 hours; {{a small amount of}} desmethyldiazepam is further metabolised into oxazepam. <b>Clorazepate</b> exerts its pharmacological properties via increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel of GABAA receptors. This effect of benzodiazepines requires the presence of the neurotransmitter GABA and results in enhanced inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA acting on GABAA receptors. <b>Clorazepate,</b> like other benzodiazepines, is widely distributed and is highly bound to plasma proteins; <b>clorazepate</b> also crosses readily over the placenta and into breast milk. Peak plasma levels of the active metabolite desmethyl-diazepam are seen between 30 minutes and 2 hours after oral administration of <b>clorazepate.</b> <b>Clorazepate</b> is completely metabolised to desmethyl-diazepam in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the pharmacological properties of <b>clorazepate</b> are largely due to desmethyldiazepam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clorazepate</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand names Tranxene and Novo-Clopate), {{also known as}} <b>clorazepate</b> dipotassium, is a benzodiazepine.

50|$|<b>Clorazepate</b> is {{prescribed}} principally in {{the treatment}} of alcohol withdrawal and epilepsy, although it is also a useful anxiolytic because of its long half-life. The normal starting dosage range of <b>Clorazepate</b> is 15 to 60 mg per day. The drug is to be taken two to four times per day. Dosages as high as 90 to 120 mg per day may be used {{in the treatment}} of acute alcohol withdrawal. In the United States and Canada, <b>Clorazepate</b> is available in 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg capsules or tablets. In Europe, tablet formations are 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg. <b>Clorazepate</b> SD (controlled release) is available and may have a reduced incidence of adverse effects. The sustained-release formulation of <b>clorazepate</b> has some advantages in that, if a dose is missed, less profound fluctuations in blood plasma levels occur, which may be helpful to some people with epilepsy at risk of break-through seizures.|$|E

50|$|Delirium {{has been}} noted from {{discontinuation}} from <b>clorazepate</b> A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in approximately one third of patients who take benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which is characterised by a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. When used for seizure control, tolerance may manifest itself with an increased rate of seizures as well {{an increased risk of}} withdrawal seizures. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of <b>clorazepate</b> occurs frequently with regular use. Due to the development of tolerance, benzodiazepines are, in general, not considered appropriate for the long-term management of epilepsy; increasing the dose may result only in the developing of tolerance to the higher dose combined with worsened adverse effects. Cross-tolerance occurs between benzodiazepines, meaning that, if individuals are tolerant to one benzodiazepine, they will display a tolerance to equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include a worsening of pre-existing symptoms as well as the appearance of new symptoms that were not pre-existing. The withdrawal symptoms may range from mild anxiety and insomnia to severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can be difficult in some cases to differentiate between pre-existing symptoms and withdrawal symptoms. Use of high doses, long-term use and abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal increases increase the severity of withdrawal syndrome. However, tolerance to the active metabolite of <b>clorazepate</b> may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines. Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremor, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|E

It is unclear whether cognitive deficits resulting from the long-term use of benzodiazepines return to normal or persist indefinitely after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are also known to cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical effects including excitement and paradoxical worsening of seizures can sometimes result {{from the use of}} benzodiazepines. Children, the elderly, individuals with a history of alcohol abuse or a history of aggressive behavior and anger are at greater risk of developing paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines.|$|E

Buspirone allows fast-acting anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines to be effective at a much lower dose which greatly reduces the physical and mental side-effects of their use, making them feasible options for immediately treating anxiety when full cognitive function is required. Its lack of GABA-ergic activity also makes it a much safer option than traditional anxiolytics when used along with pain and seizure medications, and it is a first-line anxiety treatment for patients with chronic pain complaints.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of trazodone (mean once-daily dose 111. 5 ± 36. 3 mg) versus <b>clorazepate</b> (mean once-daily dose 17. 5 ± 7. 5 mg) to relieve anxious and depressive symptoms in 18 patients undergoing treatment {{for breast cancer}} was investigated in a 28 -day randomized, double-blind study. Efficacy was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. A successful response to treatment was achieved in 91 % (10 / 11) of patients who received trazodone and 57 % (four of seven) of patients who were administered <b>clorazepate</b> (P = 0. 1373). Bayesian analysis revealed that the prior probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than <b>clorazepate</b> reduced from 26 % to 8 %. Assessment of the clinical scales suggested a benefit of trazodone compared with <b>clorazepate,</b> although the differences were not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of an abuse risk and dependence and, therefore, could be a valuable alternative to <b>clorazepate</b> {{in the treatment of}} adjustment disorders in cancer patients.
