40|$|Polyester yarns {{textured}} {{under different}} conditions {{have been tested}} using four different quality control methods: Shirley tube test; H. A. T. R. A. <b>Crimp</b> <b>Rigidity</b> Test, Hot Air retraction and Texturmat. To increase their sensitivity and to achieve reproducible results, certain modifications have been introduced in each of them. As expected, each method gives differen results, but the tendency is the same. This suggests that {{any one of them}} can be employed as a quality control method, providing the «modus operandi» are carried our strictly...|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} formed of alloy panels {{rivetted}} {{on a light}} steel frame. Roof plates were <b>crimped</b> to increase <b>rigidity.</b> The body was suspended from four points on the frame, connected by hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|R
40|$|Polyester {{woven fabric}} was heat set under {{different}} conditions of temperature (180 and 200 °C) and time (30, 45 and 60 seconds) important {{parameters of the}} original scoured fabric and heat set fabrics are determined. From the results obtained, it is deduced that the heat setting procees substantially modifies some of these parameters. In some cases the variations induced are independent of the heat setting conditions, while others (fabric weight, <b>crimp,</b> flexmal <b>rigidity,</b> air permeability, crease recovery, drape breaking strength and abrasion resistence) {{are influenced by the}} temperature. Heat setting time influences to some extent the drape coefficient and abrasion resitance. The heat setting treatment produces advantageous effect on air permeability and resistence to abrasion while a negative effect on flexual rigidity. All the fabrics studied have excellent dimensional stability and this is independent of heat setting variables...|$|R
