[...] The entire rubbing behaviour lasted approximately 10 minutes. European starlings also performed a similar behaviour with mothballs.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>common</b> <b>grackles</b> measure from 28 to 34 cm in length, span 36 - 46 cm {{across the}} wings and weigh 74 - 142 g. <b>Common</b> <b>grackles</b> are less sexually dimorphic than larger grackle species but the {{differences}} between the sexes can still be noticeable. The male, which averages 122 g, is larger than the female, at an average of 94 g. Adults have a long, dark bill, pale yellowish eyes and a long tail; its feathers appear black with purple, green or blue iridescence on the head, and primarily bronze sheen in the body plumage. The adult female, beyond being smaller, is usually less iridescent; her tail in particular is shorter, and unlike the males, does not keel (display a longitudinal ridge) in flight and is brown with no purple or blue gloss. The juvenile is brown with dark brown eyes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, males tip their heads back and fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away.

50|$|The species {{lives in}} open or semi-open country and often travels in flocks, {{sometimes}} mixed with red-winged blackbirds (particularly in spring) and bobolinks (particularly in fall), {{as well as}} <b>common</b> <b>grackles</b> or European starlings.

40|$|We {{constructed}} bioenergetic {{and economic}} models {{to estimate the}} potential impact of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), <b>Common</b> <b>Grackles</b> (Quiscalus quiscula), and Yellow-headed Blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) on production yields of sunflower in the northern Great Plains of North America. The amount of sunflower consumed annually by males and females, after considering field metabolic rates, energy value and moisture content of achenes, and percentage of sunflower in diets was, respectively: Red-winged Blackbirds 277 g and 168 g; <b>Common</b> <b>Grackles</b> 267 g and 230 g; and Yellow-headed Blackbirds 248 g and 139 g. The per capita annual economic damage was: male Red-winged Blackbirds $ 0. 09 (U. S. dollars), females $ 0. 05; male <b>Common</b> <b>Grackles</b> $ 0. 09, females $ 0. 07; and male Yellow-headed Blackbirds $ 0. 08, females $ 0. 05. Annual loss was $ 5. 4 ± 1. 3 X 106 for all three species in aggregate, with Red-winged Blackbirds accounting for 52 % of the loss. Blackbird damage represented 1. 7 % of the dollar value of the 1999 sunflower harvest in the northern Great Plains. This loss would be inconsequential if damage were distributed evenly; however, bird damage is often localized around wetlands and can be economically debilitating to individual producers. Although our model was based on regional population estimates, it should perform well at local scales, provided that a local population can be defined, accurately estimated, and remains stable in size over the six-week length of the damage period. Because of the large numbers of blackbirds that congregate in the region during August and September prior to migration, sunflower producers should expect some crop losses. The solution to the conflict appears to be one that focuses not on eliminating all damage, but on preventing it from exceeding 5 % per field...|$|R

The total number of birds captured in traps with clear mirrors and control traps did not (P = 0. 62) differ.

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} open and semi-open areas across North America east of the Rocky Mountains. The nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs, usually near water; sometimes, the <b>common</b> <b>grackle</b> will nest in cavities or in man-made structures. It often nests in colonies, some being quite large. Bird houses are also a suitable nesting site. There are four to seven eggs.|$|E
50|$|The male is unmistakable {{except in}} the far west of the US, where the tricolored {{blackbird}} occurs. Males of that species have a darker red epaulet edged with white, not yellow. Females of tricolored, bicolored, red-shouldered and red-winged blackbirds {{can be difficult to}} identify in areas where more than one form occurs. In flight, when the field marks are not easily seen, red-winged can be distinguished from less closely related Icterids such as <b>common</b> <b>grackle</b> and brown-headed cowbird by its different silhouette and undulating flight.|$|E
50|$|Deforestation {{leads to}} {{fragmented}} forest habitats and nest predators {{tend to be}} more abundant in these fragmented landscapes. If the fragmented area is long and narrow, it will have greater predation rates because it can easily be reached by nest predators from other areas. Compared to rural woodlots, nest predation rates were higher in suburban areas due higher densities of nest predators such as Blue Jay, <b>Common</b> <b>Grackle,</b> raccoons, dogs, cats and rats. Deforestation thus affects population cycles of birds by changing predator-prey relationships and making the birds more susceptible to predators.|$|E
40|$|Sunflower, due to {{the easy}} {{accessibility}} and high nutritional value of its seed, is particularly vulnerable to damage by birds (Figure 101). Seeds are exposed and the large head serves as a perch during feeding. Sunflower seed is a preferred bird food because the seed contains many proteins and fats essential to their growth, molt, fat storage and weight maintenance processes. Although many species of birds feed in maturing sunflower fields, the greatest losses are caused by migrating flocks of red-winged blackbirds, yellow- headed blackbirds and <b>common</b> <b>grackles</b> (Figure 102).

Common predators at Baltimore oriole nests can include <b>common</b> <b>grackles,</b> American crows, Blue Jays, black-billed magpies, tree squirrels and domestic cats, which most commonly capture newly fledged orioles or adults engaged in brooding behavior. Rapacious birds commonly prey on both young and fully-grown orioles, the most prolific being the eastern screech owl and Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks. Somewhat larger rapacious birds also sometimes opportunistically predate the oriole, including peregrine falcons, great horned owls, and barn owls, while merlins may do so while orioles are migrating.|$|R
