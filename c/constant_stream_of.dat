5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E
5|$|The art of mother-of-pearl carving {{is said to}} {{have been}} a Bethlehem {{tradition}} since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E

5000|$|Siena did not prosper under Roman rule. It was not sited near {{any major}} roads and lacked {{opportunities}} for trade. Its insular status meant that Christianity did not penetrate until the 4th century AD, {{and it was}} not until the Lombards invaded Siena and the surrounding territory that it knew prosperity. [...] After the Lombard occupation, the old Roman roads of Via Aurelia and the Via Cassia passed through areas exposed to Byzantine raids, so the Lombards rerouted much of their trade between the Lombards' northern possessions and Rome along a more secure road through Siena. Siena prospered as a trading post, and the <b>constant</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> pilgrims passing to and from Rome provided a valuable source of income in the centuries to come.|$|R

25|$|Until the 20th century, Dithmarschen {{had been}} a rather secluded spot on the map with little influx from the outside world.

50|$|The {{mangroves}} include tall trees, up to 30m. Compared to Central African mangroves of West Africa mangroves of East Africa have {{a greater}} variety of vegetation with two distinctive types: the mangroves on the coast itself such as the birdwatching site Mida Creek near the Arabuko Sokoke National Park and the town of Watamu, and the Lamu Archipelago both in Kenya, which are fed by <b>constant</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> fresh water; and the mangroves in river inlets where more salt accumulates in the water. East African mangrove species are similar to those found on other coasts around the Indian Ocean. The Bazaruto Archipelago is an example of offshore mangroves sheltered by coral and intermingled with a mixture of shoreline habitats such as grassy sand dunes and rockpools.|$|R
40|$|News {{sources on}} the Web {{generate}} <b>constant</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> information, describing {{many aspects of}} the events that shape our world. In particular, geography {{plays a key role in}} the news, and enabling geographic retrieval of news articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles, which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural language. Toponym recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news articles, but these static collections do not reflect the <b>streaming</b> nature <b>of</b> online news, as evidenced by poor performance in tests. In contrast, a method for toponym recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components, both rule-based and statistical. An evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym recognition systems when tested on large datasets <b>of</b> <b>streaming</b> news, indicating its suitability for this domain...|$|R
30|$|The studies {{covered in}} this section are also on data {{gathered}} from the patient level and again have the intention of answering clinical level questions. Instead of predicting the patient’s condition in the future (i.e. ICU readmission or 5 year survival), the research here will be using data streams in order to predict patient’s conditions in real-time. Data streams are never ending torrents of data that requires continuous analysis giving the possibility for real-time results (a feature not available when using static data sets). This section will sample two different categories of data steam studies: making prognosis and diagnosis predictions for patients, and detecting if a new born is experiencing a cardiorespiratory spell both in a real time.

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} assault, the Ottoman {{defenders}} {{continued to hold}} very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire. A <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from taking aim while the attack continued. Little by little the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands. However, between about 12:15 and 14:15 progress slowed.|$|E

In particular, geography {{plays a key role}} in the news, and understanding the geographic information present in news allows for its useful spatial browsing and retrieval. This process of understanding is called geotagging, and involves first finding in the document all textual references to geographic locations, known as topo-nyms, and second, assigning the correct lat/long values to each toponym, steps which are termed toponym recognition and toponym resolution, respectively. These steps are difficult due to ambiguities in natural language: some toponyms share names with non-location en-tities, and further, a given toponym can have many location interpretations. Removing these ambiguities is crucial for successful geotagging. To this end, geotagging methods are described which were developed for streaming news. First, a spatio-textual search engine named STEWARD, and an interactive map-based news browsing system named NewsStand are described, which feature geotaggers as central components, and served as motivating systems and experimental testbeds for de-veloping geotagging methods. Next, a geotagging methodology is presented that follow...|$|R
