5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> <b>murder,</b> one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991.

5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> <b>murder</b> in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> <b>murder</b> and attempted murder.|$|E
