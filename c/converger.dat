You might not improperly write on his forehead, [...] "Warehouse to let!" [...] He always dealt too much in generalities for a lawyer. He is deficient in power in applying his principles to the points in debate. I remember Robert Smith had much more logical ability; but Smith aimed at conquest by any gladiatorial shift; whereas Mackintosh was uniformly candid in argument.

Kolb transposes four learning styles, Diverger, Assimilator, Accommodator [...] and <b>Converger,</b> atop the Experiential Learning Model, using the four experiential learning stages to carve out [...] "four quadrants", one for each learning style. An individual’s dominant learning style can be identified by taking Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Robert Loo (2002) undertook a meta-analysis of 8 studies which revealed that Kolb’s learning styles were not equally distributed among business majors in the sample. More specifically, results indicated that {{there appears to be}} a high proportion of assimilators and a lower proportion of accommodators than expected for business majors. Not surprisingly, within the accounting sub-sample there was a higher proportion of convergers and a lower proportion of accommodates. Similarly, in the finance sub-sample, a higher proportion of assimilators and lower proportion of divergers was apparent. Within the marketing sub-sample there was an equal distribution of styles. This would provide some evidence to suggest that while it is useful for educators to be aware of common learning styles within business and accounting programs, they should be encouraging students to use all four learning styles appropriately and students should use a wide range of learning methods.|$|E

40|$|One way {{to define}} a Nash {{equilibrium}} is by positing a set of beliefs (or conjectures) for each player over (about) the actions of their opponents that has the property that, given these beliefs, when each player best responds, the actions taken confirm the initial beliefs. This rational expectations definition leaves open {{the question of how}} beliefs and actions get into this self-confirming state. For example, do beliefs converge to their equilibrium state first and drag actions into alignment or is the process action driven with them converging before beliefs. What we find is that the process of convergence is one where actions converge before beliefs. However, after reaching equilibrium in actions, the beliefs of subjects converge to the degenerate beliefs that place all the weight on the partner’s equilibrium action extremely rapidly (within 2 periods on average). We also identify differences between the early <b>converger</b> and the late <b>converger</b> in a group — often it is the case that the early <b>converger</b> plays his part of the Nash action profile long enough to convince his opponent to adhere.

However, as they progress through the program, active learning and concrete interpersonal interactions become crucial for the acquisition of professional competencies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if and how medical students' learning styles change during the course of their undergraduate program. Methods: All students admitted to the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) medical school between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1, 290) took the Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory at school entrance. Two years later 627 students took it again, and in the seventh and last year of the program 104 students took it for a third time. The distribution of styles at years 1, 3 and 7, and the mobility of students between styles were analyzed with Bayesian models. Results: Most freshmen (54 %) were classified as assimilators (abstract-passive learners); <b>convergers</b> (abstract-active) followed with 26 %, whereas divergers (concrete-passive) and accommodators (concrete-active) accounted for 11 % and 9 %, respectively. By year 3, the styles' distribution remained unchanged but in year 7 <b>convergers</b> outnumbered assimilators (49 % vs. 33 %). In general, there were no gender-related differences. Discussion: Medical students change their preferred way of learning: they evolve from an abstract-reflexive style to an abstract-active one.

40|$|Introduction: Learning {{style is}} an individual’s {{preferred}} method of encountering information in specific situations {{in order to}} acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes through study or experience. Students and Planers’ awareness of learning styles facilitate the teaching process, increases satisfaction and makes the future choices easier. This study aimed to examine different learning styles and their relation to academic achievement in medical students of basic sciences program at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this descriptive – analytical study, {{the sample consisted of}} all medical students of basic sciences program at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2011 - 2012. The data was collected through a questionnaire which included respondents’ demographic information and overall grade point average (GPA) as well as Kolb standard questions on learning styles. Results: 4. 3 %, 47. 8 %, 44. 9 % and 2. 9 % of students preferred diverger, assimilator, <b>converger</b> and accommodator learning styles, respectively. Mean overall GPA of students who preferred diverger learning styles was 14. 990. 39 ±. Students who prefer assimilator, <b>converger</b> and accommodator learning styles had mean overall GPAs of 14. 940. 56 ±, 15. 080. 58 ± and 14. 830. 29 ± respectively. The findings showed no significant relationship between students’ learning academic achievement and their learning styles (p = 0. 689). Conclusion: There was no significant relationship between Students’ academic achievement and their learning styles. Furthermore, the majorit of the students preferred accommodator and <b>converger</b> learning styles.

The sector specialisation determines aggregate growth, while aggregate growth modifies sector specialisation, endogenous structural changes emerge. In this model the casual chain "growth - profits - technology - income elasticity of exports" describes explicitly the feedback from growth to exports. Moreover, sectors heterogeneity and the impact of sector specialisation on growth are considered; sectors are heterogeneous because of the different dynamic of profits and because of different income elasticities. Taking account of these two elements, growth and specialisation coevolve: an economic system <b>convergers</b> towards a medium-period macro equilibrium where the rate of growth and sector specialisation is constant. After some periods the system endogenously changes the regime of growth and shifts towards another equilibrium. The result is strongly path and time dependent.
