Using 26 wheels, each with {{the letters of the}} alphabet arranged randomly around them, Thomas Jefferson invented the wheel cypher in 1795. Falling in and out of use and obscurity, the wheel cypher was [...] "re-invented" [...] twice: first by a French government official around 1890, and then just prior to World War I by an officer in the United States Army. Designated as M-94, the latter version was used by the United States Army and other military services from 1922 to the beginning of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Today this {{notation}} {{is relatively}} rare, {{and has been}} replaced by kepatihan notation, which is a <b>cipher</b> <b>system.</b> Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the kepatihan Palace in Surakarta, which had become a high-school conservatory. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales slendro and pélog for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots below or above the numbers indicating the register, and lines above notes showing time values; In vocal notation, there are also brackets under groups of notes to indicate melisma. Like the palace notation, however, Kepatihan records mostly the balungan part and its metric phrases as marked by a variety of gongs. The other parts are created in real time, and depend on the knowledge each musician has of his instrument, and his awareness of what others are playing; this [...] "realization" [...] is sometimes called [...] "garap." [...] Some teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the cengkok (melodic patterns) of the elaborating instruments. Some ethnomusicologists, trained in European music, may make transcriptions onto a Western staff. This entails particular challenges of tuning and time, sometimes resulting in unusual clefs.|$|E

In order to examine the strength of a sequence two different types of criteria are considered. Statistical tests, are designed to assess how a sequence with a particular property behaves randomly. Complexity measures, are applied to determine the complexity, or equivalently the unpredictability of a sequence. Sequences obtained by LFSR are considered as building blocks of pseudo-random (PR) sequence generators. Transformations on the decimal expansion of irrational numbers is an alternative method for generating PR sequences, which are studied and some encouraging results are reported...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{implementation of a}} hybrid <b>ciphering</b> <b>system</b> of images in Fourier domain based on two chaotic maps. The first map is the Bakermap,which is used to scramble the image pixels in three modes of operation (CBC, CFB and OFB). The second map is the logistic map,whose secret key depends on the plain text. In the key generation step of the logistic map, the chaotic stream is generated with plain text and hence {{the relation between the}} key and the plain text is established. We use Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) before the encryption to achieve a large degree of randomization. We examine the proposed algorithm and compare the results with the RC 6 algorithm. The performance and security analysis prove that this hybrid <b>ciphering</b> <b>system</b> is efficient, reliable, and can effectively resist different attacks...|$|R
50|$|In June 1941, the Germans {{started to}} {{introduce}} on-line stream <b>cipher</b> teleprinter <b>systems</b> for strategic point-to-point radio links, {{to which the}} British gave the code-name Fish.

These <b>cipher</b> <b>systems</b> were cryptanalysed, particularly Tunny, which the British thoroughly penetrated. It was eventually attacked using Colossus, which were the first digital programme-controlled electronic computers.

The Germans were convinced that the Tunny <b>cipher</b> <b>system</b> was unbreakable. Tunny was the <b>cipher</b> <b>system</b> which carried only the highest grade of intelligence: messages from the German Army Headquarters in Berlin and the top generals and field marshals on all fronts.

These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning.|$|E

Besides correlation-immunity, also other properties of Boolean functions, like balance, can be taken into account in the construction. Because of the relevance in cryptographic applications, the focus will be on balanced correlation-immune functions. The complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm leads to a new upper bound for the number of balanced correlation-immune functions, depending on the number of input variables n and the order of correlation-immunity. 1 Introduction Stream <b>cipher</b> <b>systems</b> use random sequences for the encryption of a message stream.
