5|$|Its {{climate is}} cold, dry and very sunny, {{with high levels}} of {{ultraviolet}} radiation. Licancabur is not covered by glaciers, and vegetation such as cushion plants and shrubs are found lower on its slopes. <b>Chinchillas</b> were formerly hunted on the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Licancabur was first settled by the Atacameno people, presumably {{because of the}} water in local canyons. The Incas, under Yawar Waqaq, were {{followed}} by the Spanish during the early 16th century in the region; both were looking for yareta and <b>chinchillas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The short-tailed <b>chinchilla</b> (<b>Chinchilla</b> <b>chinchilla,</b> {{formerly}} known as <b>Chinchilla</b> brevicaudata), also called the Bolivian, Peruvian, or royal <b>chinchilla,</b> is an endangered species of rodent. Their original range included the Andes Mountains of Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. The rodents were exploited for their luxurious fur, causing their numbers to dwindle greatly.|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, a {{minority}} scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, <b>chinchillas,</b> and degus, are not rodents {{and should be}} reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs). Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense was {{the fourth}} species of the genus Lagidium to be described, after L.peruanum, L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni of the central and {{southern}} Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within L.peruanum and L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni is poorly differentiated from L.viscacia. Together with the plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) and the <b>chinchillas</b> (Chinchilla), Lagidium forms the rodent family Chinchillidae. Within Lagidium, L.ahuacaense differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A cladistic analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the sister group to all other Lagidium species, but support for this placement was not strong. Morphometric analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other Lagidium species.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, <b>chinchillas,</b> degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. <b>Chinchillas</b> and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
25|$|Other mammals {{which in}} some {{locations}} comprise a minor diet component include dormice, pocket gophers, moles, raccoons, horses, kangaroo rats, porcupines, shrews, pikas, and <b>chinchillas.</b> Over {{the whole of the}} golden eagle's range these prey items comprise less than 1% of nest remains, though this figure can be higher locally.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} popular pets are likely dogs and cats, other animals, such as pigs, red foxes, ferrets, and rabbits; rodents such as gerbils, hamsters, <b>chinchillas,</b> fancy rats, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as canaries, parrots, and chickens; reptile pets, such as turtles, lizards and snakes; aquatic pets, such as fish, {{freshwater}} and saltwater aquatic snails, frogs; arthropod pets, such as tarantulas and hermit crabs, and many other species.|$|E

2500|$|An octodontid rodent of Argentina's harsh desert regions, {{known as}} the plains {{viscacha}} rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has been reported as an exception to this 'rule'.

Its closest living relation is Octomys mimax, the Andean Viscacha-Rat of the same family, whose 2n = 56.

2500|$|Cats can {{be cured}} easily and lambs usually simply lose weight, but in calves, the parasites {{can be fatal}} and often are not {{responsive}} to antibiotics or electrolytes.

[...] Dogs have a high infection rate, as 30% of the population under one year old are known to be infected in kennels. The infection is more prevalent in puppies than in adult dogs. Infected dogs can be isolated and treated, or the entire pack at a kennel can be treated together regardless. Kennels should also be then cleaned with bleach or other cleaning disinfectants. The grass areas used for exercise should be considered contaminated for at least one month after dogs show signs of infection, as cysts can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Prevention can be achieved by quarantine of infected dogs for at least 20 days and careful management and maintenance of a clean water supply.|$|E

60|$|We {{come now}} to the Himalayan breed, which is {{sometimes}} called Chinese, Polish, or Russian. These pretty rabbits are white, or occasionally yellow, excepting their ears, nose, feet, and the upper side of the tail, which are all brownish-black; but as they have red eyes, they may be considered as albinoes. I have received several accounts of their breeding perfectly true. From their symmetrical marks, they were at first ranked as specifically distinct, and were provisionally named L. nigripes. (4/14. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' June 23, 1857 page 159.) Some good observers thought that they could detect {{a difference in their}} habits, and stoutly maintained that they formed a new species. The origin of this breed is so curious, both in itself and as throwing some light on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth giving in detail. But it is first necessary briefly to describe two other breeds: silver-greys or silver-sprigs generally have black heads and legs, and their fine grey fur is interspersed with numerous black and white long hairs. They breed perfectly true, and have long been kept in warrens. When they escape and cross with common rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of Wretham Hall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half take after the one parent, and the other half after the other parent. Secondly, <b>chinchillas</b> or tame silver-greys (I will use the former name) have short, paler, mouse or slate-coloured fur, interspersed with long, blackish, slate-coloured, and white hairs. (4/15. 'Journal of Horticulture' April 9, 1861 page 35.) These rabbits breed perfectly true. A writer stated in 1857 (4/16. 'Cottage Gardener' 1857 page 141.) that he had produced Himalayan rabbits in the following manner. He had a breed of <b>chinchillas</b> which had been crossed with the common black rabbit, and their offspring were either blacks or <b>chinchillas.</b> These latter were again crossed with other <b>chinchillas</b> (which had also been crossed with silver-greys), and from this complicated cross Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and other similar statements, Mr. Bartlett (4/17. Mr. Bartlett in 'Proc. Zoolog Soc.' 1861 page 40.) was led to make a careful trial in the Zoological Gardens, and he found that by simply crossing silver-greys with <b>chinchillas</b> he could always produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding their sudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true. But I have recently been assured the pure silver-greys of any sub-breed occasionally produce Himalayans.|$|E
