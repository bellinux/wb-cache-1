Djibouti gained independence from France in 1977, making 1980 the first Summer Olympics the <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eligible for. Djibouti was one of 65 countries that boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet war in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

5|$|The 1930 FIFA World Cup was {{the inaugural}} FIFA World Cup, the world {{championship}} for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with the <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan {{to join in the}} future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{declared that}} the <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> neutral in the First World War on 4 August 1914. The sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U-boats led them to revoke their neutrality, then declare war on 26 October 1917. By this time, São Paulo was no longer one of the world's most powerful battleships. Despite an identified need for more modern fire control, {{she had not been}} fitted with any of the advances in that technology that had appeared since her construction, and she was in poor condition. For these reasons the Royal Navy declined a Brazilian offer to send her and Minas Geraes to serve with the Grand Fleet. In an attempt to bring the battleship up to international standards, Brazil sent São Paulo to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit. Soon after she departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro, fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down. The American battleship , which was in the area after transporting the body of the late Uruguayan Minister to the United States to Montevideo, rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at Bahia. Escorted by Nebraska and another American ship, , São Paulo made it to the New York Naval Yard after a 42-day journey.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E

25|$|Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) a {{developed}} country can 'sponsor' a greenhouse gas reduction project in {{a developing country}} where the cost of greenhouse gas reduction project activities is usually much lower, but the atmospheric effect is globally equivalent.

25|$|In case {{of balance}} of {{payments}} imbalances, Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing {{too much of the}} burden on the deficit <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deflationary.|$|E
60|$|The ten-year {{arrangement}} was due a year ago, {{but failed to}} connect. At least completely. A year's compromise was arranged.
