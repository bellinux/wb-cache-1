40|$|Anopheles funestus Giles {{is one of}} {{the major}} malaria vectors in Africa, but little is known about its genetics. Lack of a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> {{characterized}} by regions has hindered the progress of genetic research with this important species. This study developed a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> of An. funestus using ovarian nurse cell polytene chromosomes. We demonstrate an important application with the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> for characterizing various chromosomal inversions for specimens collected from coastal Kenya. The linear and spatial organization of An. funestus polytene chromosomes was compared with the best-studied malaria mosquito, An. gambiae Giles. Comparisons of chromosome morphology between the two species have revealed that the most extensive chromosomal rearrangement occurs in pericentromeric heterochromatin of autosomes. Differences in pericentromeric heterochromatin types correlate with nuclear organization differences between An. funestus and An. gambiae. Attachments of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope strongly depend on the presence of diffusive beta-heterochromatin. Thus, An. funestus and An. gambiae exhibit species-specific characteristics in chromosome-linear and -spatial organizations...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution {{cytogenetic}} maps {{provide important}} biological information on genome organization and function, as they correlate genetic distance with cytological structures, and are an invaluable complement to physical sequence data. The most direct way {{to generate a}} <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> is to localize genetically mapped genes onto chromosomes by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). Detection of single-copy genes on plant chromosomes has been difficult. In this study, we developed a squash FISH procedure allowing successful detection of single-copy genes on maize (Zea mays) pachytene chromosomes. Using this method, the shortest probe that can be detected is 3. 1 kb, and two sequences separated by âˆ¼ 100 kb can be resolved. To show the robust nature of this protocol, we localized nine genetically mapped single-copy genes on chromosome 9 in one FISH experiment. Integration of existing information from genetic maps and the BAC contig-based physical map with the cytological structure of chromosome 9 provides a comprehensive cross-referenced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> and shows the dramatic reduction of recombination in the pericentromeric heterochromatic region. To establish a feasible mapping system for maize, we also developed a probe cocktail for unambiguous identification of the 10 maize pachytene chromosomes.

In the present study, we integrated cytogenetic and microsatellite-based linkage maps for Zhikong scallop, Chlamys farreri. Thirty-eight marker-anchored BAC clones standing for the 19 linkage groups were used to be FISH probes. Of 38 BAC clones, 30 were successfully located on single chromosome by FISH and used to integrate the genetic and <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map.</b> Among the 19 linkage groups, 12 linkage groups were physically anchored by 2 markers, 6 linkage groups were anchored by 1 marker, and one linkage group was not anchored any makers by FISH. In addition, using two-color FISH, six linkage groups were distinguished by different chromosomal location; linkage groups LG 6 and LG 16 were placed on chromosome 10, LG 8 and LG 18 on chromosome 14. As a result, 18 of 19 linkage groups were localized to 17 pairs of chromosomes of C. farreri. We first integrated genetic and <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> for C. farreri. These 30 chromosome specific BAC clones in the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> {{could be used to}} identify chromosomes of C. farreri.

An efficient way to perform comparative <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> is based on BAC clones mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this report, to address the knowledge gap on the genome evolution in cichlid fishes, BAC clones of an Oreochromis niloticus library covering the linkage groups (LG) 1, 3, 5, and 7 were mapped onto the chromosomes of 9 African cichlid species. The <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> data were also integrated with BAC-end sequences information of O. niloticus and comparatively analyzed against the genome of other fish species and vertebrates. Results The location of BACs from LG 1, 3, 5, and 7 revealed a strong chromosomal conservation among the analyzed cichlid species genomes, which evidenced a synteny of the markers of each LG. Comparative in silico analysis also identified large genomic blocks that were conserved in distantly related fish groups and also in other vertebrates. Conclusions Although it has been suggested that fishes contain plastic genomes with high rates of chromosomal rearrangements and probably low rates of synteny conservation, our results evidence that large syntenic chromosome segments have been maintained conserved during evolution, at least for the considered markers.

40|$|The chicken genome, {{like those}} of most avian species, {{contains}} numerous microchromosomes that cannot be distinguished by size alone. Unique properties attributed to the microchromosomes include high GC content and gene density, and an enhanced recombination rate. Previously, microchromosome GGA 17 was shown to align with the consensus genetic linkage group E 41 W 17, and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing E 41 W 17 markers were isolated and assigned on the physical BAC map {{as well as the}} recently assembled draft chicken genome sequence. For this study, these same BACs were utilized as probes for fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to develop the GGA 17 <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map.</b> Here we detail the chromosome order of ten BAC DNAs, thereby deriving a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> of GGA 17 that is simultaneously integrated with both the linkage map and genome sequence. The location of the FISH probes together with the morphological appearance of the chromosome suggested that GGA 17 is an acrocentric chromosome whose <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> orientation is reversed from that currently indicated by the linkage map and draft genome sequence. The reversed orientation and the centromere location of GGA 17 were confirmed experimentally by dual-colour FISH hybridization using terminal BACs and the centromere-specific CNM oligonucleotide as probes.

The karyotype consists of 6 pairs of macrochromosomes and 10 pairs microchromosomes (2 n = 32), including a female heterogametic ZW sex microchromosome pair. Here, we present a molecular <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> for P. vitticeps comprising 87 anchor bacterial artificial chromosome clones that together span each macro- and microchromosome.

We identified an active nucleolus organizer region (NOR) on the sub-telomeric region of 2 q by mapping 18 S rDNA and Ag-NOR staining. We identified interstitial telomeric sequences in two microchromosome pairs and the W chromosome, indicating that microchromosome fusion has been a mechanism of karyotypic evolution in Australian agamids within the last 21 to 19 million years. Orthology searches against the chicken genome revealed an intrachromosomal rearrangement of P. vitticeps 1 q, identified regions orthologous to chicken Z on P. vitticeps 2 q, snake Z on P. vitticeps 6 q and the autosomal microchromosome pair in P. vitticeps orthologous to turtle Pelodiscus sinensis ZW and lizard Anolis carolinensis XY.

40|$|Molecular <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> by FISH is {{a common}} feature of most genome {{projects}} as it provides a global, low-resolution overview of the genome and facilitates comparative genomics. An essential prerequisite for <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> {{is the ability to}} identify accurately the chromosome on which the clone (e. g. BAC) resides. This is not usually a barrier to human mapping as knowledge of the human karyotype is commonplace. For other species however accurate assignment can be problematic either because, as in birds, the karyotype is too complex to analyze by standard means or because of the paucity of individuals skilled to perform the karyotyping. Using chicken as a model we have developed a reproducible approach for accurate <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> that involves: a single colour FISH, measurement of the ratio {{of the size of the}} signal bearing chromosome to that of chromosome 8, and final assignment through a small series of dual colour experiments. Reference values for size ratios were established using base pair estimate information from the Ensembl browser. By this method <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> to highly complex karyotypes can be achieved in a small number of simple steps. We have also developed and tested a karyotyping tutorial programme adapted from one previously reported in this journal.

Interspecies genomic comparisons are one method by which the origin and molecular mechanism of duplications can be inferred. By comparative mapping in human, mouse, and rat, we previously found evidence for a recent chromosome-fission event that occurred in the mouse lineage. <b>Cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> revealed that the genomic segments flanking the fission site appeared to be duplicated, with copies residing near the centromere of multiple mouse chromosomes.

Comparative chromosome painting and <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> of 15 zebra finch BAC clones to the standard (ZAL 2) and alternative (ZAL 2 m) arrangements revealed that this chromosome is orthologous to chicken chromosome 3, and that at a minimum, ZAL 2 and ZAL 2 m differ by a pair of included pericentric inversions that we estimate span at least 98 Mb. Population-based sequencing and genotyping of multiple loci demonstrated that ZAL 2 m suppresses recombination in the heterokaryotype and is evolving as a rare nonrecombining autosomal segment of the genome. In addition, we estimate that the first inversion within the ZAL 2 m arrangement originated 2. 2 Â± 0. 3 million years ago. Finally, while previously recognized as a genetic model for the evolution of social behavior, we found that the ZAL 2 /ZAL 2 m polymorphism also shares genetic and phenotypic features with the mouse t complex and we further suggest that the ZAL 2 /ZAL 2 m polymorphism is a heretofore unrecognized model for the early stages of sex chromosome evolution...|$|R

40|$|A <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for diploid potato (Solanum tuberosum), in which {{the arms of the}} 12 potato bivalents can be identified in pachytene complements using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a set of 60 genetically anchored bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the RHPOTKEY BAC library. This diagnostic set of selected BACs (five per chromosome) hybridizes to euchromatic regions and corresponds to well-defined loci in the ultradense genetic map, and with these probes a new detailed and reliable pachytene karyotype could be established. Chromosome size has been estimated both from microscopic length measurements and from 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole fluorescence-based DNA content measurements. In both approaches, chromosome 1 is the largest (100 â€“ 115 Mb) and chromosome 11 the smallest (49 â€“ 53 Mb). Detailed measurements of mega-base-pair to micrometer ratios have been obtained for chromosome 5, with average values of 1. 07 Mb/Âµm for euchromatin and 3. 67 Mb/Âµm for heterochromatin. In addition, our FISH results helped to solve two discrepancies in the potato genetic map related to chromosomes 8 and 12. Finally, we discuss the significance of the potato <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map</b> for extended FISH studies in potato and related Solanaceae, which will be especially beneficial for the potato genome-sequencing projec...|$|E

40|$|Two Drosophila pseudoobscura genomic clones have {{sequence}} {{similarity to}} the Drosophila melanogaster amylase region {{that maps to}} the 53 CD region on the D. melanogaster <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map.</b> The two clones with similarity to amylase map to sections 73 A and 78 C of the D. pseudoobscura third chromosome <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>map.</b> The complete sequences of both the 73 A and 78 C regions were compared to the D. melanogaster genome {{to determine if the}} coding region for amylase is present in both regions and to determine the evolutionary mechanism responsible for the observed distribution of the amylase gene or genes. The D. pseudoobscura 73 A and 78 C linkage groups are conserved with the D. melanogaster 41 E and 53 CD regions, respectively. The amylase gene, however, has not maintained its conserved linkage between the two species. These data indicate that amylase has moved via a transposition event in the D. melanogaster or D. pseudoobscura lineage. The predicted genes within the 73 A and 78 C regions show patterns of molecular evolution in synonymous and nonsynonymous sites that are consistent with previous studies of these two species. Conserved synteny occurs when two or more homologous genes are located on the same chromosome in two or more species.

40|$|Abstract Background Cichlid fishes {{have been}} the subject of {{increasing}} scientific interest because of their rapid adaptive radiation which has led to an extensive ecological diversity and their enormous importance to tropical and subtropical aquaculture. To increase our understanding of chromosome evolution among cichlid species, karyotypes of one Asian, 22 African, and 30 South American cichlid species were investigated, and chromosomal data of the family was reviewed. Results Although there is extensive variation in the karyotypes of cichlid fishes (from 2 n = 32 to 2 n = 60 chromosomes), the modal chromosome number for South American species was 2 n = 48 and the modal number for the African ones was 2 n = 44. The only Asian species analyzed, Etroplus maculatus, was observed to have 46 chromosomes. The presence of one or two macro B chromosomes was detected in two African species. The <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> of 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) gene revealed a variable number of clusters among species varying from two to six. Conclusions The karyotype diversification of cichlids seems to have occurred through several chromosomal rearrangements involving fissions, fusions and inversions. It was possible to identify karyotype markers for the subfamilies Pseudocrenilabrinae (African) and Cichlinae (American). The karyotype analyses did not clarify the phylogenetic relationship among the Cichlinae tribes. On the other hand, the two major groups of Pseudocrenilabrinae (tilapiine and haplochromine) were clearly discriminated based on the characteristics of their karyotypes. The <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>mapping</b> of 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) gene did not follow the chromosome diversification in the family. The dynamic evolution of the repeated units of rRNA genes generates patterns of chromosomal distribution that do not help follows the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. The presence of B chromosomes in cichlids is of particular interest because they may not be represented in the reference genome sequences currently being obtained. </p...|$|R
