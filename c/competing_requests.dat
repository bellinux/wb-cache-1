40|$|Computing {{and storage}} {{utilities}} must control resource usage to meet contractual performance targets for hosted customers under dynamic conditions, including flash crowds and unexpected resource failures. This paper explores properties of proportional share resource schedulers {{that are necessary}} for stability and responsiveness under feedback control. It shows that the fairness properties commonly defined for proportional share schedulers using Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) are not preserved across changes to the relative weights of <b>competing</b> <b>request</b> flows. As a result, conventional WFQ schedulers are not controllable by a resource controller that adapts by adjusting the weights. The paper defines controllable fairness properties, presents an algorithm to adjust any WFQ scheduler when the weights change, and proves that the algorithm results in controllable-fair schedulers. The analytic results are confirmed by experimental evaluation using a three-tier Web service and a prototype controllable-fair scheduler called C-SFQ(D). C-SFQ(D) extends concurrency-controlled Start-time Fair Queuing (SFQ(D), which supports proportional sharing in multi-tasking computing resources. The prototype includes an adaptive control system that adjusts the flow weights in C-SFQ(D) to meet latency and throughput targets {{under a variety of}} conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of controllable-fair scheduling for feedback control of computing utilities. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Caching systems {{using the}} Least Recently Used (LRU) {{principle}} {{have now become}} ubiquitous. A fundamental question for these systems is whether the cache space should be pooled together or divided to serve multiple flows of data item requests {{in order to minimize}} the miss probabilities. In this paper, we show that there is no straight yes or no answer to this question, depending on complex combinations of critical factors, including, e. g., request rates, overlapped data items across different request flows, data item popularities and their sizes. Specifically, we characterize the asymptotic miss probabilities for multiple <b>competing</b> <b>request</b> flows under resource pooling and separation for LRU caching when the cache size is large. Analytically, we show that it is asymptotically optimal to jointly serve multiple flows if their data item sizes and popularity distributions are similar and their arrival rates do not differ significantly; the self-organizing property of LRU caching automatically optimizes the resource allocation among them asymptotically. Otherwise, separating these flows could be better, e. g., when data sizes vary significantly. We also quantify critical points beyond which resource pooling is better than separation for each of the flows when the overlapped data items exceed certain levels. Technically, we generalize existing results on the asymptotic miss probability of LRU caching for a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions and extend them to multiple competing flows with varying data item sizes, which also validates the Che approximation under certain conditions. These results provide new insights on improving the performance of caching systems...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} enables data centres {{to provide}} resource sharing across multiple tenants. This sharing, however, usually {{comes at a}} cost {{in the form of}} reduced isolation between tenants, which can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable performance. This variability in performance becomes an impediment for clients whose services rely on consistent, responsive performance in cloud environments. The problem is exacerbated for applications that rely on cloud storage systems as performance in these systems is a ffected by disk access times, which often dominate overall request service times for these types of data services. In this thesis we introduce MicroFuge, a new distributed caching and scheduling middleware that provides performance isolation for cloud storage systems. To provide performance isolation, MicroFuge's cache eviction policy is tenant and deadline-aware, which enables the provision of isolation to tenants and ensures that data for queries with more urgent deadlines, which {{are most likely to be}} a ffected by <b>competing</b> <b>requests,</b> are less likely to be evicted than data for other queries. MicroFuge also provides simplifi ed, intelligent scheduling in addition to request admission control whose performance model of the underlying storage system will reject requests with deadlines that are unlikely to be satisfi ed. The middleware approach of MicroFuge makes it unique among other systems which provide performance isolation in cloud storage systems. Rather than providing performance isolation for some particular cloud storage system, MicroFuge can be deployed on top of any already deployed storage system without modifying it. Keeping in mind the wide spectrum of cloud storage systems available today, such an approach make MicroFuge very adoptable. In this thesis, we show that MicroFuge can provide signifi cantly better performance isolation between tenants with di fferent latency requirements than Memcached, and with admission control enabled, can ensure that more than certain percentage of requests meet their deadlines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—New {{multi-axis}} satellites allow {{camera imaging}} parameters {{to be set}} during each time slot based on competing demand for images, specified as rectangular requested viewing zones over the camera’s reachable field of view. The single frame selection (SFS) problem {{is to find the}} camera frame parameters that maximize reward during each time window. We formalize the SFS problem based on a new reward metric that takes into account area coverage and image resolution. For a set of client requests and a satellite with discrete resolution levels, we give an algorithm that solves the SFS problem in time @ P A. For satellites with continuously variable resolution @ a A, we give an algorithm that runs in time @ QA. We have implemented all algorithms and verify performance using random inputs. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by recent innovations in earth imaging by commercial satellites. In contrast to previous methods that required waits of up to 21 days for desired earth-satellite alignment, new satellites have onboard pan-tilt-zoom cameras that can be remotely directed to provide near real-time response to requests for images of specific areas on the earth’s surface. We consider the problem of resolving <b>competing</b> <b>requests</b> for images: Given client demand as a set of rectangles on the earth surface, compute camera settings that optimize the tradeoff between pan, tilt, and zoom parameters to maximize camera revenue during each time slot. We define a new quality metric and algorithms for solving the problem for the cases of discrete and continuous zoom values. These results are a step toward multiple frame selection which will be addressed in future research. The metric and algorithms presented in this paper may also be applied to collaborative teleoperation of ground-based robot cameras for inspection and videoconferencing and for scheduling astronomic telescopes.

40|$|The Recovery Plan Workbook is {{designed}} for use by U. S. Army chemical installations {{and state and local}} authorities who participate in the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP). The workbook includes a model recovery plan that provides a template for preparation of an integrated CSEPP recovery plan. The workbook also provides background, explanatory, and reference materials to aid planners. The model plan provides a general example and framework for planning but is not complete without input from the local CSEPP community. Each chemical stockpile location has site-specific needs, resources, and organizational differences that will shape recovery planning. Therefore, the purpose of the model plan, in part, is to raise questions that installation, state, and local planners will have to answer to develop a site-specific recovery plan. It is recommended that a single, overarching recovery plan be developed to coordinate the activities of the installation, state, and local jurisdictions at a given site. As stated in Planning Guidance for the CSEPP, Appendix M, ''The reentry/restoration plan should be integrated and coordinated among the Army installation and other state and local jurisdictions in the IRZ and PAZ. '' The integrated approach is more efficient from a planning perspective (compared to separate, parallel plans for each jurisdiction) and will facilitate coordination among the organizations. To be effective, many aspects of recovery must also be coordinated. For example, if several jurisdictions submit <b>competing</b> <b>requests</b> to the Army for monitoring services, confusion might result, and some important monitoring activities might be delayed. A coordinated plan would ensure that monitoring is conducted in proper order of priority.
