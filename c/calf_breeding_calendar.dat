40|$|Data were {{collected}} on 1739 records of Japanese Black calves during the period 1937 - 2002 at the Department of Livestock and Grassland Science, National Agricultural Research Centre for Western Region, Oda City, Shimane Prefecture. The objectives were to estimate heritability, maternal effect and genetic and phenotypic correlations between birth weight, weaning weight and average daily gain from birth to weaning; to evaluate <b>calf</b> <b>breeding</b> values and to evaluate the genetic and phenotypic trends for these traits. Heritability estimates of birth weight, weaning weight and average daily gain were 0. 39, 0. 17 and 0. 26, respectively. The corresponding maternal components were 0. 10, 0. 10 and 0. 11, respectively. Genetic correlations between birth weight and weaning, birth weight and average daily gain and weaning weight and average daily gain were 0. 30, - 0. 17 and 0. 86, respectively. The corresponding phenotypic correlations were 0. 19, - 0. 33 and 0. 90, respectively. <b>Calf</b> <b>breeding</b> values ranged between - 17. 93 and 2. 83, between - 4. 72 and 18. 08 and between - 0. 070 and 0. 182 kg for birth weight, weaning weight and average daily gain, respectively. Regression coefficients of breeding values of birth weight, weaning weight and average daily gain on year of calving were not significant and accounted for 0. 011 ± 0. 012, - 0. 02 ± 0. 02 and - 0. 0002 ± 0. 0002, respectively. The corresponding regression coefficients of the phenotypic values of weaning weight and average daily gain on year of calving were significant and accounted for 2. 16 ± 0. 31 and 0. 013 ± 0. 002, respectively. However, that of birth weight was not significant (0. 18 ± 0. 10). Breeding values fluctuated across years of study with no clearly defined pattern or trend. A similar trend was observed for phenotypic values.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the pattern of}} species richness changes in a bird-breeding bird community on a small western Mediterranean archipelago (Columbretes Islands) over a 40 -year period (1964 - 2003). The {{aim of this study}} was to qualitatively account for the relative roles of local and regional factors in shaping the community. As expected, we found that regional factors (at the metapopulation spatial scale) increased diversity whereas local factors (i. e. ecological) probably prevented further increases in diversity. We found that the archipelago gained four new species (two seabirds and two falconids) during the study period, whereas no extinctions were recorded. The community seems partially or completely closed to some groups of species (e. g. small-sized birds such as passerines and storm-petrels), probably owing to predatory exclusion by Eleonora falcons (Falco eleonorae). As newly arrived species have <b>breeding</b> <b>calendars</b> that do not fully overlap with those of resident species, competition for space in a rather saturated area is prevented.

40|$|International audienceCapsule Great Bittern {{breeding}} phenology can {{be estimated}} from egg and chick biometrics. Aims To estimate egg or chick ages in order to back-calculate egg-laying dates. Methods Bittern nests were searched for in six French and three Belarussian sites between 1999 and 2004. Eggs and chicks were measured at each visit. By using a subsample of nests with known egglaying (or hatching) dates, regression equations are determined using egg density and tarsus length in order to estimate, respectively, egg and chick ages. Additionally in Belarus, the ‘water test' was used to estimate the incubation stage of the clutch. Results A total of 141 Bittern nests were found. Egg density decreased linearly from 1. 063 at laying to 0. 915 the day before hatching. A regression equation therefore allows estimation of egg age from its density. A scale was also constructed to estimate egg age from its position in water, and {{the accuracy of the}} two methods is compared. Chick growth rates were similar between the two countries. Before the age of 25 days, chicks are best aged by tarsus length compared to other measurements (weight, bill length). No data were available after that age because chicks were no longer found on nests. Conclusions Egg-laying date {{can be estimated}} to within ± 3 days using egg density, and to within ± 5 days, using the ‘water test'. Tarsus length can be used until the age of 25 days to age chicks to within ± 2 days. These simple measurements provide efficient and accurate methods to record the <b>breeding</b> <b>calendar</b> of this endangered species...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of old feathers {{is essential for}} birds, {{but it is also}} an energy-demanding task. As moult usually does not coincide with other stressful events in its annual cycle, such as reproduction and migration, the bird can optimise its use of time and energy allocated to different activities. There are very few studies comparing the moult strategies of populations with similar <b>breeding</b> <b>calendars</b> but occurring in areas of different habitat quality. Cory’s Shearwaters Calonectris diomedea have a partial moult–breeding overlap, an unusual phenomenon among pelagic seabirds. We have compared the moult schedules in Cory’s Shearwater colonies located in distinct environments (pelagic vs. coastal) and show that moult–breeding overlap is less extensive on Selvagem Grande, situated in deep oceanic waters, than on Berlenga, situated on the continental shelf. Colony attendance of failed breeders, most of which were moulting, was lower at Selvagem Grande than at Berlenga, which suggests that the feeding areas of birds from the former site are more distant from the colony. Failed breeders started to moult earlier than individuals still raising a chick, and breeding status had a stronger influence on determining the onset of wing-feather moult than colony location. Despite published evidence that internal circannual rhythms and external cues, such as variation in daylength, are important factors regulating moult schedules, it is clear that birds retain a considerable flexibility that allows them to respond to external factors in order to strategically manage time and energy {{in a way that is}} thought to maximise their fitness...|$|R
40|$|What is <b>calf</b> wastage. <b>Breeding</b> female {{cattle in}} north Australia {{contribute}} best to business success by producing a heavy weaner each {{year at the}} first weaning round. This maximises increase in value by the cow unit over the year, generally from mid-year to mid-year. The ability to cycle in both maiden heifers and lactating cows is the primary limitation to achieving this. Wastage of a calf at any stage between conception and weaning also substantially limits fertility and value increase at a herd level. Embryo loss may result in later calves as cows re-conceive; the calves produced are smaller at weaning {{and have to be}} weaned later into the dry season. Late calf wastage usually results in breeders missing a calf for the year. Late calving often also results in failure to cycle, thus cows rear a calf in the subsequent year...|$|R

The use of 28 d average daily gains as predictors of carcass traits is a new concept in the beef industry. This procedure could benefit feedyard managers in optimizing the performance of cattle being fed and in lower discounts from the packers. The cattle evaluated were part of the Angelton Project and consisted of 3 / 4 Angus 1 / 4 Brahman cattle, 3 / 4 Brahman 1 / 4 Angus cattle, and F 2 crosses (n = 440). These cattle are compromised of 35 full sib embryo transfer families and were evaluated over a five year period for growth and slaughter traits. The cattle were placed in simulated feedyard conditions for at least 140 d and weighed every 28 d for five periods to monitor gains and performance. After the feeding period was concluded, the cattle were slaughtered and data were collected. Among the traits measured were quality grade, marbling, and actual fat. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the viability and practicality of using the five 28 d average daily gain periods as predictors of carcass traits. The mean ADGs were calculated for the total population as well as by <b>calf</b> <b>breeding</b> code. The ADGs peaked at 56 d for the total population and for the 3 / 4 Angus 1 / 4 Brahman, and the 3 / 4 Brahman 1 / 4 Angus breed groups. Family code, birth weight, and average daily gain for period 3 (56 to 84 d) were the best predictors of quality grade while only family code and average daily gain for period 3 (56 to 84 d) were the best predictors of marbling. Effects of sire code nested within family code, sex, weaning weight, average daily gain for period I (O to 28 d), average daily gain for period 2 (28 to 56), and average daily gain for period 3 (56 to 84 d) were the best predictors of actual fat. If the breeding of an animal is known, then better gains at 56 d and 84 d can be expected to enhance potential quality merit of the carcass...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the value}} of a heifer calf, a bred heifer, or a re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How does that value compare to the current market price? What is your cost of raising a heifer calf, bred heifer, or re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How many pencils have been worn dull or how many {{spreadsheets}} have been created to answer these questions? The unrealistic objective {{of this paper is to}} answer these questions. Perhaps a more realistic objective is to answer some of these questions and to provide you the framework to answer some of the questions for your own operation. One approach to determine value is to simply consider the market price for the heifer. However, this is only the true value if you actually sell the heifer. If you keep the heifer, then her true value is based on her future production, your annual costs to keep her, and the future market prices for calves and for a cull cow when the heifer is ultimately sold. When one considers these factors and how variable they are from year-to-year, from ranch-to-ranch and from heifer-to-heifer there is no single value that will be correct. However, there are some correct principles to determine these values for individual operations. Replacement heifer management from weaning of the heifer <b>calf,</b> to <b>breeding,</b> to calving and to re-breeding can greatly impact the future productivity of a heifer and therefore impact the value of the heifer. There may also be significant differences in costs associated with alternative heifer management programs. Four alternative heifer management programs will be briefly considered, primarily to illustrate a method of determining costs. A method of determining expected value will also be presented. The last section of the paper will present a historical comparison of the cost, value, and market price of a replacement heifer...|$|R

40|$|Moult is an {{extremely}} time-consuming and energy-demanding task for large birds. In addition, there is a trade-off between the time devoted to moulting and that invested in other activities such as breeding and/or territory exploration. Moreover, {{it takes a long}} time to grow a long feather in large birds, and large birds that need to fly while moulting cannot tolerate large gaps in the wing, but only one or two simultaneously growing feathers. As a consequence, large birds take several years to complete a full moult cycle, and they resume the moult process during suboptimal conditions. A clear example of this pattern is the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), which needs 2 - 3 years for changing all flight feathers. Here we describe the sequence, extent, and timing of moult of 124 Bearded Vultures in detail for the first time. We found that extent and timing of flight feather moult was different between age classes. Subadults (from 3 rd to 5 th calendar year) started moult, on average, in early March, whereas adults only started moult, on average, in late April, possibly due to <b>breeding</b> requirements. Second <b>calendar</b> year individuals delayed onset of moult until the middle of May. In general, the moult lasted until November, and although adults started to moult later than subadults, they moulted more feathers.

40|$|Data from USDA-coordinated {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{regional}} performance nurseries collected {{over the time}} period 1959 to 2008 were used to estimate genetic gain (loss) in grain yield, grain volume weight, days to heading, and plant height in winter wheats adapted to the Great Plains of North America. In both the Southern Regional (SRPN) and Northern Regional Performance Nurseries (NRPN), linear regression revealed significant positive relationships between relative grain yields of advanced <b>breeding</b> lines and <b>calendar</b> year of the nursery trial. The estimated genetic gain in grain yield potential since 1959 was approximately 1. 1 % (of the control cultivar Kharkof) yr– 1 for all entries in the SRPN, and 1. 3 % yr– 1 if only the most productive entry was considered. For the NRPN, the estimates of genetic gain in grain yield were 0. 79 % yr– 1 for all entries, and also 0. 79 % yr– 1 for the most productive entry.
