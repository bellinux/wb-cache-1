25|$|In chemistry, diarylethene is {{the general}} name of a class of {{compounds}} that have aromatic groups bonded to each end of a <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b> The simplest example is stilbene, which has two geometric isomers, E and Z.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{method for}} alkene synthesis involves {{construction of a}} new <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> by coupling of a carbonyl compound (such as an aldehyde or ketone) to a carbanion equivalent. Such reactions are sometimes called olefinations. The most well-known of these methods is the Wittig reaction, but other related methods are known.|$|E
25|$|The largest scale {{application}} of hydrogenation {{is for the}} processing of vegetable oils. Typical vegetable oils are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (containing more than one <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond).</b> Their partial hydrogenation reduces most, but not all, of these carbon-carbon double bonds. The degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen, reaction temperature and time, and the catalyst.|$|E
40|$|Polyurethanes (TPUs) {{containing}} <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are synthesized {{for use as}} novel {{materials with}} the ability to form functionalizable ultrafine fibers via electrospinning. By adjusting the molecular structure, a series of TPU products with different amounts of <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> are obtained. After investigating the reactivity of the TPU with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctanethiol, all of the TPU samples exhibit effective functionalizability. The more <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> contained in the molecular structure, the stronger the functionalizability. Besides, these TPUs can easily form uniform ultrafine fibers via electrospinning. Upon comparison, the functionalizability of the electrospun fibers is similar to that observed in the bulk TPU materials. This work suggests a feasible methodology to produce a functionalized ultrafine fibrous carrier. Accordingly, TPU containing <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> is expected to be exploited as a fibrous carrier of solid catalysts in the future...|$|R

25|$|Like {{a single}} {{covalent}} bond, double bonds {{can be described}} in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single sigma bond), a <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. This double bond is stronger than a single covalent bond (611kJ/mol for C=C vs. 347kJ/mol for C–C) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 ångströms (133 pm).|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> by groups that can not be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, the photochemical 6π cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substitutents. As both methyl groups are attached to a stereogenic center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) ring closure can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups.|$|E
25|$|Rotation {{about the}} <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> is {{restricted}} because it incurs an energetic cost {{to break the}} alignment of the p orbitals on the two carbon atoms. As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two isomers, called cis or trans isomers. More complex alkenes may be named with the E–Z notation for molecules {{with three or four}} different substituents (side groups). For example, of the isomers of butene, the two methyl groups of (Z)-but-2-ene (a.k.a. cis-2-butene) appear {{on the same side of}} the double bond, and in (E)-but-2-ene (a.k.a. trans-2-butene) the methyl groups appear on opposite sides. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.|$|E

Carbon–carbon triple bonds also can be manipulated in a similar manner with the appropriate alkylidyne catalyst.

2500|$|In organic chemistry, an alkene is an {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbon that contains {{at least one}} <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b> The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below). [...] Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula n2n. Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with {{the same number of}} carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, ethylene (C2H4), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially. Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{mechanism}} is for FPP's <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> farthest from the diphosphate group to attack the carbon adjacent to the diphosphate, forming a cyclic carbocation with the loss of the diphosphate group. A 1,3 hydride shift moves the carbocation closer to the nearest carbon-carbon double bond; the loss of a proton forms a new <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> and allows the <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> adjacent to the carbocation to quench this charged group, forming the byproduct germacrene D. Alternatively, the carbocation produced in the first step can immediately lose a proton to form the intermediate isolepidozene, which is subsequently attacked by water to form germacradienol. Further processing of germacradienol involves a proton-initiated cyclization and a novel retro-Prins-type fragmentation producing the intermediate octalin and byproduct acetone. Finally, protonation, a 1,2 hydride shift, and quenching by water convert octalin to geosmin.|$|E
