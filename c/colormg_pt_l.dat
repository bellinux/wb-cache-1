40|$|Using density {{functional}} theory, we {{have investigated}} the catalytic properties of bimetallic complex catalysts <b>Pt</b> <b>l</b> Au m (CO) n (l + m = 2, n = 1 – 3) in the reduction of SO 2 by CO. Due to the strong coupling between the C- 2 p and metal 5 d orbitals, pre- adsorption of CO molecules on the <b>Pt</b> <b>l</b> Au m {{is found to be}} very effective in not only reducing the activation energy, but also preventing poisoning by sulfur. As result of the coupling, the metal 5 d band is broadened and down-shifted, and charge is transferred from the CO molecules to the <b>Pt</b> <b>l</b> Au m. As SO 2 is adsorbed on the catalyst, partial charge moves to the anti-σ bonding orbitals between S and O in SO 2, weakening the S–O bond strength. This effect is enhanced by pre-adsorbing up to three CO molecules, therefore the S–O bonds become vulnerable. Our results revealed the mechanism of the excellent catalytic properties of the bimetallic complex catalysts. </p...|$|R

The contact between Pt nanoparticles and C has never been controlled and monitored nanoscopically. In this paper, stable Pt nanoparticles with a mean size of 1. 2 nm were synthesized embedded on/in a C matrix catalytically produced from acetylene over the Pt nanoparticles. The replica Pt-C composite was synthesized inside of the ordered mesopores (2. 7 nm) of Al-MCM- 41 followed by removal of the template. The contact between the Pt nanoparticle and C was experimentally observed by high-energy resolution <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 2 -edge XANES spectra tuned to 11065. 7 eV, at a lower energy by 5 eV than the <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 1 peak top for the replica Pt-C pressed to electrolyte polymer (Nafion).

40|$|The {{reaction}} of cis-blocked, square-planar M-II complexes with tetratopic N-donor ligands {{is known to}} give metallasupramolecular assemblies of the formula M 2 nLn. These assemblies typically adopt barrel-like structures, with the ligands paneling {{the sides of the}} barrels. However, alternative structures are possible, as demonstrated by the recent discovery of a <b>Pt</b> 8 <b>L</b> 4 cage with unusual gyrobifastigium-like geometry. To date, the factors that govern the assembly of (M 2 nLn) -L-II complexes are not well understood. Herein, we provide a geometric analysis of M 2 nLn complexes, and we discuss how size and geometry of the ligand is expected to influence the self-assembly process. The theoretical analysis is complemented by experimental studies using different cis-blocked Pt-II complexes and metalloligands with four divergent pyridyl groups. Mononuclear metalloligands gave mainly assemblies of type <b>Pt</b> 8 <b>L</b> 4, which adopt barrel- or gyrobifastigium-like structures. Larger assemblies can also form, as evidenced by the crystallographic characterization of a <b>Pt</b> 10 <b>L</b> 5 complex and a <b>Pt</b> 16 <b>L</b> 8 complex. The former adopts a pentagonal barrel structure, whereas the latter displays a barrel structure with a distorted square orthobicupola geometry.

There is insuffi cient {{understanding about the}} behavior of catalysts during this period, {{especially with regard to}} the changing environment of the cathode electrocatalyst, which is typically Pt nanoparticles supported on high surface area Vulcan XC- 72 carbon (Pt/C). The purpose of this research was to record preliminary observations of the changing environment during the conditioning phase using X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. XAFS was recorded for a Pt/C cathode at the <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 3 -edge and a PtCo/C cathode at both the <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 3 -edge and Co K-edge. Using precision machined graphite cell-blocks, both transmission and fl uorescence data were recorded at Sector 12 -BM-B of Argonne National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source. The fl uorescence and transmission edge steps allow for a working description of the changing electrocatalyst environment, especially water concentration, at the anode and cathode as functions of operating parameters. These features are discussed in the context of how future analysis may correlate with potential, current and changing apparent thickness of the membrane electrode assembly through loss of catalyst materials (anode, cathode, carbon support). Such direct knowledge of the effect of the conditioning protocol on the electrocatalyst may lead to better catalyst design. In turn, this may lead to minimizing, or even eliminating, the conditioning period...|$|R
