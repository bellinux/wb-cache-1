5000|$|David Alexander [...] {{distinguishes between}} risk and {{vulnerability}} saying that [...] "vulnerability {{refers to the}} potential for casualty, destruction, damage, disruption or other form of loss in a particular element: risk combines this with the probable level of loss to be expected from a predictable magnitude of hazard (which {{can be considered as}} the manifestation of the agent that produces the loss)." [...] As hazard have varying degrees of severity the more intense or severe the hazard, the greater vulnerability there will be as potential for damage and destruction is increased with respect to severity of hazard. Ben Wisner argues that risk or disaster is [...] "a <b>compound</b> <b>function</b> of the natural hazard and the number of people, characterised by their varying degrees of vulnerability to that specific hazard, who occupy the space and time of exposure to the hazard event." [...] (Wisner, et al., 1994).|$|E
5000|$|The overtone-rich {{sound and}} the audible {{movement}} in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of jivari which creates a sustained [...] "buzzing" [...] sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity. Jiva refers to [...] "soul", that which gives life, implying that the tanpura embodies an [...] "animated" [...] tone quality. To achieve this effect, the strings pass over a table-shaped, curved-top bridge, the front of which slopes gently away {{from the surface of}} the strings. When a string is plucked, it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge.When the string moves up and down, the downward wave will touch a far point on the curve of the bridge, and as the energy of motion of the string gradually diminishes, these points of contact of the string on the bridge will gradually shift as well, being a <b>compound</b> <b>function</b> of amplitude, the curvature of the bridge, pitch, string tension and time. When the string is plucked, it has a large amplitude. As the energy of the string's movement gradually diminishes, the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge. Depending on scale, tension and pitch, this can take between three and ten seconds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} for ranking, and demonstrates how to perform generalization analysis of listwise ranking algorithms using the framework. Many learning-to-rank algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Among them, the listwise approach has shown higher empirical ranking performance {{when compared to the}} other approaches. However, there is no theoretical study on the listwise approach as far as we know. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for ranking, which can naturally describe various listwise learningto-rank algorithms. With this framework, we prove a theorem which gives a generalization bound of a listwise ranking algorithm, on the basis of Rademacher Average of the class of <b>compound</b> <b>functions.</b> The <b>compound</b> <b>functions</b> take listwise loss functions as outer functions and ranking models as inner functions.

30|$|Observer {{design for}} {{nonlinear}} dynamic systems {{is a significant}} and interesting research area, {{and it has a}} lot of potential applications in control engineering, fault reconstruction, state estimation, and signal tracking [27 – 39]. Because the fractional derivative of a <b>compound</b> <b>function</b> has a very complicated form, most of the current observers which were designed for classical nonlinear systems cannot be used to fractional ones directly. With respect to fractional-order linear systems, observers were designed in Refs. [40 – 42]. Up to now, there was only little work that considered the observer design for fractional-order nonlinear systems. In Ref. [36], a sliding mode observer was given based on state estimation. An observer was proposed by using a scalar transmitted signal in Ref. [43]. A fractional observer with non-fragile structure was proposed in Ref. [44], and a fractional-order observer was introduced to cope with second-order multi-agent systems in Ref. [45]. Some other results can be found in Refs. [46 – 49].|$|E
40|$|Image-based {{screening}} {{has become}} a mature field over the past decade, {{largely due to the}} detailed information that can be obtained about compound mode of action by considering the phenotypic effects of test compounds on cellular morphology. However, very few examples exist of extensions of this approach to bacterial targets. We now report the first high-throughput, high-content platform for the prediction of antibiotic modes of action using image-based screening. This approach employs a unique feature segmentation and extraction protocol to quantify key size and shape metrics of bacterial cells over a range of compound concentrations, and matches the trajectories of these metrics to those of training set compounds of known molecular target to predict the test compound's mode of action. This approach has been used to successfully predict the modes of action of a panel of known antibiotics, and has been extended to the evaluation of natural products libraries for the de novo prediction of <b>compound</b> <b>function</b> directly from primary screening data...|$|E
40|$|The sensory {{response}} of a mechanoreceptor is generally {{assumed to be}} a <b>compound</b> <b>function</b> of its mechanical and electrochemical properties. In a muscle receptor such as the mammalian muscle spindle or crayfish stretch receptor, the former depend upon the visco-elastic elements of the receptor muscle and its linkages with the sensory endings, while the latter properties reside within the sensory neurone itself. Analysis of these systems is complicated, however, by the difficulty in defining the precise stimulus obtaining at the site of transduction, and by the possible modifying influence of the impulse encoding process. One approach to the problem of evaluating the contribution of mechanical factors to the sensory response is to compare the experimentally recorded response with that of an appropriate model derived from the known strucuture. The well-defined mor-phology of the crab coxal muscle receptor (Alexandrowicz & Whitear, 1957; Whitear, 1965), together with the absence of regenerative impulses in its afferent nerve fibres (Bush, 1976), makes this an attractive preparation for such an approach.
