50|$|The aircraft's Take-off {{warning system}} horn was not {{heard on the}} CAM channel of the CVR. It is {{possible}} that the take-off <b>configuration</b> <b>warning</b> was not sounding.|$|E
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through {{an altitude of}} 12040 ft, the cabin altitude warning horn sounded. The warning should have prompted the crew to stop climbing, but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off <b>configuration</b> <b>warning,</b> which signals that {{the aircraft}} is not ready for take-off, and can only sound on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} cabin {{altitude}} warning sounded, the captain radioed the Helios operations centre and reported [...] "the take-off <b>configuration</b> <b>warning</b> on" [...] and [...] "cooling equipment normal and alternate off line". He then {{spoke to the}} ground engineer and repeatedly stated that the [...] "cooling ventilation fan lights were off". The engineer (the one who had conducted the pressurization leak check) asked [...] "Can you confirm that the pressurization panel is set to AUTO?" [...] The captain, possibly experiencing {{the onset of the}} initial effects of hypoxia, disregarded the question and instead asked in reply, [...] "Where are my equipment cooling circuit breakers?". This was the last communication with the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Security and {{confidentiality}} of data on computer networks is currently a problem that continues to grow. Installation of firewalls, antivirus, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) / IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and various other security applications often require the best available installation cost is not small. Open source is the best solution to address the security issues that expensive. Intrusion Detection System is a system designed to collect information about the activities in the network, analyzing information, and give a warning. Snort, Bro and Suricata is an open source Intrusion Detection System. By comparing how the installation, <b>configuration,</b> <b>warnings</b> are displayed, and the resulting information can to know {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of snort Snort, Bro and Suricata as Intrusion Detection System. There are two stages of testing, such as scanning and penetration. Phase scanning is a scan of all ports, scanning is done by using NMAP application which is found on Armitage. Stage penetration is done by using the menu hail mary which is contained in Attack tab, hail mary is used to try all the exploits against computer target. Based on Scanning and penetration process, Snort detects 926 alert, Suricata detects 1218 alerts and Bro detects 128 low alerts. Snort and Suricata ease to install and update rule, Bro requires the least amount of resources. ...|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{fatalities}} as {{a result}} of vehicle collisions {{are much more likely to}} happen at night than during day time. Poor visibility due to darkness is believed to be one of the causes for the higher vehicle collision rate at night. Existing studies have shown that night vision enhancement systems (NVES) may improve recognition distance, but may increase driversâ€™ workload. The use of automatic warnings (AW) may help minimize workload, improve performance, and increase safety. In this study, we used a driving simulator to examine performance differences of a NVES with six different <b>configurations</b> of <b>warning</b> cues, including: visual, auditory, tactile, auditory and visual, tactile and visual, and no warning. Older drivers between the ages of 65 and 74 participated in the study. An analysis based on the distance to pedestrian threat at the onset of braking response revealed that tactile and auditory warnings performed the best, while visual warnings performed the worst. When tactile or auditory warnings were presented in combination with visual warning, their effectiveness decreased. This result demonstrated that, contrary to general sense regarding warning systems, multi-modal warnings involving visual cues degraded the effectiveness of NVES for older drivers...|$|R
50|$|A Go2Sky Boeing 737-800 {{on behalf}} of Norwegian Air Shuttle, {{registration}} LN-NII performing flight DY-277 from Kristiansand to Oslo (Norway), entered Kristiansand's runway 04, began to accelerate for takeoff, the crew rejected takeoff at low speed and stopped the aircraft after about 230 meters due to a takeoff <b>configuration</b> <b>warning.</b> The crew mistakenly shut down both engines, which caused all electrics to shut down as well including cabin lighting. The aircraft remained in position for about 5 minutes and at this time the cabin crew walked the aisles to calm passengers. The flight attendants from Norwegian Air Shuttle expected another call by the cockpit crew to take their seats prior to takeoff, however, suddenly the engines accelerated for takeoff and the aircraft departed with the cabin crew rushing to their seats. The aircraft stopped the climb at FL150 (usual cruise level FL260) the crew received a cabin altitude warning and levelled off at low altitude, it was later found the air conditioning systems had not been activated.|$|E
50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off warning horn of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off <b>configuration</b> <b>warning</b> was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff warning horn) was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|E
40|$|Collision warning systems {{work on the}} {{information}} provided by different sensors. Among many factors that can affect the performance of collision warning systems, the effect of sensor errors is investigated. Errors in direct measurements and derivatives are analysed based on typical sensor <b>configurations</b> of collision <b>warning</b> systems, which include a laser speedometer, a Radar/Lidar. Empirical sensor outputs under real traffic situations are used in deriving distributions of measurement errors. The uncertainties of collision warning criteria are then examined based on empirically derived sensor errors for three collision warning algorithms, the Honda, Mazda and NHTSA algorithm. It is found that under some problematic traffic situations and for certain algorithms, the sensor errors could significantly affect the performance of collision warning systems...|$|R
40|$|Numerous new {{flight deck}} <b>configurations</b> for caution, <b>warning,</b> and alerts can be conceived; yet testing them with human-in-the-Ioop {{experiments}} to evaluate each {{one would not}} be practical. New sensors, instruments, and displays are being put into cockpits every day and {{this is particularly true}} as we enter the dawn of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). By modeling pilot behavior in a computer simulation, an unlimited number of unique caution, <b>warning,</b> and alert <b>configurations</b> can be evaluated 24 / 7 by a computer. These computer simulations can then identify the most promising candidate formats to further evaluate in higher fidelity, but more costly, Human-in-the-Ioop (HITL) simulations. Evaluations using batch simulations with human performance models saves time, money, and enables a broader consideration of possible caution, <b>warning,</b> and alerting <b>configurations</b> for future flight decks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} {{approach to}} multi-objective optimization is introduced, using a message-passing algorithm {{to sample the}} Pareto set, i. e. the set of Pareto-non-dominated solutions. Several heuristics are proposed and tested on a simple bi-objective 3 -SAT problem. The first one {{is based on a}} straightforward deformation of the Survey-Propagation (SP) equation to locally encode a Pareto trade-off. A simple heuristic is then tested, which combines an elimination procedure of clauses with the usual decimation of variables used in the SP algorithm, and is able to sample different regions of the Pareto-front. We study in more details the compliance of these deformed equations with basic Belief-Propagation (BP) properties. This first leads to an explicit Markov Random Field (MRF) of valid <b>warning</b> <b>configuration,</b> for which the SP equations are basic BP equations. This observation is then generalized to the multi-objective context. Numerical experiments on artificial problems up to 100000 variables are presented and discussed...|$|R
