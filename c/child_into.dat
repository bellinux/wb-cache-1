Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil.

And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> <b>into</b> their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. This gave an influence to adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.|$|E

As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.|$|E

500|$|Many {{state legislators}} also seemed unsure {{about whether to}} support the Stanley plan. A press poll of the state House Appropriations Committee showed an 8-to-7 split against the plan, with two members undecided. Support for Stanley's plan came almost {{exclusively}} from the Southside and counties around it, the Tidewater counties, and portions of Southwest Virginia. Much {{of the lack of}} support focused on whether the plan would actually pass court muster as well as halt desegregation. [...] Delegate James McIlhany Thomson, an ardent segregationist, said he believed the Stanley plan would not pass without a pupil assignment program. But on August 24, Garland Gray (whose own position had moved rightward) abandoned support for the pupil assignment plan because it permitted limited integration.

500|$|According to {{architectural}} historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large {{stained glass}} windows [...] "are as much {{a feature of the}} church as the mosaics". [...] The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863–1928) and fabricated by J Lamb Studios, his father's firm in New York City, took three years to complete, and eight months to install at Stanford. [...] Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in [...] "the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work". [...] The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest enterprise of its kind at the time, and the project {{is considered one of the}} best examples of Lamb's work. [...] Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as Shields and Doré. [...] Her personal touch is shown in one of the nave windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a <b>child</b> <b>into</b> Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr., the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of typhoid shortly before his 16th birthday.|$|E

She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. I searched all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's <b>Child</b> <b>into</b> solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E
