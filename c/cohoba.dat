50|$|Some of {{the first}} people that Christopher Columbus met in the American {{continent}} were the Taino people. Their 7,000-year-old civilisation did not benefit from pre-colonial contact as many were later enslaved or died of disease. It was noted by early explorers that some of their time the Taino people were using hallucinogenic drugs. The drug and the pipes that were used are called <b>cohoba.</b> It is likely that one of these chiefs used this seat to smoke these drugs.

50|$|Zemí {{was also}} the name the people gave to their {{physical}} representations of the gods, whether objects or drawings. They were made in many forms and materials and {{have been found in}} a variety of settings. The majority of zemís were crafted from wood but stone, bone, shell, pottery, and cotton were also used. Zemí petroglyphs were carved on rocks in streams, ball courts, and on stalagmites in caves. Cemí pictographs were found on secular objects such as pottery, and on tattoos. Yucahú, the god of cassava, was represented with a three-pointed zemí, which could be found in conucos to increase the yield of cassava. Wood and stone zemís have been found in caves in Hispaniola and Jamaica. Cemís are sometimes represented by toads, turtles, fishes, snakes, and various abstract and human-like faces.Some zemís are accompanied by a small table or tray, which is believed to be a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called <b>cohoba,</b> prepared from the beans of a species of Piptadenia tree.

40|$|Shamanism {{was first}} {{described}} {{at the end}} of the seventeenth century. Since then everywhere in the world this phenomenon is mentioned. When we look at the contemporary societies of the South American mainland shamanism is part of their daily life as their world is animated. The function of the shaman is to be a mediator between the society and the spirits, reaching a trance state by using hallucinogenic substances. Not only in South American Tropical Forest societies is this the case, but also in the Siberian Arctic region. Shamanism is not a restricted phenomenon, but a widespread one. Without his tools the shaman can not contact the spirits. Tropical forest shamans use for example maracas, benches, snuffing tubes, snuffing trays and idols. They have their counterparts in the archaeological record where since the migration of the Saladoid and Huecoid peoples into the Caribbean islands shamanistic paraphernalia are found like, three-pointers, rattles, nostril bowls, snuffing tubes, snuff plateaus, and incense burners. These categories were also available among the Taíno as shamanism was also part of their society. Rattles, benches, snuffing tubes, special <b>cohoba</b> vessels, ceremonial pestles, vomiting spatulas, and <b>cohoba</b> stands were used. The egalitarian Saladoid society changed into a stratified society of the Taíno. Shamanism was not restricted anymore to the shaman or behique, but also the cacique used shamanistic paraphernalia and <b>cohoba...</b>|$|E
40|$|In several respects, the {{substituted}} tryptamines {{constitute an}} interesting family of pharmacologically active compounds. Many occur in plant materials which have either {{been associated with}} the preparation of psychotropic snuffs, potions, etc., or are known for their toxic properties. Thus 5 -methoxy-N:N-dimethyltryptamine (5 MeO-DMT), 5 -methoxy-N-methyltryptamine (5 MeO-MT), 5 -hydroxy-N:N-dimethyltryptamine (5 HO-DMT, bufotenine), N:N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and N-methyltryptamine (MT) are all present in Piptadenia peregrina Benth (1 - 4) which has been used in the making of the psychotropic <b>Cohoba</b> snuff by the Central American Indians. 5 Me 0 -DMT is also the main component of the psycho-tropic Epena snuff which contains in addition small amounts of DMT and 5 HO-DMT and is used by the Waica tribes of South America (5). The presence of 5 MeO-DMT has also been shown in Desmodium pulcellum Benth, a plant used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine in India (6) and in the Brazilian plant Dictyoloma incones-cens D. C. (7). 5 Me 0 -MT is present in Phalans arundicea L. (ß) and it is found together with 5 MeO-DMT, 5 HO-DMT and DMT in Phalaris tuberose L.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practices used in Saladoid and Taíno medicine {{with the use}} of historical accounts, specifically from Hispaniola, and uncovers other plants that were employed in medicinal context {{with the use of}} ethnoarchaeology. Taíno traditional medicine was in part practiced by shamans, working with hallucinogenic plants, and in part by housewives, preparing herbal remedies. The shamanistic medicine is described in detail by Spanish chroniclers and was a common feature of Taíno cultures. The plants used in this context were <b>cohoba</b> (Anadenanthera peregrina), a strong kind of tobacco (güeyo), and an energizing and hunger suppressing herb called digo, {{which may or may not}} have been coca (Erythroxylum coca). Hardly anything, however, is accounted on domestic medicine and, therefore, the last chapter applies ethnoarchaeology to modern herbal medicine in the Caribbean, in search of plants of which the use could date back to prehistory. Nine plants that were used by the Ostionoid and Saladoid peoples and are currently employed as medicine in the Caribbean are studied. These are: West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolica), monkey pistol (Hura Crepitans), cf. soursop (Annona muricata), cassava (Manihot esculenta), genip (Melicoccus bijugatus), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), maize (Zea mays), guava (Psidium guajava) and red pepper (Capsicum sp.). The last two have such a widespread and significant use that they were relatively certainly used as medicine as early as prehistory. Another discovery is the identification of a gum used for stomach problems by the Taíno, which was the gum of mesquite, (Prosopis juliflora) ...|$|E
40|$|The cemí (a {{representation}} of a spirit, ancestor or deity) in the collections of the Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico “L. Pigorini” in Rome (henceforth referred to as Pigorini) is a remarkable sculpture attributed to the Caribbean’s early colonial period, its collection history in Europe extending back to at least 1680 (Legati 1680 : 13) (Figure 1). It is a Janus-headed figure – one side human, the other a bat – incorporating a lavish array of indigenous wealth (e. g. over 20 000 shell beads) and exotic trade items woven into a cotton mesh and supported by a domed wooden base (Ostapkowicz, in press; Biscione 1991; 1997; Roe 1997; Vega 1987). Merging European glass beads and mirrors, and, exceptionally, rhinoceros horn, {{it has become an}} icon of the post-colonial Caribbean, embodying the three key foundational strands of modern island culture: indigenous, African and European (Roe 1997 : 165; Sullivan 2006 : 40). Given the calibre of artistry and the masterful incorporation of these new materials, the piece has long been attributed to a brief period of Taíno, Spanish and African interaction: AD 1492 - 1550 (Taíno being an umbrella term for the indigenous people of the Caribbean Greater Antilles; see Curet 2014). Critically, this is prior to the collapse of Taíno traditions in the face of European incursions, slavery, warfare and introduced diseases. It thus encapsulates a fleeting moment in early trans-Atlantic cross-cultural exchange – a meeting of very different worldviews. However, this combination of foreign materials and what has been interpreted as strands of European and African iconography and influence (Roe 1997; Coloni in Biscione 1991 : 78 - 9; Sullivan 2006 : 39 - 40), together with an obscured early collection history, have suggested that the sculpture itself is potentially suspect (Rouse 1992 : 159) : a pastiche that may have been among the items made in Europe for the princely kunstkammer (the precursors to modern museums), “not as forgeries, but to create and present even more attractive and wonderful curiosities” (Scalini 2001 : 129 - 32). Many previous studies have proposed a single function for the sculpture – either as a reliquary or as a platform for the hallucinogenic snuff taken in the <b>cohoba</b> ceremony (Vega 1987 : 19 - 20; Kerchache 1994 : 162; Roe 1997 : 164; Montás et al., 2003 : 47) – although the piece is actually a composite object, with a separate belt beneath the Janus-headed top section, both nailed to a supporting wooden base (Biscione 1997). This combination of two artefacts, nailed to a static frame, is without precedent in the repertoire of Taíno material culture and practice, and seems more in keeping with their display in a Western context. Questions arise, therefore, concerning the possible histories of intervention of this long-term museum survivor. This paper seeks to clarify some of these issues through an investigation of the diverse materials in the objects’ construction, and their varied origins. We also present the first radiocarbon dating of the cotton and wood base, and the taxonomic identification of the wood, to better understand how and when this composite sculpture came together. </p...|$|E
