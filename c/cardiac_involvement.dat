40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work was to study {{the natural history of}} dystrophinopathies and the genotype-phenotype correlations made possible by the development of the clinical part of the French DMD database. The collection of 70, 000  clinical data for 600  patients with an average longitudinal follow-up of 12 years enabled clarification of the natural history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and clinical presentations in symptomatic females. We were able to specify the phenotypic heterogeneity of motor, orthopedic and respiratory involvements (severe, standard and intermediary form), of the cardiac disorder (severe, standard or absent cardiomyopathy, absence of correlation between motor and <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements),</b> and of brain function (mental deficiency in the patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, psychopathological disorders in dystrophinopathies). Phenotypic variability did not correlate with a specific mutational spectrum. We propose a model of phenotypic analysis based on the presence or not of muscular and <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> (described by age at onset and rate of progression) and brain involvement (described by the type and the severity of the cognitive impairment and of the psychological disorders). The methodology developed for the DMD gene can be generalized and used for other databases dedicated to genetic diseases. Application of this model of phenotypic analysis for each patient and further development of the database should contribute substantially to clinical research providing useful tools for future clinical trials...|$|R

Cardiovascular diseases are common in systemic rheumatologic diseases. They can be presented {{at the time of}} diagnosis or after diagnosis. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> can be the first presentation of rheumatologic conditions. It means that a patient with rheumatologic disease may go to a cardiologist when attacked by this disease at first. These manifestations are very different and involve different structures of the heart, and they can cause mortality and morbidity of patients with rheumatologic diseases. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> in these patients vary from subclinical to severe manifestations. They may need aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. The diagnosis of these conditions is very important for choosing the best treatment. Premature atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease are increased in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and may be causes of mortality among them. The aggressive control of systemic inflammation in these diseases can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease especially ischemic heart disease. Although aggressive treatment of primary rheumatologic diseases can decrease mortality rate and improve them, at this time, there are no specific guidelines and recommendations, to include aggressive control and prevention of traditional risk factors, for them. 1...|$|R

25|$|The {{disease was}} first {{reported}} by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a four-year-old {{child with a}} rash and fever at the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later published a report on 50 similar cases. Later, Kawasaki and colleagues were persuaded of definite <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement</b> when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11 (48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an electrocardiogram. In 1974, the first description of this disorder {{was published in the}} English-language literature. In 1976, Melish et al. described the same illness in 16 children in Hawaii. Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic Kawasaki disease.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki disease often {{begins with}} a high and {{persistent}} fever that is not very responsive to normal treatment with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. It is the most prominent symptom in Kawasaki disease, is a characteristic sign of the acute phase of the disease, is normally high (above 39–40°C), is remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability. Recently, it {{is reported to be}} present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease; nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases. The first day of fever is considered the first day of illness, and the duration of fever is on average one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks. Prolonged fever is associated with higher incidence of <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement.</b> It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics. However, when appropriate therapy is started– intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin– the fever is gone after two days.|$|E
40|$|IntroductionSarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> {{in patients with}} sarcoidosis are rare with an estimated prevalence of 7 %. These serious involvements are hard to diagnose at early stage of disease. Patients and MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of patients’ files diagnosed with sarcoidosis in the Internal Medicine Department of Rabta University Hospital in Tunis. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical, paraclinical and histological criteria. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> were confirmed by the electrocardiogram and echocardiography. ResultsCardiac involvement (CI) was found in seven patients among 138 with sarcoidosis (5 %). They were 6 females and one male {{with a mean age}} at diagnosis of 49 years. Electrical disorders such as bundel branch block were seen in two cases. First degree atrioventricular block was noted in two cases. Ventricular hypertrophy was check out in two cases by electrocardiography and ultrasound. Mitral regurgitation with a flutter was noted in one patient and pericardial effusion with a normal ventricular function in another case. Only one patient was clinically symptomatic, he complained of palpitations. Thallium 201 scintigraphy was performed in one case and objectived reversible ischemia of the inferior and latero-inferior walls of myocardium. Other manifestations of sarcoidosis were dominantly associated to CI such as lung disease, which was found in all patients. Skin and neurological involvement were observed, each in three cases. Hepatosplenic involvements were noted in two patients and otorhinolaryngology involvements in one case. All patients received initially high dose of corticosteroids. Four of the patients had a good response to treatment and three were lost to follow up. ConclusionCardiac involvements in sarcoidosis are rare but serious, an early diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroid may rapidly improve patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked {{hereditary}} myopathies {{secondary to}} a dystrophinopathy resulting in progressive cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The most commonly associated <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> {{in these patients}} are dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities; however, {{recent studies have shown}} a high prevalence of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, there is increasing awareness of cardiomyopathy in female heterozygous dystrophinopathy carriers. We report a case series of two dystrophinopathy carriers with the dilated form of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a newly identified association. <Learning objective: Dystrophinopathy carriers can manifest cardiac disease in the form of cardiomyopathy. We present a novel finding of carriers who manifest their cardiomyopathy in the form of left ventricular noncompaction, dilated phenotype. This has been described previously in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. ...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: With {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} Kawasaki disease {{and its associated}} complications, the need of the hour is early diagnosis. Incomplete  Kawasaki is often diagnosed late and is frequently associated with morbidities and mortalities. Our study aims to {{emphasize the importance of}} echocardiography in detection of incomplete Kawasaki disease. Materials & Methods: A total of 150 children, clinically diagnosed as Kawasaki disease were evaluated echocardiographically and involvement of coronary artery and associated <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> were studied. Results: Amongst the incomplete Kawasaki disease patients 76 % were from extremes of ages and 19. 2 % of them had coronary involvement. Myocarditis(38. 1 %) was the commonest non-coronary findings. Conclusion: Atypical Kawasaki disease is more common in extremes of ages and echocardiography helps in detecting atypical disease at the earliest, thus facilitating prompt treatment and reducing complications. </p...|$|R

Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models. Lack of thiamin later in life causes the disease known as beriberi. There are two forms of beriberi: [...] "wet", and [...] "dry". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi. Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent edema and <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement,</b> whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis.

50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement</b> varies and is significantly influenced by race; in Japan more than 25% {{of persons with}} sarcoidosis have symptomatic <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement,</b> whereas in the US and Europe only about 5% of cases present with <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement.</b> Autopsy studies in the US have revealed a {{frequency of}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement</b> of about 20-30%, whereas autopsy studies in Japan have shown a frequency of 60%. The presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis can range from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities to fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Conduction abnormalities {{are the most common}} cardiac manifestations of sarcoidosis in humans and can include complete heart block. Second to conduction abnormalities, in frequency, are ventricular arrhythmias, which occurs in about 23% of persons with <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvement.</b> Sudden cardiac death, either due to ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block is a rare complication of cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis can cause fibrosis, granuloma formation, or the accumulation of fluid in the interstitium of the heart, or a combination of the former two.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> and laboratory findings of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Fars Province, Iran from January 1991 to December 2002.

There was no secondary case in families, none of the patients were related and recurrence of disease was seen in only one patient. Prolonged fever and thrombocytosis were significant risk factors for developing coronary artery disease (p 4 mm) and three patients had aneurysm of coronary artery in their first echocardiography. It has been suggested that a high index of clinical suspicion of KD could improve diagnosis and implementation of preventive treatment.

40|$|Purpose: Heart {{failure is}} the {{ultimate}} complication of <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> in diabetes. The purpose of this review was to summarize current literature on heart failure among people with diabetes mellitus in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Method: Bibliographic search of published data on heart failure and diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 26 years. Results: Heart failure remains largely unexplored in general population and among people with diabetes in Africa. Heart failure accounts for over 30 % of hospital admission in specialized cardiovascular units and 3 %– 7 % in general internal medicine. Over 11 % of adults with heart failure have diabetes. Risk factors for heart failure among those with diabetes include classical cardiovascular risk factors, without evidence of diabetes distinctiveness for other predictors common in Africa. Prevention, management, and outcomes of heart failure are less well known; recent data suggest improvement {{in the management of}} risk factors in clinical settings. Conclusions: Diabetes mellitus is growing in SSA. Related cardiovascular diseases are emerging as potential health problem. Heart failure as cardiovascular complication remains largely unexplored.

Leptospirosis is a disease with a large geographical spreading. The clinical picture varies from undiagnosed, flu-like syndrome to multiorgan involvement forms. Involvement of pericardium during leptospirosis is a rare event but not unknown. Objective: Our aim is to describe a severe case of leptospirosis (Weil's diseases) with prominent liver involvement, complicated with exudative pericarditis. Materials and Methods: A male patient, working as a mechanic, presents with fever, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice, pronounced myalgia and anuria for more than two days. Based on the clinical evidence, laboratory results showing multiorgan involvement and the epidemiological data, the patient was suspected for leptospirosis. Results: Referring to the above mentioned data, the patient was serologically tested with ELISA for leptospirosis, which resulted positive for IgM and IgG in two blood samples. Conclusion: Severe clinical presentations of leptospirosis are not rare and <b>cardiac</b> <b>involvements</b> are not to, but remain underreported in most of the cases.
