40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of different polyol/diisocyanate ratios on the mechanical and physical behaviours of polyurethane based polymers. Design/methodology/approach: Castor oil was mixed, as polyol, to diisocyanate in order to obtain polyurethane based polymers. Besides the ideal stoichiometry, polyol/ diisiocyanate ratio, ratios with excess/lack of diisocyanates were provided. The mechanical behaviour was investigated by uniaxial tests. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo gravimetric Analysis (TGA) were used to investigate the thermal behaviour. The various polymeric structures, obtained by the different ratios, were analysed and compared by Infrared Spectroscopy (IR). Findings: Mechanical performance was increased proportionally to contend of diisocyanate. High levels of diisocyanate have generated elongation decreasing and CO 2 formation during <b>curing,</b> <b>damaging</b> mechanical behaviour due to bubble presence. Analytical experiments have showed important changes on: polymeric structures, glass transition temperatures and behaviour at elevated temperatures. Research limitations/implications: Free acid and water contend were not taken into consideration by defining the ideal stoichiometry. The investigated formulations cannot be direct applied on practical applications; fillers and additives must be added to them, which were not taken in consideration. Practical implications: The obtained results can support development of adhesives, engineering polymers and polymeric matrix for structural composites. Stabling the relation between component ratios to their behaviours is possible to define optimal performance ranges and to avoid excess of diisocyanate on polymers. Originality/value: Deep investigation of PU based material, obtained from renewable natural source (castor oil).

The Polluter Pay Principle (PPP) has since then been touted as a useful environmental management tool that makes provisions for innovative penalties seeking to place the burden of environmental pollution control on those that abuse the environment. Despite such euphoria, the results on the ground have been appalling. In this analysis we question the practical utility of the PPP viz avis the deteriorating environmental fabric of many nations. The analysis reveals that it is cheaper for many individuals, organizations or even countries to pollute the environment and pay a fine than to install systems that require the constant monitoring of the environment.

Relatively poor generic diversity of lignicolous (pathogenic or potentially pathogenic and saprotrophic) macrofungi with only 16 species representing this group (13 basidiomycets: Schizophyllum commune, Fomes fomentarius, Stereum hirsutum, Coriolus versicolor, Flammulina velutipes, Pseudotrametes gibbosa, Ganoderma applanatum, G. lucidum, G. adspersum, Polyporus squamosus, Meripilus giganteus, Laetiporus sulphureus, Auricu­laria auricula-judae, and 3 ascomycets: Nectria cinnabarina, Xylaria hypoxylon, X. poly­morpha) were recorded. Such a poor qualitative composition of this very important fungal group could be explained by the {{reduction in the number of}} plant species in arbored walks and alleys, as well as the reduction in the number of fungi resistant to heavy air pollution caused by nearby (1 - 5 m) fuel combustion in engines. Although only preliminary, our results pointed to the necessity of conservation and protection of the most beautiful features of Banja Luka and its alleys and arbored walks, by undertaking the measures of <b>curing</b> <b>damaged</b> trees and treating them with fungicides in order to wipe out the epiphytia caused in more than 95 % of cases (dated May 2011) by Split-gill (Schizophyllum commune), present on dead wood but also on damaged trees of Aesculus hyppocastaneum (127 trees), Tilia cordata (124 trees), Tilia platyphyllos (36 trees), Tilia argentea (40 trees), Acer negundo (20 trees), Platanus acerifolia (2 trees), Robinia pseudoacacia (3 trees), Fraxinus ornus (1 tree), Betula pendula (1 tree), Catalpa sp. (2 trees), etc. Altogether, during the last decade, around 200 trees collapsed or were sanitary cut in Banja Luka arbored walk from the Malta site to the Green bridge, a total length around 5 km. The reason for this was primarily due to Split-gill fungus and the restoration of arbored walks in the streets extremely polluted by engine fuel consumption in the zone of Mladena Stojanovića street. By analyzing the trees along the City of Banja Luka main street it could be concluded that, besides the appearance of suffocation of plants, due to wide asphalt surfaces that are located immediately next to the tree-trunks and heavy air pollution, fungi caused illnesses are the most important cause of the decline of trees. With its great adaptation to arid climate and ability to resist to the air pollution, Schizophyllum commune turned out to be the most aggressive and successful universal fungal invader of trees from old alleys, even threatening immuno­compromised human individuals.

Thus, reconstitution of immune function on ART could drive incident lung damage in HIV/TB. Methods: We hypothesized that increases in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which can degrade lung matrix, on ART are associated with TB-IRIS among a cohort of advanced, ART naïve, HIV-infected adults with pTB. Furthermore, we related early changes in immune measures and MMPs on ART to lung function in an exploratory subset of patients post-TB cure. This study was nested within a prospective cohort study. Rank sum and chi-square tests, Spearman's correlation coefficient, and logistic regression were used for analyses. Results: Increases in MMP- 8 following ART initiation were independently associated with TB-IRIS (p =  0. 04; adjusted odds ratio 1. 5 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 0 – 2. 1]; n =  32). Increases in CD 4 counts and MMP- 8 on ART were also associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in one-second post-TB treatment completion (r = − 0. 7, p =  0. 006 and r = − 0. 6, p =  0. 02, respectively; n =  14).

Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed {{because there is no}} effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the host-parasite equilibrium to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD 4 (+) T cells and IFN-gamma-producing CD 4 (+) memory cells and the CD 4 (+) T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD 8 (+) memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH 1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG 1 levels and mixed TH 1 /TH 2 cytokine production. Moreover, there were no significant changes in cardiac lesions and subpatent parasitemias. In conclusion, we believe that this study may help in elucidating the necessary elements for a successful therapeutic vaccine which may reduce cardiomyopathy in chronically infected human patients...|$|R
40|$|Most high-efficiency {{concepts}} for silicon {{solar cells}} utilise passivated surfaces and/or novel metallisation approaches. For these devices an anneal step, preferential in forming gas ambient, is beneficial or even crucial. Annealing {{is known to}} activate or improve surface passivation, facilitate metal-silicide formation, improve adhesion of metal contacts and <b>cure</b> potential crystal <b>damage.</b> Challenges for industrial solutions of anneal processes are a precise control of the process atmosphere and temperature, {{as well as a}} high throughput and easy integration into production lines. We present a high capacity inline annealing system that addresses these tasks with a throughput of over 1000 wafers per hour. The gas locks, located at the entrance and exit of the furnace, allow for an effective separation of laboratory and forming gas process ambient, which results in a residual oxygen concentration of a few ppm. Inline annealed silicon solar cells with a thermal oxide passivated rear surface show the same conversion efficiency as reference cells, which are annealed in a single wafer reactor. The specific cost of inline annealing in forming gas is calculated to be below 1. 1 €ct/Wp...|$|R
40|$|Conservationists and {{wildlife}} managers often {{look for the}} silver bullet in dealing with human–wildlife conflicts. While most in this profession would agree there is no silver bullet, {{a great amount of}} financial and scientific emphasis has been placed on the technology of contraceptives for wildlife to appease the victims of damage caused by wildlife and the public at large. With increasing frequency, general public opinion of what should be done to solve wildlife damage oft en weighs heavier than the feelings and perspective of the actual victim. Agriculturists oft en find themselves at odds with general public opinion because agriculturists need the space and resources on their property, leased property, or public lands to maintain a successful business. The general public views wildlife existing on these lands as having nowhere else to go, and laws are passed to ensure their safety and protection from those who would otherwise reduce wildlife population numbers. Unfortunately for the investors and scientists promoting contraceptives as the new <b>cure</b> to wildlife <b>damage</b> problems, they are going to find a staunch opponent in agriculturists worldwide...|$|R
