40|$|This {{contribution}} {{consists of}} a summary of hospital activity related to insertion of <b>coronary</b> <b>endoprostheses</b> (stents) in 2007, along with the changes observed since 2006, arranged by sector and by stent type. Hospital stays involving stents were identified in the nationalPMSI database (information systems medicalisation programme). Frequency of repeat intervention was estimated, with monitoring of hospital admissions of patients operated on {{for the first time}} beetween January 2005 and June 2007. 175, 000 stents were billed in 2007 in France, at a cost of 158 million euros. The public sector is responsible for 54 % of volume and 48 % of billed costs. Drug-elutingstents accounted for 40 % of all implanted stents and 67 % of billed costs. In the 62, 500 hospital stays identified in the public sector(57 % of stays) there was a lower rate of stays with no myocardial infarction and no complication (43 %, compared with 55 % in the private sector) and a lower proportion of drug-eluting stents inserted (34 % compared with 47 %). The mean price of a hospital stay, not including stent cost, is € 4800 in the public sector and € 5053 in the private sector. The repeat intervention rate rises from 11 % at 6 months to 18 % at 24 months. Being female or being between 65 and 74 years old increases the risk of repeat intervention. Practices relating to coronary artery stents {{do not appear to be}} stable, as shown by the rapid decrease in the number of drug-eluting stents inserted after 2006. They also vary by sector, probably because of the different case-mixes involved. Drug-eluting stents represent a significant cost for society...|$|E
40|$|Between March 1991 and June 1994, {{the authors}} treated {{restenosis}} (> or = 50 %) of <b>coronary</b> <b>endoprostheses</b> in 17 men aged 39 to 72 years by balloon angioplasty. The stents had been implanted for de novo stenosis in 14 patients, restenosis in 1 patient and for acute occlusion in 2 patients. The vessels treated were the left anterior descending artery (1 case), the left circumflex artery (2 cases), the right coronary artery (7 cases) and venous bypass grafts (7 cases). The endoprostheses used were 5 Wallstents in 4 patients, 13 Wiktor stents in 11 patients and 2 Palmaz-Schatz in 2 patients. Clinically, the patients with restenosis presented with class II angina (6 patients), class III (8 patients) and class IV (3 patients) of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification. Conventional balloon angioplasty was performed 17 months (range: 3 to 87 months) after stent implantation {{and resulted in}} immediate clinical and angiographic success (residual stenosis < or = 50 % on quantitative analysis) in all patients. In particular, there were no dissections. The minimal lumenal diameter (MLD) and percentage stenosis changed from 1. 04 mm (range: 0. 87 to 1. 20) and 72 % (range: 68 to 76) respectively before stent implantation to 2. 83 mm (range: 2. 46 to 3. 20) and 23 % (range: 20 to 27) after stent implantation. Restenosis resulted in a MLD and percentage stenosis of 0. 89 mm (range: 0. 77 to 1. 01) and 73 % (range: 69 to 78) respectively. After angioplasty of the stent, they returned to 2. 68 mm (range: 2. 29 to 3. 06) and 27 % (range: 23 to 30) respectively. The patients were not anticoagulated after angioplasty.

40|$|International audiencea r t i c l e i n f o Biodegradable and bioassimilable poly((R,S) - 3, 3 dimethylmalic acid) (PDMMLA) {{derivatives}} were synthesized and characterized {{in order}} to develop a new coating for <b>coronary</b> <b>endoprosthesis</b> enabling the reduction of reste-nosis. The PDMMLA was chemically modified to form different custom groups in its side chain. Three side groups were chosen: the hexyl group for its hydrophobic nature, the carboxylic acid and alcohol groups for their acid and neutral hydrophilic character, respectively. The sessile drop method was applied to characterize the wettability of biodegradable polymer film coatings. Surface energy and components were calculated. The van Oss approach helped reach not only the dispersive and polar acid–base components of surface energy but also acid and basic components. Surface topography was quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and subnanometer average values of roughness (Ra) were obtained for all the analyzed surfaces. Thus, roughness was considered to have a negligible effect on wettability measurements. In contrast, heterogeneous surfaces had to be corrected by the Cassie–Baxter equation for copolymers (10 / 90, 20 / 80 and 30 / 70). The impact of this correction was quantified for all the wettability parameters. Very high relative corrections (%) were found, reaching 100 % for energies and 30 % for contact angles...|$|R
40|$|Although cost-containment {{policies}} in Europe are focusing increasingly on medical devices, {{the impact of}} these policies has yet to be fully investigated, particularly in cross-country settings. This paper analyses coverage, procurement, and reimbursement of three inpatient medical devices (<b>coronary</b> stent, knee <b>endoprosthesis</b> and implantable cardioverter defibrillator) in the Italian and Spanish healthcare systems. The research was carried out by reviewing published and grey literature, as well as national and regional legislation; in addition, 19 experts from hospitals and the industry were interviewed. In both countries, there has been a shift in political power from the national to the regional level. At the same time, the content of public coverage has become more explicit. A major issue in both systems is reimbursement, i. e. the rules about funding the delivery of services included in the benefit baskets. The differences in procurement and funding mechanisms create different incentives that may {{have an impact on the}} uptake and diffusion of technologies. These mechanisms, however, can only partially explain organizational and professional behaviour, as the use of technologies in both countries is mainly left to professionals who are exposed to a variety of incentives. There is limited direct and indirect guidance of national and regional authorities over the use of technologies in both countries. It is likely that the difficult search for a balance between introducing innovations, containing costs and assuring equity will require stronger regulatory action in the next future.

40|$|Aim: Analyse {{the two-year}} {{follow-up}} {{of patients who}} had a <b>coronary</b> angioplasty with <b>endoprosthesis</b> in light of a literature review so as to assess its medical and economic effects. Methods: Descriptive, exhaustive and retrospective study of beneficiaries of the general health insurance scheme, living in the PACA region and followed up {{for an average of}} two years after implantation of coronary stents: number of deaths,number of admissions to hospital, sum of reimbursements. Compare the results with a literature study in terms of the benefit/risk/cost ratio. Results: The study concerned 1, 157 patients with bare stent(s) and 1, 130 patients with at least one active stent, aged 68. 2 on average. The main results were an average death rate two years after the operation of 10. 8 % for all patients and 15. 9 % for patients over 70. These accounted {{for more than half of}} the population studied. The average annual expenditure was 8, 907 euros. Within the two years following the operation, we counted 5, 444 hospital admissions after an active stent and 5, 173 after bare stents. Conclusion: Our data was compared to results found in the literature. In several recent international publications, we noted the absence of benefit of percutaneous revascularisation on optimum medical treatment at three years in stable coronaries, with significant excess cost. They cast doubt on the long-term safety of active stents compared with bare stents. Given these facts, it would be important to reassess the benefit/risk/cost ratio of stents, particularly in elderly patients. A revision of stent care conditions should be considered...|$|R
