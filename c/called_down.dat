5|$|In late February, the Japanese forces around Mosigetta withdrew after {{pressure}} from Captain Ted Hutchinson's company in an action {{for which he}} was later awarded the Military Cross. The 61st Battalion, after establishing its headquarters at Mosigetta, continued its advance alongside the 25th Battalion. After the 25th Battalion crossed the Puriata, a patrol from the 61st strove for the Hari where they clashed with a group of between 15 and 20 Japanese holding an entrenched position. Upon establishing contact, the patrol's artillery forward observation officer <b>called</b> <b>down</b> indirect fire from the supporting artillery battery and as the patrol assaulted the position, the Japanese defenders withdrew, leaving six of their dead behind. The position was subsequently revealed to consist of four main pits and 20 other smaller ones. After this engagement the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a brief period due to concerns about its morale {{while the rest of the}} 7th Brigade continued the advance along the Buin road throughout February and into March.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was <b>called</b> <b>down</b> upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E
25|$|Haile Selassie now {{played his}} trump card. The Imperial Guard, {{under the command}} of Ras Getachew Abate, was sent in against the Eritreans. The {{training}} and discipline of this elite force was apparent in the methodical mode of their advance over the open ground. For three hours they struggled to roll up the Italian flank. The X Battalion of the 2nd Eritrean Division was virtually annihilated. In the end, the Italian commander of the unit <b>called</b> <b>down</b> concentrated artillery fire onto his own overrun positions and saved the day.|$|E

25|$|During December 1943 in {{battles in}} eastern Belarus, Saprykin {{and a small}} group of {{soldiers}} from his battalion reportedly repulsed numerous counterattacks of superior German forces. After three days, he reportedly <b>called</b> <b>down</b> artillery on his own position and was believed killed. For his actions Saprykin was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Saprykin was captured by the German troops and sent to a POW camp. After its liberation by British troops, Saprykin emigrated to Canada to avoid imprisonment if he returned to the Soviet Union. After Soviet authorities discovered his survival, Saprykin's Hero of the Soviet Union award was revoked. Saprykin died in Toronto on 24 April 1990. His Hero of the Soviet Union award was posthumously restored on 4 December 1991.|$|E
25|$|Former RUC Special Patrol Group (SPG) officer John Weir {{stated in}} his {{affidavit}} {{that he was}} given submachine guns for the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade {{by a group of}} County Down loyalists <b>called</b> <b>Down</b> Orange Welfare (DOW), a vigilante outfit who were engaged in manufacturing weapons. This group was made up of former and serving members of the security forces. Weir alleged that Officer Breen belonged to this organisation. Weir's information from his affidavit was published in 2003 in the Barron Report which was the findings of an official investigation commissioned by Irish Supreme Court justice Henry Barron into the Ulster Volunteer Force's 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. At the time Weir allegedly met Breen at a DOW meeting, Breen was a chief inspector in Newry.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{previous}} day, British and Indian forces had launched {{an attack on}} 'Stonehenge Ridge', where an Afghan force of about 3,000 men had established themselves {{with a number of}} artillery pieces and machine guns. Under cover of a preliminary bombardment to soften up the Afghan defences, men from the 11th Sikhs had launched the initial assault, however, they were forced to stop their attack when they ran out of ammunition at 08.00 hours, and although a resupply was effected at 10.30 hours, it was not until 14.00 hours that the attack was able to be recommenced. By this time the troops were exposed to the heat of the day; nevertheless, after another barrage was <b>called</b> <b>down,</b> the Sikhs attacked the Afghan line despite the heat and the attack was carried {{to the top of the}} ridge. Upon reaching the escarpment they found that the Afghans had left the battlefield, leaving most of their equipment, artillery and a number of standards. During the assault the British and Indian forces lost 22 killed and 157 wounded, while Afghan losses were estimated at around 200 killed and 400 wounded.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the night, Japanese {{artillery}} {{was very}} active, firing {{down on the}} Australian positions around The Pimple, after which a [...] "banzai attack" [...] was launched early on 7 February. Although repulsed, it enabled the Japanese to maintain a small pocket of resistance on the western tip of the ridge. On the evening of 7 February, Captain Kawakami's 10th Company from the III Battalion, 81st Infantry Regiment, withdrew. Nevertheless, a small Japanese force remained until 9 February when the Australians <b>called</b> <b>down</b> an airstrike upon the position and the defenders withdrew from the feature. One of the Australians, Private Colin Jorgensen, was awarded the Military Medal for charging a Japanese weapon pit and knocking it out of action during the final assault.|$|E

500|$|The {{day began}} with a four-hour {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment and all indications were of an attack in force on 156 Para and 'D' Squadron GPR. At 07:42 the attack started and at 07:50, by now under intense pressure, Brigade headquarters <b>called</b> <b>down</b> artillery fire almost {{on top of their}} own positions which broke up the assault. Attacks continued all morning and a shortage of hand held anti-tank weapons allowed German tanks to safely approach the brigade's positions. The tanks targeted the houses shooting up a room at a time, forcing the defenders out and into trenches dug in the gardens. Both units managed to hold out, however their situation was officially described as [...] "grim". The numbers of British casualties exhausted all available medical supplies and wound dressings. Those wounded who required urgent treatment were now directed to the Schoonoord Hotel, which was in German hands.|$|E
500|$|In the Third Test at Headingley, Macartney became {{only the}} second batsman to score a century before lunch on {{the opening day of}} a Test. The match started poorly for Australia. English captain Arthur Carr won the toss and sent Australia in to bat after a {{thunderstorm}} on the previous day had turned the surface into a sticky wicket; Bardsley was then dismissed by the first ball for a golden duck. Macartney strode to the crease, surveyed the fielding positions and <b>called</b> <b>down</b> the wicket to the bowler Maurice Tate [...] "Let's have it!" [...] He nearly regretted his comment when he edged the ball to Carr at third slip from the fifth ball of the day. It was a difficult chance but the English skipper failed to hold the ball. Macartney was then on two. Within a few minutes, he had regained the initiative for the Australians.|$|E
500|$|The control {{positions}} {{for the main}} armament were located in the spotting tops {{at the head of}} the fore and mainmasts. Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder located at each control position, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was <b>called</b> <b>down</b> to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The range clock integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a backup, two turrets in each ship ('A' and 'Y' in St Vincent) could take over if necessary.|$|E

500|$|In early May, the 11th Battalion {{moved to}} Norieul, where they {{occupied}} a recently captured {{portion of the}} German line. A couple of days later, during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, their position was attacked by German [...] "shock troops". In response to the attack, supporting artillery was <b>called</b> <b>down,</b> and the attack repulsed. The Germans laid down a heavy bombardment in retaliation. An attack was ordered, but the order was rescinded when the senior officer in the forward trench, Major Aubrey Darnell, expressed concerns {{about the state of}} the soldiers in the assault wave. The Germans then put in another attack, which was once again turned back, before the 11th launched a limited counterattack and regained the ground that had been lost. The battalion, having lost 68 men killed, two captured and 140 wounded, was down to a strength of just over 400 men. They were relieved and then moved back to Bapaume, where they received a draft of over 100 reinforcements.|$|E
500|$|Back in Lang Vei, the North Vietnamese {{continued}} to harass the small force of soldiers still {{trapped in the}} command bunker with hand grenades, explosives and bursts of gunfire down the stairwell that led into the bunker. Shortly after 06:00am, the North Vietnamese threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down the stairwell, causing panic amongst the defenders. Then, a voice <b>called</b> <b>down</b> the stairwell in Vietnamese, demanding the American-led forces give up at once. Following a quick discussion with his CIDG soldiers, the South Vietnamese special forces commander led his troops up the stairwell to surrender but were killed by North Vietnamese soldiers, [...] leaving behind their American counterparts. After the South Vietnamese had gone up, there was another short verbal exchange between the Americans in the bunker and the North Vietnamese in English, which was followed by another fire-fight when the Americans refused surrender. At 06:30am, the North Vietnamese successfully blasted a hole on the northern wall, gaining direct access into the command bunker. However, instead of launching a direct attack on the last American stronghold, the North Vietnamese {{continued to}} throw grenades through the wall.|$|E
500|$|By {{the morning}} of 9 June, the supply {{situation}} for Downs' company had become critical and 11th Brigade headquarters decided {{that it would be}} best to evacuate the beach. Up until that point casualties had been relatively light with only four killed and seven wounded, but the Japanese force, which had increased overnight to between 400 and 500 men as reinforcements arrived by barges and trucks from the Buka Passage area, launched a strong attack aimed at destroying the Australian force, attacking from three sides of the perimeter. In order to defend themselves the Australians <b>called</b> <b>down</b> heavy artillery fire from the battery of 25-pounders that was supporting them from its position on the Soraken peninsula. As the fighting intensified, some of the artillery shells were brought down as close as [...] from their own troops. Air support was also called in, with 16 RAAF Boomerangs and Royal New Zealand Air Force Corsairs attacking Japanese positions around the perimeter. As a result of these attacks, the Australians were able to hold off the Japanese attacks until 4:30pm when three assault landing craft arrived from Soraken to take them off the beach, and ferry them out to two larger vessels that were waiting further out to sea.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships of}} the King George V class {{were some of}} the first battleships in the RN to receive the full suite of fire-control {{equipment}} used during the First World War. The control position for the main armament was located in the conning tower. Data from a [...] coincidence rangefinder (an unstabilized Barr and Stroud instrument in [...] and stabilized Argo units in the other ships) {{on the roof of the}} conning tower, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to a Dreyer Fire-control Table (a Mark III system in King George V and Mark II Tables in the others with an Argo range clock replacing the Dreyer-Elphinstone model in the Mark III) located in the transmitting station located on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was <b>called</b> <b>down</b> to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The fire-control table integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns.

500|$|Leane himself, observing German trench-mortar fire, and suspecting {{that they}} were {{registering}} targets for a bombardment, ensured his battalion {{was ready for the}} impending battle, and sent out night patrols that detected large concentrations of German troops on a road only [...] beyond the embankment. Gellibrand ordered Lewis gun teams to be sent out to open fire on the assembling Germans, and <b>called</b> <b>down</b> artillery on the S.O.S. lines forward of the embankment. He also brought the 45th Battalion up to dig in on the high ground near Leane's headquarters. At 07:00, a heavy German bombardment came down, at first on rear areas of the 4th Division and its flanking formations, extending to the front line and supports about 08:00. Leane later observed that the barrage was [...] "the heaviest since Pozières". No attack immediately materialised on the 48th Battalion's front, although large parties of Germans began advancing after an hour of the barrage descending on the frontline. In stiff fighting, the Germans were repulsed on the 48th Battalion's front. Although Leane had twice been ordered to disband the battalion scout platoon under a new standard battalion structure brought into force in 1917, he had only recently done so, and only in a formal sense. Instead, whenever the battalion went into action, a similar number of designated scouts immediately reported to him, and he posted them at various locations to keep him informed of events.|$|E
500|$|After {{awakening}} at 8:31 UTC, {{the crew}} {{set to work}} preparing to release Hubble from the payload bay of Atlantis. Using the shuttle's robotic arm, McArthur grappled Hubble at 10:45 UTC, and lifted {{it out of the}} orbiter's payload bay to prepare for the release. Good and Massimino were standing by ready to perform a spacewalk in the event that something went wrong during the telescope's deployment. After working through the checklist to prepare the telescope for release, managers on the ground gave the go to Altman to release Hubble, and at 12:57 UTC, McArthur successfully released the telescope as the vehicles flew over Africa. Performing a small separation burn, Johnson backed the orbiter away from the telescope, and Altman <b>called</b> <b>down</b> to managers on the ground confirming the deployment of Hubble. Commending the crew, Altman said [...] "And Houston, Hubble has been released, it's safely back on its journey of exploration as we begin steps to conclude ours. Not everything went as we planned, but we planned a way to work around everything and with the whole team pulling together... we've been able to do some incredible things. And now Hubble can continue on its own, exploring the cosmos, and bringing it home to us as we head for home in a few days. Thank you." [...] Hubble's new equipment and upgraded systems would be tested for several months prior to resuming operation, but if all tests are successful, operation of the telescope would resume in early September.|$|E
