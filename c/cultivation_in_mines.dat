40|$|Bad {{policies}} (i. e., policies {{harmful to}} private producers such as excessive taxation, arbitrary confiscation, and negligence of pubic goods) are observed {{in quite a}} few countries. These countries tend to have autocratic regimes. A reason why bad policies may benefit autocrats is explored. A model economy is explored where the autocrat manages his production (e. g., military exploits, plantation <b>cultivation,</b> <b>mining)</b> <b>in</b> addition to setting policies for the private producers.

40|$|One of {{the major}} ways to develop {{policies}} and guidelines for sustainable use of wetlands is through {{a better understanding of}} their traditional uses. This is because traditional management systems are based on indigenous knowledge and practices passed on from generation to generation. These ideas are the ones that need to be promoted and applied during wetland management planning, as there is consequently a need to test a variety of potential use options for wetlands. Studies conducted in Busia and Rakai districts, revealed that in the 1940 s <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> wetlands, sand <b>mining</b> and use of papyrus, ranked lowest (1 score), while the traditional use of wetlands for water, hunting, grazing and fishing ranked highest (5 scores). This suggests that these traditional uses were sustainable under low population densities and had regulatory systems, a situation which changed in the 1990 s with cultivation, papyrus use and sand mining ranking highest, while hunting steadily declined. There are some changes in climate as a result of wetland use and conversion due to increased population. The study suggests that indigenous knowledge provides the best management options to the continued use of wetlands especially those that provide at least one known essential good, service, or attribute where alternatives are not practically or economically viable. Strategies for proper management planning for wetlands intended for use have been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Bad {{policies}} (i. e., policies {{harmful to}} private producers such as excessive taxation, arbitrary confiscation, and negligence of pubic goods) are observed {{in quite a}} few countries. These countries tend to have autocratic regimes. I explore a reason why bad policies may benefit autocrats. I present a model economy where the autocrat manages his production (e. g., military exploits, plantation <b>cultivation,</b> <b>mining)</b> <b>in</b> addition to setting policies for the private producers. The autocrat has an incentive to repress the income level of private producers: it reduces the wage rate that he must offer to his workers and thereby increases the surplus from his production. Thus the autocrat chooses a tax rate that {{is higher than the}} revenue-maximizing rate: it lies on the backward-bending part of the Laffer curve. He may also choose to lower the productivity of private producers through confiscation, neglect of public goods, and other non-tax policies. I argue that the story is helpful in understanding bad policies present in militaristic regimes of the Ottoman and Mughal empires, Trujillo's regime in the plantation- based economy of the Dominican Republic, and Mobutu's regime in mineral- rich Zaire.
