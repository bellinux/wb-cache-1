This paper {{studies the}} {{impacts on the}} {{particle}} {{size and shape of}} silica sands by roasting times and different methods of cooling, which finds out that different methods of cooling may lead to different cooling rates of sands; that is, adopt water-cooled fluidized bed to cool down sands, the cooling rate is the highest; the secondary is by <b>cooling</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and common fluidized bed leads to the lowest cooling rate. After being roasted and cooled, no matter which method is adopted, the sands are not changed obviously in particle size and shape, which indicates that roasting times, different cooling methods and cooling rates have no obvious impacts on the particle size and shape of silica sands...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{heat flow}} data, {{obtained}} with a Lister-type probe, {{consists of two}} temperature decay curves, frictional and heat pulse decay. Both follow the same physical model of a <b>cooling</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The mathematical model describing the decays is non-linear as to the thermal sediment parameters thus a direct inversion is not possible. To overcome this difficulty, the model equations are expanded using a first-orderTaylor series. The linearised model equations are used in an iterative scheme to invert the temperature decay for undisturbed temperature and thermal conductivity of the sediment. The inversion scheme is tested first for its theoretical limitations using synthetic data. Inversion of heat flow measurements obtained during a cruise of R/V SONNE in 1996 and needle probe measurements in material of known thermal conductivity show that the algorithm is robust and gives reliable results.

40|$|A {{study was}} made to reduce exhaust {{emissions}} and fuel consumption of a general aviation aircraft piston engine by applying known technology. Fourteen promising concepts such as stratified charge combustion chambers, <b>cooling</b> <b>cylinder</b> head improvements, and ignition system changes were evaluated for emission reduction and cost effectiveness. A combination of three concepts, improved fuel injection system, improved cylinder head with exhaust port liners and exhaust air injection was projected as the most cost effective and safe means of meeting the EPA standards for CO, HC and NO. The fuel economy improvement of 4. 6 % over a typical single engine aircraft flight profile does not though justify the added cost of the three concepts, and significant reductions in fuel consumption must {{be applied to the}} cruise mode where most of the fuel is used. The use of exhaust air injection in combination with exhaust port liners reduces exhaust valve stem temperatures which can result in longer valve guide life. The use of exhaust port liners alone can reduce engine cooling air requirements by 11 % which is the equivalent of a 1. 5 % increase in propulsive power. The EPA standards for CO, HC and NO can be met in the IO- 520 engine using air injection alone or the Simmonds improved fuel injection system...|$|E

Glassmaskinen kyler och blandar glassmassan till rätt temperatur och konsistens innan glassen kan serveras. Oceanpower är ett kinesiskt företag som bland annat utvecklar och tillverkar glassmaskiner. Ett nytt konstruktionsförslag har tagits fram för dörren som försluter kylcylindern på deras hårdglassmaskin OPH 42. Genom studiebesök och egna {{analyser}} har förbättringsmöjligheter kunnat lokaliseras hos den befintliga förslutningsdörren. Dessa har främst varit kopplade till hygienen och den dagliga rengörningen av maskinen. En mängd olika koncept för en ny konstruktion av dörren togs fram och utvärderades mot en kravspecifikation. Konceptet som valdes som det mest passande byggde på att ett munstycke monteras på förslutningsdörren med hjälp av en bajonettlåsning vilket kan lossas varje gång glassmaskinen skall rengöras. Således kan det gallerförsedda munstycket diskas för hand eller i maskin istället för att gallret rengörs på plats på maskinen. Förslutningsdörren som tidigare var fäst på maskinfronten med en fast led på ena sidan konstruerades om så att rotationsleden kunde glida i ett spår. Detta gör att dörren kan tryckas på plats rakt framifrån och på så sätt minska belastningen på den gummipackning som tätar förslutningsdörren. Dörren spänns åt med två handtag på var sida för att sprida trycket på packningen. When the gelato sold in {{ice cream}} {{bars and restaurants}} is manufactured, an ice cream machine is used.

Oceanpower is a Chinese company that, among other things, develops and manufactures ice cream machines. A new design proposal to the door that seals the <b>cooling</b> <b>cylinder</b> on their ice cream machine OPH 42 has been developed. Through interviews, visits and analysis of the ice cream machine has opportunities for improvement been localized in the existing sealing door. These have mainly been linked to hygiene and the daily cleaning of the machine. A variety of concepts for a new design of the door was developed and evaluated against a set of requirements. The concept that was chosen as the most fitting was based on a nozzle mounted on the sealing door with a bayonet lock which can be released each time the ice cream machine should be cleaned. Accordingly, the nozzle can be washed by hand or machine instead of that the grill must be cleaned in place on the machine. The sealing door which was previously attached to the machine front with a fixed point on one side was reconstructed so that the rotation point could slip in a groove. This means that the door can be pushed into place from the front, thus reducing the load on the rubber gasket that seals the door. The door is clamped by two handles on each side to spread the pressure on the gasket...|$|E

It is found that for some values of the viscoelastic parameter and some negative values of the mixed convection parameter (opposing flow) the boundary layer separates from the cylinder. Heating the cylinder delays separation and can, if the cylinder is warm enough, suppress the separation completely.
