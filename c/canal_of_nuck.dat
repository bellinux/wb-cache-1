50|$|There is {{a smooth}} oval {{swelling}} near the spermatic cord which {{is liable to}} be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. The swelling moves downwards and becomes less mobile if the testis is pulled gently downwards. Rarely, a hydrocoele develops in a remnant of the processus vaginalis somewhere along {{the course of the}} spermatic cord. This hydrocoele also transilluminates, and is known as an encysted hydrocoele of the cord. In females, a related region in females, a multicystic hydrocoele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> sometimes presents as a swelling in the groin. It probably results from cystic degeneration of the round ligament. Unlike a hydrocele of the cord, a hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> is always at least partially within the inguinal canal.|$|E
50|$|In males, it {{precedes the}} testes in their descent down within the gubernaculum, and closes. This closure (also called fusion) occurs {{at any point}} from {{a few weeks before}} birth, to a few weeks after birth. The {{remaining}} portion around the testes becomes the tunica vaginalis. If it does not close in females, it forms the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck,</b> first {{described}} by Anton Nuck (de) in 1691, is an abnormal patent (open) pouch of peritoneum extending into the labia majora of women. It {{is analogous to}} a patent processus vaginalis in males (see hydrocele, inguinal hernia). In rare cases, it may {{give rise to a}} cyst or a hydrocele in women. The pouch accompanies the gubernaculum during development of the urinary and reproductive organs, more specifically during the descent of the ovaries, and normally obliterates.|$|E

50|$|In {{the anatomy}} of the female {{reproductive}} system, the cervical canal (also called the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> the cervix, endocervical <b>canal,</b> cervical <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> uterus, or the cavity of cervix) is the spindle-shaped, flattened <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> the cervix, {{the neck of the}} uterus.|$|R
50|$|Just {{as in the}} male, {{there is}} a gubernaculum in the female, which effects a {{considerable}} change {{in the position of}} the ovary, though not so extensive a change as in that of the testis. The gubernaculum in the female lies in contact with the fundus of the uterus and adheres to this organ, and thus the ovary can only descend as far as to this level. The part of the gubernaculum between the ovary and the uterus ultimately becomes the proper ovarian ligament, while the part between the uterus and the labium majus forms the round ligament of the uterus. A pouch of peritoneum analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male accompanies it along the inguinal canal: it is called the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck.</b>|$|E

40|$|NUCKS 1 is a 27 kD vertebrate-specific protein, with {{a role in}} the DNA damage response. Here, we {{show that}} after 4 Gy total-body X-irradiation, Trp 53 +/- Nucks 1 +/- mice more rapidly {{developed}} tumors, particularly thymic lymphoma (TL), than Trp 53 +/- mice. TLs in both cohorts showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Trp 53 + allele in essentially all cases. In contrast, LOH <b>of</b> the <b>Nucks</b> 1 + allele was rare. Nucks 1 expression correlated well with Nucks 1 gene dosage in normal thymi, but was increased in the majority of TLs from Trp 53 +/- Nucks 1 +/- mice, suggesting that elevated Nucks 1 message may be associated with progression towards malignancy in vivo. Trp 53 +/- Nucks 1 +/- mice frequently succumbed to CD 4 - CD 8 - TLs harboring translocations involving Igh but not Tcra/d, indicating TLs in Trp 53 +/- Nucks 1 +/- mice mostly originated prior to the double positive stage and at earlier lineage than TLs in Trp 53 +/- mice. Monoclonal rearrangements at Tcrb were more prevalent in TLs from Trp 53 +/- Nucks 1 +/- mice, as was infiltration of primary TL cells to distant organs (liver, kidney and spleen). We propose that, in the context of Trp 53 deficiency, wild type levels <b>of</b> <b>Nucks</b> 1 are required to suppress radiation-induced TL, likely through the role of the NUCKS 1 protein in the DNA damage response...|$|R

30|$|Clinically, a {{hydrocele}} of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> {{can appear}} {{either as a}} painless or a moderately painful fluctuant inguinal mass, with no accompanying nausea or vomiting; therefore, {{it is not easy}} to diagnose this entity on clinical findings alone. These masses are not reducible and, if large enough, can be transilluminated. When the peritoneal evagination remains completely patent, it forms an avenue for an indirect inguinal hernia. Partial proximal obliteration, which leaves the distal portion of the processus vaginalis open, creates the anatomic prerequisite for a hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> [4 – 6]. In adults, a hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> should be first treated by surgical excision of the mass without puncturing it.

30|$|A {{hydrocele}} of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> is {{the female}} {{equivalent of a}} spermatic cord hydrocele in males; thus, this entity is called the “female hydrocele” [1, 2]. The processus vaginalis arises as an evagination of the parietal peritoneum. The seventeenth-century Dutch anatomist Anton Nuck described the processus vaginalis peritonei in the inguinal canal of a female and named it the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> [1]. During embryogenesis, the processus vaginalis accompanies the round ligament or testis as it passes through the inguinal canal into the labium majus or scrotum, respectively [3]. The <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> normally undergoes complete obliteration {{during the first year}} of life, and its failure to do so may result in an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele. While preoperative diagnosis of this type of inguinal region hydrocele is important, the diagnosis of a hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> is seldom made based on clinical findings alone [1]. In addition, this entity is unfamiliar to physicians, which is not mentioned enough in comprehensive surgical and gynecologic textbooks [2, 4, 5].|$|E
40|$|The <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> is {{analogous}} to a patent processus vaginalis in a male, which normally loses its communication to the peritoneal cavity within {{the first year of}} life. Failure of obliteration of this tract can result in a hydrocele. We present a rare case of a 2 -year-old girl with left-sided groin swelling, diagnosed as inguinal hernia.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> is a rarely {{encountered}} entity. We {{report a}} case underwent laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) {{treatment for a}} hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> extending in the extraperitoneal space mainly. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 37 -year-old woman complained of painless and reducible swelling in her left groin, and referred to our hospital for surgical management against left inguinal hernia with the incarcerated ovary. Ultrasonography and MR images revealed a cystic mass in the retroperitoneal space, and we diagnosed as an unusual type of hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck.</b> The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic treatment. Laparoscopic findings on pneumoperitoneum showed an extraperitoneal cystic tumor with no contact with the left ovary. The fascia and peritoneum of the port site were closed, and then an extraperitoneal space was created. The cystic tumor with the round ligament of the uterus was dissected and resected by the TEP technique. The extended deep inguinal ring was repaired with polypropylene mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful. DISCUSSION: Hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck</b> in the adult female is a rare condition. The accurate diagnosis of an inguinal hydrocele in a female is seldom made. Laparoscopic examination provides surgeons with information of inguinal swelling accompanied with retroperitoneal cyst, and consecutive treatment by laparoscopic technique, especially TEP, is useful in regard to minimal damage of the peritoneum. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic diagnosis and TEP treatment offers a useful alternative in selected patients with hydrocele of the <b>canal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuck...</b>|$|E
