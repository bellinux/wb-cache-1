40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} a business <b>case</b> <b>framework</b> that can guide clinical nurse specialists (CNS) in clinical intervention development. Background: Increased emphasis on cost-effective interventions in healthcare requires skills in analyzing the need to make the business case, especially for resource-intensive interventions. This framework assists the CNS to anticipate resource use and then consider if the intervention makes good business sense. Business Case Framework: We describe a business <b>case</b> <b>framework</b> that can assist the CNS to fully explore the problem and determine if developing an intervention is a good investment. We describe several analyses that facilitate making the business case to include the following: problem identification and alignment with strategic priorities, needs assessment, stakeholder analysis, market analysis, intervention implementation planning, financial analysis, and outcome evaluation. The findings from these analyses can be used to develop a formal proposal to present to hospital leaders in a position to make decisions. By aligning intervention planning with organizational priorities and engaging patients in the process, interventions will be more likely to be implemented in practice and produce robust outcomes. Conclusion: The business <b>case</b> <b>framework</b> can be used to justify to organization decision makers the need to invest resources in new interventions that will make a difference for quality outcomes as well as the financial bottom line. This framework can be used to plan interventions that align with organizational strategic priorities, plan for associated costs and benefits, and outcome evaluation. Implications for CNS Practice: Clinical nurse specialists are well positioned to lead clinical intervention projects that will improve the quality of patient care and be cost-effective. To do so requires skill development in making the business case...|$|E

40|$|Compressive {{spectrum}} sensing techniques present many advantages over traditional {{spectrum sensing}} approaches, e. g., low sampling rate, and reduced energy consumption. However, when the spectral sparsity level is unknown, {{there are two}} significant challenges. They are: 1) how to choose an appropriate number of measurements, and 2) when to terminate the greedy recovery algorithm. In this paper, a compressive autonomous sensing (<b>CASe)</b> <b>framework</b> is presented that gradually acquires the wideband signal using sub-Nyquist rate. Further, a sparsity-aware recovery algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the full spectrum while solving the problem of under-fitting or over-fitting.

40|$|Abstract — Least-squares state estimators {{present an}} alterna-tive to Luenberger {{observers}} and yield an exact (deadbeat) {{estimate of the}} state vector of a dynamic system as an optimal solution to a least-squares problem in some vector or functional space. Sensitivity of these estimators to structured uncertainty in the system matrix of the plant is studied in a common for continuous and discrete <b>case</b> <b>framework</b> using the Fréchet derivative. It is shown that the state estimation error caused by the plant model mismatch {{is proportional to the}} Fréchet derivative of the symbol of the parametrization operator used for the estimator implementation, evaluated for the nominal value of the system matrix. For the special case of state estimation in a single-tone continuous oscillator, the crucial impact of the parametrization operator choice on the observer sensitivity to plant model uncertainty is investigated in detail.

As recently shown, this problem is generically NP hard both {{in the number of}} data points and the number of inputs to the non-linearity. Our main result shows that a computationally attractive relaxation can be obtained by recasting the problem as a rank-constrained semi-definite optimization and using existing tools specifically tailored to this type of problems.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{computer}} supported outbreak detection, {{a statistical}} method {{is applied to}} a collection of cases to detect any excess cases for a particular disease. Whether a detected aberration is a true outbreak is decided by a human expert. We present a technical framework designed and implemented at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control for computer supported outbreak detection, where a database of case reports for {{a large number of}} infectious diseases can be processed using one or more statistical methods selected by the user. Results Based on case information, such as diagnosis and date, different statistical algorithms for detecting outbreaks can be applied, both on the disease level and the subtype level. The parameter settings for the algorithms can be configured independently for different diagnoses using the provided graphical interface. Input generators and output parsers are also provided for all supported algorithms. If an outbreak signal is detected, an email notification is sent to the persons listed as receivers for that particular disease. Conclusions The framework is available as open source software, licensed under GNU General Public License Version 3.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the potential for}} developing a sustainability assessment process that not only documents change in an accessible way, but also inspires people to take action. It explores the dynamics of change in democratic systems and the role that storytelling might play in these processes of change. The chosen action research framework follows the stages of designing a sustainability assessment process, trialling it, presenting the findings and reflecting on {{the usefulness of the}} process. Reflecting my participatory paradigm and epistemology, my personal reflections and creative expressions have also been included. The impetus for this thesis emerged from research into formulating a Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems (<b>CASE)</b> <b>framework</b> and vision, and the desire to investigate a tool that might assist in moving urban systems in that direction. The <b>CASE</b> <b>framework</b> was developed from examining those patterns in structure and processes evident in sustainable ecosystems and social-ecological systems. The lens used was a systems-based approach, that is, an approach which focuses on relationships and interactions rather than on individual parts. My reading on sustainability assessment and the dynamics of change led me to choose a story-based technique, the Most Significant Change technique, and I applied this to Perth. Using the <b>CASE</b> <b>framework,</b> interviewees were selected who were involved in sustainability-related programs, initiatives or projects. In face-to-face, phone or written interviews, I asked them to identify the most significant changes they had noticed or contributed to through their work. Some extra questions on perceived lessons and personal influences were also included. Following the collection of the most significant changes, these changes were analysed using the CASE criteria and the idea of leverage points - places in the system where a small change can produce a larger effect. The lessons that interviewees shared were also analysed. For Perth, the most common change identified across the system was a shift in consciousness and greater awareness of climate change, which could be regarded as a high­ level leverage point change. Yet the depth of the paradigm shift at this stage is limited - reflection is generally lacking on deeper questions of what sustains us, {{what it means to be}} human and the goals of the system. Furthermore, the literature and reflections from interviewees on behaviour change indicate that a paradigm shift alone will not be enough. Programs to shift the dominant paradigm need to go hand in hand with pushes to change the goals, structures and processes of the system as well as individual behaviour. There is some evidence that this is happening. Networks and partnerships are gaining ground too, which bodes well for organisational learning and adaptive action across the urban system. New deliberative governance structures and processes are emerging. Infrastructure projects that include sustainability features - even though not necessarily cutting edge - are growing, along with demonstration projects. Behaviour change programs across the community and business sectors are being conducted. Storytelling is being used as a tool for sharing insights and promoting personal change. The lessons shared by interviewees were grouped into the following categories: the concept of sustainability, the engagement of people, behaviour change, the mplementation of institutional change, collaborative practice, reflective practice and personal sustainability. They included the need to navigate carefully from vision to implementation, the importance of building strong relationships, the power of dialogue and stories, the importance of initial research in designing effective programs, the way that positive action and demonstration can lead to further and deeper changes in people's lives, the importance of listening in reflective practice, and the importance of positive action to sustain hope. A story-based assessment approach has potential, not as a substitute for indicator-based approaches, but as a complement to provide greater accessibility and, perhaps, a more effective stimulus for change. Stories which have a personal element are more memorable and engaging, as are those storytellers who speak from the heart and really reveal something of themselves and the passion that drives them. The wisdom and wealth of knowledge that people shared through their lessons emerged as an important basis for collective learning. The sharing of significant changes, as well as lessons and personal visions, might drive faster change in the system if these could be communicated on a regular and integrated basis. The inner journey this PhD has taken me on has opened up the world of mindfulness and mindfulness practice. I now see it as a key part of transforming our relationships with ourselves and the world and, thus, in transforming the way we live our lives.

40|$|Dependability {{cases are}} {{a concept that}} has {{primarily}} emerged from safety cases. A dependability case constitutes a clear, defensible, and traceable argument that a system is acceptably dependable to operate in a given operational context. This includes any requirements that are crucial to the stakeholders ’ envisioned system operation. A dependability case {{can be thought of}} as a driver communicating assurance about the various facets of a system’s operation. The importance of assuring the achievement of dependability attributes is readily apparent in many examples of systems and in specific System of Systems – a class of systems that exhibits a combination of characteristics such as, complexity, autonomy and geographic dispersion. Establishing a dependability case is not a monolithic process, but involves a number of processes and concepts that contribute in overcoming a number of challenges. These include elicitation and apportionment of dependability requirements, resolution of conflicts between dependability attributes and evolution of case. In this paper we present a dependability <b>case</b> <b>framework.</b> The framework includes three processes that have been proposed to overcome the stated challenges, and it can constitute the basis for further additions on the concept. The concept of dependability cases is supported by two pylons. Description of concepts used and their associations (static representation) and definition of the processes that contribute to the construction of the dependability case. The static representation of the framework is defined in a (domain specific) metamodel. Furthermore the processes that participate in the evolution of the dependability case are described along with their prerequisites and contributions to the dependability case...|$|E
