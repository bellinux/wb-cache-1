30|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> in the line spectrum frequency (LSF) domain. LSF parameters are the popular speech features encoded in the bit stream for low bit-rate speech transmission. A method of <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> compensation in LSF domain is of interest for robust speech recognition on mobile communication and Internet systems. If the bit error rate in the transmission of digital encoded speech is negligibly low, the channel distortion comes mainly from the microphone or the handset. When the speech signal is represented {{in terms of the}} phase of inverse filter derived from LP analysis, this channel distortion can be expressed in terms of the channel phase. Further derivation shows that the mean subtraction performed on the phase of inverse filter can minimize the <b>channel</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on this finding, an iterative algorithm is proposed to remove the bias on LSFs due to <b>channel</b> <b>effect.</b> The experiments on the simulated channel distorted speech and the real telephone speech are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of cepstral mean normalization (CMN) in using cepstral coefficients.|$|R

Indeed the effect of high-κ dielectric on Field Induced Barrier Lowering (FIBL) has been studied. Due to the higher electron mobility in tensile strained silicon, the n-type FETs with strained silicon channel have better drain current compare with the pure Si one. In this structure gate dielectric divided in two parts, we have used high-κ dielectric near the source and low-κ dielectric near the drain to reduce the short <b>channel</b> <b>effects.</b> By this structure short <b>channel</b> <b>effects</b> such as FIBL will be reduced indeed by increasing the RSiGe, ID-VD characteristics will be improved.
