5|$|French <b>civilian</b> administrators {{struggled}} with the military leaders, and the two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without <b>civilian</b> oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a <b>civilian</b> governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E

Of these, 70 were civilians and 55 were {{military}} personnel, many of them who worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy. The Army lost 47 <b>civilian</b> employees, six <b>civilian</b> contractors, and 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six <b>civilian</b> employees, three <b>civilian</b> contractors, and 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) <b>civilian</b> employees were also among the dead in the attack, as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) contractor. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon.|$|E
25|$|The {{parties may}} not use <b>civilians</b> to shield {{military}} targets from attack or to shield military operations including retreats.

5|$|Thơ's <b>civilian</b> {{government}} {{was plagued by}} infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Tôn Thất Đính in both the <b>civilian</b> cabinet and the MRC paralysed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the <b>civilian</b> government, but {{as members of the}} MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Thơ gave an order in the <b>civilian</b> hierarchy with which the generals disagreed, they would go to the MRC and countermand it.|$|E
50|$|The Afghanistan Rights Monitor(ARM), a Kabul-based rights watchdog, {{estimated}} that in 2008 about 3,917 <b>civilians</b> were killed, over 6,800 were wounded, and around 120,000 were {{forced out of}} their homes.

Out of these, 680 Afghan <b>civilians</b> killed in air strikes by the US-led forces, with U.S. combat aircraft conducting at least 15,000 close air support missions over the year.

5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide <b>civilian</b> oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective <b>civilian</b> oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide <b>civilian</b> oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist <b>civilian</b> control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

Han Chinese <b>civilians</b> and Mongol <b>civilians</b> were banned from settling in Manchuria. Han <b>civilians</b> and Mongol <b>civilians</b> were banned from crossing into each other's lands.

All international <b>civilian</b> aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers.
