40|$|An {{eighteen}} {{year old}} female patient presented with pitted scars over her face, back and flexures, associated with discrete comedones over her trunk, face and extremities of 5 years duration. There was history of similar lesions {{in her mother}} since her adolescence. Examination of mother and daughter revealed reticulate flexural hyperpigmentation over neck, axillae, <b>cubital</b> and popliteal <b>fossae</b> {{in addition to the}} above mentioned findings. A few cystic lesions were also present on the back and flexures. Dowling-Degos disease in mother and daughter is reported for its rarity and also for some additional features present in these patients, i. e., multiple comedones on the back and extremities in addition to the flexures and also extensive acneiform scarring all over the face in contrast to perioral pitted scars reported in earlier cases...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} seven {{patients}} (151 males and 56 females) were patch tested with {{a battery of}} plants, potassium dichromate and formaldehyde. Sensitivity to Parthenium hysterophorus. Nerium indicum, Calotropis procera, Eucalyptus sp and Mangifera indica was found in 60. 87, 23. 64, 15. 46 andl 2. 08 % patients respectively. One hundred and twenty six patients (92 males and 34 females) including five teenage girls and one 13 years old child had parthenium dermatitis. Majority (74. 60 %) were between 30 to 59 years of age. Dermatitis involving face especially eyelids, neck, <b>cubital</b> and popliteal <b>fossae</b> was the common (82. 54 %) mode of presentation. Photosensitive pattern was seen in 9. 51 % and chronic lichenification of extremities in the remaining 7. 97 % patients Parthenium dermatitis was seen more frequently in city dwellers, while farmers constituted only 20. 7 % of all cases. There was frequent patch test positivity to potassium dichromate (24. i 5 %) and formaline (28. 02 %) in the present patients...|$|R
50|$|The <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> is {{clinically}} {{important for}} venepuncture and for blood pressure measurement.|$|E
50|$|The bicipitoradial bursa {{is one of}} the two bursae in the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> {{the other}} being the {{interosseous}} bursa.|$|E
50|$|The {{brachial artery}} {{continues}} to the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> in the anterior compartment of the arm. It travels {{in a plane}} between the biceps and triceps muscles, {{the same as the}} median nerve and basilic vein. It is accompanied by venae comitantes (accompanying veins). It gives branches to the muscles of the anterior compartment. The artery is in between the median nerve and the tendon of the biceps muscle in the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa.</b> It then continues into the forearm.|$|E
5000|$|The brachial artery. The artery usually bifurcates {{near the}} apex (inferior part) of the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> into the radial artery (superficial) and ulnar artery (deeper) ...|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{border of}} the muscle forms the medial {{boundary}} of the triangular hollow known as the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> which is situated anterior to the elbow.|$|E
50|$|The {{unbranched}} {{portion of}} the median nerve (which arises from the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa)</b> innervates muscles of superficial and intermediate groups of the anterior(flexor) compartment except flexor carpi ulnaris.|$|E
50|$|Inside the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> {{the median}} nerve passes medial to the brachial artery, {{in front of}} the point of {{insertion}} of the brachialis muscle and deep to the biceps.|$|E
50|$|Several veins {{are also}} in the area (for example, the median cubital vein, cephalic vein, and basilic vein) but these are usually {{considered}} superficial to the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> and not part of its contents.|$|E
50|$|The bicipital {{aponeurosis}} (also {{known as}} lacertus fibrosus) {{is a broad}} aponeurosis of the biceps brachii which {{is located in the}} <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> of the elbow and separates superficial from deep structures in much of the fossa.|$|E
50|$|The {{area just}} {{superficial}} to the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> {{is often used}} for venous access (phlebotomy). A number of superficial veins can cross this region. It may {{also be used for}} the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter.|$|E
50|$|The median nerve {{arises from}} the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> and passes between the two heads of {{pronator}} teres. It then travels between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus before emerging between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor pollicis longus.|$|E
50|$|Blood is most {{commonly}} {{obtained from the}} superficial veins of the upper limb. The median cubital vein, which lies within the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> anterior to the elbow, {{is close to the}} surface of the skin without many large nerves positioned nearby.|$|E
50|$|The median nerve {{passes through}} the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> and passes between the two heads of {{pronator}} teres muscle into the forearm. It then runs between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus muscles and enters the hand through the carpal tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, when (venous) blood-letting was practiced, the bicipital {{aponeurosis}} (the {{ceiling of}} the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa)</b> {{was known as the}} [...] "grace of God" [...] tendon because it protected the more important contents of the fossa (i.e. the brachial artery and the median nerve).|$|E
50|$|Most {{patients}} experience poorly localised {{pain in the}} forearm. The pain {{is sometimes}} referred into the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> and elbow pain has been reported as being a primary complaint.‚Å†The characteristic impairment of the pincer movement of the {{thumb and index finger}} is most striking.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> or elbow pit is the {{triangular}} {{area on the}} anterior view of the elbow of a human or other hominid animal. It is also called the antecubital fossa because it lies anteriorly to the elbow (Latin cubitus) when in standard anatomical position.|$|E
50|$|The median nerve {{is closely}} related to the brachial artery within the arm. The nerve enters the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> medial to the brachialis tendon and passes between the two heads of the {{pronator}} teres. It then gives off the anterior interosseus branch in the pronator teres.|$|E
50|$|The brachioradialis is a superficial, {{fusiform}} muscle on {{the lateral}} {{side of the}} forearm that attaches proximally on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and distally on the radius, close to its styloid process. Near the elbow, it forms the lateral limit of the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> or elbow pit.|$|E
50|$|The bicipital {{aponeurosis}} originates {{from the}} distal insertion of the biceps brachii. While the tendon of the biceps inserts on the radial tuberosity, the aponeurosis reinforces the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> {{and helps to}} protect the brachial artery and the median nerve running underneath. This protection is important during venipuncture (taking blood) from the median cubital vein.|$|E
50|$|The {{veins of}} the arm carry blood from the {{extremities}} of the limb, as well as drain the arm itself. The two main veins are the basilic and the cephalic veins. There is a connecting vein between the two, the median cubital vein, which passes through the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> and is clinically important for venepuncture (withdrawing blood).|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, {{the median}} cubital vein (or median basilic vein) is a {{superficial}} vein {{of the upper}} limb. It connects the basilic and cephalic vein and is often used for venipuncture (taking blood), as it lies relatively {{close to the surface}} of the arm and becomes prominent when pressure is applied. It lies in the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis.|$|E
50|$|The radial and ulnar {{arteries and}} their {{branches}} supply the {{blood to the}} forearm. These usually run on the anterior face of the radius and ulna down the whole forearm. The main superficial veins of the forearm are the cephalic, median antebrachial and the basilic vein. These veins {{can be used for}} cannularisation or venipuncture, although the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> is a preferred site for getting blood.|$|E
5000|$|The median nerve, nerve origin C5-T1, {{which is}} {{a branch of the}} lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus. This nerve {{continues}} in the arm, travelling in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles. At the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> this nerve is deep to the pronator teres muscle and is the most medial structure in the fossa. The nerve passes into the forearm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{olecranon}} [...] {{from the}} Greek olene meaning elbow and kranon meaning head is the large, thick, curved bony eminence of the ulna, a long bone in the forearm that projects behind the elbow. It forms the most pointed {{portion of the}} elbow and is opposite to the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> or elbow pit. The olecranon serves as a lever for the extensor muscles that straighten the elbow joint.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the region}} {{anterior}} to the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> in the {{bend of the}} elbow joint, the basilic vein usually connects with the other large superficial vein of the upper extremity, the cephalic vein, via the median cubital vein (or median basilic vein). The layout of superficial veins in the forearm is highly variable from person to person, {{and there is a}} profuse network of unnamed superficial veins that the basilic vein communicates with.|$|E
50|$|The brachialis (brachialis anticus) is {{a muscle}} {{in the upper}} arm that flexes the elbow joint. It lies deeper than the biceps brachii, and makes up part of {{the floor of the}} region known as the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa.</b> The brachialis is the prime mover of elbow flexion. While the biceps brachii appears as a large {{anterior}} bulge on the arm and commands considerable interest among body builders, the brachialis underlying it actually generates about 50% more power and is thus the prime mover of elbow flexion.|$|E
5000|$|Biceps reflex is {{a reflex}} test that {{examines}} {{the function of}} the C5 reflex arc and the C6 reflex arc. [...] The test is performed by using a tendon hammer to quickly depress the biceps brachii tendon as it passes through the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa.</b> Specifically, the test activates the stretch receptors inside the biceps brachii muscle which communicates mainly with the C5 spinal nerve and partially with the C6 spinal nerve to induce a reflex contraction of the biceps muscle and jerk of the forearm.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} inputs {{from both}} the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, the median nerve enters the arm from the axilla at the inferior margin of the teres major muscle. It then passes vertically down and courses with the brachial artery on the medial side of the arm between biceps brachii and brachialis. At first it is lateral to the artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint; it then crosses anteriorly to run medial to the artery in the distal arm and into the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
50|$|The radial nerve divides into a {{superficial}} (sensory) and deep (motor) branch at the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa.</b> The deep {{branch of the}} radial nerve winds {{to the back of}} the forearm around the lateral side of the radius between the two planes of fibers of the Supinator, and is prolonged downward between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, to the middle of the forearm. The deep branch provides motor function to the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm, which is mostly the extensor muscles of the hand.|$|E
50|$|The ulnar artery, {{the larger}} of the two {{terminal}} branches of the brachial, begins a little below the bend of the elbow in the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa,</b> and, passing obliquely downward, reaches the ulnar side of the forearm at a point about midway between the elbow and the wrist. It then runs along the ulnar border to the wrist, crosses the transverse carpal ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone, and immediately beyond this bone divides into two branches, which enter into the formation of the superficial and deep volar arches.|$|E
50|$|It is the {{continuation}} of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the <b>cubital</b> <b>fossa</b> at the elbow. It then divides into the radial and ulnar arteries which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm.The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, {{with the use of a}} stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the blood pressure.|$|E
