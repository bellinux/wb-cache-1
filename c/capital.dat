5|$|Although members {{contribute}} <b>capital</b> to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds {{primarily by}} borrowing on international <b>capital</b> markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of <b>capital</b> in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow <b>capital</b> at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in <b>capital)</b> {{as part of a}} general <b>capital</b> increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E

On 27 August 1991 the military dictatorship of Ibrahim Babangida divided the old Anambra State into two new states, Enugu State and Anambra State. Enugu remained as the <b>capital</b> of the newly created Enugu State, while Awka became the <b>capital</b> of the new Anambra State.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of <b>capital</b> flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity <b>capital,</b> and embracing <b>capital</b> outflows and short-term <b>capital</b> mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic <b>capital</b> markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign <b>capital</b> markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative <b>capital</b> flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

5|$|Fustat was the <b>capital</b> of Egypt for {{approximately}} 500 years. After the city's founding in 641, its authority was uninterrupted until 750, when the Abbasid dynasty staged a {{revolt against the}} Umayyads. This conflict was focused not in Egypt, but elsewhere in the Arab world. When the Abbasids gained power, they moved various capitals to more controllable areas. They had established the centre of their caliphate in Baghdad, moving the <b>capital</b> from its previous Umayyad location at Damascus. Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty. In Egypt, they moved the <b>capital</b> from Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-Askar, which remained the <b>capital</b> until 868. When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868, the Egyptian <b>capital</b> moved briefly to another nearby northern city, Al-Qatta'i. This lasted only until 905, when Al-Qatta'i was destroyed and the <b>capital</b> was returned to Fustat. The city again lost its status as <b>capital</b> city when its own vizier, Shawar, ordered its burning in 1168. The <b>capital</b> of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign <b>capital</b> to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of <b>capital</b> was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) <b>capital</b> goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of <b>capital</b> goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower <b>capital</b> intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

The <b>capitals</b> dot the historical development of the town from the first half of the 2 nd century until the 4 th century. First made of regional limestone, they were later joined by those of limestone and marbles of distant source, whereby different stones in <b>capitals</b> coexisted almost throughout the town’s development. This was certainly the situation during the flourishing times of the late 3 rd and the 4 th century, when Sirmium, as one of the four <b>capitals</b> of the Roman Empire, stood within several formal circles of <b>capitals.</b> The plain-leaved <b>capitals</b> tie it to the rest of Pannonia, the Corinthianizing <b>capitals</b> to the provinces to the east and south, while part of the Asiatic <b>capitals,</b> the largest group, tie it to the wider area of the Mediterranean...|$|R

5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song <b>capital</b> without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary <b>capital.</b> Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new <b>capital,</b> but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the <b>capital</b> of the dynasty, but the label of temporary <b>capital</b> would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the <b>capital</b> of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
