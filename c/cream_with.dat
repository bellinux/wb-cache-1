40|$|The {{effects of}} citrus fibre on the physical, {{chemical}} and sensory properties {{of ice cream}} were evaluated. Three types of ice creams were compared; ice <b>creams</b> <b>with</b> stabiliser/emulsifier (0. 4 %, 0. 8 % and 1. 2 %), ice <b>creams</b> <b>with</b> citrus fibre (0. 4 %, 0. 8 % and 1. 2 %) and ice <b>creams</b> <b>with</b> 0. 4 % stabiliser/emulsifier and citrus fibre (0. 4 %, 0. 8 % and 1. 2 %). Citrus fibre as a single stabiliser could not improve the viscosity, overrun and sensory properties of ice cream samples, but had {{a positive effect on}} the melting resistance. A combination of citrus fibre and stabiliser/emulsifier produced desirable ice cream properties. Key Words: citrus fibre, dietary fibre, ice cream, meltdown, viscosit...|$|R

5|$|That night, SpongeBob {{goes to his}} {{favorite}} restaurant, Goofy Goober's, where he drowns his sorrows in ice <b>cream</b> <b>with</b> his best friend Patrick Star. Elsewhere, Mr. Krabs' business rival Plankton steals King Neptune's crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob later arrives and chastises Krabs {{under the influence of}} an ice cream headache, but seeing his boss's life is at risk, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Krabs' life. Neptune's sympathetic daughter, Princess Mindy, gives SpongeBob a Bag of Winds so that they can return from Shell City once they find the crown. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice <b>cream</b> <b>with</b> the general public.|$|E
