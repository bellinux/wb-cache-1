5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> adult male. A {{species with}} an {{important}} toxin for medical research, {{but not a}} medically significant bite - although often mistaken for Phoneutria ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{have one}} pair of {{principal}} eyes and three pairs of secondary eyes located on the prosoma (the anterior end of the head) and they are colour blind. Being adapted to nocturnality, their visual capability is reduced and they rely on their tactile sensation to detect movements or vibrations in their environment.|$|E
5000|$|In the wild, <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> are arboreal, {{living in}} trees and bushes, favoring {{plants such as}} banana with broad flat leaves and wide joints that provide shelter. Although they tend to {{generally}} be inactive, they are much faster than many other arachnids when provoked. <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> is a nocturnal, [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] ambush predator behaving with a strong circadian rhythmicity. They hide during daylight, mostly under leaves, and emerge at dusk. At sunset, when the light intentsity falls to about 15 lux, they leave their refuge but remain nearby. They remain there motionless for about 30 mins until it is dark (less than 0.1 lux) then move {{to the surface of}} the leaf and lie in-wait for prey, occasionally briefly walking about the leaf. Their actitivity is greatest during the first three hours of the night. They retreat back to their refuge after six to seven hours.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wandering}} spider (<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei)</b> can discriminate vibrations {{created by}} rain, wind, prey, and potential mates. The creeping grasshopper can escape predation by this spider if it produces vibrations similar enough {{to those of}} wind. [...] Thunderstorms and earthquakes produce vibrational cues; these may be used by elephants and birds to attract them to water or avoid earthquakes. Mole rats use reflected, self-generated seismic waves to detect and bypass underground obstacles - a form of [...] "seismic echolocation".|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{produces}} its venom {{in a pair}} of cylindrical pouch-like glands {{located at}} the anterior end of the head (prosoma). In adult females, each gland measures 1.8 mm in diameter and 6.5 mm in length. The glands are connected to a small duct through which the venom is discharged via its fang-like chelicera. Just before entering the chelicera, the duct enlarges to a muscle-invested ampulla and then constricts again. This specific arrangement {{is believed to be the}} regulatory system on the amount of venom that is released.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{is a large}} spider with {{distinct}} sexual dimorphism. The {{females are}} relatively larger than the males, measuring up to 3.5 cm in body length, with a 10 cm legspan. The dorsal {{side of the body}} is chocolate-brown with small, lighter spots on the abdomen and many darker longitudinal stripes, particularly on the carapace. The ventral side is red-orange with thick black central region under the abdomen. Males measure up to 2.5 cm long and have very long and thin legs. The males are much lighter in colour than the females. They are distinct, with conspicuous palpal bulbs.|$|E
50|$|During courtship, <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{communicate}} using sex pheromones. Females {{are usually}} solitary and to attract males, release the pheromones on trees along a silk thread. When a male detects the pheromone, he shows patterned oscillatory movement that creates vibrations on the leaves (an average frequency of 76 Hz). The female responds to this {{by creating a}} counter vibration, {{and in this way}} guides the receptive male to her exact location. The female pheromone has been identified as (S)-1,1'-dimethyl citrate. The male's pheromone sensory cells are located in tip pore sensilla and respond to touching with either female silk or the synthetic compound of the pheromone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{produces}} a neurotoxic venom which {{is composed of}} a complex mixture of compounds. The venom contains at least 286 compound and 49 novel proteins. In addition, there are many low molecular compounds, nine neurotoxic acting peptides (CSTX), at least eight neurotoxic and cytolytic acting peptides (collectively called cupiennins), highly active hyaluronidases. The most powerful neurotoxin is a peptide called CsTx-1. In 2002 a new family of peptides called cupiennins (cupiennin 1a, cupiennin 1b, cupiennin 1c, cupiennin 1d) was discovered from the venom. These proteins are all composed of 35 amino acid residues, and have high antimicrobial activities. It was subsequently discovered that the cupiennins are broad-spectrum bioactive compounds having bactericidal, insecticidal and haemolytic activities.|$|E
50|$|Cupiennins are a {{group of}} small cytolytic {{peptides}} from the venom of the wandering spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> They {{are known to have}} high bactericidal, insecticidal and haemolytic activities. They are chemically cationic α-helical peptides. They were isolated and identified in 2002 as a family of peptides called cupiennin 1. The sequence was determined by a process called Edman degradation, and the family consists of cupiennin 1a, cupiennin 1b, cupiennin 1c, and cupiennin 1d. The amino acid sequences of cupiennin 1b, c, and d were obtained by a combination of sequence analysis and mass spectrometric measurements of comparative tryptic peptide mapping. Even though they are not strong toxins, they do enhance the effect of the spider venom by synergistically enhancing other components of the venom, such CSTX.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> is a non-web {{producing}} spider {{and therefore}} depends entirely on its venom for predation. It {{is known to}} prey {{on a variety of}} insects including butterflies, moths, earwigs, cockroaches, flies, grasshoppers and small vertebrates such as frogs and lizards. Its venom glands store only about 10 μl of crude venom. Refilling of the glands takes 2-3 days and the lethal efficacy of the venom is very low for several days after envenomation, requiring 8 to 18 days to regain full effect. It has been determined that the amount of venom released differs between types of prey. For larger and stronger insects such as beetles, the spider uses the entire amount of its venom; for smaller prey, it uses only small amounts, thus economising use of the biologically costly venom.|$|E
5000|$|CSTX (for [...] "Cupiennius salei toxins") {{is a name}} {{given to}} a group of closely related {{neurotoxic}} peptides present in the venom of the wandering spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> There are twenty types so far described for this protein group. However, some are reclassified into cupiennins group of toxin, including CSTX-3, -4, -5, and -6, because of their chemical affinity. The first thirteen were isolated and identified in 1994 by Lucia Kuhn-Nentwig, Johann Schaller, and Wolfgang Nentwig of the Zoological Institute at the University of Bern, Switzerland. The different types are most likely the products of splicing variant of the same gene. They are all L-type calcium channel blockers, and also exhibit cytolytic activity by forming an alpha-helix across the cell membrane in mammalian neurons. They also inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels in insect neurons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei,</b> {{commonly}} called the tiger wandering spider, {{is a large}} spider belonging {{to a group of}} wandering spiders found in Central America (also one of many diverse types that mistakenly get called banana spiders), although this species is specifically from Eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras. The species was accidentally introduced into Germany in the early 20th century from banana plantations in Central America. In the mid-1950s it was realised that the spider is an ideal model for biological research because of its large size, inactive behaviour, and ease of breeding in laboratories. From an initial 1963 publication on its biological characteristics, it has become the most studied species of spider. Furthermore, the spider is now known to produce a complex neurotoxic venom, such as cupiennins and CSTX, of which a peptide called CsTx-1 is highly potent for paralysing its prey. Its toxin has also {{become one of the most}} studied among those of venomous spiders. As the spider does not produce a web for trapping prey, being venomous is its primary strategy for prey capture. It is known to prey on a wide range of insects and small vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Venom {{optimization}} {{hypothesis was}} postulated by Wigger, Kuhn-Nentwig, and Nentwig from their {{studies of the}} amount of venom used by a wandering spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> This spider produces a neurotoxic peptide called CsTx-1 for paralysing its prey. It does not weave webs for trapping preys, and therefore, entirely depends on its venom for predation. It is known to prey on a variety of insects including butterflies, moths, earwigs, cockroaches, flies and grasshoppers. Its venom glands store only about 10 μl of crude venom. Refilling of the glands takes 2-3 days and the lethal efficacy of the venom is, initially, very low for several days, requiring 8 to 18 days for full effect. It was found that the amount of venom released differed for each specific prey. For example, for bigger and stronger insects like beetles, the spider uses the entire amount of its venom; while for small ones, it uses only a small amount, thus economizing its costly venom. In fact, experiments show that the amount of venom released is just sufficient (at the lethal dose) to paralyze the target organism depending on the size or strength, and is not more than what is necessary.|$|E
40|$|The {{characterisation}} of the antimicrobial {{activity of}} six antibacterial peptides, {{isolated from the}} venom of the neotropical wandering spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> is reported. The peptides have a molecular weight, determined by electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry, between 3 to 4 kDa, and they consist of approximately 26 to 35 amino acids. All six peptides lack cysteines but they are rich in lysine. Peptide 1 is very closely related to CSTX- 4, a known bactericidal and insecticidal toxin from the venom of <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei...</b>|$|E
40|$|STRUCTURE OF <b>CUPIENNIUS</b> <b>SALEI</b> VENOM HYALURONIDASE Hyaluronidases are {{important}} venom components acting as spreading factor of toxic compounds. In several studies this spreading effect was tested on vertebrate tissue. However, {{data about the}} spreading activity on invertebrates, the main prey organisms of spiders, are lacking. Here, a hyaluronidase-like enzyme was isolated from the venom of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> The amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined by cDNA analysis of the venom gland transcriptome and confirmed by protein analysis. Two complex N-linked glycans akin to honey bee hyaluronidase glycosylations, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. A C-terminal EGF-like domain was identified in spider hyaluronidase using InterPro. The spider hyaluronidase-like enzyme showed maximal activity at acidic pH, between 40 - 60 °C, and 0. 2 M KCl. Divalent ions did not enhance HA degradation activity, indicating {{that they are not}} recruited for catalysis. FUNCTION OF VENOM HYALURONIDASES Besides hyaluronan, the enzyme degrades chondroitin sulfate A, whereas heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are not affected. The end products of hyaluronan degradation are tetramers, whereas chondroitin sulfate A is mainly degraded to hexamers. Identification of terminal N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine at the reducing end of the oligomers identified the enzyme as an endo-β-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase hydrolase. The spreading effect of the hyaluronidase-like enzyme on invertebrate tissue was studied by coinjection of the enzyme with the <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> main neurotoxin CsTx- 1 into Drosophila flies. The enzyme significantly enhances the neurotoxic activity of CsTx- 1. Comparative substrate degradation tests with hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate with venoms from 39 spider species from 21 families identified some spider families (Atypidae, Eresidae, Araneidae and Nephilidae) without activity of hyaluronidase-like enzymes. This is interpreted as a loss of this enzyme and fits quite well the current phylogenetic idea on a more isolated position of these families and can perhaps be explained by specialized prey catching techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} structural features modulating {{the biological}} activity of cupiennin 1 peptides from the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei,</b> three truncated cupiennin 1 d analogs were synthesized. The {{fact that their}} growth inhibiting effect on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, their lytic activity with human red blood cells and their insecticidal effect on Drosophila melanogaster correlates with structural properties shows that the hydrophobic N-terminal chain segment includes the major determinants of structure and activity. The polar C-terminus seems to modulate peptide accumulation at negatively charged cell surfaces via electrostatic interactions and has no important effect on the peptides’ amphipathic secondary structure...|$|E
40|$|The venom of the ctenid spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> {{contains}} {{a variety of}} low molecular mass compounds, many small cationic peptides, disulfiderich peptides, and several enzymes. Among the low molecular mass compounds are taurine, histamine, and citric acid. Some small cationic peptides act membranolytically and destroy prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells. More than 40 small cationic peptides (SCPs) have been identified and characterized so far, of which several exert strong cytolytic effects and enable other venom compounds to reach their targets. Most of the disulfiderich peptides follow the ICK motifand act as neurotoxins or support the activity of other neurotoxins as enhancers. More than a dozen different <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> toxins (CsTx) can be distinguished so far. CsTx- 1 is the most abundant and most insecticidal neurotoxin in the venom of C. salei. It is composed of two domains, an N-terminal part exhibiting the ICK motif, which inhibits L-type Ca 2 + ion channels, and a highly cationic C-terminal tailadopting an a-helical conformation, which destroys cell membranes. Several CsTx peptides consisting of two chains, connected by two disulfide bonds, enhance in nontoxic concentrations the insecticidal activity of other toxins. Among the enzymes, a highly active hyaluronidase is crucial for destroying tissue and assisting other venom compounds to spread into the target organism. The combined effects of synergistic and enhancing interactions between these components enable C. salei to inject a minimum quantity of venom to achieve maximum toxicity, thus optimizing its venom investment...|$|E
40|$|Cupiennin 1 a, a cytolytic peptide {{isolated}} from the venom of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei,</b> exhibits broad membranolytic activity towards bacteria, trypanosomes, and plasmodia, as well as human blood and cancer cells. In analysing the cytolytic activity of synthesised all-d- and all-l-cupiennin 1 a towards pro- and eukaryotic cells, a stereospecific mode of membrane destruction could be excluded. The importance of negatively charged sialic acids on the outer leaflet of erythrocytes for the binding and haemolytic activity of l-cupiennin 1 a was demonstrated. Reducing the overall negative charges of erythrocytes by partially removing their sialic acids or by protecting them with tri- or pentalysine results in reduced haemolytic activity of the peptide...|$|E
40|$|The venom of the ctenid spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> (Fig. 16. 1) {{is rich in}} {{components}} which {{belong to}} different functional groups. Besides low molecular mass compounds, the venom contains several disulphide-rich peptides, also called mini-proteins, which act as neurotoxins on ion channels or as enhancers of neurotoxins. Likewise, a variety of small cytolytic peptides, which destroy membranes very efficiently, and enzymes {{are present in the}} venom. Neurotoxins with cytolytic activity, cytolytic a-helical small cationic peptides and enzymes most probably attacking connective tissue and phospholipid membranes cause the overall cytotoxic effect of this venom. Synergistic and enhancing interactions between components enable the spider to achieve a maximum of toxicity with a minimum of venom quantity...|$|E
40|$|Defensins {{are a major}} {{family of}} {{antimicrobial}} peptides found throughout the phylogenetic tree. From the spider species: <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei,</b> Phoneutria reidyi, Polybetes pythagoricus, Tegenaria atrica, and Meta menardi, defensins belonging to the 'ancestral' class of invertebrate defensins were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences contain the characteristic six cysteines of this class of defensins and reveal precursors of 60 or 61 amino acid residues. The mature peptides consist of 37 amino acid residues, showing up to 70 % identities with tick and scorpion defensins. In C. salei, defensin mRNA {{was found to be}} constitutively expressed in hemocytes, ovaries, subesophageal nerve mass, hepatopancreas, and muscle tissue. This is the first report presenting and comparing antimicrobial peptides belonging to the family of defensins from spiders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hox {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in specific domains along the anterior posterior body axis and define the regional identity. In most animals these genes are organized in a single cluster in the genome and {{the order of the}} genes in the cluster is correlated with the anterior to posterior expression of the genes in the embryo. The conserved order of the various Hox gene orthologs in the cluster among most bilaterians implies that such a Hox cluster was present in their last common ancestor. Vertebrates are the only metazoans so far that have been shown to contain duplicated Hox clusters, while all other bilaterians seem to possess only a single cluster. Results We here show that at least three Hox genes of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> are present as two copies in this spider. In addition to the previously described duplicated Ultrabithorax gene, we here present sequence and expression data of a second Deformed gene, and of two Sex comb reduced genes. In addition, we describe the sequence and expression of the Cupiennius proboscipedia gene. The spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> is the first chelicerate for which orthologs of all ten classes of arthropod Hox genes have been described. The posterior expression boundary of all anterior Hox genes is at the tagma border of the prosoma and opisthosoma, while the posterior boundary of the posterior Hox genes is at the posterior end of the embryo. Conclusion The presence of at least three duplicated Hox genes points to a major duplication event in the lineage to this spider, perhaps even of the complete Hox cluster as has taken place in the lineage to the vertebrates. The combined data of all Cupiennius Hox genes reveal the existence of two distinct posterior expression boundaries that correspond to morphological tagmata boundaries. </p...|$|E

40|$|Cupiennin 1 a (GFGALFKFLAKKVAKTVAKQAAKQGAKYVVNKQME-NH 2) is {{a potent}} venom {{component}} of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> Cupiennin 1 a shows multifaceted activity. In addition to known antimicrobial and cytolytic properties, cupiennin 1 a inhibits the formation of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase at an IC 50 concentration of 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 microM. This is the first report of neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition by a component of a spider venom. The mechanism by which cupiennin 1 a inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase involves complexation with the regulatory protein calcium calmodulin. This is demonstrated by chemical shift changes {{that occur in the}} heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of 15 N-labelled calcium calmodulin upon addition of cupiennin 1 a.

40|$|The {{specialized}} hairs and slit sensillae of spiders (<b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei)</b> {{can sense}} the airflow and auditory signals in a low-frequency range.

In analogy, {{in this paper}} a setup is described where two microphones and a neural preprocessing system together with a modular neural controller are used to generate a sound tropism of a four-legged walking machine. The neural preprocessing network is acting as a low-pass filter and it {{is followed by a}} network which discerns between signals coming from the left or the right. The parameters of these networks are optimized by an evolutionary algorithm. In addition, a simple modular neural controller then generates the desired different walking patterns such that the machine walks straight, then turns towards a switched-on sound source, and then stops near to it...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSynchrotron X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was applied}} to study the structure of biogenic α-chitin crystals composing the tendon of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> Measurements were carried out on pristine chitin crystals stabilized by proteins and water, as well as after their deproteinization and dehydration. We found substantial shifts (up to Δq/q= 9 % in the wave vector in q-space) in the (020) diffraction peak position between intact and purified chitin samples. However, chitin lattice parameters extracted from the set of reflections (hkl), which did not contain the (020) -reflection, showed no systematic variation between the pristine and the processed samples. The observed shifts in the (020) peak position are {{discussed in terms of}} the ordering-induced modulation of the protein and water electron density near the surface of the ultra-thin chitin fibrils due to strong protein/chitin and water/chitin interactions.

40|$|Dynamic {{attachment}} {{is the key}} to move on steep surfaces, with mechanisms being {{still not}} well understood. The hunting spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> (Arachnida, Ctenidae) possesses hairy attachment pads (claw tufts) at its distal legs, consisting of directional branched setae. The morphological investigation revealed that adhesive setae are arranged in a radial manner within the distal tarsus. Friction of claw tufts on smooth glass was measured to reveal the functional effect of seta arrangement within the pad. Measurements revealed frictional anisotropy in both longitudinal and transversal directions. Contact behaviour of adhesive setae was investigated in a reflection interference contrast microscope (RICM). Observations on living spiders showed, that {{only a small part of}} the hairy pads is in contact at the same time. Thus the direction of frictional forces is depending on leg placement and rotation. This may aid controlling the attachment to the substrate. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei</b> depends on its hunting success, which largely relies on its immediately paralyzing multicomponent venom. Here, {{we report on the}} isolation and characterization of CSTX- 13, a neurotoxic enhancer in the spider venom. De novo elucidation of the disulfide bridge pattern of CSTX- 13 and the neurotoxin CSTX- 1 by tandem MS revealed an identical arrangement. However, in contrast to CSTX- 1, CSTX- 13 is a two-chain peptide with two interchain and two intrachain disulfide bridges. Furthermore, the insecticidal activity of CSTX- 13 is synergistically increased in the presence of K+ ions {{as well as of the}} cytolytic peptide cupiennin 1 a. We demonstrated that the weakly neurotoxic CSTX- 13 enhances the paralytic activity of the neurotoxin CSTX- 1 by 65 % when it is administered with the latter at its entirely nontoxic physiological concentration, which is 440 times below its LD 50 concentration...|$|E

The peptide (8676. 08  Da) is composed of 78 amino acids, contains six intrachain disulphide bridges and carries a modified Thr residue at position 2. SIBD- 1 mRNA expression was detected by quantitative real-time PCR mainly in hemocytes, but also in the subesophageal nerve mass and muscle. After infection, the SIBD- 1 content in the hemocytes decreases and, simultaneously, the temporal SIBD- 1 expression seems to be down-regulated. Two further peptides, SIBD- 2 and IGFBP-rP 1, also exhibiting IGFBP N-terminal domain variants with unknown functions, were identified on cDNA level in spider hemocytes and venom glands.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} a distinctive pigment ring that appears in spider eyes after ecdysis and successively decreases in size in the days thereafter.

In this species the pupil occupies only a fourth of the total projected lens surface after ecdysis and reaches its final size after approximately ten days. MicroCT images suggest that the decrease of the pigment ring is linked to the growth of the corneal lens after ecdysis. The pigment rings might improve vision in the immature eye by shielding light rays that would otherwise enter the eye via peripheral regions of the cornea, beside the growing crystalline lens...|$|E

During mid-stage of germ band extension, two additional spots of expression appear in the posterior parts of the limb buds on the second opisthosomal segment. These coincide with the position of the future genital opening and Cs-Abd-B remains expressed in these regions until the openings are formed.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between PCO • and pH were determined in cell-free undiluted haemolymph of the arachnids Eurypelma californicum, Pandinus imperator and <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> The pH/bicarbonate diagrams and the CO 2 equilibrium curves were calculated, using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, for haemolymph sampled at rest and during recovery from exercise. The calculations of solubility (aCO•) and dissociation constant (pK-) {{were based on}} additional ion concentration measurements. Blood gas analyses corroborate these results: after locomotor activity, there is a metabolic acidosis linked to the accumulation of lactate in the haemolymph. The concentration of bicarbonate in the haemolymph of resting individuals is quite different in the three species and {{is related to the}} extent of post-exercise bicarbonate depletion. During early recovery, buffering in the haemolymph strongly depends upon CO 2 release. Potassium and magnesium concentrations in the haemolymph increase after exercise.

40|$|Three novel glycine-rich peptides, named ctenidin 1 - 3, with {{activity}} against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli, were isolated and characterized from hemocytes {{of the spider}} <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> Ctenidins have a high glycine content (> 70 %), similarly to other glycine-rich peptides, the acanthoscurrins, from another spider, Acanthoscurria gomesiana. A combination of mass spectrometry, Edman degradation, and cDNA cloning revealed the presence of three isoforms of ctenidin, {{at least two of}} them originating from simple, intronless genes. The full-length sequences of the ctenidins consist of a 19 amino acid residues signal peptide followed by the mature peptides of 109, 119, or 120 amino acid residues. The mature peptides are post-translationally modified by the cleavage of one or two C-terminal cationic amino acid residue(s) and amidation of the newly created mature C-terminus. Tissue expression analysis revealed that ctenidins are constitutively expressed in hemocytes and to a small extent also in the subesophageal nerve mass...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} on whether segmentation in different phyla has a common origin sharing a common genetic program. However, before comparing segmentation between phyla, {{it is necessary to}} identify the ancestral condition within each phylum.

In this paper, we analyze the expression of three segmentation genes of the pair-rule class in the spider <b>Cupiennius</b> <b>salei.</b> Spiders are representatives of the Chelicerata, a monophyletic basic arthropod group. We find that in spider embryos, the orthologues for the Drosophila primary pair-rule genes hairy, even-skipped, and runt are expressed in stripes in the growth zone, where the segments are forming, suggesting a role for these genes in chelicerate segmentation. These data imply that the involvement of hairy, even-skipped, and runt in arthropod segmentation is an ancestral character for arthropods and is not restricted to a particular group of insects...|$|E

Both cells differ in shape, cytochemical and transmission electron microscopy staining of their cytoplasma and granules. According to MALDI-IMS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging), granulocytes exhibit ctenidin 1 (9510 Da) and ctenidin 3 (9568 Da), SIBD- 1 (8675 Da), and unknown peptides with masses of 2207 and 6239 Da. Plasmatocytes exhibit mainly a mass of 6908 Da. Unknown peptides with masses of 1546 and 1960 Da were detected in plasmatocytes and granulocytes. Transmission electron microscopy confirms the presence of two compounds in one granule and cytochemical staining (light microscopy) tends to support this view. Two further hemocyte types (cyanocytes containing hemocyanin and prehemocytes as stem cells) are only rarely detected in the hemolymph. These four hemocyte types constitute the cellular part of the spider immune system and this is discussed in view of arachnid hemocyte evolution...|$|E
