5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship <b>Clause,</b> Privileges or Immunities <b>Clause,</b> Due Process <b>Clause,</b> and Equal Protection <b>Clause.</b> The Citizenship <b>Clause</b> provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities <b>Clause</b> has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} has {{undergone}} academic scrutiny {{is the nature of}} section8B(2) as an ouster <b>clause.</b> An ouster <b>clause</b> is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.|$|E
50|$|Restrictive {{relative}} <b>clauses</b> {{are also}} called integrated relative <b>clauses,</b> defining relative <b>clauses,</b> or identifying relative <b>clauses.</b> Conversely, non-restrictive relative <b>clauses</b> are called supplementary, appositive, non-defining or non-identifying relative <b>clauses.</b>|$|R

50|$|Subordination is {{extremely}} limited in Roviana. Subordinate <b>clauses</b> never contain other subordinate <b>clauses,</b> {{nor do they}} contain relative <b>clauses.</b> Similarly, relative <b>clauses</b> do not contain either subordinate <b>clauses</b> or relative <b>clauses.</b>|$|R

5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage <b>Clause</b> might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the <b>Clause</b> might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the <b>Clause</b> by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the <b>Clause.</b> Kalt also notes that the Vicinage <b>Clause</b> would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the special processing characteristics of head-final relative <b>clauses.</b> As head-final relative <b>clauses</b> superficially resemble other prenominal modifiers such as adjectivals, stative verbs, and adjunctive/complement <b>clauses,</b> their status as a distinct kind has constantly been challenged. We present existing processing {{evidence to show that}} head-final relative <b>clauses</b> should be distinguished from other prenominal modifiers as they do involve structure-based filler-gap integrations (like those of head-initial relative <b>clauses)</b> and observe universal extraction effects. The evidence includes: (a) processing differences between possessive relative <b>clauses</b> and adverbial relative <b>clauses</b> in Mandarin; (b) processing differences between gapped relative <b>clauses</b> and adjunct <b>clauses</b> with null pronouns in Korean; and (c) subject-extracted relative <b>clauses</b> being easier to process than object-extracted relative <b>clauses</b> in head-final relativization.

5|$|If {{there is}} a <b>clause</b> in {{which one of the}} clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the <b>clause</b> could still become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the <b>clause</b> to become true.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A <b>clause</b> is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one <b>clause</b> is always the main <b>clause</b> (or matrix <b>clause)</b> whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main <b>clause.</b> For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main <b>clause</b> is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate <b>clause</b> (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the <b>clause</b> that follows is a subordinate <b>clause,</b> but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative <b>clause</b> that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main <b>clause.</b> Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{provisions}} of section 29 are plainly {{similar to those of}} the Sixth Amendment, namely the Information <b>Clause,</b> the Assistance of Counsel <b>Clause,</b> and the Compulsory Process <b>Clause.</b> The Sixth Amendment (and the remainder of the Bill of Rights) had not yet been ratified at the time of the Crimes Act's passage.|$|E

5|$|The Compulsory Process <b>Clause</b> {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the <b>Clause</b> prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, the <b>Clause</b> prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense. The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E
5|$|The Hobbs Act, the Travel Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) {{have been}} upheld under the Commerce <b>Clause.</b> The mail fraud statute has been {{justified}} under the Postal <b>Clause.</b> In Sabri v. United States (2004), the Supreme Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} the program bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, under the Spending <b>Clause</b> (with Justice Clarence Thomas citing the Commerce <b>Clause</b> in concurrence). Prior to Sabri, several circuit courts had already so held.|$|E
5|$|The Speedy Trial <b>Clause</b> regulates delay {{between the}} {{bringing}} {{of a formal}} criminal charge and/or the pre-trial deprivation of the accused's liberty {{and the start of}} trial. The <b>Clause</b> has been incorporated to apply in state prosecutions.|$|E
40|$|Finite {{interrogative}} complement <b>clauses</b> may {{be introduced}} by the complementiserof if/whether or a WH-word (wanneer when, wat what, waar where, hoekom why, watter what/which). Interrogative complement <b>clauses</b> introduced by of íf/whether are general interrogatives (indirect yes/no-questions), as exemplified by (1), whereas interrogative complement <b>clauses</b> introduced by WH-words are specific interrogatives (indirect WH-questions), as exemplified by (2). Like finite declarative complement <b>clauses</b> (see the section on syntactic positions of finite declarative complement <b>clauses),</b> interrogative complement <b>clauses</b> are most frequently used as object <b>clauses,</b> but are also used as subject <b>clauses</b> and predicate <b>clauses</b> (discussed in more detail here) ...|$|R

5|$|The Vicinage <b>clause</b> has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The <b>clause</b> {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury <b>Clause</b> of the Fifth Amendment and (possibly) the Excessive Bail <b>Clause</b> of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. The Due Process <b>Clause</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury <b>Clause,</b> the Vicinage <b>Clause,</b> and maybe the Excessive Bail <b>Clause)</b> to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
5|$|The participial mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} a subordinate <b>clause</b> describing its subject {{in the state of}} carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix <b>clause</b> and the subordinate <b>clause</b> have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.|$|E
40|$|Traditional English grammar {{is still}} not clear on how to define and {{classify}} subordinators for finite <b>clauses</b> in that grammarians mix up relative <b>clauses,</b> which are dependent on NPs, and subordinate <b>clauses,</b> which are dependent on other <b>clauses.</b> And different functions of the markers of subordinate <b>clauses</b> are not fully investigated. The author of this aritcle found, through comparative studies, that relative <b>clauses</b> should be distinguished from subordinate <b>clauses,</b> which implies that words introducing relative <b>clauses</b> are not subordinators, and even among the markers of subordinate <b>clauses</b> some of them, such as before, because and if that indicates condition, are actually prepositions. There leaves a small class of subordinators for finite <b>clauses,</b> namely, that, whether and if that indicates interrogation...|$|R
5000|$|Complement <b>clauses</b> are <b>clauses</b> {{that act}} as the direct object of the verb, {{introduced}} by a complementizer (e.g.: in English, [...] "that" [...] or [...] "which").

40|$|We present various refutationally {{complete}} calculi for first-order <b>clauses</b> with equality {{that allow}} for arbitrary selection of negative atoms in <b>clauses.</b> Refutation completeness is established via the use of well-founded orderings on <b>clauses</b> for defining a Herbrand model for a consistent set of <b>clauses.</b> We also formulate an abstract notion of redundancy and show that the deletion of redundant <b>clauses</b> during the theorem proving process preserves refutation completeness. It is often possible to compute the closure of nontrivial sets of <b>clauses</b> under application of non-redundant inferences. The refutation of goals for such complete sets of <b>clauses</b> is simpler than for arbitrary sets of <b>clauses,</b> in particular one can restrict attention to proofs that have support from the goals without compromising refutation completeness. Additional syntactic properties allow to restrict the search space even further, as we demonstrate for so-called quasi-Horn <b>clauses.</b> The results in this paper contain as special cases or generalize many known results about Knuth-Bendix-like completion procedures (for equations, Horn <b>clauses,</b> and Horn <b>clauses</b> over built-in Booleans), completion of first-order <b>clauses</b> by clausal rewriting, and inductive theorem proving for Horn <b>clauses...</b>|$|R
5|$|These {{statutes}} {{have been}} upheld as exercises of Congress's Commerce <b>Clause</b> power, {{or in the}} case of the mail fraud and program bribery statutes, the Postal <b>Clause</b> and the Spending <b>Clause,</b> respectively. In the special case where a member of Congress is the defendant, the Speech or Debate <b>Clause</b> places certain restrictions on the actions that can be prosecuted and proved up. Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state and local officials under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions, while others argue that the Guarantee <b>Clause</b> provides additional authority for such prosecutions.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination <b>Clause</b> {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the <b>Clause</b> also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the <b>Clause</b> prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the <b>Clause</b> prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal <b>clause.</b> Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate <b>clause.</b> For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement <b>clause</b> such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
