It is not the personality of Cécile Camusot herself but Pons’s art collection which is “the heroine of this story”; it is that, not her value as a person, which secures her marriage. The union of the Topinards, who are not strictly married, is the kindest, most affectionate relationship of man and woman in the novel. The friendship of Pons and Schmucke is true love but not love within marriage. The two men are poor and physically ugly but their relationship is golden and pure. Their Platonic friendship runs parallel to the idealizing function of art.|$|E
50|$|Young (1994) {{argues that}} there is an {{aetiological}} crisis, i.e. {{there is a lack of}} explanation for the fact that reported crime rises during both economic good times and bad times. Aetiology assumes fundamental importance. If the cause of crime is injustice, then its solution must lie in this direction. If poor conditions cause crime, it must be impossible to prevent crime without changing these circumstances. Furthermore, it follows that it must be wrong to punish the offender for conditions beyond his or her control. This would be punishing the criminal andblaming the victim. The social democratic brand of positivism, although sensing that injustice was the root cause of crime, either deflected its attentions to purely individual deprivation (e.g. maternal deprivation, broken homes, etc.) or made the fundamental mistake of believing thatameliorating deprivation quantitatively in an absolute sense (e.g. raising standards of education, housing, etc.) would solve the problem of relative deprivation. Young distinguishes the structural approach of other Left-wing theorists, and posits that most crime is minor, amateurish, sporadic, and intra-class, i.e. committed by working class offenders on working class victims. He rejects the positivist view that unemployment or poverty causes crime, but prefers Merton's theory of anomie and Subcultural Theory which focus on the lack of opportunity to achieve social status and economic expectations: a lack most commonly felt by the most disadvantaged sections of the community. He believes that the majority of criminals hold <b>conventional</b> <b>social</b> <b>values,</b> reflecting the need to achieve material success or social status in a competitive society where sexism, racism, machismo and other ideological forms affect outcomes. Indeed, criminal behaviour could be characterised as the operation of capitalist principles, i.e. the investment of labour for a return, but in an illegitimate form.|$|E

However, the sector also has a &# 039;dark side&# 039; - whereby its social welfare agendas are sidelined in favour of profit-driven motives, the outsourcing of government services and perpetuation of inequalities between those that manage and those that benefit from the enterprises. In this light, it is perhaps not surprising that social enterprise literature has emerged predominantly {{from the field of}} business management, resulting in an over-representation of perspectives that privilege the economic, and technocratic, aspects of social entrepreneurship.

Among these heritage <b>values,</b> <b>social</b> <b>values</b> have come to the foreground of heritage conservation recently. It is recognized that {{there is a lack of}} methods to assess <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>values</b> have not been successfully integrated into the study of a heritage place. Neglecting the <b>social</b> <b>values</b> poses risks to the comprehensive and successful conservation.

By exploring answers to these questions, this paper aims to develop some key assessment indicators for <b>social</b> <b>values.</b> Then, these proposed assessment indicators will be tested out on a case study: the Peel and Graham Street Market in the Central District in Hong Kong.

Despite the UK's government agenda in this area, and the draw of people to coastal areas generally, the larger UK public lacks understanding and awareness regarding the marine environment. Combined with these circumstances, the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> of Marine and Coastal Protected Areas (MCPAs) has been largely ignored relative to conservation and economics drivers, with the latter invariably taking precedence in environmental policy making. There is also a need for an appropriate framework or methodology with which to address the above in light of communicating, particularly the nontangible, <b>social</b> <b>values</b> of MCPAs to decision makers. This research investigates the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> of MCPAs in England and Wales through three data collection phases. These include {{a series of interviews}} to gain a perspective of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> from MCPA practitioners and the public. The emerging results are then examined in light of their operational value through in-depth case studies. The results {{led to the development of}} two assessment tools of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> which can accommodate both tangible and intangible values. The tools included a normative statement of examples demonstrating optimum <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> and a <b>social</b> <b>value</b> zoning tool that allows practitioners to 'map' the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> of their MCPA for evaluative purposes. The final research findings are represented by a conceptual model of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> within MCPAs. The assessment tools and model assist with the clarification of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> within MCPAs and can be used by decision makers to assess and communicate the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> of their site and influence management practice.

Previous literature does not commonly consider a non-material approach, using mainly quantitative practices {{which are not}} {{in line with the}} characteristics of <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> This thesis contributes to the current <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation studies in two ways. The first centers the subjectivity of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> as a phenomenon embedded in space and time which calls for distinctive ways of understanding its creation. Here the research approaches the hedonic perspective of well-being as a processual phenomenon which makes possible to explore the way <b>social</b> <b>value</b> is created from beneficiaries’ perspective. The second contribution is an empirical study within a voluntary program in order to explore how the beneficiaries’ subjective well-being unfolds over time. In this setting, where impoverished people deal with satisfying their basic needs, a process approach reveals the emotionally loaded context and the complexity of the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation. Thereby, the main emphasis of this thesis is to put on a deeper theoretical discussion of the concept of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation. The result of this research is an understanding of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation as a subjective construct centered on how the process uncovers unique moments experienced by people. ...|$|R

Ironically, in future, climate change may raise <b>social</b> <b>value</b> at the coast given a public fascination with dramatic storms and sensational rapid change as a result of coastal processes. In order to identify <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> evaluate how it has been applied, and suggest better future integration, research focussing on selected coastal protected areas in England and Wales has taken an inductive grounded theory approach. A combination of practitioner and public interviews were undertaken to inform the design of a normative statement and model of <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> To understand <b>social</b> <b>values</b> at an operational level a detailed ‘zoning chart’ exercise in conjunction with an expert scoring system was applied to four case studies This work has resulted in validating <b>social</b> <b>value</b> criteria and has highlighted the complexities of measuring <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> particularly using a scoring system to rate the criteria. Tranquility, for example, is typically subjective. Zoning charts proved to be a productive data collection tool, allowing visualisation of the criteria. All the data collection phases demonstrated that criteria in the ‘spirituality and natural environment’ theme provided the most <b>social</b> <b>value</b> to the public. Criteria in this theme include areas where it is possible to get away from other people in order to experience tranquillity, isolation and remoteness: experiences of views and open coastline: inspirational opportunities for art, poetry and photography: and an outdoor experience in a place where people want to be. ...|$|R
40|$|Consideration of the <b>social</b> <b>values</b> people {{assign to}} {{relatively}} undisturbed native ecosystems {{is critical for}} the success of science-based conservation plans. We used an interview process to identify and map <b>social</b> <b>values</b> assigned to 31 ecosystem services provided by natural areas in an agricultural landscape in southern Australia. We then modeled the spatial distribution of 12 components of ecological value commonly used in setting spatial conservation priorities. We used the analytical hierarchy process to weight these components and used multiattribute utility theory to combine them into a single spatial layer of ecological <b>value.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>values</b> assigned to natural areas were negatively correlated with ecological values overall, but were positively correlated with some components of ecological value. In terms of the spatial distribution of values, people valued protected areas, whereas those natural areas underrepresented in the reserve system were of higher ecological value. The habitats of threatened animal species were assigned both high ecological <b>value</b> and high <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> Only small areas were assigned both high ecological <b>value</b> and high <b>social</b> <b>value</b> in the study area, whereas large areas of high ecological value were of low <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> and vice versa. We used the assigned ecological and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> to identify different conservation strategies (e. g., information sharing, community engagement, incentive payments) that may be effective for specific areas. We suggest that consideration of both ecological and <b>social</b> <b>values</b> in selection of conservation strategies can enhance the success of science-based conservation planning.

30|$|The term “social value” mostly {{signifies the}} {{wellbeing}} {{of people and}} communities, built {{on a set of}} basic <b>values.</b> In <b>social</b> psychology, <b>social</b> <b>value</b> orientation is connected to research on social dilemmas and is defined as “the importance an individual attaches to their own and others’ outcomes in situations of social interdependence” (Joireman et al. 2001). <b>Social</b> <b>value</b> creation is a term frequently used in literature, though there has been inadequate effort to conceptualize it (Sinkovics, Sinkovics, Hoque, & Czaban 2015). In social entrepreneurship literature, <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation is inclusive of altruistic and virtuous behavior, and promotion of social purposes (Choi & Majumdar 2014). It is an intervention creating positive change, i.e. <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> for subjective well-being and life satisfaction (Kroeger & Weber 2014) of people seeking subsistence, or amour propre, or freedom from subjection or enslavement (Sinkovics et al. 2015). <b>Social</b> <b>value</b> creation is achieved by successfully attending complex and diverse ‘social cause-attractors’ (Dietz & Porter 2012), i.e. social issues, with priority over economic value. While popular wisdom talks about the social mission leading to the creation of <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> not much of social entrepreneurship literature was found which elicited the concept of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> (Stevens, Nathalie, & Johan 2015). This construct has come up with some indicative vocabularies. Nevertheless, it needs to be more explored in depth in the context of social entrepreneurship in India.|$|R
