This compound is stable up to 1473 K in air. It was found that copper {{in the form of}} Cu + cations is located in infinite linear (CuO) - 1 chains inserted into the tunnels parallel to the hexagonal c axis.

The experimental value of the effective magnetic moment (μ eff) for the 1 Cr atom in formula Sr 5 (CrO 4) 3 (Cu 0. 586 (4) O) (1. 671 μ B) is slightly smaller than the theoretical moment (1. 732 μ B) calculated in the assumption that all chromium is present as Cr 5 + cations and <b>copper</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cu</b> +. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The copper ion substituted Cu 0. 1 Fe 0. 9 Al 2 O 4 {{appears to be the}} most active, showing similar to 98 % methanol conversion at 300 degrees C with similar to 5 % CO selectivity at GHSV = 30, 000 h(- 1) and H 2 O:CH 3 OH = 1. 1. The analogous impregnated catalyst, CuO (10 at%) /FeAl 2 O 4, is found to be much less active. These materials are characterized by XRD, H- 2 -TPR, BET, HRTEM, XPS and XANES analyses. Spinel phase formation is highly facilitated upon Cu-ion substitution and Cu loading beyond 10 at% leads to the formation of CuO as an additional phase. The ionic substitution of copper in FeAl 2 O 4 leads to the highly crystalline SCS catalyst containing Cu 2 + ion sites that are shown to be more active than the dispersed CuO nano-crystallites on the FeAl 2 O 4 impregnated catalyst, despite its lower surface area. The as prepared SCS catalyst contains also a portion of <b>copper</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cu</b> 1 + that increases when subjected to reforming atmosphere.

40|$|The Keweenaw Peninsula {{native copper}} {{district}} of Michigan, USA {{is the largest}} concentration of native copper in the world. The copper isotopic composition of native copper was measured from stratabound and vein deposits, hosted by multiple rift-filling basalt-dominated stratigraphic horizons over 110 km of strike length. The δ 65 Cu of the native copper has an overall mean of + 0. 28 ‰ {{and a range of}} − 0. 32 ‰ to + 0. 80 ‰ (excluding one anomalous value). The data appear to be normally distributed and unimodal with no substantial differences between the native copper isotopic composition from the wide spread of deposits studied here. This suggests a common regional and relatively uniform process of derivation and precipitation of the copper in these deposits. Several published studies indicate that the ore-forming hydrothermal fluids carried <b>copper</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cu</b> 1 +, which is reduced to Cu 0 during the precipitation of native copper. The δ 65 Cu of copper in the ore-forming fluids is thereby constrained to + 0. 80 ‰ or higher in order to yield the measured native copper values by reductive precipitation. The currently accepted hypothesis for the genesis of native copper relies on the leaching of copper from the rift-filling basalt-dominated stratigraphic section at a depth below the deposits during burial metamorphism. Oxidative dissolution of copper from magmatic source rocks with magmatic δ 65 Cu of 0 ‰ ± 0. 3 ‰ is needed to obtain the copper isotopic composition of the metamorphogenic ore-forming hydrothermal fluids. In order to accommodate oxidative dissolution of copper from the rift-filling basalt source rocks, the copper needs to have been sited in native copper. Magmatic native copper in basalt is likely stable when the magma is low in sulfur. Low sulfur is predicted by the lack of sulfide minerals in the ore deposits and in the rift-filling basalt-dominated section, which are source rocks, the same rocks through which the ore fluids moved upwards, and the host rocks for the native copper ores. When combined with geologic evidence and inferences, the copper isotopic composition of native copper helps to further constrain the genetic model for this unique mining district...|$|E
