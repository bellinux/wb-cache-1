40|$|International audienceAbstract Within the {{framework}} of geological repositories for radioactive waste, structural concretes must be adapted to the underground chemical conditions. CEM I cement-based materials are characterised by high pH that may produce an alkaline plume in the near-field of the repository. In order to avoid this problem, low-pH cements have been designed. This study compares the physico-chemical behaviour of a low-pH material with a CEM I cement paste, both being subjected to leaching by an aqueous solution. An original experimental setup was designed to reproduce the underground conditions using a specific CO 2 regulation device. Under these conditions, the low-pH material was strongly degraded, which results in <b>coarser</b> <b>porosity,</b> whereas thickness degradation of the CEM I cement paste {{is limited by the}} precipitation of a magnesium-calcite crust over the surface, which reduces the exchange of soluble species.

40|$|The global cement {{industry}} is striving {{to reduce its}} carbon footprint. Common approaches have included reduced clinker factors by blending cement clinker with supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). However supplies of SCMs are not sufficient to achieve replacement above about 30 %. Limestone ternary cements offer the opportunity to reduce the clinker factor of cements while maximizing the efficiency of SCMs. In these cements, calcite from limestone reacts with dissolved aluminates to form carboaluminate {{and in the process}} influence hydration of other constituents. However, sulfates which are conventionally added to regulate the early reactions in cement also compete for aluminates. Here we have used complementary techniques to investigate the effects of calcium sulfate additions on hydration, microstructure and performance of composite Portland clinker-slag-limestone cements. The results show that the presence of sulfate influenced the early-age reaction kinetics of the clinker phases and supplementary cementitious materials. However, even after sulfate depletion, the course of hydration and microstructures formed were significantly influenced. Increasing the sulfate level resulted in a gradual increase of the fraction of ettringite over AFm phases, <b>coarser</b> <b>porosity</b> and lower water content of the C-S-H. These microstructural changes impact the total porosity and hence cement strength in opposing ways, namely porosity is reduced with increasing ettringite fraction while the space filling capacity of the C-S-H is also reduced due to the lower water content of the C-S-H. These findings have important implications for optimizing the mechanical properties and durability of ternary blends...|$|R

Decreases in pore tortuosity but also in wettability have been identified as the most relevant parameters explaining these evolutions with time, as a result of combined effects of root growth and irrigation regimes. So, this study aimed to analyse the respective effects of root development and irrigation strategies on the physical and hydraulic properties of four different growing media (peat, pine bark, coir and wood fiber) within a culture of Rosa × hybrida “Radrazz” grown with and without plants during four months, for which watering was managed in three different ways: (1) water potential always maintained at − 1 kPa, (2) irrigation triggered when water potential reached − 10 kPa or (3) − 30 kPa. Root volume, total volume, air and water retention properties, hydraulic conductivity, relative gas diffusivity, and wettability were evaluated at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the experiment. The study showed important changes over time, mainly due to the hydric history, leading to large and higher modifications of pore size distribution, tortuosity and wettability as a function of the intensity of the drying/wetting cycles. Changes in wettability, and notably, more hydrophobic properties of the <b>coarser</b> <b>porosity</b> due to its drainage during the drying processes were suggested for explaining the general physical/hydraulic behaviour of growing media, and the decrease in shoot dry mass and root content with the intensity of irrigation regimes. Although they were with smaller amplitude to those resulting of the hydric history, positive effects of the root system were shown, increasing pore connectivity, relative gas diffusivity and limiting the decrease in total pore volume, and moreover, limiting the degradation in wettability...|$|R

Accordingly, the highest (54.58  %) mean value of total porosity was observed in the soils of the grazing land, while the lowest (47.57  %) was recorded in the soils of the cultivated land (Table  2). Within a soil depth, the mean total porosity of the surface soil was significantly {{greater than that of}} the subsurface soil (Table  2). The total porosity increased from the cultivated land followed by the forest land to the grazing land and decreased along the soil depths of the study area. This trend could be attributed to the low OM content of the cultivated land and the subsurface soil depth and the increase in bulk density with soil depth, respectively. Finding reported by Negassa (2001) also indicated lower total porosity in the cultivated land and subsoil depths was a result of low OM in the Dystric Nitosols of Bako area.

40|$|Limestone {{dolomitization}} is {{an example}} of a fluid-induced mineralogical transformation that commonly affects extensive rock volumes. To understand the mechanisms enabling these efficient replacement reactions, we investigated experimentally the dolomitization of a fractured calcite marble under flow-through conditions at mild hydrothermal conditions. Contrary to most earlier studies of coupled dissolution reprecipitation reactions that were conducted using small, individual grains, in this study, the integrity of the rock was preserved, so that the experiment explored the links between flow in a fracture and fluid–rock interaction. In these experiments, grain boundaries acted as microreactors, in which a Mg-poor ‘protodolomite’ formed initially, and then transformed into dolomite. The difficulty in nucleating dolomite played a key role in controlling the evolution of the porosity, by allowing for (1) initial dissolution along grain boundaries, and (2) formation of <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity</b> at the reaction interface. This porosity evolution not only enabled the reaction to progress efficiently, but also controlled the mineralogy of the system, as shown by brucite replacing calcite near the fracture once the fluid along calcite grain boundaries became sufficiently connected to the fluid flowing through the fracture. This study illustrates the role of grain boundaries, porosity evolution and nucleation in controlling reaction progress as well as the nature and textures of the products in pervasive mineralogical transformations.

40|$|Synopsis: The {{transport}} {{properties of}} concrete {{are critical to}} its field performance. Commonly encountered degradation mechanisms are dependent on ionic diffusivity, sorptivity, and permeability. In this paper, virtual testing of two of these concrete transport properties, diffusivity and permeability, will be reviewed. Virtual evaluations of ionic diffusion (and equivalently conductivity) will be presented as one example that spans {{the full range of}} applications, from computations on cement paste with micrometer resolution to a virtual rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) that simulates the standard ASTM test method for conductivity of concrete cylinders. At the concrete scale, a hard core/soft shell (HCSS) microstructural model may be employed to estimate diffusion coefficients, while finite difference solutions of Fick’s laws that incorporate sorption/reaction may be employed to evaluate remediation strategies for real world bridge decks. Virtual evaluations of permeability are dependent on a sufficient resolution of the pore sizes that are critical for flow under pressure. Two recent successful evaluations will be presented in this paper: the permeability of cement pastes (hydroceramics) cured at elevated temperatures, where transport is controlled by micrometer-sized pores, and the permeability of pervious concrete that is dominated by its <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity</b> (scale of mm).

The influence of environmental factors such as drying and carbonation on the pore structure and diffusional properties of OPC, OPC/ 30 %PFA and OPC/ 65 %BFS hardened pastes was investigated. Specimens were desorbed from a saturated surface dry condition to a near constant weight at 65 % relative humidity (RH) while others were simultaneously exposed to a 65 % RH atmosphere and a carbon dioxide atmosphere of up to 5 % by volume until there were fully carbonated. The presence of the interfacial zone at the cement paste-aggregate interface was critically reviewed and identified. The influence of the interfacial zone on porosity and chloride ingress in assumed periodic composites of glass bead mortars was also studied. The investigations have demonstrated the following: (a) The use of fly ash and slag in blended cement pastes {{has resulted in a}} marked reduction in capillary porosity and rate of chloride ingress. (b) The ratio of oxygen to chloride diffusion coefficients increased from values close to 1 in permeable pastes, to values of around 15 in low-permeability blended fly ash and slag pastes.

Undisturbed soil cylinders and single aggregates (0 - 10 cm layer) were collected from untilled and conventionally tilled sites in the Santiago (STG) and Mapocho Soil Series (MPC). General soil properties and shear parameters were determined. The shear tests were conducted on confined and free-draining aggregates and on soil cores, equilibrated at field capacity and air-dried, to obtain data on cohesion and {{angle of internal friction}} in the samples. Dry aggregates from the tilled sites showed 40 and 70 % greater cohesion compared to untilled sites in STG and MPC soils, respectively, associated with a decrease in <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity</b> in the STG soil and a decrease in organic matter in the MPC soil, thus reducing its friability.

Two impingers with an extra <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity</b> fritted disc were used to dispense the smoke in the aqueous trapping medium. Cigarettes were smoked on a 20 -port Borgwaldt RM 20 /CS smoking machine using modified FTC (Federal Trade Commission) conditions.

This {{new technique}} accounts for the contributions to smoke pH from both the vapor phase and the particulate phase of smoke. The repeatability of this new technique was determined on eighteen replicates of a commercially available non-menthol, filter cigarette. Each measurement was done on a different day to check for a possible drift in pH with time. The mean pH value for the chosen sample {{was found to be}} 4. 97 {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 07 pH units. The smoke pH values for over 150 commercially available cigarette brands with a variety of “tar” levels were determined.

40|$|Aggregate {{hierarchy}} and porosity changes in aggregate beds {{as a consequence}} of wetting-drying cycles were studied in two Andisols and one Mollisol from Chile, collected at two depths. Bulk density and indirect tensile strength were measured in aggregates of different sizes. Aggregate beds were prepared in cylinders with two size classes. Six wetting-drying cycles between 0 and - 60 hPa were applied. Bulk density (Db) of soil matrix was controlled after each cycle, and the macroporosity was calculated. A repellency index was measured in one of the Andisols. In addition, also the air permeability was measured after the sixth cycle. It could be proofed, that the aggregate strength is an appropriate parameter to evaluate the aggregate hierarchy, and this parameter is also more sensitive than aggregate Db to discriminate between the effects of land-use intensity. Aggregate strength is furthermore well correlated with changes in pore water pressure and can be applied to relate strength values with aggregate development level. Only if the predrying exceeds pF > 3. 0, aggregate strength correlates with Db. The more pronounced is the land-use, the higher is the increase of Db values for aggregate beds. The decrease of <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity</b> during wetting-drying cycles can be explained by mass differences between saturated and equilibrated water conditions that considers the water around aggregates and within the contact area. Nevertheless, the relation of relative macroporosity change, calculated by P-exped where D-agg IS the Db measured by clod method, and the relative Db change, is useful to explain possible presence of coarse pores inside the aggregates. The newly formed porosity prevents the water repellency, but after six cycles of drying, the repellency index increased in the topsoil while we could detect a decrease in the subsoil samples (under defined conditions in the laboratory) which we assume to be caused by microbial activity. The approaching of aggregates by drying cycles generates in Andisols a reduced area to air fluxes, with low values of air permeability...|$|E

40|$|The pseudomorphic {{replacement}} of Carrara marble by calcium phosphates {{was used as}} a model system in order to study the influence of different fluid pathways for reaction front propagation induced by fluid-rock interaction. In this model, grain boundaries present in the rock as well as the transient porosity structures developing throughout the replacement reaction enable the reaction front to progress further into the rock {{as well as to the}} center of each single grain until transformation is complete. Hydrothermal treatment of the marble using phosphate bearing solutions led to the formation of hydroxylapatite and β-TCP; the formation of the latter phase was probably promoted by the presence of ~ 0. 6 wt. % Mg in the parent carbonate phase. Completely transformed single grains show a distinctive zoning, both in composition and texture. Whereas areas next to the grain boundary consist of nearly pure hydroxylapatite and show a <b>coarse</b> <b>porosity,</b> areas close to the center of the single grains show a high amount of β-TCP and a very fine porous microstructure. If fluorine was added as an additional solution component, up to 3 wt. % of F were incorporated into the product apatite and the formation of β-TCP was avoided. The use of the isotope 18 O as a chronometer for the replacement reaction makes it possible to reconstruct the chronological development of the calcium phosphate reaction front. Raman analysis revealed that the incorporation of 18 O in the PO 4 tetrahedron of hydroxylapatite results in the development of distinct profiles in the calcium phosphate reaction front perpendicular to the grain boundaries of the marble. Through the use of the 18 O chronometer, it is possible to estimate and compare the time effectiveness of the different fluid pathways in this model system. The results demonstrate that the grain boundaries are an effective pathway enabling the fluid to penetrate the rock more than one order of magnitude faster compared to the newly developing channel-like porosity structures, which act as pathways towards the center of single mineral grains. Thus, after only short reaction durations, it may be possible for the fluid to progress relatively large distances along the grain boundaries without developing broad reaction fronts along the path. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} dust (EAFD) is a {{by-product}} of the electric steelmaking industry produced in large quantities around the world. In Saudi Arabia, a form of EAFD known as Bag House Dust (BHD) is being used in small amounts as concrete additive, because higher levels of addition caused excessive retardation of setting and hardening. The use of this material is recent, therefore {{little is known about}} its effects on durability. This research aims to examine effects of BHD additions on certain properties of cement pastes, mortars and concretes, particularly those believed to affect the susceptibility of embedded steel reinforcement to chloride-induced corrosion as this is a major cause of degradation of reinforced concrete structures in the Arabian Gulf region. Studies of the effects of 2 % BHD addition on pore solution chemistry of hydrated-cement pastes with various levels of internal chloride contamination indicated that both free chloride concentration and hydroxyl ion concentration increased. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel in chloride-contaminated mortars showed that the rates of corrosion were reduced slightly in the presence of BHD. Measurements of the <b>coarse</b> capillary <b>porosities</b> of hydrated-cement pastes revealed significantly lower results in 2 - 3 % BHD-specimens compared to plain cement pastes. Attempts to measure the consequent changes in apparent diffusion coefficients of chloride in related concrete specimens showed that the BHD additions caused no adverse effects on chloride penetration rates. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of steel bars embedded in mortars exposed to chloride ingress at 20 °C and 40 °C demonstrated that the threshold chloride level for the initiation of crevice corrosion was significantly increased by the presence of BHD. This was thought to be partly influenced by BHD in reducing bleeding which affects the integrity of the layer of hydration products formed around the steel surface. Having found that 2 - 3. 5 % BHD additions had no detrimental effects on the properties studied, the possibility of using chloride-free accelerators to increase levels of BHD addition without causing excessive retardation of cement hydration was investigated. Calcium nitrite and calcium formate were both found to be reasonably effective in increasing the rates of hardening of specimens with 8 % addition of BHD.

Topsoils {{affected by}} surface mining suffer severe physical degradation and lose {{most of their}} earthworm populations. After mining, replaced soils are planted to grassland and managed to improve soil structure. Earthworm inoculation into selected restored areas produced populations {{similar to those of}} undisturbed soils within 3 years. Soil properties in inoculated areas were compared with those of controls to evaluate the contribution of casts to bulk soil aggregation, and soil organic matter and root content responses to earthworm activity. Crumb <b>porosity</b> and <b>coarse</b> particle content were measured in water-stable macro-aggregates and earthworm casts to establish whether aggregates were formed by earthworms. Over a 5 - to 6 -year period, inoculation increased stable aggregation (> 2 ?m, > 60 ?m and > 3 mm), even at 0 - to 5 -cm depth where it reduced soil organic matter content. Productivity and root content were also increased by inoculation; roots and organic matter were re-distributed to greater depth. Crumb porosity decreased with casts > aggregates (inoculated plots) > aggregates (control plots). Coarse particle content increased with casts <aggregates (inoculated plots) <aggregates (control plots). <b>Coarse</b> particle and <b>porosity</b> data were consistent with much of the newly aggregated soil being processed and formed by earthworms as casts. Whilst levels of soil organic matter were often closely associated with percentage stable aggregation, root content showed weaker associations. Aggregation percentage was most closely associated with abundance of Aporrectodea longa, although at particular depths significant correlations were also obtained for Aporrectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus terrestris. Results suggest that earthworms, rather than plant roots, initiate aggregation in severely degraded grassland soils. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Though the {{carbonation}} of cementitious materials {{has been}} widely studied, numerous problems remain unsolved. The lack of quantitative data especially appears when one tries to model the carbonation process {{with the aim of}} predicting the lifetime of a reinforced concrete structure. This reason has justified this study which deals essentially with four subjects namely: the modification of the microstructure caused by carbonation, the measure of the diffusivity of CO 2 and O 2 through carbonated hydrated cement paste (hcp) and mortar, the carbonation shrinkage and the progress of the carbonation into mortars exposed outdoors. The accelerated carbonation of hcp and mortars leads to large modifications of the porous system. The lower the water/cement ratio or, in other words, the porosity, the higher the reduction of porosity. The pore-size distributions, measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry, show that the pores of all sizes are affected. Therefore, in hcp of W/C ≤ 0. 5, the volume of the pores with a radius < 0. 1 μm especially decreases. The water vapor sorption isotherms are strongly modified by carbonation. The equilibrium water amounts decrease considerably at all relative humidities after carbonation. The hcp of different W/C get similar sorption isotherms. The BET specific surface area is reduced of 50 % by carbonation. The porosity of the studied mortars is little modified by carbonation. This is due to the high level of big pores in these mortars, which is much higher than that of hcp. The influence of the water content of hcp on the diffusivity of CO 2 and O 2 is clearly lower than that observed on non-carbonated materials. It is only above 90 % rh and for the less porous hcp where micro- and mesopores dominates, that the influence of the water content becomes noticeable. These facts are a direct consequence of the strong decrease of the internal surface due to carbonation. On the studied mortars the influence of the water content is still weaker due to their <b>coarser</b> <b>porosity.</b> The diffusion coefficients of CO 2 and O 2 strongly depend on the porosity and are an exponential function of the latter. The same diffusion coefficients determined on the mortars seem to show a minimum as the sand concentration is increased. In our case this minimum is located at a sand concentration of about 50 % by volume. At first sight, this behavior appears peculiar because the amount of nonporous sand has been increased. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that as the concentration in cement decreases, a lot of cement particles are too big to fill the porosity between sand particles which so acts as a sieve. The lack of cement paste to fill the voids and the augmentation of the "auréoles de transition" can also play a role. The diffusion coefficient Of CO 2 is between 60 and 65 % of that of O 2. This is due to the bigger size of the molecule of CO 2. It is shown that the Knudsen diffusion predominates in hcp of W/C ≤ 0. 5, whilst in that of W/C = 0. 8 and in the studied mortars, it is rather the bulk diffusion which predominates. It is also shown that the surface diffusion is certainly negligible for CO 2 and O 2. Carbonation shrinkage of autoclaved aerated concrete artificially carbonated with 2 % CO 2 is maximum at about 70 % rh. As this material contains practically no Ca(OH) 2, the shrinkage is thus due essentially to the carbonation of calcium silicate hydrates. The time necessary to reach half the final shrinkage is minimum for hcp of 0. 3 ≤ W/C ≤ 0. 8 between 50 % and 80 % rh. The amount of carbonate in carbonated hcp shows a maximum when represented as a function of the relative humidity at which the carbonation shrinkage has been measured. The value of this maximum increases as W/C and its position moves towards rising humidities when W/C increases. On the other hand, no simple relationship was observed between the amount of carbonate and the carbonation shrinkage. The highest measured carbonation shrinkage reaches about 4 mm/m for aerated concrete and 3. 5 mm/m for hcp. The rate of carbonation is limited at low rh by the rate of diffusion of CO 2, if enough water is present to catalyze the reaction, and, at higher rh, by the rate of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor diffusion. These results do not allow us to draw general conclusions on the amount of shrinkage, because the humidity inside the carbonating material depends not only on the rh of the environment, but also on the rate of diffusion of CO 2 and O 2 that depends on water content, depending itself on the size of the specimens. Small slabs of mortar were placed outdoors, one face directly exposed to rain or snow, whilst the other was protected. The distribution of carbonate as a function of the depth was quantitatively measured. The amount of carbonate increases as the cement. At constant cement content, it increases as the mixing water. The amount of carbonate formed and the depth of carbonation are higher than on the protected faces of the mortars, except for the most porous mortars where the contrary is observed. The mortars of common consistency, neither too dry nor too wet, present a well defined carbonation front. The more porous the mortar, the wider the front. On the other hand, no carbonation front is observed in the most porous mortars: the carbonation is not complete and reaches higher depths. In such mortars, the CO 2 diffuses in the bigger pores before having fully reacted with alkaline compounds...|$|R
40|$|Cement {{replacement}} {{materials are}} by-products {{used to produce}} high performance concrete. Published data {{on the effects of}} combinations of mineral admixtures in concrete on the microstructural and performance-related properties under different curing regimes are comparatively little. Further the correlation of strength of concrete to its permeability and pore structure is also not clear. The main objective of this research is to study the performance of various combinations of fly ash/silica fume and slag/silica fume concretes under three different curing regimes, viz. continuous moist curing, no moist curing after demolding and air drying after 7 -days of initial moist curing. Six different concrete mixes were prepared with ordinary portland cement and a blend of portland cement and combinations of fly ash+silica fume and slag+silica fume The water-to-cementitious materials ratio of all the concrete mixtures was kept constant at 0. 45. The properties investigated included workability of the fresh concrete, engineering properties such as cube and modified cube compressive strength, flexural strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, pulse velocity, shrinkage and swelling, permeability and microstructural properties such as porosity and pore size distribution. The results show that prolonged dry curing results in lower strengths, higher <b>porosity,</b> <b>coarser</b> pore structure and more permeable concretes. It was found that the loss in early age compressive strength due to incorporation of fly ash or slag can be compensated for by the addition of small amounts of silica fume. The engineering and microstructural properties and permeability of concretes containing fly ash or slag appear to be more sensitive to poor curing than the control concrete, with the sensitivity increasing with increasing amounts of fly ash or slag in the mixtures. The incorporation of high volumes of slag in the concrete mixtures refined the pore structure and produced concretes with very low porosity and threshold diameters. The results emphasize that a minimum 7 -day wet curing is needed for concrete with mineral admixtures to develop the full potential, and that continued exposure to a drying environment can have adverse effects on the long-term durability of inadequately cured slag or fly ash concretes. The results also confirm that compressive strength alone is not an adequate index to judge the performance of concrete, and the knowledge of the strength, pore structure and permeability are required for this purpose. Slag/silica fume concrete mixtures showed better performance than fly ash/silica fume concrete mixtures as regards the development of engineering and microstructural properties...|$|R
40|$|Menorca is {{subdivided}} in main {{regions with}} different stratigraphic and tectonic characteristics. To the north, folded, thrusted and faulted Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Paleogene rocks compose the Tramuntana region. To the south, upper-Miocene carbonate and, locally, siliciclastic rocks compose the Migjorn region. Upper Miocene rocks unconformably overlie Paleozoic to middle Miocene basement. In the Migjorn, three Miocene depositional units were recognized (Pomar et al., 2002 and references herein) : the Basal Conglomeratic Unit (Burdigalian p. p.), interpreted as near-shore to fan-delta deposits; the Lower Bar Unit (early Tortonian), {{interpreted as a}} distally steepened carbonate ramp; the Reef Complex (upper Tortonian - lower Messinian), a reef-rimmed platform prograding complex. Within the ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates and bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), crossbedded grainstones (middle- ramp), rhodolithic rudstone clinobeds (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestone-packstone with planktonic foraminifers (outer ramp). The cross-bedded units here analysed occur at the transition lower slope-outer ramp. They infill the axial depression of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp succession. The wedge-shaped cross-bedded units, 10 - 12 m thick, pinch out basinward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Several amalgamated cross-laminated bodies, 40 cm- to 2 m wide each with erosive base compose each unit. They are composed by rhodolithic-mollusk rudstone with <b>coarse</b> grain/packstone matrix. <b>Porosity</b> is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Matrix consists of red-algal-, bivalve-, echinoderm, coral fragments, and benthic foraminifers. Ooids are, locally abundant along with limestone pebbles. Pebbles are flat, 5 - to 10 -cm wide, of oolitic grainstone, sometimes with mollusk borings. Cross bedding is underlined by the abundance and orientation of coarser components. Cross-laminae within units dip upslope (8 ° to 35 °) forming backstepping backsets. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction (or a local break on the slope), and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction. In Menorca, these sedimentary structures have been interpreted by Pomar et al. (2002), as backset beds related to up-stream migrating hydraulic jump where slide scars acted as slope channels funneling platform debris down the slope. The occurrence of aragonitic components (oolites, corals) within these units, absent in the ramp system, and the scars development {{at the end of}} the ramp progradation, suggest the involvement of Reef Complex sediment. Therefore, those events, involved both sediment of the upper Tortonian distally steepened ramp and part of the Reef Complex. These structures have been mostly described in different environments of terrigenous systems. In carbonate systems are scarcely described and none from carbonate ramps. The architecture characterizing these upslope cross-bedded beds seams to call for a scour-and-fill process, therefore initially the action of a strong scouring event immediately followed by depositional events. The presence of these bodies in various intervals suggests the repetitive occurrence of this process. In the studied system, deep-scouring events on the platform could be represented by slope failures that induced tsunami events or by eustatic variations, able to create strong downslope flows directed offshore. Scours have been rapidly infilled by shallow-water sediment...|$|R
