25|$|About 3,350 {{transfer}} students entered UCLA in Fall 2016, 83% of whom {{came from the}} <b>California</b> <b>Community</b> Colleges System. Over the past 15 years, more than 45,000 students have transferred to UCLA. Between one-half to one-third of baccalaureate degrees are awarded to students who transferred to UCLA.

UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process starting Fall 2007. The holistic admissions process evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, their personal hardships and unusual circumstances at home.|$|E
