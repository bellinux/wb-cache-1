5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the <b>cochlea,</b> a spiral-shaped structure. The <b>cochlea</b> consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the <b>cochlea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth.

Journal also known as: Australian Journal of Oto-laryngologyCochlea implantation at an early age is important in rehabilitating profoundly hearing impaired children. Given the incidence of pneumococcal otitis media in young children, there has been concern that cochlear implantation could increase the possibility of otitis media, leading to labyrinthitis in this age group. Clinical experience has not indicated an increase in the frequency of otitis media and labyrinthitis in implanted adults or children over two years. However, labyrinthitis has occurred in implanted animals with otitis media. In order {{to assess the impact of}} cochlear implants on the occurrence of labyrinthitis, pneumococcal otitis media was induced in 21 kittens. Thirty-two kitten <b>cochleas</b> were implanted, of which 9 had a fascial graft and 9 a Gelfoam® graft. Nine control <b>cochleas</b> were unimplanted.

It is largely unknown how sound is received by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory meatus is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in the tympanic bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that vibrations passing through the bone is important.

The {{present study}} examines {{the effects of}} long-term electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve on cochlear histopathology and spiral ganglion cell survival in young sensorineural deafened cats. Eight kittens were deafened using kanamycin and ethacrynic acid, and implanted with bipolar or monopolar scala tympani electrodes. Following recovery from surgery the animals were unilaterally stimulated using charge balanced biphasic current pulses for 450 - 1730 hours over implant periods of up to four months. Charge densities varied from 0. 6 - 0. 9 µC. cm ^- 2 geom. per phase for monopolar electrodes to 12 - 26 µC. cm ^- 2 geom. per phase for the bipolar electrodes. Electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) were periodically monitored during stimulation {{to confirm that the}} stimulus levels were above threshold, and to monitor any change in the response of the auditory nerve. Following completion of the stimulation program <b>cochleae</b> were prepared for histological examination. EABRs exhibited relatively stable thresholds for both stimulated and implanted, unstimulated control <b>cochleae</b> for the stimulus duration. While the growth in response amplitude as a function of stimulus current remained stable for the bipolar control and monopolar stimulated <b>cochleae,</b> the five <b>cochleae</b> chronically stimulated using bipolar electrodes exhibited a moderate to large increase in response amplitude. These increases were associated with a more widespread fibrous tissue response which may have altered the current distribution within these <b>cochleae.</b> Implanted control <b>cochleae</b> exhibited significantly less tissue response within the scala tympani. Importantly, we observed no statistically significant difference in the spiral ganglion cell density associated with chronic electrical stimulation when compared with unstimulated control <b>cochleae.</b> While the present study supports the safe application of cochlear implants in young profoundly deafened children, it does not corroborate previous studies that have reported electrical stimulation providing a trophic effect on degenerating auditory nerve fibres.

Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a <b>cochlea,</b> but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the <b>cochlea</b> of the auditory system.|$|E

As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the <b>cochlea.</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Focused multipolar (FMP) {{stimulation}} {{has been}} shown to produce restricted neural activation using intracochlear stimulation in animals with a normal population of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). However, in a clinical setting, the widespread loss of SGNs and peripheral fibres following deafness is expected to influence the effectiveness of FMP. APPROACH: We compared the efficacy of FMP stimulation to both monopolar (MP) and tripolar (TP) stimulation in long-term deafened cat <b>cochleae</b> (n =  8). Unlike our previous study, these <b>cochleae</b> contained < 10 % of the normal SGN population adjacent to the electrode array. We also evaluated the effect of electrode position on stimulation modes by using either modiolar facing or lateral wall facing half-band electrodes. The spread of neural activity across the inferior colliculus, a major nucleus within the central auditory pathway, was used as a measure of spatial selectivity. MAIN RESULTS: In <b>cochleae</b> with significant SGN degeneration, we observed that FMP and TP stimulation resulted in greater spatial selectivity than MP stimulation (p <  0. 001). However, thresholds were significantly higher for FMP and TP stimulation compared to MP stimulation (p <  0. 001). No difference between FMP and TP stimulation was found in any measures. The high threshold levels for FMP stimulation was significantly reduced without compromising spatial selectivity by varying the degree of current focusing (referred as 'partial-FMP' stimulation). Spatial selectivity of all stimulation modes was unaffected by the electrode position. Finally, spatial selectivity in long-term deafened <b>cochleae</b> was significantly less than that of <b>cochleae</b> with normal SGN population (George S S et al 2014 J. Neural Eng. 11 065003). SIGNIFICANCE: The present results indicate that the greater spatial selectivity of FMP and TP stimulation over MP stimulation is maintained in <b>cochleae</b> with significant neural degeneration and is not adversely affected by electrode position. The greater spatial selectivity of FMP and TP stimulation would be expected to result in improved clinical performance. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the <b>cochlea,</b> the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the <b>cochlea</b> is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate.

This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise.

They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a <b>cochlea</b> in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E

The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and <b>cochlea.</b> Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating.
