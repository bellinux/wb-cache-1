For <b>closed</b> <b>models,</b> on the other hand, the performance improvement converges to a constant as the simulation length increases...|$|R

We embed these structures in a monster model D of some well-rounded theory and describe them as PAC substructures of D. Assuming that {{the class of}} these existentially <b>closed</b> <b>models</b> is elementary, we show that, under the assumption of having bounded models, its theory is simple and eliminates quantifiers up to some existential formulas - similar to ACFA. Moreover, it codes finite sets and allows a geometric elimination of imaginaries, but not always a weak elimination of imaginaries...|$|R
50|$|In {{homotopy}} theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a Quillen adjunction between two <b>closed</b> <b>model</b> categories C and D is {{a special kind of}} adjunction between categories that induces an adjunction between the homotopy categories Ho(C) and Ho(D) via the total derived functor construction.

50|$|In mathematics, homotopical algebra is a {{collection}} of concepts comprising the nonabelian aspects of homological algebra as well as possibly the abelian aspects as special cases.

40|$|A {{numerical}} double burst {{model of}} the chemical evolution of gas-rich dwarf galaxies has been developed. The model is fitted {{to a sample of}} N/O, O/H, Y and gas fraction observations, where N/O and O/H are the relative abundances by number of nitrogen to oxygen and oxygen to hydrogen, respectively. Y is the abundance by mass of helium. <b>Closed</b> <b>models</b> as well as models including enriched outflow, ordinary outflow and ordinary outflow combined with inflow are considered. The bursts are assumed to be instantaneous but ordered in pairs to explain the scatter in N/O-O/H. The method of gas fraction fitting is revised, and it is found that {{it is very important to}} specify whether dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) or blue compact galaxies (BCGs) are considered. Effective enriched winds fail when fitting N/O, whereas <b>closed</b> <b>models,</b> models with ordinary winds or a combination of ordinary winds and inflow are all viable.
