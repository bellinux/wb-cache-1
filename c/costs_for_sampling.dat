40|$|A {{modeling}} {{approach is}} described for optimizing {{the design and}} operation of groundwater remediation at DNAPL sites that considers uncertainty in site and remediation system characteristics, performance and cost model limitations, and measurement uncertainties that affect predictions of remediation performance and cost. The performance model simulates performance and costs for thermal source zone treatment and enhanced bioremediation with statistical compliance rules and real-time operational system monitoring. An inverse solution is employed to estimate model parameters, parameter covariances, and residual prediction error from site data and a stochastic cost optimization algorithm determines design and operation variables that minimize expected net present value cost over Monte Carlo realizations. The method is implemented in the program SCOToolkit. A series of applications to a hypothetical problem yielded expected cost reductions for site remediation as much as 85 % compared to conventional non-optimized approaches, while also increasing the probability of achieving “no further action” status in a specified timeframe by more than 60 %. Optimizing monitoring frequency for compliance wells used to make no further action determinations as well as operational monitoring used to make decisions on individual remediation system components reveals tradeoffs between increased direct <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis versus decreased construction and operating costs that arise because more data increases decision reliability. Optimizing protocols for operational monitoring and heating unit shutdown protocols for thermal source treatment (incremental versus all-or-none shutdown, soil versus groundwater sampling, number and frequency of samples) produced cost savings of more than 20 %. Defining compliance based on confidence limits of a moving time window regression decreased expected cost and lowered failure probability compared to using measured extreme values over a lookback period. Uncertainty in DNAPL source delineation {{was found to have}} a large effect on the cost and probability of achieving remediation objectives for thermal source remediation...|$|E
40|$|Background As low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses can mutate into high pathogenic viruses the Dutch poultry sector implemented a surveillance system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) based on blood samples. It {{has been suggested}} that egg yolk samples could be sampled instead of blood samples to survey egg layer farms. To support future decision making about AI surveillance economic criteria are important. Therefore a cost analysis is performed on systems that use either blood or eggs as sampled material. Methodology/Principal Findings The effectiveness of surveillance using egg or blood samples was evaluated using scenario tree models. Then an economic model was developed that calculates the total costs for eight surveillance systems that have equal effectiveness. The model considers <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling,</b> sample preparation, sample transport, testing, communication of test results and for the confirmation test on false positive results. The surveillance systems varied in sampled material (eggs or blood), sampling location (farm or packing station) and location of sample preparation (laboratory or packing station). It is shown that a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the packing station and samples prepared in a laboratory had the lowest total costs (i. e. € 273, 393) a year. Compared to this a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory, and the currently implemented system in which blood is sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory have 6 % and 39 % higher costs respectively. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that surveillance for avian influenza on egg yolk samples can be done at lower costs than surveillance based on blood samples. The model can be used in future comparison of surveillance systems for different pathogens and hazard...|$|E

40|$|Background: Following {{the first}} finding of Echinococcus multilocularis in Sweden in 2011, 2985 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were {{analysed}} by the segmental sedimentation and counting technique. This is a labour intensive method and requires {{handling of the}} whole carcass of the fox, resulting in a costly analysis. In {{an effort to reduce}} the cost of labour and sample handling, an alternative method has been developed. The method is sensitive and partially automated for detection of E. multilocularis in faecal samples. The method has been used in the Swedish E. multilocularis monitoring program for 2012 ¿ 2013 on more than 2000 faecal samples. MethodsWe describe a new semi-automated magnetic capture probe DNA extraction method and real time hydrolysis probe polymerase chain reaction assay (MC-PCR) for the detection of E. multilocularis DNA in faecal samples from red fox. The diagnostic sensitivity was determined by validating the new method against the sedimentation and counting technique in fox samples collected in Switzerland where E. multilocularis is highly endemic. ResultsOf 177 foxes analysed by the sedimentation and counting technique, E. multilocularis was detected in 93 animals. Eighty-two (88 %, 95 % C. I 79. 8 - 93. 9) of these were positive in the MC-PCR. In foxes with more than 100 worms, the MC-PCR was positive in 44 out of 46 (95. 7 %) cases. The two MC-PCR negative samples originated from foxes with only immature E. multilocularis worms. In foxes with 100 worms or less, (n¿=¿ 47), 38 (80. 9 %) were positive in the MC-PCR. The diagnostic specificity of the MC-PCR was evaluated using fox scats collected within the Swedish screening. Of 2158 samples analysed, two were positive. This implies that the specificity is at least 99. 9 % (C. I. = 99. 7 - 100). ConclusionsThe MC-PCR proved to have a high sensitivity and a very high specificity. The test is partially automated but also possible to perform manually if desired. The test is well suited for nationwide E. multilocularis surveillance programs where sampling of fox scats is done to reduce the <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>sampling</b> and where a test with a high sensitivity and a very high specificity is needed...|$|E

Small aliquots of dissolver solution that contain 10 $sup - 6 $g of U and 10 $sup - 8 $ g of Pu are adequate for preparing about ten resin beads.

40|$|Many {{factors are}} {{important}} during sampling of contaminated soil. One {{of these is}} the sample sizes used. By estimation of the Heterogeneity Invariant (HI) it is possible to balance the sample size to one uncertainty contribution that is attached to sampling and sample handling. This is called the Fundamental error. Large overestimation of HI leads to larger <b>samples</b> and increased <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> <b>sample</b> handling. Large underestimation of HI leads to too small samples and to a larger uncertainty contribution, and possible skewed samples. Some methods to estimate HI is described and discussed from the perspective of contaminated soil sampling. Contaminated soil is a widely used concept, it is quite different challenges to sample if the contaminant is e. g. metallic particles, in-evaporated solutions or oils. None of the discussed methods is without any limitation. Field portable X-ray spectroscopy fluorescence is (XRF) is a popular instrument to analyse for metals in contaminated soils. It can provide quick and cheap analysis. The most prepared samples are dried, ground finely and put into Mylar thin film XRF sample cups. The sample volume is about 5 - 7 cm 3, but the actually measured volume is only a fraction thereof. In the, likely, case of segregation in the sample volume this can lead to a biased measurement. Mechanisms for segregation in the XRF sample cup are discussed. Further suggestions are made to reduce the segregation. Despite precautions to reduce the effect of segregation it is difficult to eliminate it. Godkänd; 2007; 20071113 (ysko...|$|R
