5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. She argues that what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a weapon to terrorise the people.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> evidence.|$|E
5|$|Astrid had two deckhouses: one at {{the stern}} with navigational {{equipment}} and maps, and another forward containing a bar. The lower deck had twelve 2-person cabins (of which three <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> 3-person cabins) as well as showers, toilets and a galley.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of permanent members; the opacity of appointment; and {{the inclusion of}} members of the Government, political parties, and their allies may mean that the PCMR <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a tool for the government of the day to remain in power despite its waning popularity in the future.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E

5|$|Heaphy's {{contract}} with the company was for three years, primarily to create art that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> advertising for the company. In doing so he travelled extensively {{around the country and}} occasionally participated in overland treks, living out of a tent or staying with local Māori. He also sailed around parts of the country aboard the Tory and learned surveying from its captain. Another employee of the company travelling on the Tory was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{nationalist}} {{and military}} hardliners, particularly {{leaders of the}} intelligence agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit, Opsus, saw the Portuguese coup {{as an opportunity for}} East Timor's integration with Indonesia. The central government and military feared that an East Timor governed by leftists <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a base for incursions by unfriendly powers into Indonesia, and also that an independent East Timor within the archipelago could inspire secessionist sentiments within Indonesian provinces.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{first aid}} {{has been used}} as an {{emergency}} treatment for diving injuries for years. If given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as decreasing the number of recompression treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.|$|E

5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, {{as it has}} been suggested that the criminal trial <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, {{it has been suggested that}} an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would {{come into contact with}} the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|St Deiniol's is {{no longer}} in use; in 2006, a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no {{services}} had been held for a number of years, and added that ivy was growing across the building. The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll, served by St Mary's, Llanfairpwll. As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for £50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> part of trials.|$|E
5|$|The Memphis {{relocation}} {{effort was}} led by AutoZone founder Pitt Hyde, who promised to purchase 50% of the team. The city had a 1991 venue, Pyramid Arena, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a temporary home until a new US$250 million venue was ready for use in 2004. The venue would be publicly financed through sales tax rebates, government-backed bonds and hotel and car rental taxes. The Memphis efforts to get an NBA team had started in 1997, following the relocation of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E

5|$|To keep up morale {{following}} Amherst's departure, Maxwell began organising {{his remaining}} 200 men (and one woman) {{to secure their}} position and gather supplies. The men were divided into parties, with one ordered to dig a well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could. A third party was ordered to clear a path to the island's central hill, where a cool cave <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a larder and trees felled to form a protective stockade. By {{the end of the}} first day the well was producing a steady supply of water.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} was {{canceled}} on 11 August 1945, {{when she was about}} 22% complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945. Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the some $30million it would cost to complete the ship {{enough to be able to}} launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the builder's ways.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily {{be used as a}} sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
