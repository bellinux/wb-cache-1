2500|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} {{run for the}} U.S. Senate, Steiger {{attempted to}} return to the Arizona State Senate in 1978. [...] This was followed in 1982 with him running for governor {{as a member of the}} Libertarian Party. [...] His goal during the campaign was to obtain five percent of the vote and establish ballot access for the Libertarian party. [...] He succeeded with 5.1% of the vote, the fourth-best result for any Libertarian gubernatorial candidate. [...] During this time, Steiger saw a steady erosion of his approval. [...] As Prescott Councilman Ken Bennett explained, Steiger was popular in his hometown as a [...] "brash young congressman out in Washington telling people what to do. [...] But they liked him less when he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and started telling our people what to do. [...] Sam was the kiss of death in Prescott for a while. His popularity was at an all-time low. [...] But he was back to being a hero with that crosswalk." ...|$|E
2500|$|The case {{highlighted}} {{a number}} of issues including social housing policies for single men, communication between governmental agencies, standards of psychiatric care and the conduct of the police search operation. The nature of the crime and the age of the victim caused a wave of public anger and protests, and threats and violence were also directed at the local council. The first solicitor appointed to represent Armstrong withdrew from the case, stating [...] "I have my staff to think about." [...] In 2010 the case began to attract news media coverage again when it was revealed that Armstrong could be released from prison in 2011 but would be exempt from signing the Sex Offenders' Register – despite the murder being one of those that {{led to the creation of}} the register – as he was never formally charged with a sexual offence. Councillor Kevin Kelly warned that despite the passage of time community feelings about the case were still very strong and stated: [...] "If he ever <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> he would be lynched." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to come back up here and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe {{get a chance to}} coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{you have}} not yet told me why you <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to-night? If Citizen Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all that has occurred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't," [...] Nasmyth answered, and it {{was evident}} that he was serious. [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> feeling that I had had quite enough of it." ...|$|E
