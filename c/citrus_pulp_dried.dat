40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effects of different feed concentrates on sheep behaviour. Our hypothesis was that citric pulp would stimulate rumination and be capable of replacing other concentrates traditionally used for feeding in confinement, {{to reduce the risk of}} urolithiasis. Ten adult Santa In&# 234;s sheep were distributed in a Latin square with five different diets, one control diet with 80 % hay and 20 % commercial feed and four diets containing 30 % coast-cross hay and 70 % of the following concentrates: pelleted <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp,</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> meal, cornmeal or wheat bran. After 21 d of adaptation to each one of the five diets, the sheep were visually monitored for 24 h at 3 min intervals to record the time spent ruminating, time spent eating and time spent resting; the animals' positions (standing or lying down) were also noted. Daytime was considered to be from 06 : 00 h to 18 : 00 h. The data were evaluated using ANOVA, with Tukey post-hoc test or throughout Two-sample T test for circadian and position assessment. <b>Citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> diets resulted in time spent ruminating similar to the control diet (601, 590 and 669 min, respectively), but greater (P< 0. 05) than the cornmeal group (421 min), which showed that <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> generated effective rumination. The estimated saliva production in the control diet (26 L) was greater than in the other groups, and was greater in the <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> groups (24 L/d) than cornmeal (21 L/d).

In addition, the <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> composition contains tannin, saponin, phytate, oxalate, flavonoid, and limonene (Oluremi et al. 2010); regarding tannins, phytate and oxalate are known to affect protein and mineral utilisation in fish nutrition (Francis et al. 2001).|$|R

Experiments were performed using a randomized block design with four incubation periods. Each period featured four replicates per ingredient and four blanks, totaling 16 repetitions per ingredient. The lowest total amount of produced gas (37. 96 mL gincubated DM- 1) and the lowest final pH value (4. 95) were obtained for crude glycerin (P < 0. 05), which, however, exhibited the highest (P < 0. 05) DM degradation. <b>Citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> produced the largest amount (P < 0. 05) of CH 4 per gram of incubated DM (13. 56 mL g- 1). However, when methane production was expressed per gram of degraded feed, the ingredients with lower degradation values, such as soybean hulls and corn silage, produced more CH 4 per gram of degraded DM. <b>Citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> and corn grain produced more (P < 0. 05) CO 2 per gram of incubated DM. However, per gram of degraded food, <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> produced the largest amount of CO 2 (P < 0. 05).

However, for the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, replacing <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> by coffee hulls may reduce milk production costs, since <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> needs to be imported from another state, while coffee hulls are highly available at essentially no cost. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the performance of crossbred cows fed concentrates containing 25 % coffee hulls (Coffee) or 25 % <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> (Pulp) {{as a replacement for}} ground corn grain (Corn; 47. 4 % in the concentrate). Forty-two cows were blocked based on milk yield and allocated to one of the three treatments for 56 days, following a 14 -day standardization period.

Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to define a methodology for evaluating the potential biogas production available from <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> and olive pomace, which are suitable agricultural by-products for biogas production. In the first phase of the study, the spatial distribution of both olive and citrus-producing areas was analysed in Sicily, a geographical area of the Mediterranean basin highly representative of these types of cultivation. Then, a GIS-based model, which had been previously defined and utilised to evaluate the amount of <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> and olive pomace production, was applied to this case study.
