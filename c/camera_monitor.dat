The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.|$|E

Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault."

Enraged the guard takes the <b>camera</b> <b>monitor</b> and tosses it into the garbage bin. As the guard returns to his desk the song has just ended, in the background the band can be seen leaving with several pieces of stolen artwork from the museum along with taking the monitor he just tossed, revealing that the video was used to distract the guard.|$|E
5000|$|Max Nicholson of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] score of 7.5 out of 10, noting the [...] "double whammy" [...] of the {{tackling}} both the social etiquette of toilet seats and the Transportation Security Administration. Nicholson opined {{that while the}} former topic was not necessarily hilarious, it was nonetheless funny, and that Cartman was well-used to pace what would have otherwise been a difficult joke to mine for an entire episode. Nicholson also felt that while mocking the TSA was somewhat dated, there was still potential for humor in that topic to be exploited, in particular the masturbating TSA security <b>camera</b> <b>monitor.</b> Less funny, Nicholson felt, were the [...] "sueance" [...] scenes that harbored moments that were clever but not outstanding, and felt like padding, though he lauded the convergence of the two storylines by the episode's climax.|$|E

5000|$|The 1993/94 Safari Trek {{though still}} {{fabricated}} on the NPR chassis, had an engine upgrade {{with the introduction}} of the inter-cooled 4BD2Tc which boosted power to 135HP. The Electro-Majic Bed which was previously positioned {{to the front of the}} coach over the captain chairs, was now moved a few feet aft towards the living quarters. It is believed this move was made so that the television set which also doubled as a rear backup <b>camera</b> <b>monitor</b> could be moved front and center just over head of both driver and passenger. There was the continuation of the Pathmaker Edition and same floor plan configurations as before. The 1994 Safari Trek is essentially the same as the previous model year with the exception of new interior and exterior color schemes, an Onan generator now replaced the Generac, and RVA brand leveling jacks replaced the prior year's HWH leveling jack system.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{underground}} passageway, Luke speaks into the camera, trying to reach the other survivors via the monitor. In the next scene the survivors are seen walking around at the river beach amidst the remains of the boats, the <b>camera</b> <b>monitor</b> lies shattered on the ground. Amara reveals that she was supposed to lead the group to do some records at a safe place in the jungle but she refuses to go towards the gateway and leaves, taking one of the boats. Jonathan and Pete continue the search for Luke and Charlie. In the meantime, Luke meets Crypto and follows him deeper into the jungle, where he is attacked by the bat-like creatures. He is rescued by Pete, who suddenly appears together with Jonathan and drives off the creatures. Pete chases them into the jungle, when he is suddenly encircled by the creatures who attack and presumably kill him. Charlie is seen, speaking to the camera at an unknown place, when he is interrupted and forced to hide by Jonathan and Luke, continuing through the jungle. They follow a steep cliffway, when they are hit by a rockfall, causing Jonathan almost to fall down the cliff. As Luke looks up, Charlie is seen with a stick in his hands, indicating that he caused the rocks to fall. Luke tries to help his father who is holding onto a rock, but, telling him that he loves him, he lets go of the rock and falls down the cliff.|$|E

50|$|The I Quit {{match for}} the WWE Championship was the second main event of the night which saw {{defending}} champion Randy Orton face John Cena. After wrestling in the ring Orton threw Cena towards the commentary desk and hit him with a <b>camera</b> <b>monitor.</b> Orton dragged Cena back to the ring hoping to deliver an RKO to him on to a steel chair but Cena countered. The action went to ringside as Orton threw Cena into the steel steps. After Orton had punished Cena with the steel steps the referee asked {{if he wanted to}} quit to which he refused. Orton then handcuffed one of Cena's arms to the middle rope and continued to assault him by hitting him with the referee's microphone. After refusing to quit once again, Cena was placed on the steel steps in a sitting position with his arms in handcuffs hanging {{over the top of the}} ring post. Orton then poured a bottle of water over Cena and when asked if he wanted to quit, Cena spat the water in Orton's face. Orton repeatedly hit Cena with a Singapore cane and choked him with it until Cena delivered a low blow to Orton. Cena escaped from the ring post only to be hit with a steel chair by Orton and handcuffed with one arm to the bottom rope outside the ring. Cena managed to give a one armed Attitude Adjustment to Orton, took the key from around Orton's neck and handcuffed himself to Orton. Whilst still handcuffed together, Cena dragged Orton inside the ring and Orton hit an RKO on Cena. Orton reached for the key to the handcuffs at the other side of the ring but was unsuccessful as Cena held him back. Cena then applied the STF tugging at the handcuffs to hurt Orton's wrist. As a result, Orton said the words 'I quit' to which Cena was victorious.|$|E

This study compared patterns of spontaneous speech for same room versus two videomediated conversations. One video system used a single <b>camera,</b> <b>monitor</b> and speaker, and a picture-in-a-picture device to display multiple people on one screen. The other system used multiple cameras, monitors, and speakers in order to support directional gaze cues and selective listening. Differences were found between same room and video-mediated conversations in terms of floor control and amount of simultaneous speech. While no differences were found between the video systems in terms of objective speech measures, other important differences are suggested and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{command module}} {{television}} <b>camera</b> <b>monitor</b> exhibited loss of horizontal synchronization {{during the initial}} usage. This condition cleared and performance of the monitor was normal until the press conference telecast during the transearth coast phase. At that time, the monitor had the same horizontal synchronization problem reported during the initial usage. The horizontal hold control adjustment would not correct the condition. The monitor was turned off for approximately 5 minutes, then turned back on, after which the monitor's picture was normal. The loss of horizontal synchronization was most likely caused by either an intermittent condition in the precision voltage regulator circuit assembly in the low voltage power supply, or the shift of the stable range of the horizontal potentiometer setting when warming up after turn-on...|$|E
