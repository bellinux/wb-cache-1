30|$|The {{researchers}} in the present paper recommended {{that the notion of}} autonomy is best meaningful when accompanying the tolerance of responsibility to better depict the characteristics of learners in academic settings. The notion of tolerance of responsibility could be best defined by the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> but as the existing realm is the span of responsibility, the researchers recommended the term tolerance. That is why the {{researchers in}} the present paper would suggest the term “tolerance” rather than the “coefficient” of responsibility to be used. All in all, having accompanied the notion of “tolerance of responsibility” along with that of the “learner autonomy” would vividly depict a better transparent picture of the learners who are called autonomous learners.|$|E

3000|$|There {{was another}} shift of {{paradigm}} witnessed {{by the researchers}} {{in the present study}} which could be regarded as a weak version paradigm shift if the former one could be entitled as a strong version paradigm shift. The notion of autonomy is a multifaceted notion in great need of adding specific characteristics to depict the vivid picture of the autonomous practitioners, i.e. to provide the exact dimensions of the practitioners. The researchers found that some language learners were totally autonomous {{at the beginning of the}} intervention, but their personality traits were somehow intermittent. They were good beginners only. They didn’t lose their hopes, incentives, etc. They had serious problems with the notion of endurance. Even at the point where the researchers felt that they were no more motivated to continue with a prolonged task, they were highly eager to begin a new embedded task, hence showing no tendency to complete the previous task which was left incomplete. They were only good beginners. The researchers came to the understanding that the notion of autonomy could best depict the personality traits of the practitioners if it accompanies the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> tolerance <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> or in short, tolerance <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Such weak version paradigm shift defines that not necessarily do the autonomous good beginners endure the tasks to the completion phase. This was also witnessed from poor beginners, who acted very weak at the beginning of tasks, but they were good terminators and they pursued the tasks to the conclusion and completion phases. A thorough justification is as follows: [...]...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} show the {{importance}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as the foundation of ethics in times of crisis in particular in the fields of politics and economics in the modern civilisation marked by globalization and technological progres. I consider the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as the key notion {{in order to understand the}} ethical duty in a modern technological civilisation. We can indeed observe a moralization of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> going beyond a strict legal definition in terms of imputability. The paper begins by discussing the humanistic foundations of such a concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> It treats the historical origins <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and it relates this concept to the concept of accountability. On the basis of this historical determination of the concept I would like to present the definition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as fundamental ethical principle that has increasing importance as the foundation of the principles of governance in modern welfare states. In this context the paper discusses the extension of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> towards institutional or corporate responsibility where responsibility does not only concerns the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> individuals but also deals with the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> institutional collectivities. In this way the paper is based on the following structure : 1) The ethical foundation of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> 2) Responsibility in technological civilisation 3) Political responsibility for good governance in the welfare state 4) Social <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> business corporations in times of globalization 5) Conclusion and discussion : changed conditions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in modern times...|$|R

The philosophical definitions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> range from duty or obligation to personal assumption <b>of</b> moral <b>responsibility.</b> Psychological theories and their assumptions regarding responsibility and moral judgment are presented from Piaget, Heider, Kohlberg, and Rest. Piagetian empirical studies center on intentionality as evidence of an underlying cognitive organization and its relationship to attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Other studies <b>of</b> attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> focus on Heider's continuum <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and seek to take into account factors such as foreseeability and environmental justifications as well as intentionality.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in a dynamic {{policy-making}} environment modeled as a principal-agent relationship. We show that, with dynamic policy making, {{the two components}} <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> are negative complements: taken together, unified agency and observability of agent actions can reduce the principal’s welfare. In particular, the equilibrium retention rule used by the principal is characterized by “What Have You Done for Me Lately ” (WHYDFML) behavior and induces the agent to allocate too much effort to the late stages of the policy-making process relative to early stages. Eliminating either institutional feature <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> eliminates WHYDFML-driven inefficiencies, but at a cost. Without action observability, the principal {{is not able to}} give the agent as powerful incentives. Without unified agency, each agent controls fewer resources, making rent seeking more attractive. Whether complete clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> or some more limited form of it is optimal depends on the relative magnitudes of these competing effects.
