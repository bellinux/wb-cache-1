40|$|Eating {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} various psychiatric and neurological diseases. Pathological eating behaviour ranges from reduced to excessive appetite, dysregulation of hunger and satiation signals, and odd food preferences. Hyperphagia and anorexia are reported in lesions (mostly tumours) involving the ventromedial hypothalamus. 1 Moreover, eating disorders also occur in temporal lobe tumours, temporal lobe epilepsy, and advanced states of degenerative disease with neuronal loss in the medial temporal lobe. Hyperorality {{is part of the}} Kluver-Bucy syndrome which occurs in patients with bilateral mesial temporal lesions. 1 We report a patient in whom <b>compulsive</b> <b>hyperphagia</b> was associated with a medial thalamic ischaemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a {{multisystemic}} {{genetic disease}} characterized by hypothalamic hypogonadism, mental retardation and <b>compulsive</b> <b>hyperphagia</b> associated with early and severe obesity. Complications of overweight, such as type- 2 diabetes Mellitus, dyslipidemia and diffuse atheromatosis are common. We report a 15 years old morbid obese male with PWS, {{with a body}} mass index of 57. 7 kg/m², refractory to weight-lowering treatments. He underwent preoperative evaluation and treatment by a multidisciplinary team, and subjected to a 95 % gastrectomy, leaving a 50 ml remnant pouch and a long limb (120 cm) Y-Roux gastro-jejuno anastomosis. There were no surgical complications, oral feeding was initiated at the 5 th day with an hypocaloric diet. During the first postoperative year, the patient lost 70 kg, achieving a body mass index of 30 kg/m². Surgical treatment can become a therapeutic choice for obesity in PWS patients (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 427 - 31) ...|$|E
