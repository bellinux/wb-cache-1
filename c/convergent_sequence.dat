2500|$|The {{triangle}} inequality {{is responsible for}} most of the interesting structure on a metric space, namely, convergence.

As {{in the case of}} real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence (x'n) in X with limit lim x'n = c, we have lim f(x'n) = f(c). The latter condition can be weakened as follows: f is continuous {{at the point}} c if and only if for every <b>convergent</b> <b>sequence</b> (x'n) in X with limit c, the sequence (f(x'n)) is a Cauchy sequence, and c is in the domain of f.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1880s, {{it became}} clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be {{formulated}} for spaces of functions rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of Giulio Ascoli and Cesare Arzelà. [...] The culmination of their investigations, the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of continuous functions, the precise conclusion of which was {{that it was possible to}} extract a uniformly <b>convergent</b> <b>sequence</b> of functions from a suitable family of functions. [...] The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's [...] "limit point". [...] Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of integral equations, as investigated by David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt. [...] For a certain class of Green functions coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of mean convergenceor convergence in what would later be dubbed a Hilbert space. [...] This ultimately led to the notion of a compact operator as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was Maurice Fréchet who, in 1906, had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term compactness to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper which led to the famous 1906 thesis).|$|E
