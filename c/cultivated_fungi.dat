For these ants, farmed fungi are the only source of food on which their larvae are raised on and are also an important food for adults.

Wider application of SSF is hindered by a lack of knowledge about the design and control of the process. An important problem in SSF is the limited rate of oxygen supply to the fungal mats on the substrate surface. Using the fungus Aspergillus oryzae as an example, the author has discovered that aerial mycelia – which fungi can only form in SSF – help the fungus to overcome this oxygen supply limitation, and thus grow faster and make more enzymes of interest to the food industry.

40|$|Sex in {{symbionts}} {{is useful}} in creating beneficial traits. However, the resultant decrease in genetic relatedness between symbionts can be potentially detrimental for mutualistic interactions such as those between fungus-growing termites and the <b>cultivated</b> <b>fungi</b> in the genus Termitomyces, where the termite host should try to increase intra-nest symbiont relatedness to increase crop productivity. Any parasites of this mutualism such as the fungi in the sub-genus Pseudoxylaria may also use sex to generate variation to counter evolving host defensive mechanisms. Using molecular phylogenetic tools, we found within-nest genetic homogeneity in Termitomyces species but not in Pseudoxylaria species associated with the fungus-growing termite Odontotermes obesus. There was lower OTU but higher genotypic diversity (within the most abundant OTU) in the genus Termitomyces than in the sub-genus Pseudoxylaria. Additionally, population genetics methods suggest a sexual population structure for Termitomyces species and clonal propagation for Pseudoxylaria species.

40|$|Switching by parasites to novel hosts has {{profound}} {{effects on}} ecological and evolutionary disease dynamics. Switching requires that parasites {{are able to}} establish contact with novel hosts and to overcome host defenses. For most host– parasite associations, it is unclear as to what specific mechanisms prevent infection of novel hosts. Here, we show that parasitic fungal species in the genus Escovopsis, which attack and consume the fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants, are attracted to their hosts via chemotaxis. This response is host-specific: Escovopsis spp. grow towards their natural host cultivars more rapidly than towards other closely related fungi. Moreover, the <b>cultivated</b> <b>fungi</b> secrete compounds that can suppress Escovopsis growth. These antibiotic defenses are likewise specific: in most interactions, cultivars can inhibit growth of Escovopsis spp. not known to infect them in nature but cannot inhibit isolates of their naturally infecting pathogens. Cases in which cultivars are susceptible to novel Escovopsis are limited to a narrow set of host–parasite strain combinations. Targeted chemotactic and antibiotic responses therefore explain why Escovopsis pathogens do not readily switch to novel hosts, consequently constraining long-term dynamics of host–parasite coevolution within this ancient association...|$|E
40|$|Fungus-growing ants, their <b>cultivated</b> <b>fungi</b> and the cultivar-attacking {{parasite}} Escovopsis coevolve as {{a complex}} community. Higher-level phylogenetic congruence of the symbionts suggests specialized long-term associations of host-parasite clades but reveals little about parasite specificity at finer scales of species-species and genotype-genotype interactions. By coupling sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism genotyping analyses with experimental evidence, we examine (i) the host specificity of Escovopsis strains infecting colonies of three closely related ant species in the genus Cyphomyrmex, and (ii) potential mechanisms constraining the Escovopsis host range. Incongruence of cultivar and ant relationships across the three focal Cyphomyrmex spp. allows us to test whether Escovopsis strains track their cultivar or the ant hosts. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the Escovopsis phylogeny matches the cultivar phylogeny but not the ant phylogeny, indicating that the parasites are cultivar specific. Cross-infection experiments establish that ant gardens can be infected by parasite strains {{with which they are}} not typically associated in the field, but that infection is more likely when gardens are inoculated with their typical parasite strains. Thus, Escovopsis specialization is shaped by the parasite's ability to overcome only a narrow range of garden-specific defences, but specialization is probably additionally constrained by ecological factors, including the other symbionts (i. e. ants and their antibiotic-producing bacteria) within the coevolved fungus-growing ant symbiosis...|$|E

40|$|Ants of {{the tribe}} Attini {{discovered}} agriculture 50 million years before humans (Mueller et al 1998). Today, nearly 200 species in 12 genera of these ants <b>cultivate</b> <b>fungus</b> gardens in the Nearctic and Neotropical regions; in the Palaeotropics, this niche is occupied by fungus-growing termites. It is believed {{that the act of}} fungus cultivation evolved just once in the attines (Wilson 1971). The primitive attines <b>cultivate</b> <b>fungus</b> on insect frass and decaying vegetation while the advanced attines are the eponymous leaf-cutting ants. These ants carefully select leaves from species that are low in fungistatic compounds, such as phenolics, carry them to underground nests where they are masticated, and plant them in soil along with fungal mycelia and glandular secretions containing proteolytic enzymes. Obligate fungal symbionts break down structural carbohydrates in the leaves and produce nutritive protruberances called gongylidia from their hyphae. The ants consume these gongylidia and also feed them to their larvae. They also prevent the fungi from forming fruiting bodies or sporophores; consequently, the fungus is clonally propagated. In the advanced attines, the queen tucks a pellet of the mutualistic fungal mycelia into her infrabuccal pouch before her nuptial flight, and then uses this fungal innoculum to seed a new fungus garden in the new colony...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The fungus-growing ant-microbe {{symbiosis}} {{consists of}} coevolving microbial mutualists and pathogens. The diverse fungal lineages that these ants cultivate are attacked by parasitic microfungi {{of the genus}} Escovopsis. Previous molecular analyses have demonstrated strong phylogenetic congruence between the ants, the ants-cultivated fungi and the garden pathogen Escovopsis at ancient phylogenetic levels, suggesting coevolution of these symbionts. However, few studies have explored cophylogenetic patterns between these symbionts at the recent phylogenetic levels necessary to address whether these parasites are occasionally switching to novel hosts or whether they are diversifying with their hosts {{as a consequence of}} long-term host fidelity. Results Here, a more extensive phylogenetic analysis of Escovopsis lineages infecting the gardens of Apterostigma ants demonstrates that these pathogens display patterns of phylogenetic congruence with their fungal hosts. Particular clades of Escovopsis track particular clades of <b>cultivated</b> <b>fungi,</b> and closely-related Escovopsis generally infect closely-related hosts. Discordance between host and parasite phylogenies, however, provides the first evidence for occasional host-switches or acquisitions of novel infections from the environment. Conclusion The fungus-growing ant-microbe association has a complex coevolutionary history. Though there is clear evidence of host-specificity on the part of diverse Escovopsis lineages, these pathogens have switched occasionally to novel host fungi. Such switching is likely to have profound effects on how these host and parasites adapt to one another over evolutionary time scales and may impact how disease spreads over ecological time scales. </p...|$|E
