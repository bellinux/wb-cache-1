If this voltage is set too high it will result in rapid electrolyte loss. A failed <b>charge</b> <b>regulator</b> may allow the charge voltage to rise well above this value, causing a massive overcharge with boiling over of the electrolyte.|$|E

The charging station control schemes with three-level AC/DC power conversion and a bidirectional DC/DC <b>charging</b> <b>regulator</b> are described. The integration of EVs to the power grid provides an improvement of the grid reliability and stability. EVs are considered an asset to the smart grid to optimize effective performance economically and environmentally under various operation conditions, and more significantly to sustain the resiliency of the grid in the case of emergency conditions and disturbance events. The three-level grid side converter (GSC) can participate in the reactive power support or grid voltage control at the grid interfacing point or the common coupling point (PCC). A fuzzy logic proportional integral (FL-PI) controller is proposed to control the GSC converter. The controllers used are verified and tested by simulation to evaluate their performance using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The comparison of a PI-controller and a PI-Fuzzy controller for the EV charging station shows the effectiveness of the proposed FL-PI controller over conventional PI controller for same circuit operating conditions.

40|$|Inwardly {{rectifying}} potassium (K+) channels (IRK 1) {{were incorporated}} into lipid bilayers to test the relative contributions of various mechanisms to inward rectification. IRK 1 channels were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and oocyte membrane vesicles containing the channels were fused with lipid bilayers. The major properties of the IRK 1 channel were similar whether measured in the oocyte membrane or lipid bilayer; the single channel conductance was 21 pS in 140 mM symmetrical [K+] and varied as a square root of external [K+]. Importantly, IRK 1 channels display voltage-dependent inward rectification {{in the absence of}} divalent ions or <b>charged</b> <b>regulators</b> such as spermine, indicating that they possess an intrinsic rectification mechanism. Although rectification was significantly increased by either Mg 2 + or spermine added to the cytoplasmic face of the channel, their effects could not be explained by simple block of the open pore. The Hille and Schwartz (1978) model, originally proposed to explain inward rectification by singly charged blocking particles, cannot be used to explain rectification by multiply charged blocking particles. As an alternative, we propose that in addition to a slow gating mechanism producing long lasting open and closed states, there is a distinct, intrinsic fast gating process amplified by cytoplasmic Mg 2 + and/or polyamine binding to the channel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The {{photovoltaic}} {{solar energy}} is a theme at center of the topicality since the world conscience hold of the warming of planet by the greenhouse effect and of the rarefaction of the primary resources(Oil, gas…). For solve theseproblems environmental and of energy, {{the development of the}} {{photovoltaic solar energy}} becomes primordial. The PV system is the device which allows exploiting this inexhaustible energy source. Currently we distinguish several types of which the one met usually in the isolated sites is the autonomous PV system. In this article, we studied the modelling and the optimization of the functioning of an autonomous photovoltaic system equipped with a <b>charge</b> <b>regulator</b> simple. The study is made in considering tensions of 12 V and of 24 V of the storage system. The voltage in open circuit represents the only parameter of the PV field taken into account in this study. After the investigations, the results obtained show on the one hand that a suitable operation of charge or discharge, from a storage system is obtained if the discharge or charge current is weak. On the other hand, the study on autonomous PV system showed that the tension in open circuit of the PV field adapted for the optimal functioning of an autonomous PV system of 12 V is in the fork between 16 V to 23 V. In the case of an autonomous photovoltaic system of 24 V, this beach of tension is between 34 V to 43 V. The tension in open circuit of PV field is under the conditions of 1000 W/m 2 and a temperature of 25 °C.

40|$|The {{majority}} of new satellites generate electrical power using photovoltaic solar arrays and store energy in batteries for use during eclipse periods. Careful regulation of battery charging during insolation can greatly increase the expected lifetime of the satellite. The battery <b>charge</b> <b>regulator</b> is usually custom designed for each satellite and its specific mission. Economic {{competition in the}} small satellite market requires battery charge regulators that are lightweight, efficient, inexpensive, and modular enough {{to be used in}} a wide variety of satellites. A new battery <b>charge</b> <b>regulator</b> topology has been developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center to address these needs. The new regulator topology uses industry-standard dc-dc converters and a unique interconnection to provide size, weight, efficiency, fault tolerance, and modularity benefits over existing systems. A transformer-isolated buck converter is connected such that the high input line is connected in series with the output. This "bypass connection" biases the converter's output onto the solar array voltage. Because of this biasing, the converter only processes the fraction of power necessary to charge the battery above the solar array voltage. Likewise, the same converter hookup can be used to regulate the battery output to the spacecraft power bus with similar fractional power processing. The advantages of this scheme are: 1) Because only a fraction of the power is processed through the dc-dc converter, the single- stage conversion efficiency is 94 to 98 percent; 2) Costly, high-efficiency dc-dc converters are not necessary for high end-to-end system efficiency; 3) The system is highly fault tolerant because the bypass connection will still deliver power if the dc-dc converter fails; and 4) The converters can easily be connected in parallel, allowing higher power systems to be built from a common building block. This new technology will be spaceflight tested in the Photovoltaic Regulator Kit Experiment (PRKE) on TRW's Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative (SSTI) satellite scheduled for launch in 1996. This experiment uses commercial dc-dc converters (28 to 15 Vdc) and additional control circuitry to regulate current to a battery load. The 60 -W, 87 - percent efficiency converters can control 180 W of power at an efficiency of 94 percent in the new configuration.
