5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to {{pass through}} the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, with one <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates before hitting the area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning.

5|$|The two initial, primary {{computers}} on the HST {{were the}} 1.25MHz DF-224 system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundant NSSC-1 (NASA Standard Spacecraft <b>Computer,</b> <b>Model</b> 1) systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using diode-transistor logic (DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, {{which consisted of}} two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor. The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Weather forecasters {{first began}} to notice the {{severity}} of the impending weather situation after the 6:00pm CST (0000UTC) <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> runs on the night of Friday, March 27. On Saturday, March 28 at 11:30am the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day2 moderate risk of severe weather for southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, northwest Illinois and much of Wisconsin.

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the <b>computer</b> <b>model.</b> The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, and later was extended to Zihuatanejo. Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall, one <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicted Carlotta to move ashore; due to the threat, the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo. Outer rainbands and rough surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration; officials evacuated about 100families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution. Precipitation and clouds were reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in flooding in some areas. No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds; however, Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44mph (71km/h). Heavy rainfall and rough seas were also reported on Socorro Island.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical or <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular in biomedical science. Although they are a simplification of reality, <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> are able to link a multitude of processes to each other. In the fields of cardiac physiology and cardiology, models {{can be used to}} describe the combined activity of all ion channels (electrical models) or contraction-related processes (mechanical models) in potentially millions of cardiac cells.

The <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> were based on patient demographics, risk factors, historical items, and symptoms. The study showed that neither clinical impression nor <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> were able to adequately distinguish organic from functional disease.|$|R
5|$|Situated to {{the south}} of a strong {{subtropical}} ridge, the depression tracked rapidly westward. With easterly wind shear, the structure was initially disorganized, although the system was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 48hours of developing, due to anticipated favorable conditions. One <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicted the depression would reach winds of around 115miles per hour (185km/h) by four days after development. Banding features increased while the satellite presentation continued to improve, and at 1200UTC on August16 the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal about 370miles (595km) east of Barbados. At the same time however, a QuikSCAT pass suggested the system did not contain a low-level circulation, and in post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center estimated the system degenerated into a tropical wave rather than attain tropical storm status. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a <b>computer</b> <b>model.</b> A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
40|$|Overall, <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> and {{simulations}} have {{a rather}} disappointing record within the management sciences {{as a tool}} for predicting the future. Social and market environments can be influenced by an overwhelming number of variables, and it is therefore difficult to use <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> to make forecasts or to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between individual behaviours and macroscopic outcomes. At the same time, however, advocates of <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> argue that they can be used to overcome the human mind's inability to cope with several complex variables simultaneously or to understand concepts that are highly counterintuitive. This paper seeks {{to bridge the gap between}} these two perspectives by suggesting that management research can indeed benefit from <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> by using them to formulate fruitful hypotheses...|$|R

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170miles (270km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. The depression initially moved west-northwestward, and shortly after forming it turned to the north-northwest. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220miles (350km) west of Manzanillo. By later that day, the convection wrapped around the center of circulation. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135miles (235km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Upon reaching hurricane status, one <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California, though most forecast a turn to the northwest.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2008USD). Hurricane Isabel formed from a {{tropical}} wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike. At least one <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> predicted a landfall on New Jersey, {{and as a result}} services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E
