40|$|Introduction: Atherothrombotic {{diseases}} such as myocardial or cerebral infarction are serious consequences of the thrombus formation in blood vessels. Thrombolytic agents are used to dissolve the already formed clots in the blood vessels. However, these drugs have certain adverse effects, which cause serious and sometimes fatal consequences. Methods: Plants essential oils were prepared and analyzed by GC/MS. To evaluate the fibrinolytic effect, fibrinogen labeled with FITC {{was added to the}} plasma. Ca 2 + was used for production of labeled clot. The essential oil (1 / 10, 1 / 100, 1 / 1000 dilutions) with and without streptokinase as a positive control, were added. Fluorescence was determined after 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes (excitation = 478, emission = 510). Results: Our findings showed that carvacrol was the main component of Zataria multiflora essential oil. This essential oil showed the best fibrinolytic activity. <b>Curcuma</b> <b>domestica</b> also showed fibrinolytic activity, which might be related to the presence of curcumene, zingiberene and tumeron.

The present study aims to assess the effect of essential oils of turmeric rhizomes (<b>Curcuma</b> <b>domestica</b> Val) against Aedes aegypti larvae Methods This was an experimental study of post test one group design, performed in two phases, using Aedes aegypti larvae as test organisms. In the first phase, laboratory-reared larvae were used for calculation of the LC 50 and LC 90, while in the second phase the test organisms were larvae taken from 75 buildings that had been designated based on a preliminary survey in four sub-districts in Banjarbaru city with a high incidence of dengue cases. Probit analysis of was used to calculate LC 50 and LC 90, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine the larvicidal potency of turmeric rhizome essential oils.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment {{was to investigate the}} effectiveness of treating broiler with temulawak (Curcuma xanthoriza) and kunyit (<b>Curcumae</b> <b>domestica)</b> extracts to enhance productivity and as imunostimulator of avian influenza. Broilers were given either temulawak, kunyit or temulawak+kunyit extracts. The treatments, including a control, were arranged in a factorial design. Variables measured were production index and immune titter with haemaglutination inhibition (HI) test at 35 days of age. Results showed that control, temulawak-, kunyit- and temulawak+kunyit-treated chicken have production indexes of 302. 80, 382. 30, 327. 71, and 358. 30, respectively. HI test results were all negative. It can be concluded that neither temulawak, kunyit nor temulawak+kunyit extracts is effective imunostimulator of avian influenza in broiler. Nevertheless, temulawak-treated chicken showed highest production index.   (Animal Production 9 (2) : 178 - 183 (2007)   Key Words: Avian influenza, haemaglutination inhibition, temulawak, kunyi...|$|R

However, these drugs also {{quite a lot of}} side effects. In turmeric (<b>Curcuma</b> <b>domestica)</b> there is eugenol which functioned as anti-perelic substance. The research purpose is to prove that turmeric rhizome essence (<b>Curcuma</b> <b>domestica)</b> could influence the temperature reduction in white rat and to determine the concentration of the most effectif in lowering {{body temperature}} in white rats. The research used true experiment with post-test only control group design. 28 white rats divided into 7 groups. First (Al) was given DPT vaccine and turmeric essence with 1 gr/grBB dose, second group (A 2) was given DPT vaccine and turmeric essence with 1, 2 gr/grBB dose, third group (A 3) was given DPT vaccine and turmeric essence with 1, 6 gr/grBB dose, fourth group (A 4) was given DPT vaccine and turmeric essence with 2 gr/grBB dose, fifth group (AS) was given DPT vaccine and turmeric essence with 2, 4 gr/grBB dose, sixth group (A 6) was given DPT vaccine only, seventh group (A 7) was given DPT vaccine and paracetamol with 0, 2 mg/grBB dose. All data were analyzed with normality assumption, one-way anava homogeneity, and duncan’s test. The average temperature reduction result were A 1. 1, 23 °C, A 2. 1, SS °C.

The spentwash treatments, primary treated spentwash (PTSW) diluted to 50 % and 33 % spentwash, were analyzed for their plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and other physical and chemical parameters. Experimental soil was tested for its chemical and physical parameters. The seeds (sets) of the condiments (Namadhari and Mayhco) were sowed in the prepared land and irrigated with raw water (RW), 50 % and 33 % spentwash at the dosage of 5 mm- 10 mm/cm 2 depending upon the climatic condition. The impact of spentwash on the yields of condiments at their maturity periods was investigated. It was noticed that the yields of all condiments were very high in 33 % spentwash compared to 50 % spentwash and raw water irrigation...|$|R

40|$|Efficacy {{and quality}} of {{medicinal}} plant extracts depend on chemical composition therein. Therefore, to ensure its efficacy orquality, the chemical composition of extracts have to be analyzed based on its chemical marker or its chemical pattern. This study tried to develop a method for extracts quality assay based on infrared spectrum in fingerprint region and extracts inhibition activity to xanthine oxidase. Five extracts from kunyit (<b>Curcuma</b> <b>domestica),</b> temulawak (C xanthorriza), jahe (Zingiber officina/e), temukunci (Boesenbergia pandurata), and cabe jawa (Piper retrofractum) were tested to inhibit xanthine oxidase activity. The bioactive data of extracts and its infrared spectrum was analyzed using PCA and PLS-DA (partial least squarediscriminant analysis). Almost all extracts that were tested showed inhibition activity to xanthine oxidase activity, except the extract of jahe. The result showed that PCA can group all of extract into each of their region. Meanwhile, PLS-DA has {{shown to be a}} good prediction model for classifying extracts based on fingerprint region of its mR Spectrum and its biological activit...|$|R
