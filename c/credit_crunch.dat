The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design, resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991. Financing of the steel structure had been secured in loans, but these were stopped following a <b>credit</b> <b>crunch.</b> In 1994, the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas, which included grants to build Grünerhallen. The hall was estimated to cost NOK23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax. Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995, as the 30th indoor ice rink in Norway. In 1996, the city council had to grant an additional NOK4.6 million to cover cost overruns.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression the economy was destabilized by bank failures followed by <b>credit</b> <b>crunches.</b> The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by bank runs.

As the bank run progressed, it generated a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more people withdrew their deposits, the likelihood of default increased, and this encouraged further withdrawals.) ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{treatments}} of financial regulation worry about {{threats to the}} banking system and the economy from defaults or <b>credit</b> <b>crunches.</b> This paper argues that the recent crisis points to fire sales through capital markets as another source of financial and economic instability. Accounting for fire sales implies several changes to the standard approach. First, if there are three channels of instability, then three regulatory tools are needed to deliver stability. Second, if only a single capital tool and a single liquidity tool are available, {{then there is a}} risk that using them pushes activity into the shadow banking system. Third, liquidity requirements on the asset side of bank balance sheets are conceptually different from liquidity requirements on the liability side. The paper starts with a review of the recent theoretical work on fire sales that form the building blocks for a next generation of models of the financial system. A summary of some evidence suggesting that fire sales were present in the crisis is offered. Next, the paper outlines a general equilibrium framework {{that can be used to}} think about a financial system in which default, <b>credit</b> <b>crunches,</b> and fire sales are all possible. The paper concludes with a discussion of the regulatory options and some speculation on how such a framework could be extended. ...|$|R
25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a <b>credit</b> <b>crunch</b> which does serious harm to the economy. A <b>credit</b> <b>crunch</b> lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E

40|$|Periods {{of banking}} {{distress}} are often followed by sizable and long-lasting contractions in bank credit. They {{may be explained}} by a declined demand by financially impaired borrowers (the conventional financial accelerator) or by lower supply by capital-constrained banks, a "credit crunch". This paper develops a bank model to study <b>credit</b> <b>crunches</b> and their real effects. In this model, banks maintain a precautionary level of capital that serves as a smoothing mechanism to avert disruptions in the supply of credit when hit by small shocks. However, for larger shocks, highly persistent <b>credit</b> <b>crunches</b> may arise even when the impulse is a one time, non-serially correlated event. From a policy perspective, the model justifies the use of public funds to recapitalize banks following a significant deterioration in their capital position.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding the lingering problem of soft budget constraints in many transition economies even after the macroeconomic situation has been stabilized and a sound banking system has been introduced. We show that soft budget constraints can persist and even coexist with <b>credit</b> <b>crunches,</b> as the existing evidence from transition economies seems to indicate. As in Dewatripont and Maskin (Credit and efficiency in centralized and decentralized economies, Review of Economic Studies, 1995), the existence of sunk costs in existing loans may also give rise to soft budget constraints when banks themselves are subject to hard budget constraints and have outside options. We endogenize the outside option by allowing banks to allocate available funds between new lending and refinancing of old loans. The option to invest in new lending hardens budget constraints when the average quality of investment projects is high and varied. Otherwise soft budget constraints may persist. In the latter case, refinancing of old loans crowds out new finance, giving rise to <b>credit</b> <b>crunches</b> on new loans. By screening and monitoring firms banks can improve the relative profitability of new lending and break out of soft budget constraint equilibria. Unlike Dewatripont and Maskin, larger banks may be harder than smaller banks {{because they have the}} resources and higher incentives to invest in screening and monitoring. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

Near the steady state, these intermediaries can raise equity finance at no cost through retained earnings. However, even moderately large shocks cause their borrowing constraints to bind, leading to contractions in credit offered to firms, and requiring the intermediaries to raise further funds by paying the cost to issue equity. This leads to the occasional sharp increases in interest spreads and the counter-cyclical, positively skewed equity issuance that are characteristic of the <b>credit</b> <b>crunches</b> observed in the data...|$|R

In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.|$|E
