Hybrid honeypot architectures consisting of frontends and backends are widely used in the research area, specially due to the benefits of their high scalability and fidelity for detailed attacking data collection. A hybrid honeypot system often needs a facility aimed to tightly control the network traffic, for purposes such as redirecting the traffic from the frontends to the backends for in-depth attack analysis. However, the current traffic redirection approaches, particularly the TCP <b>connection</b> <b>handover</b> mechanisms, are not stealthy and they can be easily detected by attackers. This paper proposes an SDN based network data controller for hybrid honeypot systems that uses a transparent TCP <b>connection</b> <b>handover</b> mechanism and provides a traffic filtering approach based on the Snort alert functionality. The controller is implemented as an application based on the open-source Ryu SDN framework. It allows the users to configure their own network data control rules, which based on the Snort alert messages will forward or redirect the traffic to the corresponding honeypots. The experiments validate the proposed mechanism and the testing results show that the controller can efficiently perform the stealthy TCP <b>connection</b> <b>handover</b> as well...|$|E

For example, a mobile payment using {{near-field}} communication (NFC) is a micro-interaction. The arrival of NFC on smart phones makes possible a wide array of applications using micro-interactions, from sharing photos between a phone and a TV to checking a car into a valet parking service by touching two phones. This paper addresses the challenge of how to create intuitive, frictionless micro-interactions that require no pre-configuration for a large class of applications. We deliver a consistent tap-and-share interface for many forms of micro-interactions through several concepts. We propose interaction manifests as universal descriptors of multi-party, cross-platform applications. Zero-click overheads are made possible by automatically using the foreground application as the context for the micro-interactions. We extend the concept of <b>connection</b> <b>handovers</b> to allow NFC-enabled applications to run unmodified on devices lacking NFC. We also show how these abstractions make it easy to create a variety of applications. All the application and library code is available as open source.

40|$|Mobile {{terminals}} with multi-radio {{devices have}} become increasingly prevalent. This {{makes it possible for}} Internet applications to be supported by heterogeneous wireless networks while the terminal is on the move. As the user is constantly moving, it is highly desirable that the terminal connects to the best network and retains high performance of network <b>connections.</b> <b>Handovers</b> can be made within the same type of network (horizontal handover) or different types of networks (vertical handover). This paper focuses on link-layer inter-technology vertical handovers. Vertical handovers present several great challenges, such as user mobility randomness, high handover overhead and optimality requirement. Existing work often focuses only on the current network condition when making handover decisions, ignoring future performance of the terminal. As a result, a handover decision good for the current moment may soon become poor when the user moves to another place. This paper is motivated by the observation that users in a given mobile environment, such as university or enterprise campus, exhibit clear mobility patterns. We propose an approach for making handover decisions, which explicitly exploits user mobility patterns. This approach can produce high-performance handover decisions in the long run. Employing a comprehensive framework for preference customization, the approach supports user customization caring for different user preferences. Extensive real trace driven simulations and comparative study show our algorithm is better than the conventional vertical handover algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In general, multi beam satellite employs uniform allocation of RF power and bandwidth to multi beams, {{since it is}} hard to predict the distribution of traffic requests and the arrival rate of new connection.

This means handover will introduce long shutdown of connection, because not only handover process in layer 2 but also multicast join and multicast tree reconstruction is necessary. This causes loss of large amount of packets and finally causes NAK implosion.
