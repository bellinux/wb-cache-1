The following question is explored: What are the barriers to developing a more effective governance structure in the Tl'etinqox-t'in community? To answer this research question a review of current literature and a case study format will be used. The paper outlines the history and development of First Nations governance {{as defined by the}} Indian Act (1876), and how Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) policies have imposed challenges for development of effective First Nations governance structures. A comparison is offered between researched best practice in governance structures and current First Nations governance structures. Four key elements of effective governance are identified in the research: <b>constitutions,</b> localized <b>governance</b> structures, accountability and transparency, and revenue creation. These elements are compared to the current practices of the Tl'etinqox-t'in government. Recommendations, based on the research findings, are then presented to assist the Tl'etinqox-t'in government structures to become more closely aligned with effective practice.

40|$|Does {{there exist}} a voting rule to be, for example, {{inserted}} into the constitution of a newly constructed apartment building, {{which is likely to}} attract the greatest number of consumers? We analyze this and other questions within a framework in which co-owners resolve future debates by voting. We examine the conditions under which a co-owner optimally opts for unanimous, special majority, simple majority, and minority voting rules. The main innovation of the analysis is that co-owners with distinct characteristics may yet unanimously agree on the optimal voting rule. Among the other results are that the optimal level of the voting rule is non-decreasing (non-increasing) in one’s level of disutility from opposing (favoring) an accepted (a rejected) proposal. Also, while our results are generally in line with the predictions of Ellickson (1982) and the evidence of Barzel and Sass (1990), according to which heterogeneous (homogeneous) voters require (less than) a super majority voting rule, we show a possible exception to this generalization: heterogeneity, in some circumstances, may optimally lead to a minority voting rule. The results are applicable for groups such as general assemblies in apartment buildings, neighborhood councils, and others.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{operation}} of third sector politics within the changing context of local governance. Throughout the history of urban policy the concept of community has fonned a recurrent, if fluctuating theme (Eisenschitz and Gough, 1993; Raco, 1998 a). Recent literature has tended to assume {{the emergence of a}} new local governance characterised by restructured local political relations. A related strand of thinking suggests that within this new context, the community role has been elevated. The recent turn to community seems to present a vision in which public participation is something of a panacea to secure successful and lasting urban regeneration and more effective local governance. The tendency within the literature has been to focus on new institutional configurations rather than the detailed operation of the new arrangements. This thesis seeks to assess in detail how the third sector is engaging in processes of local governance and the mechanisms that support this. The research focuses on the fine-grain of spatial and institutional representation of community interests and the fonn and function of community politics. It develops this focus through a specific concern with {{the operation of}} community politics and the <b>constitution</b> of <b>governance</b> roles through two in-depth case studies conducted in the North-East. These provide contrasting examples of third sector organisation and coordination, thus highlighting the locally distinctive nature of third sector politics. The thesis concludes that attempts at specifying changing local governance and models of community engagement have tended to ignore the complexity of community politics. Therefore, it is argued that future theoretical developments need to address these complexities in order to capture any change in the fonn and nature of local political relations in general and third sector politics in particular...|$|R
40|$|Constitutions {{constitute}} a polity and create and entrench power. A corporate <b>constitution</b> - the <b>governance</b> choices incorporated in state {{law and the}} certificate of incorporation - resembles a political constitution. Delaware law allows parties to create corporations, to endow them with perpetual life, to assign rights and duties to "citizens" (directors and shareholders), to adopt {{a great variety of}} governance structures, and to entrench those choices. In this Article, we argue that the decision to endow directors with significant power over decisions whether and how to sell the company is a constitutional choice of governance structure. We then argue that it is, on theoretical and empirical grounds, a perfectly intelligible choice: shareholders reasonably might opt for board entrenchment - implemented, for example, by means of a staggered board - in order to enable a board to employ selling strategies more effectively and thus to increase the premium shareholders receive when the company is sold. Such a decision is a kind of pre-commitment whereby shareholders, by binding themselves ex ante, may be able to improve their collective position ex post. After examining how shareholders can entrench particular governance structures under Delaware law, we examine two issues that arise once shareholders have chosen to entrench a governance structure: the question of incomplete implementation that arises in cases such as Blasius and Liquid Audio; and the questions when and whether changed circumstances justify ex post judicial negation of shareholders' prior commitments. corporate governance,...|$|R

One being financial institutions, specifically banks, which have built their entire product offering to stokvels based on a small aspect of their <b>governance</b> (<b>constitution</b> and key roles). Second is members' reliance on the stokvels funds for livelihoods. This makes them risk averse as they cannot afford to lose their money nor delay their expenditure.

40|$|Constitutional {{text and}} {{government}} action are at times discordant in important ways. This discrepancy occurs in both mature and emerging democracies. It {{can result in}} the underenforcement of constitutional norms and implicate the rule of law. When the constitutional norm involves the right to vote, the gap between <b>constitutions</b> and <b>governance</b> inevitably triggers concerns about democracy as well. There is rich and ample debate within American legal scholarship over {{the effect of the}} underenforcement of constitutional norms on the scope and meaning of the norm. The arguments generally fall into one of two camps. One strand of argument suggests that judicial underenforcement of a constitutional norm does not define the norm itself; nor does it absolve non-judicial actors from enforcing the full conceptual scope of the norm. That is, a constitution 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 are the foreground where the norm is defined. A second branch of underenforcement scholarship suggests that judicial implementation defines constitutional norms by employing the 2 ̆ 2 implementing doctrine 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 decision rules 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 used to enforce some aspect of the norm. This Article aligns itself with the first branch of scholarship and borrows the 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 thesis to examine the right to vote when it exists as a constitutional norm in a maturing democracy. In particular, I extract two principles from the 2 ̆ 2 operative provisions 2 ̆ 2 thesis and employ them in the contexts of voting rights and comparative law to illustrate how and why underenforcement of a normative right to vote can occur in newer democracies. First, I adopt the position that the scope and meaning of a constitutional norm may be greater than its actual enforcement. Second, I rely on the argument that under- or nonenforcement results not only from a lack of judicial enforcement but also from underenforcement by the legislative and administrative actors that are obligated to enforce constitutional norms to their fullest extent. By employing these two principles, this Article analyzes an under-recognized underenforcement of the right to vote that has evaded the force {{of some of the most}} liberal contemporary constitutions. It also analyses the subsequent judicial enforcement of that norm as an integral step toward full enforcement of the fair measure of the right to vote. To illustrate this phenomenon and apply the theory of constitutional underenforcement to practice, I use Ghana, in West Africa—a recently designated 2 ̆ 2 maturing democracy 2 ̆ 2 —as a case study...|$|R

The study adopted exploratory and descriptive research design, which required in depth analysis on the role of governance systems in the strategic management of counties in Kenya. The population of the study was the forty-seven (47) counties in Kenya. Cluster and purposive sampling techniques were employed in the study. Questionnaire instruments were used in the collection of data. Qualitative and quantitative data collected from this study was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A major result of the study was that the strategic direction of the devolved public sector is the role of the governance systems. It was recognised that the strategic management practice in the public sector is starting to bear fruit and this trend is set to help managers run public sector institutions more effectively. Institutions that engage in formal strategic planning processes have a higher probability of success than those that don’t. Strategic management practise is one sure way to systematize the most important business decisions; it helps educate managers to become better decision makers; it helps managers to examine the basic problems of the institution and finally it helps improve corporate communication, coordination of individual projects, the allocation of resources, and short-range planning such as budgeting. The beauty of a county having a corporate strategy is that everyone in the county, the executives in the front office as well as people in the operating units, can knowingly work towards the same strategic objective without being rigid about how they do so...|$|R

40|$|Transnational {{corporations}} {{are at the}} center of extraordinary and complex governance systems that are developing outside the state and international public organizations and beyond the conventionally legitimating framework of the forms of domestic or international hard law. Though these systems are sometimes recognized as autonomous and authoritative among its members, they are neither isolated from each other nor from the states with which they come into contact. Together these systems may begin to suggest a new template for networked governance beyond the state, but one in which public and private actors are integrated stakeholders. This provides the source of the questions explored in this article: Is it possible to detect this new template for transnational governance of economic activity (in general) and corporations (in particular) developing through principles of transnational private governance? Is public governance in the twentyfirst century taking on the characteristics of transnational corporate governance? The questions suggest three objectives. The first is to examine the organization of communities of states through the normative lens of private transnational governance. A secondary objective is to suggest the importance of communication-structural coupling-between developing private governance systems and emerging transnational public governance systems. That communication suggests the development of the institutional intermeshing of both autonomous systems of governing communities of private actors and communities of states. The third objective is to consider whether emerging governance frameworks, public and private, might be arranged together in a way that credibly suggests a system of coordinated metagovernance. After an introduction, Section I of this article examines the <b>governance</b> <b>constitutions</b> of multinational economic actors. Section II then turns to a consideration of corporate constitutionalism within a metagovernance framework. The focus is the governance framework of the G- 202 ̆ 7 s Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G- 20 -FSB framework points to the future of governance systems in which the state participates in a collaborative governance structure, but in which states share rulemaking power with public and private nonstate actors. The FSB template points to the organization of governance as a collegial enterprise in which states and traditional law-based systems interact with nonstate actors and their norm-based systems to develop integrated governance with global reach. Thus reconstituted, a new set of arrangements might well arise, one in which amalgamations of the most powerful states and private regulatory bodies assert authority once reserved to states alone.
