5|$|A {{series of}} {{lawsuits}} between the State of Oregon, the United States government, and the railroads ensued. Another lawsuit was brought by Portland attorney and future U.S. Representative Walter Lafferty {{on behalf of}} 18 western Oregon counties, which sued to claim revenue from timber sales on the O lands. The cases worked their {{way up to the}} United States Supreme Court, which ruled in 1915 in Oregon & California R. Co. v. United States that despite the violation of grant terms, the railroad had been built and the railroad company should be <b>compensated.</b> In 1916, Congress passed the Chamberlain–Ferris Act, which revested the remaining 2,800,000 acres of land to the United States government, and <b>compensated</b> the railroad at $2.50 per acre from an account, the Oregon and California land grant fund, funded by timber sales from the land. Oregon counties affected by the revestiture of land were also to be <b>compensated</b> from the fund.|$|E

25|$|The <b>compensating</b> {{euphonium}} {{is common}} among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The <b>compensating</b> valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming {{off of the}} back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E2 down to B1. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are <b>compensating.</b> Only those designed with extra tubing are <b>compensating.</b> There were, at one time, three-valve <b>compensating</b> euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one <b>compensating</b> models did, in order to bring the notes C2 and B1 in tune. This three-valve <b>compensating</b> configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.|$|R

Moreover, he disagreed with the use of taxpayers' money to <b>compensate</b> victims of the coup.

40|$|The {{common and}} {{traditional}} method for dispersion compensation in optical domain is concatenating the transmit optical fiber by a <b>compensating</b> optical fiber having high-negative dispersion coefficient. In this paper, we take an opposite direction and show how an optical fiber with high-positive dispersion coefficient {{can also be}} used for dispersion compensation. Our optical dispersion <b>compensating</b> structure is the optical implementation of an iterative algorithm in signal processing. The proposed dispersion <b>compensating</b> system is constructed by cascading a number of <b>compensating</b> sub-systems and its compensation capability is improved by increasing the number of embedded sub-systems. We also show that the compensation capability is a trade-off between transmission length and bandwidth. We use simulation results to validate the performance of the introduced dispersion <b>compensating</b> module. Photonic crystal fibers with high-positive dispersion coefficient can be used for constructing the proposed optical dispersion <b>compensating</b> module. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
