500|$|Title VI of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, {{signed into}} law by President George W. Bush on October 16, 2008, {{authorized}} a grant of $1.5 billion over a 10-year period for Metrorail <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> projects. The grant was contingent upon the establishment of dedicated revenue sources for the Metro by the Compact jurisdictions. An amendment to the Metro's Compact on August 19, 2009, added the requirement for payments [...] "from dedicated funding sources" [...] by the Compact's participating jurisdictions. In June 2010, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell threatened to withhold Virginia's WMATA funding unless the composition of WMATA's board is modified to allow Virginia's Governor to appoint two of the four Virginia seats, instead of the localities. On June 17, 2010, Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff required a formal commitment from Virginia to match its share of the federal funds if the federal funding is to continue. On July 1, 2010, the WMATA Board of Directors agreed to provide matching funds without regard to McDonnell's request for Board seats. [...] Based on this agreement, the federal funds were reconfirmed, and WMATA was able to proceed with a contract to purchase 428 new metrorail cars. McDonnell pressed for a Board seat again in 2011, and used his amendatory veto authority to amend the 2010-11 budget to require the NVTC to appoint someone of the Governor's choosing to fill one of the NVTC seats on the WMATA Board.|$|E
2500|$|After {{negotiations}} broke down, {{the team}} began planning a new stadium, SunTrust Park. The stadium {{would be built}} in southern Cobb County, with an Atlanta address, located [...] "near the geographic center of the Braves' fan base." [...] The new stadium was constructed in a public/private partnership. The projected cost was $672million. It occupies [...] of a [...] lot, with {{the remainder of the}} space devoted to parking, green space, and mixed-use development. The new stadium is part of a 60-acre development called The Battery Atlanta. Although Cobb County is not presently served by MARTA, the Braves use a [...] "circulator" [...] bus system to shuttle fans to and from the stadium. Construction on SunTrust Park broke ground on September 16, 2014. Had SunTrust Park been behind schedule, the Braves had the option (but ultimately declined) to extend their lease at Turner Field up to 5 years. Braves executive vice president Mike Plant has stated that <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> would be much less at SunTrust Park. [...] While Turner Field was designed from the ground up with the Braves in mind, Plant said that it required higher <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs in the long run because it was value engineered for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Plant estimates that <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs at SunTrust Park will be no more than $80 million after 30 years – {{less than half of the}} $150 million in <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> needed for Turner Field after 17 years.|$|E
2500|$|After the R36 {{cars were}} {{delivered}} in 1963–1964, no more IRT cars were built for another 20 years. Several rolling stock orders were {{proposed for the}} IRT during this time. In 1966, a lightweight R39 subway car, {{similar to the ones}} used on the Market–Frankford Line in Philadelphia, was proposed for the oldest elevated IRT and BMT lines; however, this proposal failed because most of the remaining elevated lines were closed, and demolished instead. In 1973, another proposal to replace the R12 through R17 series was deferred because not enough voters approved it. Finally, in 1979, with the bus and train fleets in poor and decrepit shape, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) looked into <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> and bond acts to replace the oldest IRT cars (the R12s, R14s, R15s, and R17s) and to rebuild and refurbish newer (at the time) IRT cars (R21s and beyond). A bond issue for 136 new IRT cars was approved, and funds were procured for another new 1,014 IRT cars in 1981. These cars were referred to as the [...] "R62" [...] contract. The R62 order was originally proposed as an order of 260 [...] cars, but the selected plan called for 325 [...] IRT cars instead.|$|E

2500|$|... {{also adds}} that, when an SE is incorporated, {{employees}} have the default right to retain all existing representation {{on the board}} of directors that they have, unless the negotiate by collective agreement a different or better plan than is provided for in existing member state law. Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders, or the right to bring derivative claims to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of pre-emption to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by tort, contract or piercing the corporate veil to hold directors and shareholders accountable. However, Directives do require minimum rights on company formation, <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance,</b> accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a takeover bid, rules on mergers, and management of cross-border insolvency. The omission of minimum standards is important since the Court of Justice held in Centros that freedom of establishment requires companies operate in any member state they choose. This has been argued to risk a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in standards, although the Court of Justice soon affirmed in Inspire Art that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the [...] "public interest".|$|E

5000|$|... (3) Financial <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{in units}} of {{constant}} purchasing power (<b>Capital</b> <b>Maintenance</b> in Units of Constant Purchasing Power): authorized by IFRS but not prescribed—optional during low inflation and deflation. See Par 104(a). <b>Capital</b> <b>Maintenance</b> in Units of Constant Purchasing Power is prescribed during hyperinflation in IAS 29: i.e. the restatement of Historical Cost or Current Cost period-end financial statements {{in terms of}} the period-end monthly published Consumer Price Index. Only financial <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> in units of constant purchasing power (<b>Capital</b> <b>Maintenance</b> in Units of Constant Purchasing Power) in terms of a daily index per se can automatically maintain the real value of financial capital constant at all levels of inflation and deflation in all entities that at least break even in real value—ceteris paribus—for an indefinite period of time. This would happen whether these entities own revaluable fixed assets or not and without the requirement of more capital or additional retained profits to simply maintain the existing constant real value of existing shareholders' equity constant. Financial <b>capital</b> <b>maintenance</b> in units of constant purchasing power requires the calculation and accounting of net monetary losses and gains from holding monetary items during low inflation and deflation.
