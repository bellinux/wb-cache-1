40|$|Supercapacitors are {{now being}} looked at for use in higher power {{applications}} such as mobile telecommunications and hybrid electric vehicles. We have examined two different supercapacitors, one is a <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> {{and the other is}} a supercapacitor of our own design. Four different testing methods including Impedance Spectroscopy, Constant Current Charging, Cyclic Voltammetry and Power Cycling were applied to each supercapacitor and the results are reviewed. Parameter values obtained from Impedance Spectroscopy are excellent for comparing supercapacitors under equilibrium conditions but correlate poorly with data obtained from the more useful Power Cycling Charts (PCC). The choice of the current step size in Constant Current Charging and the scan rate in Cyclic Voltammetry has a large bearing on the results obtained from these techniques. The strong voltage dependence of the parameters for the <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> prevented analysis using Cyclic Voltammetry. It was also clearly demonstrated by Power Cycling that the <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> had the poorer power performance of the two supercapacitors tested.

40|$|International audienceIn {{contrast}} to the plethora of publications on the separation of fatty acids, analogous studies involving fatty amines are scarce. A recently introduced ionic-liquid-based capillary column for GC was used to separate trifluoroacetylated fatty amines focusing on the analysis of a <b>commercial</b> <b>sample.</b> Using the ionic liquid column (isothermal mode at 200 °C) {{it was possible to}} separate linear primary fatty amines from C 12 to C 22 chain length in less 25 min with MS identification. The log of the amine retention factors are linearly related to the alkyl chain length with a methylene selectivity of 0. 117 kcal/mol for the saturated amines and 0. 128 kcal/mol for the mono-unsaturated amines. The sp(2) selectivity for unsaturated fatty amines also could be calculated as 0. 107 kcal/mol for the ionic liquid column. The <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> was quantified by GC with flame ionization detection (FID). An LC method also was developed with a reversed phase gradient separation using acetonitrile/formate buffer mobile phases and ESI-MS detection.
