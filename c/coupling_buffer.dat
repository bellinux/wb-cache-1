40|$|Publisher Summary This chapter {{primarily}} aims {{to explore}} sequencing strategies capable of rapid analysis of proteins, possibly recovered from 2 D-electrophoresis gels. For this purpose, the chemistry {{needed to be}} adaptable to multiple samples and sensitive enough {{to work in the}} femtomole range. The isothiocyanate trifluoroethyl isothiocyanate (TFEITC) chemistry shows early signs of meeting these criteria. The main practical requirement is that the starting peptide is dissolved in a defined volume of <b>coupling</b> <b>buffer,</b> dependent only on the number of cycles required and the volume applied per cycle. The chapter explains, on a low-picomolar scale, that a phosphorylated tyrosine residue could be directly identified making this a potentially powerful tool for the identification of this and other sites of post-translational modification. The inherent simplicity of the process should also allow for easy automation to permit rapid processing of samples in parallel. Certain limitations are entirely instrument-related, and not relevant to the demonstration of the degradation chemistry; however, future developments in instrumentation are required to overcome these limitations...|$|E
40|$|Ligands, such as {{antibodies}} or antigens, can be covalently {{coupled to}} affinity supports by many different chemical methods. The availability of primary amines {{on the surface}} of proteins makes amine coupling popular for affinity chromatography supports. Tosyl Activated Agarose (Product # 20415) can be used to couple primary amines. Hydroxyls {{on the surface of}} cross-linked beaded agarose are reacted with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (tosyl chloride) to yield a sulfonated support (see Figure 20). These sulfonates can couple to nucleophiles, such as primary amines or thiols, to yield a stable affinity support. 43 The tosylated support also couples to imidazole, or tyrosine hydroxyl groups. 43 Tosyl Activated Agarose couples more rapidly and more efficiently to sulfhydryl groups than to primary amines. Sulfhydryl coupling supports are convenient when accessible free sulfhydryls exist in the protein, or when one can be easily generated through reduction of a disulfide bond. Coupling of antibodies through reduced disulfide bonds in the hinge region is a popular way to couple without interfering with the antigen binding region. Tosyl Activated Agarose couples to primary amines at an optimal pH range of 9 - 10. 5. 43 Reducing agents, primary amines and other strong nucleophiles must be avoided in the <b>coupling</b> <b>buffer</b> because they will compete in the coupling reaction...|$|E

40|$|The family Poxviridae {{consists}} of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate {{exclusively in the}} cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (~ 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in {{the life cycle of}} the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection.

It is packaging which elicits a desirable biological response from food systems without the active component migrating from the packaging into the food. Possible applications for this include in-package enzymatic processing and non-migratory antimicrobial packaging. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) oligomers were covalently attached by one end to surface-oxidized poly(ethylene) (PE) films using carbodiimide coupling; bioactive peptides were covalently linked to the free terminus of the PEG chains using the same reaction. Reactions were confirmed and monitored through contact angle measurements, dye adsorption assays, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Bioactivity of the modified films depended on the peptide attached: antibacterial activity was found for films treated with antimicrobial peptide E 14 LKK; no activity was found for lactase attached to PE films. Antibacterial activity was demonstrated against E. coli for films to which side-chain-protected E 14 LKK was attached and then deprotected. Further investigation of the lactase coupling indicated difficulties with amino-carboxy-PEG attachment, despite prior successes with diamino-PEG; amino-carboxy-PEG coupling requires further optimization. Lactase attached directly to PE was inactive, regardless of lactose inclusion in the <b>coupling</b> <b>buffer,</b> however PEGylated lactase is active: {{the inclusion of a}} PEG spacer should improve immobilized lactase activity.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} concerning high-performance communications networks is the unavoidable congestion in network nodes. Network traffic is normally characterised as "bursty", which may use up network resources during peak periods. As a consequence end-user applications are subject to end-to-end delays and disruptions. Simultaneous transmission of packets on a finite bandwidth channel might result in contentions, where one or more packets are refrained from entering the transmission channel resulting in packet losses. Hence, the motivations of this thesis are two-fold: investigation and evaluation of switch architectures with electronic and optical buffers, and the development and evaluation of an improved dynamic threshold policy for shared memory switch architecture. In this work, switch architectures based on modular designs are evaluated, with simulation results showing that modular switch structures, i. e. multistage interconnection networks with optical delay line buffers, offer packet loss rate, throughput and average delay time similar to their electronic counterparts. Such optical architectures emulate prime features of shared memory switch architecture under general traffic conditions. Although the shared memory switch architecture is superior to other buffering approaches, but its performance is inadequate under imbalanced input traffic. Here its limiting features are investigated by means of numerical analysis. Different buffer management schemes, namely static thresholds, dynamic thresholds, pre-emptive, adaptive control, are investigated by using the Markov simulation model. An improved dynamic buffer management policy, decay function threshold (DFT) policy, is proposed and it is compared with the dynamic thresholds (DT), partial sharing partial partitioning (PSPP) and dynamic queue thresholds (DQT) buffer management policies by using bursty traffic source models, such as interrupted Poisson process (IPP), by means of simulations. Simulation results show that proposed policy {{is as good as}} well-known dynamic thresholds policy in the presence of best-effort traffic and offers improved packet loss performance when multicast traffic is considered. An integration framework for dynamic buffer management and bandwidth scheduling is also presented in this study. This framework employs loosely <b>coupled</b> <b>buffer</b> management and scheduling (weighted round robin, weighted fair queueing etc.) providing support for quality of service traffic. Conducted tests show that this framework matches the best-effort packet loss performance of dynamic thresholds policy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

However, the release rate of workpieces to the line is time-dependent, due to changes in demand. The buffers between the machines may be finite or infinite. We introduce two new sampling approaches for the performance evaluation of such flow lines: one method utilizes an approximation based on a mixed-integer program in discrete time with discrete material, while the other approximation is based on partial and ordinary differential equations in continuous time and with a continuous flow of material. In addition, we sketch a proof that these two approximations are equivalent under some linearity assumptions. A computational study demonstrates the accuracy of both approximations relative to a discrete-event simulation in continuous time. Furthermore, we reveal some effects occurring in unreliable flow lines with time-dependent processing rates...|$|R
