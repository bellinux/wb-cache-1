The interference between phase slips passing through different junctions of the array makes the hybridization {{sensitive to the}} charges of the superconducting islands comprising the array.

40|$|SUMMARY The paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} the optimum thermal design of free and forced convection fin arrays composed of longitudinal fins with constant thickness. Two different optimization problems have been considered: the minimization of the weight for a given heat flow and the maximization of the heat flow for a given fin weight. Two different geometrical configurations of the fin array have been considered: <b>closed</b> <b>array</b> and open array. The procedure for the optimization is provided in a general case and a complete analytical solution of the problem, for the case with the tip approximated as being insulated, is developed. The paper contains several illustrative examples of the application of the proposed optimization procedure...|$|E
40|$|This is the publisher’s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] statistical treatments of large data sets in sedimentary geochemical and other fields are rapidly becoming more popular as analytical and computational capabilities expand. Because geochemical data sets present a unique set of conditions (e. g., the <b>closed</b> <b>array),</b> application of generic off-the-shelf applications is not straightforward and can yield misleading results. We present here annotated MATLAB scripts (and specific guidelines for their use) for Q-mode factor analysis, a constrained least squares multiple linear regression technique, and a total inversion protocol, that are based on the well-known approaches taken by Dymond (1981), Leinen and Pisias (1984), Kyte et al. (1993), and their predecessors. Although these techniques have been used by investigators for the past decades, their application has been neither consistent nor transparent, as their code has remained in-house or in formats not commonly used by many of today’s researchers (e. g., FORTRAN). In addition to providing the annotated scripts and instructions for use, we discuss general principles to be considered when performing multivariate statistical treatments of large geochemical data sets, provide a brief contextual history of each approach, explain their similarities and differences, and include a sample data set for the user to test their own manipulation of the scripts...|$|E

For accurate depiction of an acoustic environment, such as a halls, side reflections are essential. Appropriate microphone techniques should therefore be used, if room impression is important.

40|$|Data {{from two}} {{intervals}} when pulsation activity was simultaneously observed on both ATS 1 and Ogo 5 satellites are presented. The first example, a Pc 4, indicates that this pulsation {{is caused by}} a field line near L = 7 resonating in its second-harmonic mode. This is inferred from both plasma density measurements and polarization characteristics. The wave was not observed at three ground stations {{in the vicinity of the}} satellite conjugate points. This indicates that Pc 4 waves are very localized in latitude and that a <b>close</b> <b>array</b> (less than 100 km) is needed to perform effective correlation with satellites. The second event, which is also in the Pc 4 band, can again be inferred to be a field line resonance from the polarization characteristic...|$|R

40|$|SWI-SNF alters DNA-histone {{interactions}} {{within a}} nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. These alterations cause {{changes in the}} topology of a <b>closed</b> circular nucleosomal <b>array</b> that persist after removal of ATP from the reaction. We demonstrate here that a remodeled <b>closed</b> circular <b>array</b> will revert toward its original topology when ATP is removed, indicating that the remodeled array has a higher energy {{than that of the}} starting state. However, reversion occurs with a half-life measured in hours, implying a high energy barrier between the remodeled and standard states. The addition of competitor DNA accelerates reversion of the remodeled array by more than 10 -fold, and we interpret this result to mean that binding of human SWI-SNF (hSWI-SNF), {{even in the absence of}} ATP hydrolysis, stabilizes the remodeled state. In addition, we also show that SWI-SNF is able to remodel a <b>closed</b> circular <b>array</b> in the absence of topoisomerase I, demonstrating that hSWI-SNF can induce topological changes even when conditions are highly energetically unfavorable. We conclude that the remodeled state is less stable than the standard state but that the remodeled state is kinetically trapped by the high activation energy barrier separating it from the unremodeled conformation...|$|R

40|$|Rho GTPases control many cytoskeleton-dependent processes, but {{how they}} {{regulate}} spatially distinct features of cytoskeletal function {{within a single}} cell is poorly understood. Here, we studied active RhoA and Cdc 42 in wounded Xenopus oocytes, which assemble and close a dynamic ring of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin- 2 around wound sites. RhoA and Cdc 42 are rapidly activated around wound sites in a calcium-dependent manner and segregate into distinct, concentric zones around the wound, with active Cdc 42 in the approximate middle of the F-actin array and active RhoA on {{the interior of the}} array. These zones form before F-actin accumulation, and then move in concert with the <b>closing</b> <b>array.</b> Microtubules and F-actin are required for normal zone organization and dynamics, as is crosstalk between RhoA and Cdc 42. Each of the zones makes distinct contributions to the organization and function of the actomyosin wound array. We propose that similar rho activity zones control related processes such as cytokinesis...|$|R

Missiles thrown toward it were intercepted by the shields, and fell harmless to the ground. Darts, arrows, javelins, and every other weapon which could be projected from a distance, were equally ineffectual, and no one could come near enough to men thus protected to strike at them with the sword. Even cavalry were utterly powerless in attacking such chevaux de frise as the phalanx presented. No charge, however furious, could break its serrated ranks; an onset upon it could only end in impaling the men and the horses that made it together on the points of the innumerable spears.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Arrays of subnanoliter wells (nanowells) {{provide a}} useful system to isolate single cells and analyze their {{secreted}} proteins. Two general approaches have emerged: one that uses open arrays and local capture of secreted proteins, {{and a second}} (called microengraving) that relies on <b>closed</b> <b>arrays</b> to capture secreted proteins on a solid substrate, which is subsequently removed from the array. However, the design and operating parameters for efficient capture from these two approaches to analyze single-cell secretion have not been extensively considered. Using numerical simulations, we analyzed the operational envelope for both open and closed formats, {{as a function of}} the spatial distribution of capture ligands, their affinities for the protein, and the rates of single-cell secretion. Based on these analyses, we present a modified approach to capture secreted proteins in-well for highly active secreting cells. This simple method for in-well detection should facilitate rapid identification of cell lines with high specific productivities.
