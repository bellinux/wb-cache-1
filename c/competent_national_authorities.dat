5000|$|The portal {{was officially}} {{launched}} in March 2003 by Viviane Reding, the Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth, Media and Sport, during an informal {{meeting of the}} ministries for education in Athens. According to the European Commissioner, the project [...] "makes it easier to find the necessary information to study and train {{in another part of}} Europe" [...] It provided information on education systems, qualifications, grants and tuition fees in the EEC countries. It also provided practical help on matters such as finding a place to stay, living costs, the legal aspects of studying abroad, taxes, and social security as well as facilitating exchange programmes and the process of moving from one Member State to another. In this first phase, the portal provided access to about 5,000 links available in 11 languages. Approximately 60,000 entries were registered by the end of 2003. People with disabilities were prioritised as a target group. At this stage, it did not directly provide information about single courses but pointed the user toward websites and/or databases, where the required information could be found. The disadvantage of this solution was that it required the user to access different websites with different user interfaces, and of course different classification systems, languages and educational models. In a report of January 2004, the European Commission stated PLOTEUS I was [...] "only the first step, to be followed by a service which will offer citizens direct access to information on learning opportunities, by making national services inter-operable throughout Europe. After discussion with the <b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities,</b> a tender has been launched and the development work will start early in 2004." [...] The number of visits, estimated in June 2003 at between 1,500 and 2,000 per day, reached 60,000 per month in 2005. According to 2004 external evaluation, the PLOTEUS portal was considered by 2 thirds of the users [...] "useful for their work". Nevertheless, according to a paper published in 2006, though [...] "laudable in its aims to help citizens find out information about studying in Europe", the PLOTEUS portal [...] "presents learners with a bewildering assortment of learning opportunities, each leading the enquirer to the vagaries of providers’ websites and none of the information offered to learners is standardised or predictable, making it difficult to determine which goals can be reached by which routes". Another paper criticised the fact these [...] "important instruments" [...] did not exist everywhere and were not completely available in English.|$|E

Previous work describes the preparation of the labelled precursor [11 C]L-deprenyl-D 2 from the activated d 2 -propargyl group and L-amphetamine as starting material. L-amphetamine is extremely hard to access to, especially because only few companies market it, as well as the import requirements given by the <b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> take long time and are difficult to succeed. Because of this, it is convenient to develop a new synthetic strategy.|$|E

This is partly due to agriculture, because large amounts of antibiotics are used to treat animals, which encourages resistant genes to appear and transfer to humans through foodstuffs.

40|$|At {{the urging}} of <b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities,</b> a limited risk {{assessment}} on Salmonella in chicken meat preparations in Belgium was undertaken following a retail-to-table approach. The input distribution of Salmonella was based on surveillance data in Belgium. To analyze the relative impact of {{reducing the risk of}} salmonellosis associated with a decrease in the Salmonella contamination level, different distributions based on the actual situation but limiting the number of portions containing Salmonella at 1 CFU per 1, 10, and 25 g of meat were used in the quantitative microbial risk assessment model. The quantitative microbial risk assessment model also was run several times with a theoretical fixed input of Salmonella assuming all portions possessed the same fixed contamination level set at 1, 000, 100, 10, and 1 CFU/g of meat and 1 CFU per 10, 25, 100, and 1, 000 g of meat. With regard to the initial contamination level, the results indicate, both by the narrowing of the current distribution and by the fixed input, that especially the higher levels of contamination (> 1 CFU/g) contribute to the increased risk for salmonellosis...|$|E
40|$|Horses {{indigenous}} to East and Southeast (E/SE) Asia, including native, landrace, feral, and wild populations, embody valuable genetic diversity. Conservation efforts for animals {{have largely been}} driven by humane altruism, with little consideration for the information value of genomes. Yet, if horses are viewed as archives of information as well as objects of affection, their conservation shifts to a market-based paradigm. Horse genetic resources (GR) likely contain significant value to the lucrative global horse industry, including veterinary applications such as diagnostics, therapeutics, genetic markers, gene therapies, and cloning technologies. As biotechnology becomes increasingly sophisticated, mining of horse GR will accelerate, thus facilitat- ing identification, inventorying, bioprospecting, and commercialization of genetic information. Yet, establishing a value chain that balances equitable compensation for commercial applications while promoting conservation of horse populations remains a challenge. Recommendations presented here include establishing regional and national human resource and institutional capacity (<b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities),</b> that catalog eco-geographical inventories of horse GR; monitor, manage, market and direct equitable value chains from horse to genetic information to commercial products; and ensure revenue flow back to support conservation. This system will foster market incentives to build capacity for sustainable conservation of the diverse horse populations of E/SE Asia...|$|E

40|$|The UN Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Biosafety Protocol) is an {{international}} instrument addressing the potential environment and health issues of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Its article 27 on Liability and Redress, which finally has been explored as a new treaty "Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol" (Supplementary Protocol) was recently adopted in October 2010. The new Protocol chose an administrative approach instead of {{an international}} civil liability regime, and left the implementation to the discretion of <b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> of the parties as rather a "national approach". As {{a party to the}} Biosafety Protocol, China might take the Supplementary Protocol into account for its own biosafety regime. The interplay between the Biosafety Protocol (and the Supplementary Protocol) with China's national biosafety regime will be briefly examined in this paper. It argues that a comprehensive biosafety law will be needed to oversee the import and export of GMOs, as well as efficiently manage cultivation of GM crops within China. The paper concludes that the inclusion of a liability clause into the biosafety law seems necessary for China's obligation to the Biosafety protocol to deal with the uncertainties of GMOs, thereby ensuring the sustainable development of biotechnology...|$|E

40|$|The {{public health}} effect of illness caused by {{foodborne}} pathogens in Greece during 1996 – 2006 was quantifi ed by using publicly available surveillance data, hospital statistics, and literature. Results were expressed as {{the incidence of}} different disease outcomes and as disability-adjusted life years (DALY), a health indicator combining illness and death estimates into a single metric. It {{has been estimated that}} each year ≈ 370, 000 illnesses/million inhabitants are likely caused because of eating contaminated food; 900 of these illnesses are severe and 3 fatal, corresponding to 896 DALY/million inhabitants. Ill-defi ned intestinal infections accounted for the greatest part of reported cases and 27 % of the DALY. Brucellosis, echinococcosis, salmonellosis, and toxoplasmosis were found to be the most common known causes of foodborne illnesses, being responsible for 70 % of the DALY. Overall, the DALY metric provided a quantitative perspective on the impact of foodborne illness that may be useful for prioritizing food safety management targets. To initiate and sustain efforts for prevention and control of foodborne diseases, it is essential to determine the extent and dimensions of the problem (1). Accurate knowledge of disease incidence and severity is invaluable to <b>competent</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> for use in selecting appropriate management actions to reduce the overall public health impact.
