5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> the new album.

During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|Lance Corporal Jose Francisco Jimenez (1946–1969) was {{assigned}} to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On August 28, 1969, his unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese Army soldiers <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> well-camouflaged emplacements at Quang Nam Province. Jimenez personally destroyed several enemy personnel and silenced an antiaircraft weapon. He then maneuvered to within ten feet of hostile soldiers who were firing automatic weapons from a trench and, {{in the face of}} vicious enemy fire, destroyed the position. As he moved to attack another enemy soldier, he was mortally wounded.|$|E

In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E

5|$|The French {{artillery}} <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> wooded areas {{proved more}} potent than the tanks.

Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E

In the end, Hawking and Homer meet at Moe's Tavern for a drink. Homer imitates Hawking in an attempt to make him pay the tab and gets punched by a boxing glove on a spring, which is <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> Hawking's wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Three days of {{cold weather}} and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Edmond Van der Meersch led {{an attack on}} the brook.

A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers <b>concealed</b> <b>in</b> the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E

5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC).

5|$|ASquadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) {{continued}} the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. <b>Concealed</b> <b>in</b> hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged ASquadron, disabling five tanks, but {{were forced to}} withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading CCompany, and {{the attack on the}} fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that CCompany, reunited with ASquadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and BCompanies 1DLI, eventually took the position.
