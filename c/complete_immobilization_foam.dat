50|$|Air bag or air strut {{failure is}} usually caused by wet rust, due to old age, or {{moisture}} within the air system that damages {{it from the}} inside. Air ride suspension parts may fail because rubber dries out. Punctures to the air bag may be caused from debris on the road. With custom applications, improper installation may cause the air bags to rub against the vehicle's frame or other surrounding parts, damaging it. The over-extension of an airspring which is not sufficiently constrained by other suspension components, such as a shock absorber, may also lead to the premature failure of an airspring through the tearing of the flexible layers. Failure of an airspring may also result in <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the vehicle, since the vehicle will rub against the ground or be too high to move.

50|$|Often {{compression}} is used concurrently in {{the form}} of pressure wraps, to reduce edema and swelling. Pressure wraps are usually used as long as inflammation is active. Bandaging is especially important in cases of severe swelling, such as cellulitis, which can cause continued lameness if the edema persists after the initial cause has been successfully treated. Bandaging may also be helpful in reducing pain, by stimulating mechanoreceptors. Bandaging is often used to keep wounds clean, but has been shown to increase the risk of exuberant granulation tissue (“proud flesh”) formation. Casting may be used to completely immobilize a joint, which is important in the case of destabilizing injury, but increases the risk of adhesion formation within a joint, and muscle and joint cartilage atrophy. In the case of joint pain secondary to capsulitis or synovitis, which are not destabilizing, <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the joint should be avoided.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, the {{immobilization}} of MNP in PVA {{lead to a}} higher reduction of SAR values compared to agarose, most likely through stronger inhibition of Brownian relaxation, leaving Néel relaxation and hysteresis as the main contributor for MNP heating. The observed SAR reduction by an almost <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the MNP mimics the in vivo situation where MNP are attached to cell membranes or are taken up into intracellular vesicles.

The model shows that selectivity loss appears as the molar ratio of [ligand]/[ionic site] < 1 in the case of fixed ionic sites. The effect of <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the neutral ligand has been simulated by gradually decreasing the mobility ratio α of the cation-ligand complex and free cation in the membrane phase.

This paper addresses the interaction between dry frictional soil and the multi-legged wheelleg concept, with the aim of exploiting its enhanced mobility for safe, in-situ terrain sensing. The influence of multiple legs and different foot designs on wheel-leg-soil interaction is analyzed by incorporating these aspects to an existing terradynamics model. In addition, new theoretical models are proposed and experimentally validated to relate wheel-leg slip to both motor torque and stick-slip vibrations. These models, capable of estimating wheelleg slip from purely proprioceptive sensors, are then applied in combination with detected wheel-leg sinkage to successfully characterize the load bearing and shear strength properties of different types of deformable soil.

In the present study, we compared the results of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy planning for five patients irradiated in the supine and {{prone position}}. Tumor stage was T 1 N 0 M 0 in four patients and T 1 N 1 M 0 in one. All patients had been previously submitted to conservative breast surgery. Breast size was large in three patients and moderate in the other two. Irradiation in the prone position was performed using an <b>immobilization</b> <b>foam</b> pad with a hole cut into it to accommodate the breast so that it would hang down away from the chest wall. Dose-volume histograms showed that mean irradiation doses reaching the ipsilateral lung were 8. 3 ± 3. 6 Gy with the patient in the supine position and 1. 4 ± 1. 0 Gy with the patient in the prone position (P = 0. 043). The values for the contralateral lung were 1. 3 ± 0. 7 and 0. 3 ± 0. 1 Gy (P = 0. 043) and the values for cardiac tissue were 4. 6 ± 1. 6 and 3. 0 ± 1. 7 Gy (P = 0. 079), respectively. Thus, the dose-volume histograms demonstrated that lung tissue irradiation was significantly lower with the patient in the prone position than in the supine position. Large-breasted women appeared to benefit most from irradiation in the prone position. Prone position breast irradiation appears to be a simple and effective alternative to the conventional supine position for patients with large breasts, since they are subjected to lower pulmonary doses which may cause less pulmonary side effects in the future...|$|R

For 4 leopard cats (group 2) after an initial mean dose of 6. 92 ± 1. 06 mg/kg of Zoletil©, it was necessary to administer a second dose (or booster) of Zoletil © (mean dose 2. 6 ± 0. 33 mg/kg) or ketamine (mean dose 3. 5 ± 0. 05 mg / kg) to achieve <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization.</b> There were differences between the periods of anesthesia resulting from these boosters, which were 43. 5 ± 2. 1 minutes for ketamine and 89. 5 ± 6. 36 minutes for Zoletil©.

40|$|Off-road ground mobile robots {{are widely}} used in diverse applications, both in {{terrestrial}} and planetary environments. They provide an efficient alternative, with lower risk and cost, to explore or to transport materials through hazardous or challenging terrain. However, nongeometric hazards that cannot be detected remotely pose {{a serious threat to}} the mobility of such robots. A prominent example of the negative effects these hazards can have is found on planetary rover exploration missions. They can cause a serious degradation of mission performance at best and <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> and mission failure at worst. To tackle this issue, the work presented in this paper investigates the novel application of an existing enhanced-mobility locomotion concept, a hybrid wheel-leg equipped by a lightweight micro-rover, for in situ characterization of deformable terrain and online detection of nongeometric hazards. This is achieved by combining an improved vision-based approach and a new ranging-based approach to wheel-leg sinkage detection. In addition, the paper proposes an empirical model, and a parametric generalization, to predict terrain trafficability based on wheel-leg sinkage and a well-established semiempirical terramechanics model. The robustness and accuracy of the sinkage detection methods implemented are tested in a variety of conditions, both in the laboratory and in the field, using a single wheel-leg test bed.

Bovine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 was selectively deuterated at the aromatic ring systems of Trp- 3 and Phe- 5 and porcine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 at Trp- 3 only. Solid-state 2 H NMR spectra of the lyophilized enzymes exhibited quadrupole splittings {{on the order of}} 130 kHz, indicating almost <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the aromatic ring systems. Exposure to a water-saturated atmosphere did not remove these steric constraints. However, side-chain mobility could be induced for the tryptophyl residue of the bovine enzyme by dissolving this enzyme in aqueous buffer or micellar solution whereas the phenyl ring always remained immobile and served as a probe for the protein's overall rotation. Typical correlation times for the tryptophyl and phenyl aromatic ring systems in aqueous solution were 7 ps and 13 ns (at 20 degrees C), respectively. The correlation time of the phenyl ring was longer than expected for the monomeric protein (approximately 6 ns), suggesting some aggregation of the protein at the high concentrations used for the NMR measurements. Addition of a micellar solution of oleoylphosphocholine had no influence on the motional freedom of the tryptophyl residue but approximately doubled the correlation time of the phenyl ring, indicating an increase of the effective volume of the tumbling particle due to lipid-protein interaction.

Radiographs showed short and deformed long bones, significant cranial hyperostosis, enthesopathies, and calcifications of the paraspinal ligaments. Biochemistries were consistent with hypophosphatemia owing to renal phosphate wasting; markers of bone turnover and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23) levels were increased significantly. Nucleotide sequence analysis of DMP 1 revealed a novel homozygous mutation at the splice acceptor junction of exon 6 (IVS 5 - 1 G > A). Two heterozygous carriers of the mutation also showed mild hypophosphatemia, and bone biopsy in one of these individuals showed focal areas of osteomalacia. In bone, DMP 1 expression was absent in the homozygote but normal in the heterozygote, whereas FGF- 23 expression was increased in both subjects but higher in the ARHP patient.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{was to examine the}} {{mechanisms}} by which physical activity and inactivity modify muscle fatigue. It is well known that acute or chronic increases in physical activity result in structural, metabolic, hormonal, neural and molecular adaptations that increase the level of force or power that can be sustained by a muscle. These adaptations depend on the type, intensity and volume of the exercise stimulus, but recent studies have highlighted the role of high intensity, short duration exercise as a time-efficient method to achieve both anaerobic and aerobic/endurance type adaptations. The factors that determine the fatigue profile of a muscle during intense exercise include muscle fibre composition, neuromuscular characteristics high energy metabolite stores, buffering capacity, ionic regulation, capillarization and mitochondrial density. Muscle fiber type transformation during exercise training is usually towards the intermediate type IIA at the expense of both type I and type IIx myosin heavy chain isoforms. High intensity training results in increases of both glycolyic and oxidative enzymes, muscle capilarization, improved phosphocreatine resynthesis and regulation of K+, H+ and lactate ions. Decreases of the habitual activity level due to injury or sedentary lifestyle result in partial or even compete reversal of the adaptations due to previous training, manifested by reductions in fibre cross-sectional area, decreased oxidative capacity and capillarization. <b>Complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> due to injury results in markedly decreased force output and fatigue resistance.

40|$|Computational Infrastructure and Informatics Poster SessionA {{telemetry}} unit {{designed to}} monitor strain in bones is presented. This unit allows studying {{the relationship between}} bone load and bone mass in scenarios that were not possible with current setup. The current measuring setup employs a bench top load instrument and a data acquisition unit to read the output of strain gage sensors attached to the ulna of a mouse. Although precise, this setup is bulky and requires <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the mouse. The telemetry unit developed by the authors replaces the data acquisition unit in the current setup {{and is able to}} wirelessly transmit the readings of the strain gage to a remote computer. The telemetry unit makes possible the collection of bone strain data in scenarios where the mouse is free to move or while performing fatigue-inducing exercises. The unit has been designed around an ultra low-power microcontroller (MSP 430). The microcontroller makes the design highly flexible and programmable. The telemetry unit also includes a high-performance instrumentation amplifier to amplify the strain gage output. The gain and offset of the amplifier are digitally set by the microcontroller eliminating the use of manual potentiometers. The board has an expansion connector that allows up to 16 additional strain gages to be connected to the unit and incorporates a low-power radio transceiver operating in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. The data transmitted by the unit is received by a base station connected to a computer via a USB cable. The telemetry unit has been tested in a lab setting and is able to transmit the strain data at distances greater than 20 m while consuming less than 30 mW of power. This low power consumption allows the unit to be powered by a micro-battery weighting less than 3 grams. The telemetry unit can be used in other biomedical applications such as in the monitoring of orthopedic implants and can be easily configured to use other type of sensors...|$|R
40|$|As {{bisphenol}} A (BPA) exerts oxidative/pro-apoptotic {{effects in}} several cell types, we explored whether the in vitro exposure to BPA could affect human sperm integrity through the induction of pro-oxidative/apoptotic mitochondrial dysfunction. The exposure of motile sperm suspensions to scalar BPA concentrations for 4 h produced {{a decrease in}} the mitochondrial membrane potential, starting from 300 μM. It was associated with an increased mitochondrial generation of superoxide anion, caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 activation and motility decrement. Vitality decline was observed at BPA≥ 400 μM. Twenty hours exposure to 300 μM BPA, but not to lower concentrations, produced a significant loss in sperm vitality associated with a <b>complete</b> sperm <b>immobilization.</b> Finally, 300 μM BPA also produced a significant DNA oxidative damage, as revealed by the formation of oxidized base adduct 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the equilibrium constants for the binding of AEDANS-labelled S 1 to S 1 -depleted 30 S and 70 S ribosomes. For "tight" ribosomes, {{the association of}} S 1 increases with the sixth power of Mg 2 + concentration, but for 30 S subunits and "loose" ribosomes, {{there is virtually no}} dependence of the association on Mg 2 + over the same concentration range, 2 - 10 mM in Mg 2 +. The binding of S 1 to 70 S ribosomes at 10 mM Mg 2 + is stabilized by 2 kcal/mol compared to the binding to 30 S subunits. When intact S 1 binds to tight ribosomes, the fluorescence anisotrophy is that for virtually <b>complete</b> rotational <b>immobilization.</b> The anisotropies vary considerably with the preparation and treatment of both S 1 and ribosomes and these variations are detailed here.

40|$|Abstract Background Different {{types of}} {{membrane}} microdomains (rafts) have been postulated {{to be present}} in the rear and front of polarized migrating T-lymphocytes. Disruption of rafts by cholesterol sequestration prevents T-cell polarization and migration. Reggie/flotillin- 1 and - 2 are two highly homologous proteins that are thought to shape membrane microdomains. We have previously demonstrated the enrichment of flotillins in the uropod of human neutrophils. We have now investigated mechanisms involved in chemokine-induced flotillin reorganization in human T-lymphocytes, and possible roles of flotillins in lymphocyte polarization. Results We studied flotillin reorganization and lateral mobility at the plasma membrane using immunofluorescence staining and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching). We show that flotillins redistribute early upon chemokine stimulation, and form very stable caps in the uropods of human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, colocalizing with the adhesion molecule PSGL- 1 and activated ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins. Chemokine-induced formation of stable flotillin caps requires integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, but is not abolished by inhibitors suppressing Rho-kinase or myosin II activity. Tagged flotillin- 2 and flotillin- 1 coexpressed in T-lymphocytes, but not singly expressed proteins, colocalize in stable caps at the tips of uropods. Lateral mobility of coexpressed flotillins at the plasma membrane is already partially restricted in the absence of chemokine. Incubation with chemokine results in almost <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of flotillins. Capping is abolished when wild-type flotillin- 1 is coexpressed with a mutant of flotillin- 2 (G 2 A) that is unable to interact with the plasma membrane, or with a deletion mutant of flotillin- 2 that lacks a putative actin-binding domain. Wild-type flotillin- 2 in contrast forms caps when coexpressed with a mutant of flotillin- 1 unable to interact with membranes. Transfection of T-lymphocytes with flotillin- 2 -G 2 A reduces cell polarization and uropod recruitment of endogenous flotillin- 1 and PSGL- 1. Conclusions Our data suggest that stable flotillin cap formation in the rear of polarized T-lymphocytes requires flotillin heterooligomer formation, as well as direct F-actin interactions of flotillin- 2 and raft/membrane association of flotillin- 2, but not - 1. Our data also implicate flotillin-rich actin-dependent membrane microdomains in T-lymphocyte uropod formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen free-ranging moose {Alces alces) (2 adult males, 13 adult {{females and}} 2 female calves) were immobilized with a {{combination}} of medetomidine hydochloride (MED) and ketamine hydrochloride (KET) in early autumn (August-September). Drugs were administrated with plastic projectile syringes fired from a dart gun, either from a car or by approaching the animals on foot. MED at 30 mg/adult and 15 mg/calf in combination with KET at 400 mg/adult and 200 mg/calf induced <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> with sternal or lateral recumbency and loss of the corneal reflex in all individuals. The mean &plusmn; SD time from darting to when the animals were found was 18. 3 &plusmn; 8. 7 min for adults and the mean distance covered by these animals between darting and recumbency was 320 + 200 m. No side effects of clinical significance were detected and registration of the rectal temperature (38. 8 &plusmn; 0. 5 &deg;C), heart rate (44 &plusmn; 7 beats/min), respiratory rate (31 &plusmn; 20 breaths/min) and relative arterial oxygen saturation (89 &plusmn; 3 %, n= 8) during immobilization in adults showed that these physiological parameters were within the safe ranges established for moose. Blood samples from adults were analyzed for 17 haematological and 33 serum biochemical constituents and the results were compared to corresponding values found in moose immobilized with etorphine (ETO). Although the lower levels (p&lt; 0. 05) found for haematocrit, red blood cells, haemoglobin and Cortisol in the MED-KET group may indicate a difference in the stress response, the low muscle enzyme levels in both groups show that these immobilizing drugs and capture methods induce very little physical stress in moose. A hyperglycaemic response was found in MED-KET treated animals. Atipamezole hydrochloride (ATI) rapidly remobilized all animals and the time elapsing from ATI administration to standing was 3 - 9 &plusmn; 1. 8 min after i. v. /s. c. treatment (n= 7) and 6. 9 &plusmn; 3. 4 min after i. m. /s. c. injection (n= 8). No side effects were detected after reversal. In conclusion, medetomidine-ketamine and atipamezole can be recommended for reversible immobilization of free-ranging moose in early autumn...|$|R
40|$|Tailoring/Adapting Applications of Sorbents for Phosphate Immobilization: Energetics and Simulation Modeling. The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a remediation technology for a rapid P uptake and <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of P in soils, and evaluate the potential for re-use of such immobilized P. Many studies exist in the peer-reviewed literature on the use of sorbents for P immobilization. However, there is little to no published information on the development of remediation strategies that focus on the tailoring and use of sorbents to target various P species concurrently for a rapid and efficient P immobilization. To gain knowledge in tailoring an application of different sorbents in P immobilization, the following tasks were performed: 1. Selection and evaluation of various sorbents (Al drinking water treatment residuals (Al-WTR), Slag, Gypsum, Lime kiln dust (LimeKD) and MgO for P immobilization. 2. Characterization of the surface properties of all selected sorbents by physisorption analysis. 3. Evaluations of the sorbents-P interactions in phosphorous contaminated water and soil matrices through multiple techniques of incubation, operationally defined speciation (sequential extraction), and geochemical modeling. 4. Development of a co-blending technique and assessment of its efficiency on immobilized P through leaching, geochemical modeling and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). 5. Flow calorimetry which provides a controlled environment for quantifying parametric inputs and outflows of P in this case was used to help in developing a simple mathematical model for simulation of P sorption. The major findings from these experimental and modeling studies can be summarized as follows: Results from the evaluation of sorbents suggest Al-WTR and Gypsum had limitation in immobilizing P at near natural condition (soil solution extracts containing P), whereas, Slag, LimeKD and MgO removed P greater than 90 % from solution. On the contrary, using lab reagents suggest, all the sorbents were excellent candidates for sorption. The specific surface areas of the sorbents were 21, 3. 1, 3. 3, 2. 0, and 5. 0, m 2 g- 1 for Al-WTR, Gypsum, Slag, LimeKD and MgO respectively. Physisorption isotherm further revealed that the sorbents were non-porous with limited microporosity, suggesting that adsorption of P may be governed by other secondary mechanisms of chemisorption and or precipitation reactions. Sorbents-P interactions revealed that Al-WTR removed P associated with Al-Fe, significantly greater than sorbents containing Ca-Mg i. e. Slag, and MgO (P < 0. 001). On the other hand, sorbents containing Ca-Mg immobilized P associated with Ca-Mg than that of Al-Fe (P < 0. 001) Thus showing that co-blending the sorbents, could immobilize all P forms liable to cause environmental pollution. The results from the co-blending technique of using Al-WTR with Ca-Mg based sorbents suggest the method can effectively and rapidly immobilized P. This was assessed with soil leaching experiments. Data of 10 g kg- 1 each of Al-WTR and Slag reduced P to almost zero {{in the first week of}} leaching. In addition, the results showed that, the co-blending of (Al-WTR+Slag) is statistically and significantly greater than depending on 20 g kg- 1 of solely Al-WTR for P immobilization. Further, co-blended Al-WTR+Slag had a pH that is about the same as that of the control (unamended soil). Furthermore, with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealed presence of new solid phases. Geochemical models also revealed the nature of these solid phases. Results suggest presence of various PO 4 minerals including struvite. Although, not identified experimentally, the occurrence of struvite would be paramount as it is not only a sink for P but can also be used as a source of controlled P release. Accordingly, the potential formation of this mineral could lead to the development of a remediation strategy that may help in sustainable re-use of PO 4. Phosphorus sorption on Al-WTR and its dynamics were modeled using flow calorimetry, and a new and simple mathematical model was proposed. A sensitivity analysis on parameters influencing P sorption showed clearly that for P sorption, the most important single parameter is the rate and not the adsorption capacity. The P model validation studies resulted in very good predictions with R 2 ~ 90 %. A decision support tool was developed based on the mathematical model, with the goal to provide easy access to decision makers on the types of sorbent to use for water quality considerations. Finally, future laboratory studies are needed to identify and quantify struvite formation, if formed under the above described experimental conditions and as predicted by the geochemical models. This could then lead to optimization studies focusing on slow release of previously sorbed P and its potential applications. Overall, the results suggest that the novel co-blending technique can lead to rapid and <b>complete</b> <b>immobilization</b> of P...|$|R

The fungus becomes entrapped as it threads growing mycelia {{through the open}} foam matrix. The tenacity of binding {{and the amount of}} biomass bound depend on initial spore numbers and nutrient concentration. Optimal dehydroabietic acid transformation occurs with early-stationary-phase foam-bound mycelia suspended in buffer at pH 6. 5 to 8. 5 with aeration > 0. 1 liter liter− 1 min− 1 and near a temperature maximum of 33 °C. Neither a greater number of similarly loaded foam cubes nor a greater surface area for similar amounts of biomass increased transformation rates. Compared to free mycelial cultures, foam presence retards growth and decreases the rate of precursor transformation but does not alter the nature of the metabolites formed from dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, or isopimaric acid. Diffusional barriers or binding of substrates in an inaccessible manner may cause the observed inhibitions.
