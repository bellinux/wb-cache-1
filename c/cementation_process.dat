25|$|Two {{decades before}} the Industrial Revolution an {{improvement}} {{was made in}} the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the <b>cementation</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{is similar}} to the salt <b>cementation</b> <b>process</b> but creates sulfides instead of chlorides. Finely divided impure gold and {{elemental}} sulfur are reacted together under moderate heat in a sealed crucible. The impurities form metal sulfides and the gold is left unreacted. The gaseous sulfide condenses on the crucible fabric. The antimony process is the same but uses stibnite (Sb2S3) instead of sulfur because stibnite is stable at a higher temperature than sulfur. This is much quicker than the salt process and gave a purer gold, but it could dissolve some of the gold as well. This process is first described in the Probierbuchlein.|$|E

2500|$|Steel (with {{a carbon}} content between pig iron and wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity as an alloy. Its process of production, Wootz steel, was exported before the 4th century BC to ancient China, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Archaeological evidence {{of cast iron}} appears in 5th century BC China. New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the <b>cementation</b> <b>process</b> were devised in the 17th century.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, ironworkers in Western Europe had {{developed}} the <b>cementation</b> <b>process</b> for carburizing wrought iron. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay {{to be held}} at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week. [...] During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing cement steel or blister steelalso known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source. [...] The earliest place where this process was used in England was at Coalbrookdale from 1819, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavatedin 20012005). [...] For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619.

40|$|International audienceLarge {{quantities}} of cements and concretes {{need to be}} incorporated in geological disposal facilities for long-lived radwaste. An alkaline plume diffusing from an aged concrete (pH 12. 5) through argillite-type rocks has been modelled considering feedback of porosity value variations on transport properties using the reactive transport code TOUGHREACT. The mineralogical composition of the argillite is modified at the interface with the concrete. Diffusion of cementitious elements leads to rapid and strong porosity occlusion in the argillite. Numerical results show that both reaction rates and spatial refinement affect mineralogical transformation pathways. The variations in porosity and {{the extension of the}} zone affected by the alkaline perturbation are compared at different times. The major effects of mineral precipitation under kinetic constraints, rather than local equilibrium, are a delay in the porosity clogging and an increase in the extension of the alkaline perturbation in the clay formation. The same time-delay rise for the porosity occlusion also appears for the roughest spatial resolutions. A simulation as representative as possible of temporal and spatial scales of <b>cementation</b> <b>processes</b> must then be supported by more comparative data such as long term experimental investigations or natural analogues...|$|R

Analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: width variations of the opposition surge can be related to differences in porosity or grain size distribution on the various domains, with little or no effect from suspended dust. As the biggest effects are observed on dark and bright materials, intermediate behaviors on average-bright regions cannot result from a mixing process, but are more likely to come from either <b>cementation</b> <b>processes</b> or modification of the grain size distribution under the influence of wind, which under Martian conditions preferentially removes the biggest particles.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades Denmark has {{experienced}} a growing interest in low-input farming systems like organic farming. These systems rely on a high soil fertility to maintain nutrient availability and plant health. Soil aggregation contributes to this fertility, because {{it is crucial to}} soil porosity, aeration and infiltration of water. This paper reports a study of two pairs of differently managed, neighboring fields. The aim was to elucidate long-term effects of the different farming systems on physical and biological variables with influence on bonding and binding mechanisms of soil aggregation. Each pair consists of an organically grown dairy farm soil, based on a forage crop rotation system, including grass (Org-FCS(G)) and a conventionally managed soil. One of the conventional farms has a forage crop rotation with annual cash crops and no grass (Conv-FCS(NG)) and one has been grown continuously with small grain cereals and rape (Conv-CCS). Our results indicate that the Org-FCS(G) soils stimulate biotic soil aggregating agents as measured by extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and hyphal length measurements, respectively. Generally, the Conv-CCS soil, which relies exclusively on synthetic fertilisers and cereal production, offered poor conditions for the biotic binding and bonding agents. Nevertheless this soil contained a large amount of stable macro-aggregates. This is explained by the physical results, which indicated that the strong macro-aggregation was due to clay dispersion and <b>cementation</b> <b>processes</b> rather than to biotic processes...|$|R

Salt cementation continued to be the main method of parting until the 16th century but in later Middle Ages processes using sulfur, antimony and mineral acids began to be used. There are archaeological finds at sites in London of distillation vessels for making acids in Britain from the 15th century which include fragments of ceramic cucurbits (vessels for heating reacting chemicals) which were used with alembics for distillation. By the 18th century cementation was rarely used and had been replaced by acid treatment. Into modern times the acid parting method continued to be used but other methods were discovered. In 1860's Australia the Miller process was developed, this removed silver by bubbling chlorine gas through the molten gold mixture.
