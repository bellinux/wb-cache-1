2500|$|The Isle of Man Examiner {{newspaper}} described Stanley Woods as an [...] "enthusiastic amateur" [...] {{and started}} the 1922 Junior TT with the number 40 entered by Cotton. After being delayed at the start to stop to recover dropped spark-plugs which had fallen-out of his pocket, Stanley Woods still managed to make good-time and lapped in 40minutes and 50 seconds despite clipping the kerb at Governor's Bridge on lap 1. At Sulby on lap 2, Stanley Woods slipped off the motor-cycle and continued but hit the same kerb again at Governor's Bridge which removed part of the exhaust. A fire in the pits at the TT Grandstand followed which was extinguished by pit-attendants and Stanley Woods using an overcoat. Further problems occurred at Braddan Bridge when Stanley Woods had to stop to re-place an exhaust valve after the inlet push-rod had broken. At Greeba Castle when he discovered the brakes had failed after the rear brake <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> had split {{a result of the}} pit-fire. Although, Stanley Woods continued the 1922 Junior TT Race with no brakes, he again fell-off at the Ramsey Hairpin on the last-lap, but finished the race in 5th place in a time of 3hours, 55minutes and 33 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Cam {{fasteners}} are {{a simple}} type of fastener that use a cam to push {{down on the}} webbing that is passed through the cam and prevent the webbing from slipping back through the fastener. The edge of the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> that faces the webbing is usually knurled to provide a firmer grip on the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> to lock the webbing in place.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{machine guns}} use gas-operated reloading. A recoil {{actuated}} machine gun uses recoil energy to first unlock and then operate the action. Machine guns {{such as the}} M2 Browning and MG42, are of this type. A <b>cam,</b> <b>lever</b> or actuator absorbs part of {{the energy of the}} recoil to operate the bolt.|$|E
5000|$|Electro{{mechanical}} - {{the motor}} uses purely mechanical means {{to open the}} door: gears, <b>cams,</b> <b>levers</b> and such. This is the preferred type in the US.|$|R
40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove hose coupling to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the coupling halves, is to ensure that the coupling halves are properly aligned before the <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> can be locked into position...|$|R
40|$|A sliding drawer type {{canister}} {{was designed}} to contain long duration exposure facility experiments which require vacuum storage before and after space exposure. The elastomeric seals require high closing loads which are generated through <b>camming</b> <b>levers</b> and transmitted through a spring loaded pressure plate. Lubrication was provided by various dry surface coatings. Higher than expected friction required some redesign after which the assembly functioned well and provided good sealing...|$|R
5000|$|A cam and groove {{coupling}}, {{also called}} a cam lock fitting or <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> coupling, [...] {{is a kind}} of quick connect coupling usually used in industries as a hose connection to avoid leakage. This kind of coupling is popular because it is a simple and reliable means of connecting and disconnecting.|$|E
5000|$|The gauge {{consists}} of a beam, a headstock, and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: a locking screw, <b>cam</b> <b>lever,</b> or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to {{one end of the}} beam.|$|E
50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or scuba tank to a buoyancy compensator or backplate. The name is derived from the cam action of the buckle to tighten and secure the strap. Also known as a cam band or tank strap. Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released cam locks the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|E
50|$|Hot cutting is {{performed}} {{by means of}} a thermal torch (plasma or oxyfuel) and is mounted to the last axis of a multi-axis machine. The axes of the multi-axis machine are powered by electric motors and are synchronized to create a path for the torch and pipe that yield a desired profile. The synchronization of axes is accomplished either mechanically, via <b>cams,</b> <b>levers</b> and gears, or electronically, via microprocessors and controllers.|$|R
50|$|The larger twelve {{horsepower}} six-cylinder {{engine was}} {{mounted in the}} chassis of the ten horsepower four-cylinder BSA Ten. Steering was by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever,</b> brakes were mechanical. Tyres specified were 5 inch on 18 inch wheels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently the {{application}} of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y made of the high-functional polymer is increasing internationally to improve the productivity and weight reduction. But {{the application}} of injection molding of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y in our country is not reported yet {{because of the lack}} of the optimal selection technique of proper material and the optimal design of injection parameter. In order to solve the problem, the injection molding simulation is used. The modification of gate position and rib thickness was done and the parameters like injection time, injection temperature, packing pressure and cooling time were changed. As a result, the comparison between models was done and the optimal shape of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y was developed...|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the cam systems used a Gibbs-style type 1 ascender placed in an inverted position attached to a soloer's sit harness opposite to the manufacturer's intended use. The combination of a climber's body position in a fall and friction between the ascender frame and the rope provides the activating leverage for the cam to grab the rope. Fall forces generated using this device and the cam profile can be enough to damage a rope due to the high clamp loads induced by the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> arm. The main drawback to this system {{is that it is}} like the prussik knot system where the soloer also has to feed out an estimate amount of rope in order to reach a stance point.|$|E
50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a lever operated cam assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the <b>cam</b> <b>lever,</b> thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|E

50|$|Steering {{which was}} by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever</b> now by worm and nut. The {{propellor}} shaft is now provided with needle-roller bearings. There is a stabilising front bumper. Four-wheel brakes are now mechanical by Girling. Maximum speed was reported as having {{moved up to}} 65 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Steering was by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever.</b> The four-wheel brakes were {{initially}} Lockheed hydraulic. The handbrake lever, {{designed for use}} as a parking brake, operated on the back wheels using cables. [...] "The lower gears can be used as an emergency brake". Tyres were 4.5 x 19 inches ...|$|R
50|$|Steering is by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever.</b> Rear {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical, {{and practically}} flat, springs mounted beneath the axle and on rubber pads. Front springs are splayed. Single-acting hydraulic shock absorbers {{are employed in}} front and back. Bumpers are supplied fore and aft {{and there is a}} folding luggage grid.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sides of}} the can were marked with cross-like {{indentations}} that strengthened the can while allowing the contents to expand, as did an air pocket under the handles when the can was filled correctly. This air pocket allowed the container to float if dropped in water. Rather than a screw cap, the containers used a <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> release mechanism with a short spout secured with a snap closure and an air-pipe to the air pocket which enabled smooth pouring (which was omitted in some copies). The interior was also lined with an impervious plastic, first developed for steel beer barrels {{that would allow the}} can to be used for either water or gasoline. The can was welded and had a gasket for a leak-proof mouth. The British used cans captured from the [...] "Jerries" [...] (Germans) — hence [...] "jerrycans" [...] — in preference to their own containers as much as possible. Later in 1940, Pleiss was in London and British officers asked him about the design and manufacture of the jerrycan. Pleiss ordered the second of his three jerrycans flown to London. After the second capture of Benghazi at the end of 1941, large numbers of Axis jerrycans were captured, sufficient to equip some units such as the Long Range Desert Group.|$|E
5000|$|Thru axle - a {{removable}} axle with a threaded end that is inserted {{through a hole}} in one fork leg, through the hub, and then screwed into the other fork leg. Some axles have integrated <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> that compress axle elements against the fork leg to lock it in place, while others rely on pinch bolts on the fork leg to secure it. Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm, 15 mm (most common), and 9 mm. Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm. Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes, although some cyclocross and road bikes are using them. Thru axles repeatable locate the wheel in the fork or frame, which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes. Unlike other axle systems (except Lefty), the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame, not the hub. Hubs/wheels do not include axles, and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame.|$|R
50|$|The frame has {{the popular}} {{cruciform}} or X channelled sectioned cross membering.The unit of engine, fluid flywheel and self changing gearbox is held at four points on rubber, the two points in front being close together {{and on the}} cross member. Half elliptical springs wide-set to prevent roll are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever.</b> The four-wheel brakes are worked by rods.|$|R
25|$|The casting section {{receives}} completed {{lines from}} the assembler, and uses these to cast the type slugs that {{are the product of}} the linotype machine. The casting section is automatic: once it is activated by the operator sending a completed line by raising the casting lever, a series of <b>cams</b> and <b>levers</b> move the matrices through the casting section and control the sequence of steps that produce the slug.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by a <b>cam</b> and <b>lever</b> {{system which}} {{provided}} a dual ratio to ease parking. Suspension was all elliptic (overslung in front, underslung at the rear) with rigid beam axles all controlled by Luvax-Girling double acting hydraulic shock absorbers—a transverse torsion bar linking both pairs. Brakes by Girling were mechanical using a wedge and roller system in 11 inch drums with twin leading {{shoes in the}} front drums.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by <b>cam</b> and <b>lever</b> {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} car's frame. From 1932 the brake vacuum servo motor was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
25|$|The CPW weighs only 1.5kg empty/dry (2kg with a {{fully loaded}} 30-round 9mm magazine) {{and uses a}} unique bolt <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> recoil {{mitigation}} system to control recoil and muzzle rise to increase target hits. Full-auto cyclic rate of fire is a relatively high 900 to 1100rpm.|$|R
50|$|Harvey's inner {{functions}} went though {{three main}} stages of development. The prototype used telephone relays and a four track tape to create heart movement and sounds, respectively. The first commercial model used {{a series of}} <b>cams</b> and <b>levers</b> instead of telephone relays, but kept the 4-track tape recordings for sound. When the manufacturer of the tape recorder (Ampro Corp) went out of business, a sound card was integrated to mimic heart sounds. The third and current version of this simulator uses a servo motor and a sound card to mimic the cardiovascular functions of the human body.|$|R
50|$|The plug has a straight-shaped slot {{known as}} the keyway at one end to allow the key to enter the plug; the other end may have a <b>cam</b> or <b>lever,</b> which {{activates}} a mechanism to retract a locking bolt. The keyway often has protruding ledges that serve to prevent the key pins from falling into the plug, {{and to make the}} lock more resistant to picking. A series of holes, typically five or six of them, are drilled vertically into the plug. These holes contain key pins of various lengths, which are rounded to permit the key to slide over them easily.|$|R
50|$|Ascender - These {{are used}} to ascend ropes. Devices that used <b>lever</b> <b>cams</b> were once used, though these have now been {{overtaken}} in popularity by toothed cam devices which slip less. A minimum of two ascenders are used, one attached to the harness at waist level, and another attached to a footloop and moved by hand. A third ascender may be attached to {{a foot and a}} ropewalking technique used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new beating machine {{based on a}} dual <b>cam</b> and <b>lever</b> {{mechanism}} to operate flapping and torsion motions of a dragonfly wing. The beating machine was designed according to the time dependent variation in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a free flight dragonfly. Our experiment {{results show that the}} variations in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a wing on beating machine agree well with those of a real free flight dragonfly wing, confirming that our beating machine is available for studying the beating performance. We then use the beating machine to study the aerodynamic force and inertia affecting on the wing by comparing the flapping angle and torsion angle under the normal and vacuum conditions...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a <b>cam</b> or <b>lever</b> to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} example today of a zashiki karakuri {{mechanism}} is a tea-serving robot, which starts moving forward when {{a cup of}} tea is placed on the plate in its hands. It was used in a situation when a host wanted to treat a guest in a recreational way. It moves in a straight line for a set distance, moving its feet as if walking, and then bows its head. This signals that the tea is for drinking, and the doll stops when the cup is removed. When it is replaced, the robot raises its head, turns around and returns to where it came from. It is typically powered by a wound spring made of whalebone, and the actions are controlled by a set of <b>cams</b> and <b>levers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{this type}} of mechanism, a shaft {{is driven by the}} clock so it rotates once a year, at {{constant}} speed. The shaft carries a cam, which is approximately [...] "kidney shaped" [...] such that its radius is essentially a graph of the annual variation of the equation of time. A follower and lever rest against the cam, so that as the <b>cam</b> rotates the <b>lever</b> moves in a way that represents the changing equation of time. This lever drives other components in the clock.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting at this {{juncture}} to define what conventional machines are. According to Adeyeri et al. (2012), conventional machines are “machines which are operated manually. These machines are controlled by <b>cams,</b> gears, <b>levers,</b> or screws. Examples of these machines are Lathe, grinding machine, flaking machine, extruding machine and just to mention a few. They indeed needed special attention to safe guard or vouch safe for their functionality and optimal performance {{as compared to the}} non-conventional machines which are controlled automatically by integrated computer”. In view of this, there should be a platform that bridges the gap between the rich manufacturing industries and the less privileged in the maintenance world or a platform that provides a face lift for the customary approach for maintenance practices. The customary maintenance technique is breakdown maintenance (which is also called unplanned maintenance, or run-to-failure maintenance), takes place only at breakdowns. Therefore this article gives an attempted concept of using an embedded approach in embedding sensors (agent hardware) for monitoring machinery conditions from the perspective view of vibration and temperature effects on machines performance.|$|R
5000|$|A {{consequence}} of the windproofing {{is that it is}} hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut the fuel. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable [...] "clink" [...] sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable [...] "clunk" [...] when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling <b>cam,</b> a little <b>lever</b> that keeps the lid closed or opened securely.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of recoil buffer is {{made from}} a resilient and deformable material (leather, rubber, polymer e.g. a rubber butt pad on a shotgun). A second way of producing a recoil buffer is to insert a spring into the recoil train—the path/part(s) generating recoil impulse. This spring is mounted to the point(s) where the firearm contacts a mechanical holder such as a tripod or human upper torso. Reducing the initial jolt, the rate and/or extent of rearward displacement, and any internal impacts in the operating parts of a firearm can reduce the shooter's perception of recoil, and may also work to {{extend the life of}} the mechanism and its parts. More sophisticated designs use hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorbers; systems of springs, <b>cams</b> and <b>levers</b> to modify, dampen, or dissipate the rearward impulse generated as the projectile is fired down the bore of the firearm. Aftermarket buffers are often moulded bumpers or additional springs placed between operating metal parts which impact one another, such as the slide and the frame of a semi-automatic pistol. This type of buffer cushions the battering force of repeated metal on metal impact, reducing wear on parts and lengthening the service life of the firearm. Reduction of perceived recoil discomfort is an immediate added benefit of this type recoil buffer.|$|R
