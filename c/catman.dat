5|$|In 2006, Gail Simone {{brought back}} the Secret Six as a team of villains with new members, in which many are LGBT, {{including}} lesbian Scandal Savage, her lover Knockout, pansexual Rag Doll, bisexual Jeannette, and <b>Catman,</b> who is also bisexual. Secret Six relaunched in December 2014, with Gail Simone returning as the writer. Scandal Savage, Rag Doll, and Jeannette return as recurring characters. The team consists of new members save <b>Catman,</b> and among them, Porcelain is genderfluid.|$|E
25|$|The Secret Six: Following {{their initial}} appearance, {{members of the}} Secret Six have {{appeared}} repeatedly in Birds of Prey. The team composed of <b>Catman,</b> Deadshot, Ragdoll, Scandal Savage, Knockout, and Harley Quinn act as foils to the Birds on one shared mission. <b>Catman</b> and Huntress are potential romantic interests, Scandal finds an enemy in Hawkgirl, and Barda and Knockout have a longstanding rivalry.|$|E
25|$|With their make-up and costumes, {{they took}} on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and The <b>Catman</b> (Criss). Due to {{creative}} differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Catmen</b> are {{the primary}} antagonists in The Spell Sword and feature {{in a number of}} the short stories. In The Spell Sword, Bradley {{describes}} them as carrying short, curved swords, capable of coordinating attacks against the humans, and able to use laran and starstones. The <b>Catmen</b> also featured prominently in several of the short stories, including David Heydt's I'm a Big Cat Now from Towers of Darkover; Linda Frankel and Paula Crunk's Blood Hunt from The Other Side of the Mirror; and Judith Sampson's To Serve Kihar from Domains of Darkover.|$|R
50|$|Although it is {{not part}} of her Darkover book series, Darkover is {{mentioned}} (as another planet) in passing in the book; numerous Darkover elements appear in the book, such as a red sun, Dry Towns with chained women, <b>catmen</b> and other nonhumans, Terran Empire trade cities, Ghost Wind.|$|R
500|$|Movement {{through the}} catacombs is {{controlled}} by command inputs and keywords, which is referred to in-game as MIDAS. For example, entering in the word [...] "hit" [...] will bring down a menu which will display various forms of attacking techniques. The {{left side of the}} screen displays an animated first person perspective of the respective tunnel or room the player is in, whereas {{the right side of the}} interface displays a general top-down view of the catacombs. The bottom of the screen features a command box and announces available options or hints to the player; flashing arrows indicate where movement is possible throughout the catacombs. During the game, enemies such as gargoyles, <b>catmen</b> and warriors will appear at random and attack the player if confronted. Magic spells such as poison and fire are able to defeat enemies, alongside weaponry such as swords and axes. The player-character has both a health and magic bar, which will slowly deplete once attacked by an enemy or by using magic spells, respectively. Items in the game include treasure and artefacts which may have a chance of giving the player negative effects, such as draining life and paralysing movement.|$|R
25|$|In 1983, Kiss began {{performing}} without {{makeup and}} costumes, {{thinking that it}} was time to leave the makeup behind. The band accordingly experienced a minor commercial resurgence, and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Drummer Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of a rare type of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was commercially successful. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band have continued with their original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original <b>Catman</b> and Space Ace makeup, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Howard Morris as Waldo, a [...] "fraidy cat" [...] {{who enjoys}} imagining and dreaming {{that he is}} a superhero; he {{pictures}} himself in a variety of personas, including Robin Cat, <b>Catman,</b> and Catzan.|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy has {{expressed}} his disdain for [...] "anonymous cowards on the internet", those who operate [...] "under the shadowy cover of names like <b>Catman,</b> Yer Da Takes It Up the Macy Gray or Twenty Rothmans or whatever", and believes Wikipedia is [...] "a fact-free bull run for any passing eejit {{to come along}} and add whatever fact or fiction they desire and up it goes onto the site". He prefers books and pornography instead.|$|E
5000|$|Lester del Rey {{declared}} that [...] "Weinbaum, {{more than any}} other writer, helped to take our field out of the doldrums of the early thirties and into the beginnings of modern science fiction." [...] H. P. Lovecraft stated that Weinbaum's writing was ingenious, and he stood miles above the other Pulp Fiction writers in his creation of genuinely alien worlds in a comparison to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his [...] "inane" [...] stories of [...] "egg-laying Princesses". Frederik Pohl wrote that, before Weinbaum, science fiction's aliens [...] "might be <b>catmen,</b> lizard-men, antmen, plantmen or rockmen; but they were, always and incurably, men. Weinbaum changed that[...] [...] [...] it was the difference in orientation -- in drives, goals and thought processes -- that made the Weinbaum-type alien so fresh and rewarding in science fiction in the mid-thirties". [...] Everett F. Bleiler, however, reported that although Weinbaum [...] "was generally considered the most promising new s-f author of his day," [...] his reputation is overstated. While [...] "Weinbaum's style was more lively than that of his genre contemporaries, and he was imaginative in background details, [...] [...] [...] his work was ordinary pulp fiction, with routine plots, slapdash presentation, cardboard characterization, and much cliche of ideas. Alexei and Cory Panshin concluded that [...] "Time has swallowed what were once Weinbaum's particular virtues. What is left seems quaint and quirky." ...|$|R
2500|$|Then V for Vendetta emerged, {{putting the}} {{emphasis}} on [...] "V" [...] rather than [...] "Vendetta". David Lloyd developed the idea of dressing V as Guy Fawkes after previous designs followed the conventional superhero look. During {{the preparation of the}} story, Moore made a list of what he wanted to bring into the plot, which he reproduced in [...] "Behind the Painted Smile":Orwell. Huxley. Thomas Disch. Judge Dredd. Harlan Ellison's [...] "Repent, Harlequin!" [...] Said the Ticktockman, <b>Catman</b> and The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World by the same author. Vincent Price's Dr. Phibes and Theatre of Blood. David Bowie. The Shadow. Night Raven. Batman. Fahrenheit 451. The writings of the New Worlds school of science fiction. Max Ernst's painting [...] "Europe After the Rain". Thomas Pynchon. The atmosphere of British Second World War films. The Prisoner. Robin Hood. Dick Turpin... The influence of such a wide number of references has been thoroughly demonstrated in academic studies, above which dystopian elements stand out, especially the similarity with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four in several stages of the plot.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the rest}} of the 1980s and early 1990s, Criss was {{involved}} with a number of bands, each usually lasting less than a year. One of them was The Keep, which featured ex-Kiss guitarist Mark St. John. Criss also played with Balls of Fire from the spring of 1986 to December 1986, with Jane Booke on lead vocals, Bob Raylove on bass and JP (John Pakalenka) on guitar, who currently plays for Buckner Funken Jazz in Denver, Colorado. [...] Balls of Fire played only 7 shows before Criss left the band to enjoy his daughter Jenilee growing up. Another was the Criss Penridge Alliance, essentially Peter Criss and Stan Penridge with the 1970s jazz rock fusion band Montage (Mike Hutchens - guitar, Allen Woody - bass (Govt Mule, Allman Brothers Band), John Moss - drums and Tony Crow - keyboards) who rehearsed 39 songs including from the first 3 Peter Criss solo albums, and played around 10 shows in total. While Kiss was promoting their upcoming release Crazy Nights, Criss appeared on the syndicated radio program Metal Shop and discussed his time in Kiss from a more positive perspective than before; he also promoted the book he was writing at the time, an autobiography to be titled A Face without a Kiss. He also mentioned his dream of one day opening up his own recording studio and starting his own record label, to be called <b>Catman</b> Records. [...] Criss briefly reunited with former Kiss bandmate Ace Frehley on Frehley's 1989 album Trouble Walkin' (singing and playing percussion on one track). In the early '90s, Criss assembled a band named [...] "Criss", which would feature future Queensr√øche guitarist Mike Stone. This band released the Criss EP in December 1993 and the Cat #1 album in August 1994. The group also supported Frehley's band on the 1995 [...] "Bad Boys Of KISS Tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since September 2008, Bane has {{appeared}} as a regular character in the ongoing Secret Six series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a stoic devil's advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and <b>Catman</b> {{on the subject of}} love. He is later shown to have an almost father like concern for Scandal Savage's well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc's final issue displays the depth of Bane's affection. [...] When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane's concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team's several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. [...] Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that [...] "God help him." [...] Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. In the latest issue of Secret Six, Bane's Secret Six and Scandal Savage's Secret Six finally square off against each other. Bane and Scandal engage in a one on one fight where he refuses to fight back until Scandal uses her Lamentation Blades to slash his throat. The card is ultimately used to resurrect Knockout.|$|E
