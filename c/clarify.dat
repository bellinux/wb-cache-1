40|$|Recently, {{adoption}} of the <b>Clarified</b> International Standard of Auditing (<b>Clarified</b> ISAs) and International Standard of Quality Control (ISQC) have gain steady attention from various accounting practitioners and academicians. This Clarity project began in 2004 and was completed in February 2009.

The study seeks to survey the internal resource preparedness of the Small and Medium Practice (SMP) for adoption of <b>Clarified</b> ISAs and ISQC by applying resource-based view theory. Further, impact of <b>Clarified</b> ISAs and ISQC on timeliness on audit report had been investigated. Standard multiple regression was used to analyse data from 115 respondents from Small and Medium Practice (SMP) in Malaysia.

Besides, the adoption of <b>Clarified</b> ISAs and ISQC also affects the timeliness of audit report. Nevertheless, there are no significant association found between financial resource preparedness, human resource preparedness and the adoption of <b>clarified</b> ISAs and ISQC.

Raw apple juice was prepared by pressing of apple mash. After thermal treatment of raw apple juice, depectinisation, additional clarification and filtration, the <b>clarified</b> juice was obtained. In raw and <b>clarified</b> apple juice soluble solids, acidity, reducing sugar, total sugars and brown component content were determined, as well as total dry matter, ash, acidity, reducing sugar, total sugars, total pectins, cellulose and starch content in apple mash and pomace. The total cotent of phenolics in <b>clarified</b> apple juice and apple pomace extract, determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin- Ciocalteu reagent, was 0. 496 mg/ml and 6. 505 mg/g, respectively. The antioxidant activity of <b>clarified</b> and polyphenol-enriched <b>clarified</b> juice (with addition of apple pomace extract in the concentrations 0. 05 g, 0. 1 g, 0. 5 g and 1 g of phenolic compounds per liter of <b>clarified</b> apple juice) was examined on stable 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of reducing light scattering in isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), through {{the addition of}} so-called <b>clarifying</b> agents, is studied with small-angle light scattering (SALS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The <b>clarifying</b> agents {{used in this study}} depict monotectic phase behavior with i-PP, crystallizing in a relatively narrow concentration range in a nanofibrillar network, providing an ultrahigh nucleation density in the i-PP melt. It is found that the <b>clarifying</b> effect, a dramatically increased transparency and reduced haze, that occurs within the aforementioned additive concentration range, coincides with a change in morphology from strongly scattering spherulites to shish-kebab-like crystalline structures, as evidenced by in situ SALS measurements and confirmed by SEM images. A simple scaling law, relating the diameter of the shish-kebab structures to the fibril diameter and volume fraction of the <b>clarifying</b> agent is proposed, suggesting that the performance of a (fibril-forming) <b>clarifying</b> agent will improve by reducing the fibril diameter and/or increasing the volume concentration of the <b>clarifying</b> agent...|$|R
