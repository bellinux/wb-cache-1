40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> of antifungals is of crucial importance {{in view of the}} side-effects of conventional oral and intravenous treatments of Sporotrichosis. In this study, systems composed of polyoxypropylene (5) polyoxyethylene (20) cetyl alcohol (PPG- 5 -CETETH- 20) as a surfactant, oleic acid as an oil phase, and water were developed as a possible fluconazole transdermal drug delivery system. The systems were characterised by polarised light microscopy (PLM), SAXS, and rheological analysis, followed by cellular and histological analyses, in vitro release assays, and ex vivo skin permeation and retention studies using porcine ear tissue and a Franz diffusion cell. PLM and SAXS results indicated that the mixtures of surfactant, oil and water formed micellar and lamellar phases. The incorporation of fluconazole in these systems was greater than in water and conventional dosage forms. Micellar systems behave as Newtonian fluids, being more viscous than elastic in rheological analysis, and lamellar phases behave as pseudoplastic fluids with high elastic moduli. In vitro and in vivo biological assays showed that the formulations did not affect normal cell macrophages and did not promote skin irritation. The release profile indicated that fluconazole could be released in a controlled manner. It was found that the systems enhanced drug permeation and skin retention by changing only the composition of the components in the formulations. Therefore, PPG- 5 -CETETH- 20 - based systems have great potential as transdermal systems with different structural and rheological characteristics for Sporotrichosis treatment using antifungal drugs...|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} years, <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> as {{biocompatible}} and injectable biodegradable polymeric particles, including poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), has been employed {{to avoid the}} invasive approach of surgical intervention and implants. The crystallinity of the PLGA polymer {{is directly related to}} its swelling behavior, mechanical strength, subsequently its biodegradation rate, its hydrolysis capability which further depends on the molecular weight, and the molar ratio of the lactic and glycolic in the polymer chain (Wu 1995; Gilding and Reed 1979; Lewis 1990). PLGA is approved as a material to design DDS for parental approach by the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drugs Administration. PLGA is used worldwide for the preparation of intravenous (DDS) and biomimetic materials, and it has extensive applications prospects in tissue engineering, medical imaging, drugs delivery, and disease diagnosis (Kocbek et al. 2007). It possesses attractive properties as drug delivery carrier, including biocompatibility and biodegradability, it protects drugs from degradation, the particles can target some specific cells, its system adapts to various types of drugs, hydrophilic or hydrophobic macromolecules, or small molecules, it has sustained release possibility, and possesses flexible surface properties that can be tuned as per the concerned application. Zhang et al. (2013) have reported the surface modification of PLGA to enhance a better efficacy of the drug, increasing the drug availability at specific areas with delivery in a sustained manner. The surface modification can be achieved by depositing few atomic layer thick biocompatible polymers coating, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), to tune the hydrophilicity, stability, and the aggregation ability of the PLGA-based nanocarriers. In addition, the drug delivery vehicle can be decorated with different functional groups which can be used to bind with the drug molecules or specific ligand molecules to enhance the drug specificity.|$|E

Systematic changes in key parameters from this model signify alterations in the microscopic or short-range structure as the glass physically ages. Predictions from this model correlate quite closely with the observed water permeability reductions and thus indicate that the transport properties of glassy polymers are dependent on the structure of the glass.

Polymeric delivery systems are mainly intended to achieve controlled or sustained drug delivery. Polysaccharides fabricated into hydrophilic matrices remain popular biomaterials for <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and the most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer is cellulose; so hdroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose can be used for production of time controlled delivery systems. Additionally microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose as well as hydroxypropyl cellulose are used to coat tablets. Cellulose acetate phthalate and hydroxymethyl cellulose phthalate are also used for enteric coating of tablets. Targeting of drugs to the colon following oral administration has also been accomplished by using polysaccharides such as hdroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose in hydrated form; also they act as binders that swell when hydrated by gastric media and delay absorption.

Carvedilol IR data (1270 measurements) were obtained from 2 open-label studies (50 mg/ 25 mg Q 12 hours for 2 doses). Carvedilol CR data (2058 measurements) were obtained from an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-rising (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg), 4 -period balanced crossover study. All data were simultaneously analyzed using NONMEM V. Leverage analysis and internal evaluations were conducted for the final model. A 2 -compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination provided the best fit. The model included different absorption rates (KAs) for the CR and IR morning (IRAM) and evening (IRPM) doses; incorporating change-points at certain times. Estimates of KAs indicated that the absorption was slower at equivalent times and extended for CR relative to IR carvedilol. Oral clearance ofS(−) -carvedilol was 149 L/h. The IRPM and the CR doses had bioavailability (Frel) of 0. 80 and 0. 76, respectively, relative to the IRAM dose.

In this study, injectable biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric particles were employed for <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and the encapsulation of antibodies into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) based microspheres was explored. In order to avoid stability issues which are commonly described when water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion is used, a solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) method was developed and optimized. The solid phase was made of IgG microparticles and the s/o/w process was evaluated as an encapsulation method using a model Ab molecule (polyclonal bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG)). The methylene chloride (MC) commonly used for an encapsulation process was replaced by ethyl acetate (EtAc), which was considered as a more suitable organic solvent in terms of both environmental and human safety. The effects of several processes and formulation factors were evaluated on IgG:PLGA microsphere properties such as: particle size distribution, drug loading, IgG stability, and encapsulation efficiency (EE%). Several formulations and processing parameters were also statistically identified as critical to get reproducible process (e. g. the PLGA concentration, the volume of the external phase, the emulsification rate, and the quantity of IgG microparticles). The optimized encapsulation method has shown a drug loading of up to 6 % (w/w) and an encapsulation efficiency of up to 60 % (w/w) while preserving the integrity of the encapsulated antibody.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the texture of hydrated biopolymer matrices that are now being considered in the design of pharmaceutical <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms,</b> in order to determine their influence on the release of an active compound. Prolonged release of pentoxifylline, a highly soluble drug, is needed for once-daily administration to achieve its therapeutic effect. Forthis purpose, pentoxifylline was incorporated in a polymer matrix made of acombination of xanthan and locust bean gum (XLBG), both of which are of biotechnological origin. Different methods were used {{to investigate}} the interplay of the XLBG gel structure characteristics in the absence and presence of 200 mM CaCl 2 on pentoxifylline release: drug-release studies, determination of swelling, erosion, and visco-elasticity of the gel, as well as its texture analysis and microscopic imaging. From the results obtained, the following conclusions can be drawn: the pentoxifylline release from XLBG matrices in water was prolonged for 24 h whereas from the control lactose formulation was completed within 30 min. The presence of Ca 2 + ions in water resulted in faster pentoxifylline release, in spite of less swelling and erosion. However, the rheology, texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy revealed that {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 + ions the gel layer of theXLBG was more cohesive and thinner, as the attraction for water molecules was lower due to the condensation of counter-ions on the xanthan carboxylic-moieties, and consequently greater interpolymer interactions. Therefore, relatively larger amounts of free water molecules were available within the XLBG hydrogel in the presence of Ca 2 +, allowing faster drug dissolution and diffusion. Here, the presence of Ca 2 + ions had a completely opposite effect on XLBG gel structure and drug release in comparison with other more investigated matrix polymers like alginate or non-ionic cellulose ethers.

40|$|The {{release of}} drug {{substance}} from <b>controlled-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> is often pH-dependent since most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. A system that permits the drug release {{to be changed}} freely while maintaining pH-independent drug release (model drug was Domperidone) was developed. Powder mixture of drug and HPMC K 4 M, eudragit L 100, sodium bicarbonate (as gas-generating agent) and other excipients were mixed and directly compressed using single-punch tablet compression machine. It was found that sodium bicarbonate reacts with HCl and produce carbon dioxide which creates pores in tablet and elevates swelling by wetting the polymer. So it helps in maintaining the buoyancy. The release rate could be modified by varying the polymer ratio. The prepared tablets were evaluated for general appearance, content uniformity, hardness, friability, buoyancy, in vitro drug release and in vivo studies. The best formulation (D 1) was selected based on in vitro characteristics and was used in vivo radiographic studies by incorporating BaSO 4. These studies revealed that the tablets remained in the stomach for 250 &#x 00 B 1; 30 min in fasted rabbits and indicated that gastric retention time was increased by the floating principle, which was considered desirable for the absorption window drugs. The linear regression analysis and model fitting showed that all these formulations followed Higuchi model, which had a higher value of correlation coefficient (r). The scanning electron microscopy images of the tablet (D 1 formulation) were taken before and after dissolution and images showed that the drug was released from matrix by diffusion mechanism. Stability studies of all formulations were carried out at elevated temperature and humidity conditions of 40 &# 177; 2 o C/ 75 &# 177; 5 &#x 0025; RH and a control sample was placed at an ambient condition for 12 months.

40|$|AbstractWater-insoluble {{materials}} containing {{amorphous solid}} dispersions (ASD) are an emerging category of drug carriers which can effectively improve dissolution kinetics and kinetic solubility of poorly soluble drugs.

For example, solid molecular dispersions of poorly soluble drugs in poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) can maintain {{a high level of}} supersaturation over a prolonged period of time via a feedback-controlled diffusion mechanism thus avoiding the initial surge of supersaturation followed by a sharp decline in drug concentration typically encountered with ASDs based on water-soluble polymers.

As PEO is sensitive to thermal oxidation, it is susceptible to free radical oxidative attack. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the stability of PEO based formulations containing different model drugs with different water solubility, namely propranolol HCl, theophylline and zonisamide. Both polyox matrices 750 and 303 grade were used as model carriers for the manufacture of tablets stored at 40 °C. The results of the present study suggest that the drug release from the matrix was affected by the length of storage conditions, solubility of drugs and the molecular weight of the polymers. Generally, increased drug release rates were prevalent in soluble drug formulations (propranolol) when stored at the elevated temperature (40 °C). In contrast, it was not observed with semi soluble (theophylline) and poorly soluble (zonisamide) drugs especially when formulated with PEO 303 polymer. This indicates that the main parameters controlling the drug release from fresh polyox matrices are the solubility of the drug in the dissolution medium and the molecular weight of the polymer. DSC traces indicated that that there was a big difference in the enthalpy and melting points of fresh and aged PEO samples containing propranolol, whereas the melting point of the aged polyox samples containing theophylline and zonisamide was unaffected...|$|R
40|$|In the {{treatment}} of chronic malignant and non-malignant pain, opioids are used as strong analgesics. Frail elderly patients often have multiple comorbidities and use multiple medicines, leading to {{an increased risk of}} clinically relevant drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Age-related changes and increased frailty may lead to a less predictable drug response, increased drug sensitivity, and potential harmful drug effects. As a result, physicians face a complex task in prescribing medication to elderly patients. In this review, the appropriateness of the strong-acting opioids buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and tapentadol is determined for use in elderly patients. Evidence-based recommendations for prescribing strong opioids to the frail elderly are presented. A literature search was performed for all individual drugs, using a validated and published set of 23 criteria concerning effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, experience, and convenience in elderly patients. First, information on the criteria was obtained from pharmaceutical reference books and a MEDLINE search. The information obtained on the individual drugs in the class of opioids was compared with the reference drug morphine. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated {{on the basis of the}} pros and cons for the frail elderly. Using the set of 23 criteria, no differentiation can be made between the appropriateness of buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and oxycodone for use in elderly patients. Methadone has strong negative considerations in {{the treatment}} of chronic pain in the frail elderly. Methadone has a high drug-drug interaction potential and is associated with prolongation of the QT interval and a potential risk of accumulation due to a long elimination half-life. In addition, methadone is difficult to titrate because of its large inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics, particularly in the frail elderly. Because of a lack of empiric knowledge, the use of tapentadol is not recommended in frail elderly persons. Nevertheless, tapentadol may prove to be a useful analgesic for {{the treatment of}} chronic pain in frail elderly persons because of its possible better gastrointestinal tolerability. In the treatment of chronic pain in the frail elderly, the opioids of first choice are buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and oxycodone.

These include {{many kinds of}} liquid, solid, and semisolid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Common <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> include pill, tablet, or capsule, drink or syrup, and natural or herbal form such as plant or food of sorts, among many others. Notably, the route of administration (ROA) for drug delivery {{is dependent on the}} <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> of the substance in question. A liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> is the liquid form of a dose of a chemical compound used as a drug or medication intended for administration or consumption.|$|R
50|$|Extended-release dosage {{consists}} of sustained-release (SR) and <b>controlled-release</b> (CR) <b>dosage.</b> SR maintains drug release over a sustained period {{but not at}} a constant rate. CR maintains drug release over a sustained period at a nearly constant rate.|$|R

50|$|Absolute bioavailablity {{refers to}} the {{bioavailability}} of drug when administered via a non-intravenous (non-IV) <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> (i.e. oral tablet, suppository, subcutaneous, etc.) compared with the bioavailability of the same drug administered intravenously (IV). This is done by comparing the AUC of the non-intravenous <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> with the AUC for the drug administered intravenously. This fraction is normalized by multiplying by each <b>dosage</b> <b>form's</b> respective dose.|$|R
50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} {{drug delivery}} of solid oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> film coatings are frequently applied. The motivation for coating <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> range from cosmetic considerations (colour, gloss), improving the stability (light protection, moisture and gas barrier) {{and making it}} easier to swallow the tablet. In addition, functional coatings can be used to modify the drug release behaviour from the <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> Depending on the polymers used it is possible either delay the release of the drug (such as in enteric coatings) or use the coating to sustain the release of the drug from the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> over extended periods of time.|$|R
40|$|Current {{definitions}} of lotions, gels, creams and ointments {{vary depending on}} literature source, market history or traditional use. This often leads to confusion when deciding which <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> to prescribe and/or purchase. The existing classification of topical <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> needs to be re-examined to ensure that definitions for different <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are based on consistent scientific principles and that <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> can be distinguished from one another. The {{purpose of this study}} is to obtain a scientifically based, systematic classification of <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> for topical drugs. A variety of prescription and over-the-counter topical products currently marketed as lotions, gels, creams, and ointments are evaluated using different techniques including rheology (viscosity and shear rate versus shear stress), loss on drying (LOD), specific gravity, surface tension, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), water absorption, dilution properties, microscopic evaluation, transmittance of visible light, appearance and composition. Rheology is the most discriminating property separating creams and lotions. Water plus volatiles (as measured by LOD) and composition separate ointments and creams. Composition and thermal behavior separate gels from the other <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Based on these findings, new definitions and a decision tree are presented to assist in the determination of the appropriate nomenclature for a topical <b>dosage</b> <b>form...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper briefly {{illustrates}} several approaches {{applied in}} delivering particulate drugs as powders. Microparticulate drug powders {{are difficult to}} manipulate with respect to <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> preparation, particularly when they have very small size as this leads to poor flow and packing properties. When the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> performance resides {{on the presence of}} individual intact drug particles, the particle characteristics have to be retained in their original state, i. e., not altered during manufacturing and/or within the <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> There are several examples of dry powder <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> intended for different administration routes whose performance is strictly dependent on particle characteristics. In addition, the preparation of the finished <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> is dependent on powder properties. The paper addresses dry powder formulations with special focus on oral powders mainly for elderly people or children, nasal powders and inhalation dry powders. These <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are very attractive for both researchers and companies. Their formulation requires deep investigation, mainly in order to define particle structure and performance. Indeed, this makes for a new breakthrough in pharmaceutics and may lead to innovative products...|$|R
