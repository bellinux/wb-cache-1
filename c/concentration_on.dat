40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective study {{was to assess the}} relationship of LH and oestradiol on day 7 of the cycle in patients stimulated with recombinant FSH (rec-FSH) for IVF before initiation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. One hundred and forty-six women treated for IVF using GnRH antagonists for premature LH rise suppression were stimulated with 150 IU of rec-FSH from day 2 to day 6 of the cycle. On cycle day 7, LH concentrations (median 1. 8, range 0. 1 - 7. 51) were positively associated with oestradiol <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> the same day by multiple regression analysis controlling for patient's age, concentrations of FSH and LH on cycle day 2, FSH <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> cycle day 7 and follicular index on cycle day 7. In conclusion, the higher the endogenous unsuppressed LH <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> day 7 of the cycle after 5 days of stimulation with rec-FSH for IVF, the higher the serum oestradiol <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> the same day.

5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Gauld's {{ability on}} the ball, and his small and slight stature, {{led him to}} be {{compared}} to Lionel Messi, a comparison made by the British press since 2013. At Dundee United, he was tutored by Ian Cathro, who favoured creativity and passing over the physicality often expected in Scottish football. After his transfer to Sporting, BBC Sport columnist Richard Wilson predicted that Gauld would be better suited to the style of football in Portugal, due to its slower tempo and its <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> a passing game. Gauld himself has spoken of his preference for Portuguese football over its Scottish equivalent, and expressed relief at the lower media interest in him at Sporting, opining that comparisons with Messi were exaggerated and premature.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} in the New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies and the historical records of the early colonizers. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak {{when compared to the}} statistically led investigations in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The red-throated loon breeds {{primarily}} in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> {{the eastern part of}} the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size outweigh the limitations.|$|E

5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} {{himself as}} close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point.

5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was originally}} planned as a three-act opéra comique for the Opéra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped {{work on the}} opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form {{to meet the requirements}} of the Paris Opéra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics – including the spending of Bertram's money – continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in opéra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1946, Renault {{abandoned}} the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles, and the company lost the position of France's market leader which it had before World War II. However, the rapid development and production <b>concentration</b> <b>on</b> that sector made Renault to seek ways {{to enter into the}} market. In 1950, the Renault's technical chief, Fernand Picard, elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine, taking advantage of the economies of scale, which proved unsuccessful. In 1953, the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers, starting with Somua and Latil. The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider (owner of Somua) and the Blum family (owner of Latil) had stakes in the new company. Initially, the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but, from 1957 onwards, Saviem-LRS appeared as marque's name on the company's products (the acronym representing the former marques Latil, Renault and Somua), which was simplified to Saviem in 1960. In 1959, Saviem became a whole-owned subsidiary of Renault. The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault's existing models (Goélette and Galion), new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach/bus production. With an aggressive market approach focussed in volume rather than quality, Saviem became the leader by sales in France.|$|E

40|$|Normal cows have 2 {{peaks in}} endometrial {{epidermal}} growth factor (EGF) <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Days 2 - 4 and 13 - 14, {{and the absence of}} peaks has been linked to reduced fertility in repeat breeder (RB) cows. However, the timing of the peaks (i. e., day of examinations) was estimated for a few cows per cycle day. Therefore, the present study characterized EGF peaks and examined if the absence of peaks in RB cows indicate either peak loss or changed timing. In Study 1, 20 Holstein cows were examined for EGF concentrations between Days 1 and 6 using repeated biopsy of the uterine endometrial tissues. Sixteen cows exhibited increased EGF concentrations for 2 - 3 days between Days 2 and 5. All 16 cows exhibited increased EGF <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Day 3. In Study 2, 10 cows were examined for EGF concentrations between Days 11 and 16. Increased EGF concentrations for 2 - 3 days were found in 7 cows between Days 12 and 15. All 7 cows exhibited increased EGF <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Days 13 and 14. In Study 3, 12 RB cows were examined for endometrial EGF concentrations between Days 1 and 6. Four cows exhibited an increase of EGF <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Days 3 and 4, whereas 8 cows (66. 7 %) exhibited low EGF concentrations throughout the study period. In conclusion, Days 3 and 13 - 14 are suitable days to examine a cyclic change of endometrial EGF concentrations. Further, low EGF <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Day 3 in RB cows indicated an absence, but not altered timing, of the EGF peak...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of brushing prior to scalding on reducing the E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> carcasses. Three visits were arranged to a commercial slaughterhouse in which carcasses were cleaned in a separate line. Ten batches were sampled to compare the E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> carcasses before and after a stand-alone brushing unit. Per batch, 8 carcasses before and 8 after brushing were sampled by the whole-carcass rinse method. Furthermore, the dry matter content and the pH were determined in these samples, as these parameters indirectly (dry matter) or directly (pH) influence the scalding lethality. Results revealed a small but statistically significant reduction (P < 0. 001) in E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> the brushed carcasses. The <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> whole carcasses were reduced on average by 0. 3 log for both E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae. Rinse samples from treated carcasses had significantly less dry matter on average by 2. 5 g (P < 0. 001) and significantly higher pH by 0. 08 units (P < 0. 001). Although these differences are statistically significant, they might have rather low biological relevance; thus, further optimization of brushes is needed for more relevant results. This study confirms that brushing reduces bacterial <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> carcasses, which may be increased potentially by enlarging the brushed surface of the carcass. Further in-line investigations are needed to observe the effect of brushing <b>on</b> bacterial <b>concentrations</b> in scalding water and on carcasses after scalding and at the end of processing...|$|R
