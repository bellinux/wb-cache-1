40|$|During 1997 {{research}} was conducted on trends in factors that affect the supply and demand for airfreight space for fynbos exports from South Africa. The aim was to sensitise decision-makers to probable trends in those factors that will shape <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> availability. The main finding was that the supply of airfreight to South African producers is aggravated by the unbalanced availability of <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> on southbound and northbound trips originating from Cape Town. If the price and quantity of <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> were determined by supply and demand, an imbalance couldn’t arise in a perfect market, as prices would balance <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> supplied and demanded. However, airfreight tariffs are rigid per weight level. The result is that items with a higher mass per volume unit represent a higher income per palette, and are therefore preferred by export agents. This finding has implications for future growth in the industry. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
25|$|Turret deck ships had a low {{net tonnage}} (an {{approximate}} measure of cargo space) {{in comparison to}} their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo) allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of net tonnage which excluded some of the <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk deck ships therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Orlop Decks and the Tank Top {{below that}} were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces,</b> while the Tank Top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the {{platform}} on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} {{were made}} to <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold {{was turned into a}} refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.|$|E

500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E
500|$|Washington Irving was {{intended}} solely for passenger day service and neither sleeping nor <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> were incorporated in design. Nineteen private [...] "balcony parlors" [...] were available {{with the rest}} of the spaces being large public spaces with decor based on the Irving period. A large writing room's design was based on the Alhambra. Forward, below the main deck, was a large lunch room patterened on the Old Cock Tavern of London and a ladies lounge was patterned on Irving's study at [...] "Sunnyside". The main dining room, on the after main deck, was purely in Colonial style. The main saloon on the main deck blended Moorish and Knickerbocker designs and was among the largest rooms afloat. The vessel had about [...] of outside deck space and rooms were fitted with large plate glass for views of the river. Though licensed for 6,000 passengers, breaking a record for such ships previously held by consort Hendrik Hudson, the deck space would have made it possible to carry 1,400 more than its 6,000 capacity license allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Both GT and NT are {{obtained}} by measuring ship's volume and then applying a mathematical formula.
