500|$|The Wrecking crew's ranks {{included}} {{a circle of}} keyboardists who contributed piano and organ parts {{to many of the}} famous songs of the era. [...] Larry Knechtel, later in Bread, was a multi-instrumentalist who played keyboards on [...] "California Dreamin'", [...] "Bridge Over Troubled Water" [...] and [...] "Classical Gas", as well as upright bass on [...] "Eve of Destruction" [...] and electric bass on Byrds' [...] "Mr. Tamborine Man". Mike Melvoin, a classically trained pianist, had an English degree from Dartmouth College and played in several cuts on the Beach Boy's Pet Sounds. [...] Don Randi contributed the piano part on Barry McGuire's 1965 hit [...] "Eve of Destruction". [...] Before becoming a solo artist, Leon Russell was a regular member of the Wrecking Crew and played in the Ronettes' [...] "Be My Baby", and Jan & Dean's [...] "The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)". [...] New Orleans' Mac Rebennack (later Dr. John) did session work with the Wrecking crew while living in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. [...] Mike (Michel) Rubini was the son of Jan Rubini, a classical violinist, and initially played <b>concert</b> <b>piano,</b> but later became enamored with R and switched to playing popular music, eventually becoming a member of the Wrecking Crew and playing on hits such as Sonny & Cher's [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] and Frank Sinatra's [...] "Strangers in the Night".|$|E
500|$|... 1894 saw the {{publication}} in Berlin {{of the first}} part of Busoni's edition of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach for the piano; the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier. This was equipped with substantial appendices, including one [...] "". [...] This was eventually to form a volume of the Bach-Busoni Edition, an undertaking which was to extend over thirty years. Seven volumes were edited by Busoni himself; these included [...] the 1890 edition of the Two- and Three-Part Inventions. [...] Busoni also began to publish his <b>concert</b> <b>piano</b> transcriptions of Bach's music, which he often included in his own recitals. These included some of Bach's chorale preludes for organ, the organ Toccata and Fugue in D minor, and the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue. These transcriptions go beyond literal reproduction of the music for piano and often involve substantial recreation, although never straying from the original rhythmic outlines, melody notes and harmony. This is in line with Busoni's own concept that the performing artist should be free to intuit and communicate his divination of the composer's intentions. Busoni adds tempo markings, articulation and phrase markings, dynamics and metronome markings to the originals, as well as extensive performance suggestions. [...] In his edition of Bach's Goldberg Variations (BV B 35), for example, he suggests cutting eight of the variations for a [...] "concert performance", as well as substantially rewriting many sections. Kenneth Hamilton comments that [...] "the last four variations are rewritten as a free fantasy in a pianistic style which owes far more to Busoni than to Bach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kaye {{was born}} in Leicester, England into a musical family. He was only four {{years old when he}} started to receive piano lessons. At twelve he started to play in local concerts and he {{attended}} the London School of Music, aspiring to be a <b>concert</b> <b>piano</b> player. Later on, when Kaye was fifteen, he discovered he preferred the music of both [...] Dixieland and modern jazz as well as the modern youthful sounds of the Beatlemania days. He played in one jazz band when he was still a schoolboy and at 15 he joined the Danny Rogers Orchestra. Three years later he abandoned his classical music lessons completely. During the 1960s he played with Johnny Taylor's Star Combo and later recorded a handful of singles with at least three different rock groups: the Federals, Jimmy Winston & His Reflections a.k.a. Winston's Fumbs, and Bittersweet; during 1967 he was on tour with French singer Johnny Hallyday.|$|E

40|$|The thesis "The {{influence}} of jazz in Czech piano concerts" disserts on the Czech jazz {{scene of the}} First republic and the time after 1945.

It picks especially those most affected by jazz (E. Schulhoff: <b>Concert</b> for <b>piano</b> and a small orchestra, J. Ježek: <b>Piano</b> <b>concert,</b> M. Svoboda: Concerto grosso for violin, piano and a string orchestra, M. Hybler: <b>Concert</b> for <b>piano</b> and orchestra, op. 21).
