5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Antananarivo {{is the largest}} and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is {{reflected}} in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium. Concerts and night clubs are attended mainly by young people of the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees. More affordable are performances of traditional vakindrazana or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and hira gasy at the city's outdoor <b>cheminots</b> theater or Alliance française; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth. Nightlife is the most animated in the ville moyenne neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina and Andohalo.|$|E

25|$|Once again, {{the fort}} {{was the scene}} of {{civilian}} executions, with thirteen members of the French Resistance executed there. The most notable victims were les quatres <b>cheminots</b> d'Amagne ("the four railway workers of Amagne"), René Arnould, Georges Boillot, Robert Stadler and Lucien Maisonneuve, executed on 26 June 1944 for sabotage at the Amagne-Lucqy depot.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{intelligence}} service, the Deuxième Bureau stayed {{loyal to}} the Allied cause despite nominally being {{under the authority of}} Vichy; the Deuxième Bureau continued to collect intelligence on Germany, maintained links with British and Polish intelligence and kept the secret that before World War II that Polish intelligence had devised a method via a mechanical computer known as the Bombe to break the Enigma machine that was used to code German radio messages. A number of the Polish code-breakers who developed the Bombe machine in the 1930s continued to work for the Deuxième Bureau as part of the Cadix team breaking German codes. In the summer of 1940, many les <b>Cheminots</b> (railroad workers) engaged in impromptu resistance by helping French soldiers wishing to continue the struggle together with British, Belgian and Polish soldiers stranded [...] in France escape from the occupied zone into the unoccupied zone or Spain. Les <b>Cheminots</b> also become the main agents for delivering underground newspapers across France.|$|E
2500|$|The Aerofer was {{designed}} and built {{by members of the}} Aero-Club des <b>Cheminots</b> as a co-operative project. It was a small single-seat low-winged aircraft. The Aerofer had a two-spar wooden wing with fabric covering. The fuselage was of wooden construction with a combination of fabric and plywood covering. [...] The tailwheel undercarriage was fixed. The aircraft was powered by a 50 h.p. Walter Mikron four-cylinder air-cooled engine built by Aster.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} 23 October through 9 November, the VI Corps sector was very quiet, {{and also the}} weather was very bad for flying. Nevertheless, the group took {{numerous}} aerial photographs of enemy territory, made daily visual reconnaissances and made several adjustments of artillery. It noted the enemy was forming artificial lakes at <b>Cheminot</b> and Mailly-sur-Seille, being formed by its engineers damning streams. A patrol on 10 November was made over enemy lines for reconnaissance of enemy infantry and artillery positions.|$|R
50|$|It {{originates}} near Azoudange, in {{the department}} of Moselle. Leaving the Lindre lake, it skirts the town of Dieuze, and traverses Vic-sur-Seille and Nomeny, before flowing into the Moselle at Metz. It is 135 km long, and has a basin area of 1348 km². Most of its length is {{in the department}} of Moselle, except for the part between Aulnois-sur-Seille and <b>Cheminot,</b> which is in Meurthe-et-Moselle. The Seille also forms the border between Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle from Chambrey to Aulnois-sur-Seille.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 {{founded the}} multi-sports Sporting Club de Paris Orleans, a sports club of railwaymen which {{consists}} of 4 sections. In 1932 created the basketball section under the patronage of the backbone of Sportive d’Ivry-Port. In 1936 created the National Society of French Railways (SNCF) and the SCPO then changes its name to Sporting Club de Préparation Olympique. The club under the new name became champion of France in 1935-36 and 1937-38 beating Métro during two final games. In 1966 the basketball section disappears to reappear in 1999. In 1972 SCPO again changes {{its name to the}} Sporting <b>Cheminot</b> de Pratiques Omnisports.|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for Operation Overlord, Resistance attacks on the rail system increased with the Resistance {{in the first three}} months of 1944 damaging 808 locomotives compared to 387 damaged by air attack. Starting with the clearer weather in the spring, between April–June 1944 the Resistance damaged 292 locomotives compared to 1, 437 damaged in air strikes. These statistics do not completely tell the story as Resistance sabotage attacks on the rail system in the first half of 1944 were so pervasive that the Germans had to import workers from the Reich Bahn (the German state railroad) and put soldiers on trains as they no longer trusted the <b>Cheminots.</b> On 23 March 1944, General Pierre Koenig was appointed commander of the FFI and flew [...] to London from Algiers to co-ordinate the operations of the FFI at the SHEAF commanded by General Dwight Eisenhower at a section known as État Major des Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur (General Staff, French Forces of the Interior). The American and British officers at SHEAF distrusted the Resistance with the OSS agent William J. Casey writing that many in the Resistance appeared more interested in post-war politics than in fighting the Germans. Despite the mistrust, SHEAF planned to use the Resistance to tie down German forces. In April 1944, there were 331 drops of weapons by the SOE to the marquis, in May 531 drops and in June 866 drops. The most common weapon provided by the SOE was the Sten machine gun, which through inaccurate except at short ranges and prone to breakdown was cheap, light, easy to assemble and disassemble and required no special skills to use. Other weapons dropped by the SOE were the Webley revolver, the Bren machine gun, the Lee-Enfield rifle and the PIAT anti-tank gun while the OSS provided the M3 [...] "Greasegun", the Browning handgun, the M1 rifle and the Bazooka anti-tank gun. In general, American weaponry was preferred to British weaponry, through the British-built Bren gun emerged as one of the favorite weapons of the resistance. Reflecting the importance of weapons, organising supply drops was the main concern for the Resistance in the spring of 1944. André Hue, a dual citizen of France and the United Kingdom serving in the SOE who parachuted into Brittany to lead the Hillbilly resistance circuit recalled his principle duty in the spring of 1944 was organizing supply drops and attempting to avoid the Wehrmacht and the Milice. Hue had been born in Wales to a French father and a Welsh mother, and like many other Anglo-French dual citizens had volunteered for the SOE. The Communist FTP often complained that they were being staved of arms by the BCRA with Charles Tillon noting that the BCRA had organized hundreds of supply drops, of which only six were for the FTP. On 29 April 1944, the most famous of all the SOE agents during the war returned to France when Nancy Wake, aka the [...] "White Mouse" [...] parachuted into France. Despite the rampant sexism in French society (French women were not allowed to vote until 1946 as Frenchwomen were viewed as minors under the protection of their father or husband), Wake took command of a marquis band numbering about 1, 000 men in the Auvergne region and led it successfully, barking out orders in her distinctive Australian accented French and threatening to shoot any man who a problem with taking orders from a woman. A sign of Wake's success as a guerrilla leader was the number of maquisards under her command increased to about 7, 500 by the summer of 1944.|$|E

50|$|Once the First Army {{jumped off}} on the offensive, the 82nd Division engaged in a holding mission to prevent German forces from attacking the right flank of the First Army. On 13 September, the 163rd Infantry Brigade and 327th Infantry Regiment raided and patrolled to the {{northeast}} of Port-sur-Seille, toward Eply, in the Bois de <b>Cheminot,</b> Bois de la Voivrotte, Bois de la Tête-d'Or, and Bois Fréhaut. Meanwhile, the 328th Infantry Regiment, {{in connection with the}} attack of the 90th Division against the Bois-le-Prêtre, advanced on the west of the Moselle River, and, in contact with the 90th Division, entered Norroy, advancing to the heights just north of that town where it consolidated its position. On 15 September, the 328th Infantry, {{in order to protect the}} 90th Division's flank, resumed the advance, and reached Vandières, but withdrew on the following day to the high ground north of Norroy.|$|R
500|$|The 95th Infantry Division was {{assigned}} to XIII Corps of the Ninth United States Army, Twelfth United States Army Group. The division sailed for Europe on 10 August 1944. The 95th Infantry Division arrived in England on 17 August. After receiving additional training, it moved to France one month later on 15 September. During {{this time it was}} reassigned to III Corps. The division bivouacked near Norroy-le-Sec, from 1 to 14 October. It was then assigned to XX Corps of the Third United States Army. The division was sent into combat on 19 October in the Moselle bridgehead sector east of Moselle and South of Metz and patrolled the Seille near <b>Cheminot,</b> capturing the forts surrounding Metz and repulsing enemy attempts to cross the river. It was during the defense of this town from repeated German attacks that the division received its nickname, [...] "The Iron Men of Metz." [...] On 1 November, elements went over to the offensive, reducing an enemy pocket east of Maizières-lès-Metz. On the 8 November, these units crossed the Moselle River and advanced to Bertrange. Against heavy resistance, the 95th captured the forts surrounding Metz and captured the city by 22 November.|$|R
5000|$|De Vivie {{imported}} machines from England. In 1889 {{he made a}} bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had {{a diamond}} frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 {{when one of his}} readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two chain wheels on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. [...] In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split chain wheel. Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the chain wheel open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his <b>Cheminot</b> in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling.|$|R
