The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11am. The number of passengers had grown to about 650 {{by the time the}} train arrived to a celebration at Huntly at 1:12pm. Public services began the following day.|$|E

25|$|In 1855 an Act of Parliament {{authorised}} the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> However the one train per day {{each way}} {{did little to}} produce extra revenue and, when a passenger was killed in 1877, the service was discontinued. The line's prosperity depended on that of the canals it connected but, by the 1830s, they were in decline. This was, to a degree, offset by {{the increase in the}} trade for limestone from the quarries.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{large numbers}} of surplus DH.9s became available, having been deemed to be surplus to {{requirements}} by their original military operators; accordingly, many were resold onto civil operators, such as by early aerial transport companies. Large numbers were modified to better perform as transport aircraft, such as the cabin being suitably adapted for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> In this role, the DH.9 provided a useful load carrying capability and were relatively inexpensive to procure. Accordingly, in various configurations, the type saw prolific use by civil operators.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 and 1883, two new Acts were {{obtained}} which adjusted the tolls on the railway and permitted the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> The second of these Acts was necessary because {{the owners of}} the quarries served by the railway objected that passenger trains would interfere with their mineral traffic. Initially the railway ran a test passenger service on the local roads; this proved to be so popular {{that they were able to}} pass the parliamentary act over the opposition of the quarry owners. It was also the first instance of a long history of the Corris Railway operating passenger road services in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} the {{aircraft}} {{began in the}} 1990s with a forecast programme cost of US$10 billion (early published figures were US$4–5.5B) and called for the first aircraft to be built before 2000. With an estimated price per unit of about US$160–200 million (an earlier published estimate was US$150 million) the market was forecast {{for a total of}} 300 aircraft, with production planned for the Kazan Aircraft Production Association facility. Initially designed for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> later a KR-860T (T stands for Tanker) version was proposed for use as an aerial Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker for far-north regions. Taking advantage of the presence of LNG on the aircraft, the design proposed using LNG to fuel the turbines, rather than conventional Jet fuel, like on the Tupolev Tu-206.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{approved}} by the Assembly of Jamaica in 1843 was for a double track between Kingston and Spanish Town, with branch lines to Angels, Port Henderson and the Caymanas sugar estate. On 21 November 1845 the Governor of Jamaica James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin and ten <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> pulled by the companies two locomotives Projector and Patriot built by Sharp Brothers of Manchester, travelled [...] from Kingston to Spanish Town. The first train came after the British Government had enacted the Sugar Duties Act 1846 and just after the emancipation of slaves, meaning the sugar industry needed the efficiency that the railway would bring to the difficult to passage island.|$|R

25|$|On 7 July 1948, a Silver City Bristol Freighter {{operated}} the first cross-Channel air ferry service, between Lympne near Folkestone in Kent and Le Touquet on France's northern Côte d'Opale coast, with good road connections from and to London and Paris respectively. The new service, which initially operated on a seasonal charter basis, became a year-round scheduled operation in 1949. In the beginning, {{there was a}} flat £32 one-way fare to take a group of four passengers along with their car across the Channel. Once opposition from British European Airways (BEA) to the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> travelling without vehicles was overcome, a new fare structure was introduced. For example, a group of four travelling with a small car was charged only £27, while the comparable fare for four people travelling with a large car remained at £32. By the end of 1949, this operation fully utilised five Freighters, which carried 2,700 cars and 10,000 passengers. These figures represented a significant increase {{over the previous year}} when only 178 cars and their occupants, as well as some motorcycles and bicycles had been carried {{until the end of the}} season in September.|$|E
25|$|The Cunard Line {{acquired}} a controlling stake in Eagle in March 1960 {{which resulted in}} the creation of a joint venture company trading as Cunard Eagle. Eagle's founder Harold Bamberg was appointed as aviation director of the company. The new support enabled Cunard Eagle to order two new Boeing 707 jet aircraft in May 1961. In June 1961, Cunard Eagle became the first independent airline in the UK to be awarded a licence by the newly constituted Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB) to operate a scheduled service on the prime Heathrow — New York JFK route, using Boeing 707 jets and Bristol Britannia turboprops at a frequency of one round-trip per day. The licence was valid for 15 years — from 31 August 1961 to 31 July 1976. The airline also won the right to serve Manchester, Glasgow Prestwick, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston and Washington. The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> on UK domestic sectors and of mail on all sectors was denied. Similarly, requests for traffic rights to Toronto, Montreal, Detroit and Chicago were turned down. This decision angered BOAC, which was losing money at the time. It appealed to Aviation Minister Peter Thorneycroft, who was empowered to accept or reject the ATLB's recommendations and to uphold or quash appeals against its decisions. The state airline cited its order for 45 Standard and Super VC10 long-haul jets and an earlier ministerial promise not to permit another British competitor on this route in support of its appeal. The appeal was upheld, resulting in revocation of Cunard Eagle's licence in November 1961. In the meantime the airline acquired two further Britannia aircraft in March and May 1961, both ex-Canadian Pacific Air Lines aircraft.|$|E

Their novelty quickly made the trams popular with the public causing patronage to rise to [...] "unprecedented and unexpected" [...] levels.

50|$|In 1857 the Portpatrick Railway was authorised, {{its primary}} {{objective}} was to connect Portpatrick and Carlisle for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> mails, <b>passenger</b> and goods. When {{it became obvious that}} Portpatrick Harbour {{was not going to be}} improved, it concentrated on Stranraer as its ferry port. Stranraer is at the southern end of Loch Ryan; although the passage to Irish ports is longer, Stranraer was a more spacious and better-sheltered location, thus it became the dominant port for transits to northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 1971, a {{collision}} occurred between a newspaper delivery train and a passenger service from Southend Victoria. Nobody was injured, however two <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>passenger</b> train were extensively damaged and some minor damage was caused {{to the newspaper}} train. The newspaper train's driver had left his cab to check signals without having applied the brakes, leading to the train slipping back down the gradient of the branch line, into the Southend train which was stopped on the main line at Wickford.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} the railway was ready to open in 1902, lead mining in Ceredigion was in steep decline. However a {{significant}} growth in tourism was under way, and the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> soon became the principal traffic of the railway. It opened for mineral traffic in August 1902 and for passengers on 22 December 1902, using two 2-6-2T locomotives built by Davies and Metcalfe and the aforementioned Rheidol, built by Bagnall. [...] The original stations were Aberystwyth (located on Park Avenue), Llanbadarn, Capel Bangor, Nantyronen and Devil's Bridge (Pontarfynach). A short branch ran along the Rheidol's bank to the harbour. The final construction cost was reported as £60,000 (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, {{a regular}} {{connection}} of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or, [...] by Southern Railway and French Northern Railway, began. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat {{cars in the}} UK and [...] "CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL" [...] in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator Silvio Crespi proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition. [...] This would be done {{under the auspices of}} an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular container service in the northeast United States. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in New York and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means of transport for cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in Venice on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests were done to assess the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.|$|E

50|$|The {{cabotage}} {{provisions of}} the Jones Act restrict the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods or <b>passengers</b> between United States ports to U.S. built and flagged vessels. In addition, at least 75 percent of the crewmembers must be U.S. citizens. Moreover foreign repair work of U.S.-flagged vessels' hull and superstructure is limited to 10 percent foreign-built steel weight. This restriction largely prevents Jones Act ships from refurbishing their ships at overseas shipyards.|$|R
