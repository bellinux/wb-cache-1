5|$|L. ahuacaense was {{the fourth}} species of the genus Lagidium to be described, after L.peruanum, L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni of the central and {{southern}} Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within L.peruanum and L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni is poorly differentiated from L.viscacia. Together with the plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) and the chinchillas (Chinchilla), Lagidium forms the rodent family <b>Chinchillidae.</b> Within Lagidium, L.ahuacaense differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A cladistic analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the sister group to all other Lagidium species, but support for this placement was not strong. Morphometric analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other Lagidium species.|$|E
60|$|My {{experience}} is that mammals and birds, with few exceptions--probably there are really no exceptions--possess the habit of indulging frequently in more or less regular or set performances, with or without sound, or composed of sound exclusively; and that these performances, which in many animals are only discordant cries and choruses, and uncouth, irregular motions, in the more aerial, graceful, and melodious kinds take immeasurably higher, more complex, and more beautiful forms. Among the mammalians the instinct appears almost universal; but their displays are, as a rule, less admirable than those seen in birds. There are some kinds, it is true, like the squirrels and monkeys, of arboreal habits, almost birdlike in their restless energy, and in the swiftness and certitude of their motions, in which the slightest impulse can be instantly expressed in graceful or fantastic action; others, like the <b>Chinchillidae</b> family, have greatly developed vocal organs, and resemble birds in loquacity; but mammals generally, compared with birds, are slow and heavy, and not so readily moved to exhibitions of the kind I am discussing.|$|E

5000|$|Chinchillas are {{two species}} of crepuscular rodents, {{slightly}} larger and more robust than ground squirrels. They are native to the Andes mountains in South America and live in colonies called [...] "herds" [...] at high elevations up to 4270 m.

50|$|The family <b>Chinchillidae</b> is in {{the order}} Rodentia and {{consists}} of the chinchillas, the viscachas, and their fossil relatives. This family is restricted to southern and western South America, mostly living in mountainous regions of the Andes but one species living on plains. They are medium to large-sized rodents, weighing from 800 g to 8 kg, with strong hind legs and large ears and a bushy tail. All species have thick, soft fur, which is considered valuable in some cultures.|$|E
5000|$|Members of {{the family}} <b>Chinchillidae</b> are {{somewhat}} squirrel-like rodents varying in weight from 0.5 to 8 kg.

The forefeet have four toes while the hind feet have four small-clawed toes in Lagidium and Chinchilla but three large-clawed toes in [...] Lagostomus, a digging species. Their dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 1/1, 3/3 and their incisors grow continually throughout their lives. Chinchillids are generally brownish-grey or grey on the dorsal (upper) surface and pale on the ventral (under) surface. Plains viscachas have distinctive black and white markings on their faces.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis entitled The current situation of chinchillas breeding in the Czech Republic, is to identify and assess {{the current status of}} breeding Chinchilla lanigera on the fur farms and also as pets. The first part deals with the history of fur farming and situations {{in the world and the}} Czech Republic, taxonomic classification of chinchillas, their origin, and domestication. One chapter is focused on the division of the family <b>Chinchillidae</b> with emphasis on the differences between genera and a description of types and color varieties of Chinchilla lanigera. The next section describes the breeding facilities, the characteristics of breeding animals, their reproduction, nutrition, and handling. The thesis also pays attention to a method for determining the fur maturity of chinchilla and skinning. Conclusion of the work is devoted to describing the current situation in a particular chinchilla fur farm...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{parasite}} fauna present in rodent coprolites collected from Cueva Huenul 1 (CH 1), northern Neuquén (Patagonia, Argentina), an archaeological site that provides stratified sequences of archaeological and palaeontological remains dating from the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Transition to the Late Holocene period. Twenty rodent coprolites collected from different sedimentary units from the site, with ages ranging from 13. 844 ± 75 - 1. 416 ± 37 years BP, were examined for parasites. Each coprolite was processed as a whole: rehydrated, homogenised, spontaneously sedimented and examined using light microscopy. The coprolites and the eggs of any parasites present were described, measured and photographed. In all, 158 parasite eggs were found in 10 coprolites. The faeces were positive for Viscachataenia quadrata Denegri, Dopchiz, Elissondo & Beveridge and Monoecocestus sp. Beddard (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae) and for Heteroxynema (Cavioxyura) viscaciae Sutton & Hugot (Nematoda: Oxyuridae). The coprolites examined were tentatively attributed to Lagidium viscacia Molina (Mammalia, Rodentia, Caviomorpha, <b>Chinchillidae).</b> The life cycles of these parasites are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A micromammal archaeological {{sequence}} (2120 f 120 to 780 f 100 years BP) from Inca Cueva 5 site (23 " 05 ' S - 65 " 27 ' W; 3700 m. a. s. l., Jujuy Province, Argentina) was studied. The following mammalian taxa were recorded: Order Didelphimorphia, Family Didelphidae, Thylamys cf. T. pallidior; Order Rodentia, Family Muridae, Akodon cf. A. albiventer, Andinomys edax, Auliscomys sublimis, Calomys lepidus, Neotomys ebriosus, Phyllotis sp.; Family Caviidae, Cavia cf. C. tschudii, Galea musteloides; Family Abrocomidae, Abrocoma cinerea; Family <b>Chinchillidae,</b> Lagidium viscacia; Family Octodontidae, Octodontomys gliroides. The taphonomy {{indicates that}} the sequence is an owl pellet accumulation inside the cave. The general landscape corresponds to the oriental border of the Puna steppe, with scattered shrub and low brush vegetation. Near the site there are small tree groups of Polylepis australis as well as small streams covered with grass and ciperaceous vegetation known as &# 194;&# 171;vegas&# 194;&# 187;. Al 1 the recorded taxa at Inca Cueva 5 exist today in Puna and Prepuna environments from Jujuy and Salta Provinces and southem Bolivia, excepting Cavia cf. C. tschudii. The modem records of this species in northem Argentina and southern Bolivia come from localities with high montane bunchgrass prairies and forests of the humid Yungas phytogeographical region. The presence of this species in the sequence suggests wetter climatic conditions on this region when the archaeological site was originated. Later drier conditions, caused probably by anthropic influence in the last 500 years, produced the retraction of Cavia tschudii to the moist {{eastern side of the}} Andes and its disappeareance of the Puna areas. El sitio arqueol&# 243;gico Inca Cueva 5 se encuentra en la provincia de Jujuy, Argentina, en el borde oriental de la regi&# 243;n de la Puna (23 " 05 ' S - 65 " 27 ' W; 3700 m s n m) y est&# 225; fechado entre 2120 f 120 y 780 f 100 a&# 241;os radiocarb&# 243;nicos AP. El estudio de una peque&# 241;a muestra de micromam&# 237;feros permiti&# 243; reconocer la presencia de los siguientes taxa: Orden Didelphimorphia, Familia Didelphidae, Thylamys cf. T. pallidior; Orden Rodentia, Familia Muridae, Akodon cf. A. albiventer, Andinomys edax, Auliscomys sublimis, Calomys lepidus, Neotomys ebriosus, Phyllotis sp.; Familia Caviidae, Cavia cf. C. tschudii, Galea musteloides; Familia Abrocomidae, Abrocoma cinerea; Familia <b>Chinchillidae,</b> Lagidium viscacia; Familia Octodontidae, Octodontomys gliroides. La tafonom&# 237;a indica que el agregado tuvo su origen en la depositaci&# 243;n de egagr&# 243;pilas de lechuza (Aves, Strigiformes) en el contexto de la cueva. El ambiente general actual en la zona corresponde a la estepa pune&# 241;a, con arbustos y matorrales bajos y dispersos. En el fondo del valle hay bosquecillos de Polylepis australis, un curso de agua y vegas peque&# 241;as y circunscritas. Todas las especies registradas en Inca Cueva 5 habitan actualmente en ambientes de Puna y Prepuna de Salta, Jujuy y sur de Bolivia, a excepci&# 243;n de Cavia cf. C. tschudii. Los registros actuales de esta especie en el noroeste de Argentina y sur de Bolivia corresponden a localidades ubicadas en pastizales de altura y bosques subtropicales de Yungas. La presencia de este tax&# 243;n en la secuencia sugiere condiciones de mayor humedad que las actuales para la regi&# 243;n durante el lapso considerado. Condiciones posteriores de mayor aridez, probablemente asociadas al impacto antr&# 243;pico de los &# 250;ltimos 500 a&# 241;os, habr&# 237;an redundado en la desaparici&# 243;n de Cavia tschudii de &# 225;reas pune&# 241;as y en su retracci&# 243;n a los cordones orientales h&# 250;medos de los Andes...|$|E
