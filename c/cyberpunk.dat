5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond <b>Cyberpunk!</b> from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on <b>cyberpunk</b> culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the <b>Cyberpunk</b> album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole <b>cyberpunk</b> genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E

5|$|Blade Runner {{continues}} to reflect modern trends and concerns, {{and an increasing}} number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the <b>cyberpunk</b> movement. It also influenced the <b>cyberpunk</b> derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E

50|$|In the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in {{the early}} 1990s, Dundee turned on his father and became J.C. Ice, a white rapper, loosely based on Vanilla Ice. He formed a tag team called PG-13 with Kelly Wolfe (known as Wolfie D) and {{dominated}} the USWA tag team division throughout the mid-1990s, winning the USWA Tag Team Championship on fifteen occasions. After losing to Bill Dundee, PG-13 were obliged to leave the USWA. They returned shortly thereafter under masks as The <b>Cyberpunks,</b> Ice (Dundee) and Fire (Wolfe). After some time, The <b>Cyberpunks</b> unmasked and reverted to being PG-13.|$|R
5|$|While <b>cyberpunk</b> {{remained}} a core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what <b>cyberpunk</b> was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as <b>cyberpunk</b> were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} work of Mark Frauenfelder on Boing boing, Idol hired him to use {{graphics}} software {{in the design of}} artwork associated with the album.

5|$|In its {{retrospective}} on the series, Japanese magazine Yougo {{praised the}} game's cautionary message concerning {{black and white}} morality, praising its mixture of <b>cyberpunk</b> and occult elements, and citing it as the reason the Megami Tensei series continued.

It also incorporates role-playing system elements, in which the player can develop skills and traits, such as hacking and psionic abilities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the <b>Cyberpunk</b> album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to {{the failure of}} the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

Assuming {{the role of a}} nameless hacker, the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called SHODAN.|$|E
5|$|The Sprawl trilogy was {{followed}} by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' <b>cyberpunk</b> roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.|$|E
5|$|The album {{featured}} a cyberpunk-styled narrative {{as well as}} synthesized vocals and industrial influences. Despite the critical and financial failure of the album, Billy Idol set several precedents {{in the process of}} promoting the album. These included his use of the internet, e-mail, virtual communities, and multimedia software – each a first for a mainstream celebrity. Idol also based his fashion style, music videos, and stage shows on <b>cyberpunk</b> themes and aesthetics.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2044 AD. Players assume the role of any one of six <b>cyberpunks,</b> each {{equipped}} with a unique car and a deadly supply of weapons.

5|$|<b>Cyberpunk</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol {{to take control of the}} creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
5|$|Dark Angel is an American <b>cyberpunk</b> {{television}} series that premiered on the Fox network on October 3, 2000. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, it starred Jessica Alba in her breakthrough role. Set in 2019, the series chronicles {{the life of}} Max Guevara (Alba), a genetically enhanced super-soldier who escapes from a covert military facility as a child. In a post-apocalyptic Seattle, she tries to lead a normal life, while eluding capture by government agents and searching for her brothers and sisters scattered {{in the aftermath of}} their escape. Dark Angel was the first and only series produced by the company Cameron/Eglee Productions, and was filmed in Vancouver at Lions Gate Studios.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the <b>cyberpunk</b> element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured the essence of the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to some of}} the hippies of the 1960s who were antiscience and antitechnology, the <b>cyberpunks</b> of the 1980s and 1990s ecstatically embraced technology and the hacker ethic. They believed that high technology (and smart drugs) could help human beings overcome limits, that it could liberate them from authority and even enable them to transcend space, time, and body. They often expressed their ethos and aesthetics through cyberart and reality hacking.|$|R
5000|$|While Larry McCaffery has {{commented that}} these early short stories {{displayed}} flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic Darko Suvin has identified them as [...] "undoubtedly <b>cyberpunk's</b> best works", constituting the [...] "furthest horizon" [...] of the genre.

[...] In the dedication to his book, Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars, Brooks Landon calls McCaffery, [...] "Pomo's Pure Product, <b>Cyberpunk's</b> Critical Case Officer, Avant Pop's Main Man, and SF's Friend in the High Castle".|$|R
5|$|Fantasy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common LARP genres internationally and is the genre that the largest events use. Fantasy LARPs are set in pseudo-historical worlds {{inspired}} by fantasy literature and fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. These settings typically have magic, fantasy races, and limited technology. Many fantasy LARPs focus on adventure or on competition between character factions. In contrast, science fiction LARPs take place in futuristic settings with high technology and sometimes with extraterrestrial life. This describes a broad array of LARPs, including politically themed LARPs depicting dystopian or utopian societies and settings inspired by <b>cyberpunk,</b> space opera and post-apocalyptic fiction.|$|E
5|$|Max Guevara (X5-452) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the protagonist of the <b>cyberpunk</b> science fiction television program Dark Angel. During both seasons of the series Max was portrayed by Jessica Alba and by Geneva Locke during childhood flashbacks. Over one thousand actresses were considered for the part of Max before Alba was given the role. Max also appears in three canonical novels based on the series {{as well as an}} apocryphal video game adaptation. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, Max followed a long line of strong female characters created by Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.|$|E
5|$|Remember Me is a <b>cyberpunk</b> action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Dontnod Entertainment {{and published by}} Capcom. It was released worldwide in June 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game's plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by megacorporation Memorize. With {{the help of a}} mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people's recollections. The combat consists of a modified combo system called Pressen.|$|E
500|$|Mark Frauenfelder also defended Idol, {{pointing}} out the elitist hypocrisy of the WELL community, and highlighted the perceived pointlessness of the conflict. [...] "There are all these 16- and 17-year-old <b>cyberpunks</b> who are afraid that everybody's going to learn their secret handshake or something." [...] Andy Hawks, original maintainer of the alt.cyberpunk Frequently Asked Questions list, {{and founder of the}} Future Culture mailing list, criticized what he perceived to be a double-standard among Idol's critics in questioning his motivation behind creating the album and his choice of associating on internet forums.|$|R
50|$|William Gibson, {{the author}} of Neuromancer, collaborated with Shirley on short stories—as did fellow <b>cyberpunks</b> Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. Shirleys lyricism, wealth of ideas and imagination, {{crossover}} pioneering, and street-level honesty have been praised by other writers including Clive Barker, Peter Straub, Roger Zelazny, Marc Laidlaw, and A. A. Attanasio. His more surreal work, as in A Splendid Chaos showed how {{it was possible to}} describe the indescribable with a paradoxical believability and impeccable internal logic no matter how bizarre the subject matter. Shirleys personal experiences as a recovering drug addict and punk rocker brought real verisimilitude to his darker, urban-tinctured writing.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the dot-com}} bubble {{of the late}} 1990s burst in 2000, the techno-utopianism that prevailed in the cyberdelic {{counterculture}} waned while technorealism grew. Most <b>cyberpunks</b> realized that the PC, the Internet, and other new technologies did not really bring the radical social, political, and personal changes they thought they would, specifically the [...] "cybersociety" [...] - a postpolitical, non-hierarchical society made possible by cyberware, in which the computer-literate, super-intelligent, open-minded, change-oriented, self-reliant, irreverent free-thinker is the norm {{and the person who}} is not internetted and does not think for him or herself and does not question authority is the [...] "problem person".|$|R
