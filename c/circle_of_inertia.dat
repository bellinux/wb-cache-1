40|$|After 20 {{years of}} transition, {{the culture of}} Romanian {{companies}} is still dominated by some remaining block culture mentalities proper to Eastern and Central European countries. Although, from a technical point of view the transition may be regarded as an ended process, {{it is certain that}} there is still a communist inheritance strongly integrated in this culture in series of remaining mentalities. Such mentalities {{are to be found in}} the culture of Romanian companies framed into a vicious <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> representing significant change resisting structures. Thus, this paper displays the results of a pilot study meant to establish the diagnosis of the dominant values of Romanian companies ’ culture. The results reveal the fact that although some reminiscences of the communist period are still integrated in the culture of Romanian companies some of those mentalities have been overcome.

40|$|Three {{commonly}} used methods {{to determine the}} principal moments of inertia of a plane area and their directions are based on: (i) the stationarity condition for the axial moment of inertia, (ii) the eigenvalue analysis, and (iii) Mohr’s circle. In this paper we provide two new derivations, which are based on: (a) the matrix diagonalization and the invariant tensor properties, and (b) the conjugacy property of the moment of inertia vectors. A new general expression is derived which specifies the principal directions of inertia, {{as well as the}} directions of the maximum and minimum product of inertia. A comparative study of the five presented approaches is given, which is of interest from both conceptual and methodological points of view. The connection between the deviatoric part of the moment of inertia tensor and Land’s <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> is also given.

5000|$|Romani {{communities}} in Greece face severe, widespread issues {{of social and}} geographic segregation, including denial of access to environmental means of sustenance such as land, electricity, and clean water, as well as exposure to pollution and other ecological issues. Similar issues exist for predominantly Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants, especially those working in the agricultural sector. In some cases, Romani communities have been identified for actions resulting in environmental damage, such as unauthorized waste incineration and negligently starting forest fires. According to Pavlou and Lykovardi,The persistence of extreme socio-spatial segregation of Roma and its underlying causes has resulted in acute social exclusion. The spatial segregation of habitats is a pattern closely connected to their socio-economic exclusion which leads them to seek and find unoccupied and isolated areas in order to set up temporary or long-term encampments with makeshift shacks ... {{the consequences of their}} marginalisation become the reasons - and legitimising arguments - for their perennial segregation and exclusion in a persistent vicious <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> stereotyping, state <b>inertia</b> and local hostility.|$|R
6000|$|As is well known, the {{fundamental}} {{law of the}} mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which {{is known as the}} law <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star describes a <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> immense radius in the course of an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the law <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a <b>circle.</b> A system <b>of</b> co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> holds relative to it is called a [...] " [...] Galileian system of co-ordinates."
