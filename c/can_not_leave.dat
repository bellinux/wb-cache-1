5000|$|Responding to the paper, the {{economist}} Tyler Cowen speculated on how time travel affects time preference discounting.

As you approach {{the speed of light}} you move into the future relative to more stationary observers. So <b>can</b> you <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> a penny in a savings account, take a very rapid spaceflight, and come back to earth [...] "many years later" [...] as a billionaire? Hardly any time has passed for you. In essence we are abolishing time preference, or at least allowing people to lower their time preference by spending money on fuel. I believe that in such worlds the real interest rate cannot exceed the costs at which more fuel can [...] "propel you into the future through time dilation." ...|$|R

5000|$|Many ethnographic films include {{recorded}} {{speech by}} {{people in the community}} being filmed. When this speech is in a language unfamiliar to the intended audience of the ethnographic film, the producers generally use voice over translation or subtitles. However, {{it has been shown that}} these translations of the film's subjects to the film's audience have not always been accurate. In the film Spirits of Defiance: The Mangbetu People of Zaire about the Mangbetu people of the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as [...] "Zaire", Robert McKee has shown that the subtitles <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>leave</b> out part of what is said, but at times even change what is said to support the point of view of the film's producers.

Any such attempt shuts down the body of the attacking Eternal, and is implied to be an automatic defense mechanism of the Celestials' armor. On one occasion, when the Eternals attempted to form a Uni-Mind with the intent of keeping the Dreaming Celestial asleep, they were immediately shut down and discorporated back into their original, individual forms before they could even form a non-aggressive plan of action.
