5|$|Double-articulation <b>cranes,</b> {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry <b>cranes,</b> reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry <b>cranes,</b> the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E

50|$|An {{overhead}} <b>crane,</b> {{commonly called}} a bridge <b>crane,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>crane</b> found in industrial environments.

If the bridge is rigidly supported on two or more legs running on a fixed rail at ground level, the <b>crane</b> is called a gantry <b>crane</b> (USA, ASME B30 series) or a goliath <b>crane</b> (UK, BS 466).|$|R
50|$|The wattled <b>crane</b> was {{formerly}} placed {{in its own}} genus Bugeranus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus Grus within the <b>crane</b> family was not monophyletic and that the wattled <b>crane</b> was a sister species to a clade containing the blue <b>crane</b> and the demoiselle <b>crane.</b> In the resulting reorganization of the genera, the wattled <b>crane</b> {{was moved to the}} genus Grus. Some taxonomists retain the wattled <b>crane</b> within Bugeranus. The wattled <b>crane</b> is monotypic: there are no recognised subspecies.|$|R
5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent.

50|$|A {{railroad}} <b>crane</b> generally {{resembles a}} conventional fixed-location <b>crane</b> {{except that the}} platform the <b>crane</b> sits on is a heavy-duty reinforced flat car.

The trucks on the car under the <b>crane</b> will often include traction motors so that the <b>crane</b> is able to move itself along the track, and possibly tow additional cars.|$|R
5|$|Every spring {{over two}} million {{waterfowl}} pass Matsalu, including 10,000—20,000 Bewick's swans, 10,000 greater scaups, common goldeneyes, tufted ducks, goosanders and many others. A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common <b>cranes</b> in Europe. The highest recorded number of <b>cranes</b> at the park has been 23,000.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 season saw {{a number}} of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to {{financial}} trouble. At {{the same time it}} was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper <b>Cranes</b> had captured first place for a {{second year in a row}} with 95 points. While the <b>Cranes</b> had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the <b>Cranes</b> and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the <b>Cranes</b> faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the <b>Cranes</b> vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the <b>Cranes.</b>|$|E
