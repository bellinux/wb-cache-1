5000|$|Years ago, Harvard University's Office of Government and Community Affairs {{sponsored}} {{an in-depth}} {{study of the}} animal rights movement, examining its tactics, strategies, and long-term goals. Even those many years ago Harvard understood {{that there was a}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> in the movement, noting in its Report that [...] "philosophically, animal rights/welfare groups can be classified as abolitionists or regulationists. The abolitionists, such as ISAR…constitute a minority within a movement. They are, however, also the most diligent, tactical and clear thinking. They use the law, publications and education to work for their ultimate goals." [...] (Our italics.) What Harvard said about ISAR those decades ago remains true today.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pursuit}} of better {{outcomes}} for people, problems {{have been found in}} current procedures for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). These relate primarily with regard to the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between an ‘organic’ genesis of pain, where the presence of tissue damage is presumed, and a ‘psychogenic’ origin, where pain occurs despite a lack of damage to tissue. CPP literature in medicine and psychiatry reflects a paradigm where unproblematically observable ‘organic’ processes are causally and sequentially explained, despite evidence in favour of a possible model which accounts for the “complex role played by meaning and consciousness” in the experience of pain. While in the literature of causal mechanisms reference is made to ‘subjective’ aspects of pain, current models do not provide a means through which these aspects may be accessed or understood. Without interpretive or ‘subjective’ approaches to the pain experienced by patients, medical understandings of CPP are fixed within ‘organic’ sequences of the “purely object” body conceptually separated from the patient. Despite the prevalence of this wider understanding of the biological genesis of pain, alternate diagnosis and treatments of CPP in multidisciplinary settings have shown high success rates for people for whom ‘organic’ pathology has been unhelpful.|$|E

Without such action an imbalance could arise which would lead to their demise or subservience to federal authority and advice. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on a {{research}} and clinical work conducted in a pain treatment centre in France, the author shows that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> of psyche-soma that dominate the current discussion of the phenomenon of pain cannot ultimately account for its clinical realities. Although pain manifests in the body, it cannot be reduced to organic causes. The psycho-analytic approach to the body {{on the other hand}} allows us {{to make sense of the}} reality of pain, of the objectivity and cer-tainty that mark its experience for the suffering subject and, in parallel, of the cases where no organic substrate has been identified. The body is not only organic. It is then up to the clinician, whether a physicalist or a psychoanalyst, to know how to work with this sign – one that does not call for interpretation [...] regardless of its presumed aetiology...|$|R
40|$|Greater Miami {{makes an}} {{interesting}} {{case study of}} suburbanization because of its recent history, the geographic limits of urban expansion, and its profound ethnic makeover {{at the time that}} postwar suburbanization peaked in North America. The city-suburb distinction here does not correspond to prototypes and it is equally difficult to find typical suburbs as conventionally perceived. A general discussion of the local meaning of ‘suburb’ and of the formation of suburbia and of city-suburb relations in southeast Florida is followed by a comparative review of six selected ‘suburbs’. While suburban features can be detected across the metropolis, they almost always combine with characteristics that are emphatically not suburban such as high densities or concentrated economic activity. Theoretically, this paper contests the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> and ahistoricism that have long overshadowed research on suburbs. The study also highlights suburbia as a subjective category and as a complex and multidimensional notion that, in the modern metropolis, can manifest itself partially, and in different ways, in various geographic domains...|$|R

40|$|The Qur’ânic Studies {{have long}} {{recognized}} the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of Makkîyah and Madaniyah where verses {{are classified as}} either belonging to the period of Makkah or Madinah. This paper suggests that this <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> may also be applied {{in the study of}} the science of the prophetic saying (hadîth). We propose that paradigm of the Qur’ânic Studies concerning the periodical distinction may be borrowed to understand and classify the prophetic sayings along the line of Makkîyah and Madanîyah. The paper however acknowledges this effort is not without methodological difficulties. There are hadîth that may –in terms of their characteristics and substance- be regarded as Makkî, but may also be considered as Madani because they are narrated by the people of Madinah (the Ansâr). To tackle this problem, we propose double-way strategy. We will first find out which hadîths are regarded as Makkî in terms of their characteristics and substance, and then examine the idea of what many have called the “argumentation of the prophetic term”. The first is about the thematic study, while the second is about the analysis of the term of a hadîth. The first will involve the consultation of mainly the hadîth authoritative book called Miftâh Kunûz al-Sunnah, while the second will consult those books that employ the personal-encyclopedic approach including books of hadîth, the sciences of the Qur’ân (tafsîr), the reason of revelation (asbâb al-nuzûl), the reason of decreeing (asbâb al-wurûd), and the autobiography of the prophet (sîrah). The meaning of a hadîth and its appropriation in these books will be analyzed in the light of the science of hadîth. The paper will examine how different scientists of tafsir, hadîth and so on would understand and interpret the same hadîth...|$|E
40|$|This article {{builds on}} Fairhurst and Connaughton’s {{proposals}} {{for future research}} agendas in leadership studies by critically examining three key themes in the leadership literature: dichotomies, dialectics, and dilemmas. The first section argues that mainstream leadership research frequently relies on <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> which are often multiple, inter-related, and proliferating. Critiques of dichotomization are suggestive of more dialectical forms of analysis and these {{are discussed in the}} second section. Dialectical studies can surface important questions about organizational power relations, paradoxes and contradictions that are typically under-explored within mainstream leadership studies. The third section proposes an additional, future research theme for critical perspectives, namely whether and if so why, how, and with what consequences leaders may engage in discourses of denial regarding the dilemmas and tensions of organizational life. The article concludes by arguing that re-framing leadership dichotomies as multiple, intersecting dialectics can open up fresh lines of enquiry and generate important insights about the complex and situated relations of power and identity that comprise leadership and followership dynamics...|$|R
2500|$|Many, {{although}} not all post-processualists have adhered {{to the theory of}} structuralism in understanding historical societies. Structuralism itself was a theory developed by the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009), and held to the idea that [...] "cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… [...] underlying every culture was a deep structure, or essence, governed by its own laws, that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it." [...] At the centre of his structuralist theory, Lévi-Strauss held that [...] "all human thought was governed by <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies,</b> or bilateral oppositions, such as culture/nature, male/female, day/night, and life/death. He believed that the principle of oppositions was a universal characteristic inherent in the human brain, but that each culture was based on a unique selection of oppositions". This structuralist approach was first taken from anthropology and applied into forms of archaeology by the French archaeologist André Leroi-Gourhan (1911–1986), who used it to interpret prehistoric symbols in his 1964 work, Les Religions de Préhistoire.|$|R
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between law and development in the post-colonial era? Are particular types of legal institutions associated with particular modes of economic organization or trajectories of economic development? Is {{the relationship}} between law and development causal, in the sense that specific legal reforms cause specific development outcomes? These questions are not of merely academic interest. The answers have major implications for policy-makers. In this essay we trace major currents in the history of ideas about these topics, ranging from Max Weber and his successors to proponents of the “right to development. ” We then identify key limitations in the intellectual frameworks that have been dominant through the turn of the twenty-first century. Those limitations include: failure to draw upon the experience of countries in the global South; misplaced reliance upon problematic <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> such as Kevin E. Davis and Mariana Mota Prado Law, Regulation, and Development Chapter 12 Page 2 legal/non-legal, public/private, common law/civil law, and domestic/international; and failure to acknowledge the complexity and mutability of legal institutions. We conclude by examining emerging approaches that promise to overcome some of these limitations...|$|R
40|$|Propremiar or pro-president? On the {{distinction}} between parliamentarism, presitentialism and semi-presidentialism. From comparative research on the constitutional development in Central and Eastern Europe and also from the longstanding debate on whether parliamentarism or presidentialism best facilitates democracy, {{it is apparent that}} there has been and continues to be, a certain degree of confusion concerning the concepts of semi-presidentialism and presidentialism. Different scholars mean different things by the terms and therefore classify countries differently. In this article I argue that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between pro-premi&# 228;r (premier-presidentialism) and pro-president systems (presidentparliamentary systems) provide the best solution to several of the problems related to categorising constitutional types, most importantly perhaps to the presidential power dilemma.

40|$|Addressing {{conceptual}} and empirical lacunae in existing work on train station (area) development (TSAD), this paper seeks to systematically bring into conversation re- search on TSAD with literature on neoliberal urbanization.

I argue that this <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> is problematic. Con- temporary TSAD is overwhelmingly driven by the logics of neoliberalization: political ac- tors use sustainability discourses to create place-based competitive advantages so as to attract business and capital by enhancing network connectivity and revalorizing central urban space. Using the mega-project “Stuttgart 21 ” in Germany {{as a case study}} I demon- strate that it is essentially designed to secure nodal functions of Stuttgart Central Station (enhance network connectivity) and upgrade the station and adjacent area (revalorize the urban core) —whereas questions of sustainability play a subordinated role at best...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{business}} environment is characterised by constant economic upheaval and incessant technological {{changes and the}} pace of change has accelerated with the emergence of the Internet. Consequently the management of technological change has become a major challenge for almost all organisations. Increasingly researchers have refocused their attention from planned models of change management to understanding the emergent nature of change. It is now widely acknowledged that one of the major obstacles to managing change is organisational culture. Since cultural concepts have their origins in anthropology, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the contribution which anthropology can make in the study of organisational culture and, by implication, the management of technological change. This paper recognises some of the inherent weaknesses with existing cultural models and approaches within the literature; most studies assume that culture is static over time; that culture is homogenous (disregarding cultural pluralism) and there is a tendency to represent culture in terms of <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies.</b> In this paper, a theoretical framework originating from anthropology (grid and group cultural theory) is put forward as a more coherent and interpretive research framework for examining organisational culture and the management of technological change...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{supports}} Merleau-Ponty's {{view that}} only a revisioning of our ontology can get us beyond those <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> that prevent us from accounting {{for the presence of}} phenomenal experience in the world. It takes a phenomenological approach to questions concerning the localization, phenomenality, content and efficacy of consciousness when considered in its primary perceptual relation to the world. In examining the reductive functionalism of Dennett and the naturalistic dualism of Chalmers it argues that the eliminative or epiphenomenalist consequences of their approaches can be avoided when phenomenal experience, rather than being reduced or tied to the functional specificity of neural events, is understood as coinciding with the motile contours of our embodiment. Embodied phenomenality is understood to be constituted not only by conscious perceptual presence but by its merging with the presence of a past in somatic phenomenality. This merging marks to a greater degree the individuality of lived experience. A central supporting theme throughout is the self-reflexive quality of embodiment. This reflexivity is taken in its functional lineaments as the body's sensitivity to its own movements and then in the ontologically more fundamental sense in which Merleau-Ponty explores the inflection through which we experience embodiment in its active and passive modes. This reflexivity supports a view that perceptual experience brings us into contact with the things themselves and that a phenomenal presence to the world has causal efficacy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore {{socially}} shared ideas about mental illness in everyday contexts. Drawing on social representation theory, organizations for users {{of mental health services}} and self-help groups are regarded as communities where social knowledge is constructed that makes intersubjective understanding of illness experiences possible. In order to investigate such knowledge as a resource in joint construction of meaning, a theoretical model is introduced where a distinction is made between a discursive level of situated ‘representational work’ and an underlying level of sociocultural resources. A focus group study was carried out with 27 participants who label their health problems as anxiety, depression or bipolar disorder, and were members of service user organizations. The focus group conversations were analysed with regard to thematic, interactional and discursive features to answer the questions: 1) how is mental illness represented, 2) how is the mentally ill person represented, and 3) how are others’ views on mental illness represented. The results show how mental illness is represented as a complex phenomenon that is contextualised to a number of frames of reference. Further, the analysis identified different types of resources that are utilized in representational work: local knowledge of the communities, medical concepts, different explanatory models, narrative structures, metaphors and <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies.</b> It also revealed dialogical properties of the representational work that have rhetorical functions for self-presentation as a team performance. The discussion suggests that widely shared resources are put to use in group- and situation-specific representational projects, and that representations that are produced in group discourse can be characterised as ‘polemical social representations’ that respond to a double stigma of mental illness in everyday life where mental illness is regarded as a sign of ‘weakness’ as well as ‘otherness’...|$|R

Such confrontational character disappeared in the 80 ’s and 90 ’s due to three factors: authoritarian regimes, neoliberalism, and the left’s ambiguous attitude towards its participation in the political democratic game and in elections. The current repolitization expresses itself in the left’s revalorization of democracy, its rejection of neoliberal reforms and the anticapitalism {{of some of its}} sectors. On the other side, the ambiguity and complexity of such repolitization expresses itself in the hibridation of leftist politics into a radical, moderate, populist, and ethnic left, which characterizes some of the region’s current political regimes...|$|E

40|$|Rhetorically, President Johnson {{presented}} his Vietnam intervention {{as part of}} an international war on poverty. ‘The vast Mekong River can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even our own TVA,’ LBJ held during his televised speech at Johns Hopkins University of April 1965, informing the audience of the United States’ benevolent ambition in Vietnam. But the desired effect of LBJ's rhetoric was not solely limited to sanctifying foreign affairs: rather, Johnson’s remarks underlined the universalism embedded in Great Society reform, and extrapolated the Democratic platform into a global context - justifying the president's agenda in both the foreign and domestic contexts. Thus, this thesis argues that LBJ’s early Vietnam rhetoric was intimately linked with his public defense of Great Society reforms, and challenge the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between domestic and foreign affairs by closely scrutinizing several key speeches of the Johnson presidency...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{academic}} field of Geography, {{there is an}} "identity crisis" facing German-language scholarship in Development Studies programs, particularly in terms of disciplinary characteristics, epistemological aims and methodological approaches. This critical self-reflection finds its expression {{in the use of}} terms like "mid-range theory" or "global south", and is manifest as well in repeated calls for a re-formulation of the discipline. Simultaneously, an increasing number of empirical studies in this field are informed by readings of Bourdieu, and are relying on praxeological and corresponding relational perspectives. These studies are transcending the prevalent actor-centered paradigms. Against such a background this paper not only shows how Bourdieu's suggestions can contribute to countering <b>conceptual</b> and discursive <b>dichotomies,</b> regionalized exoticism of cultural contexts and a normative bias (especially in applied research), but also indicates directions for a reformulation or alternative interpretation of the discipline. In order to address these issues, we focus on the key concept of relationality, which is epistemologically central to understanding the "social world"; academically central for a praxeological concept of global social research; and methodologically central in terms of self-reflexivity and a heuristic approach to social categories...|$|R
40|$|Este artigo propõe uma leitura sobre o espaço rural tendo por base a sua oposição/relação com o urbano. Neste sentido, se desde os meados do século XIX até praticamente ao último terço do século XX, a análise sociológica clássica determinou um dualismo {{conceptual}} e analítico entre estes dois mundos, a partir de determinada altura reequacionou-se o significado limitativo da visão binária introduzindo-se, para o efeito, uma concepção mais complexa de cariz eminentemente relacional. Actualmente identificam-se três perspectivas modelares sobre o rural que realçam diferentes evoluções estruturais, mas que não são necessariamente exclusivas e alternativas. Pelo contrário, cada vez mais as realidades do mundo rural se abrem a novos sentidos que não se encaixam necessariamente nas tendências gerais que afectam as zonas mais urbanas.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Objectivity and Impartiality track. The epistemological concept of objectivity and its commonly assumed inherent connotation as ‘neutral’, or as “a view from nowhere” (Th. Nagel) has been pungently contested and unmasked as particularly androcentric by feminist philosophers during the 1980 s and 1990 s, e. g. by N. Hartsock, S. Harding, D. Haraway, L. Code, E. Fox Keller, P. Hill Collins, S. Hekman and many others. For them, the main aim consisted not merely in the modification of certain circumstances of science, but rather in the fundamental change of both scientific and socio-political structures. According to this integral idea of emancipation, feminist theorists strived to invade the core of the issue: One of the most crucial criticisms brought forth by feminist theorists concerned the androcentric bias of philosophy as a whole. This view was {{based on the assumption that}} (western) philosophical thoughts reflect the maleness not only of the actors (e. g. the philosophers) or the social circumstances, but also of philosophy itself as a scientific discipline. They claimed that the traditional notion of objectivity as being neutral because of its abstraction from contextual and concrete aspects is to be doubted and critically reflected. Although ‘objectivity’ stands traditionally for (Weberian) value-neutrality par excellence, it is the very abstraction from concrete, ‘lifeworldly’ dimensions of the human existence which conceals the in fact double-valued dualisms within the philosophical thinking. These dualisms are characterized by a hierarchical gender-connotation, within which the allegedly feminine part of the dualism is seen as inferior (e. g. form versus matter, transcendence versus immanence, activity versus passivity, culture versus nature, rationality versus emotionality). Feminists criticized therefore the philosophical ideal of objectivity as being a ‘phallogocentric’ (J. Derrida) system of representation and value. It seems, however, that the request to reflect the term ’objectivity’ concerning its gender-related implications has weakened in the course of the increasing institutionalization of gender topics within the realm of academic research, especially in the context of the paradigmatic shift from ‘women’/’feminist’ studies to ‘gender’/’intersectionality’ studies. Evidently, the feminists’ politically agonistic tendency has faded away, the close connection between politics and theory broke during the paradigm shift as put forward by deconstructivist and postmodern approaches. After an incipient enthusiasm over a possible resort from the simple man-woman-enmity, one can increasingly observe that the category gender looses its former subversive analytic power – both in epistemological and socio-cultural perspective. There is one central problem I would like to discuss in my paper: Obviously, feminist epistemology particularly shows the insufficiency of refusing the scientific legitimation of gender hierarchies (e. g. the androcentric concept of objectivity) in order to initiate emancipatory processes. In my paper, I hold that there is a connection between the loss of emancipatory impulse in political/socio-cultural terms on the one hand and the decrease of the exploration of the underlying (e. g. androcentric) structure of the concept of objectivity on the other. As long as ‘objectivity’ will be considered as a value-neutral warrantor for non-sexist (non-racist etc.) science, an emancipatory practice (both in science and society) will be impeded. In this context, it is the very dualistic structure of thinking itself, which is to be reflected again with regard to a revisited concept of objectivity. Even for critical scientists, it seems impossible to think one part of a conceptual couple without its counterpart. Therefore, it appears to be impossible not to think in dualistic terms, because couples are logically intertwined with each other. This structural and categorical condition of our thinking has far-reaching consequences in regard to the evaluation of binarity, since the difference between the two parts of a binary couple is not conceived as a simple dissimilarity or even a contrast, but as a contradiction (e. g. objectivity vs. subjectivity). Moreover, we have internalized the gender connotations of the following pairs of polarized opposites: mind - body, intellect - emotion, rationality - irrationality, autonomy - dependence, power - weakness, courage - modesty, publicity - domesticity, culture - nature (c. f. Aristotle’s category theory). The critical-epistemological question is here, whether dichotomies need necessarily be conceived as hierarchical. In other words, is there any alternative with regard to binarity? My thesis in the paper is therefore, that a stricter methodological differentiation between an analysis concerning the phenomenological gender distinction on the one hand and an analysis on the basis of the logical/conceptual character of the gender distinction on the other is required in philosophy and theory of science. This differentiation could entail a more detailed qualification of the epistemological spectrum and its inherent values. (The gender-dichotomy serves here as the prime example for other potential hierarchical dichotomies which might bear insights for studies in the field of intersectionality.) Philosophical research could be committed to clarify, whether conceptions really have to be viewed through ‚polarizing glasses‘. The assessment of possible ways out of the hierarchical dichotomic raster could be settled thoroughly in the context of subversive infiltration of established norms and values. This kind of request would not entail a great revolution at first instance. However, revisiting the conception of “situated knowledges” (D. Haraway) may offer a theoretical grasp on genderness without any androcentric or other lopsided traps. For even feminists themselves are not immune to ideology! For Haraway, the possibility to meet the constraints of knowledge consists not in the ‘view from nowhere’, but rather in marked positions and perspectives. Haraway compasses the claim of cognition not to be disposed to arbitrariness, but to be applied constructively in the persuit of knowledge. A (self) critical reflection of <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> could make problematic gender connotations and values transparent instead of reproducing them. A pluralistic scope on research items could foil existing dualistic-hierarchical patterns of thinking by multiple constructive, subversive and interactive infiltrations. This need by no means result in a total destruction of values. The accretion of diverse new criteria can be understood as a utopian experiment with open outcome. The aim is, at least, to liberate concepts from hierarchical binarity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{transitional}} justice discourse and practice {{suffer from a}} limited conception of memory which reduces the latter to the sphere {{of the mind and}} neglects its attachment to the bodily aspects of human existence.

Contrary to the assertions of this tradition, memory is not "located" in mind, but always incorporated.

It then goes on to analyze the operations consisting in reformulating a certain set of norms, singling out the “founding” elements of a normative system, highlighting the formal and axiological characteristics, and suggesting, if necessary, the expulsion, from the normative set, of the norms that do not allow this set to have a genuinely systematic nature. Then, the paper carefully examines, {{in the light of the}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> first/second interpretation, the systematizing tools employed by jurists in order to create, avoid, or ascertain systematic defects of the law, such as normative gaps and inconsistencies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to examine some pre-school teacher's and parent's {{perceptions}} about communication within the pre-school context and how this {{can be described in}} terms of <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy.</b> The empirical investigation consists of a qualitative study, where data have been collected by interviewing two focus groups and one single parent.

The study also considers the conception of the intermediate domain as an arena for communication between parents and pre-school teachers, and further more the conception of stereotyping in social and cultural contexts. In order to explore these processes I have used the qualitative method of interpretation; Hermeneutic, also with a narrative approach to the analysis. The results and the analysis of the data show that the interviewed parent and pre-school teachers have a poor sense of knowing how much influence to give to each other. The parents were not satisfied with the level of open communication and how the pre-school teachers share information of the activities...|$|E
40|$|This project {{researches}} {{the issue}} of visual analysis {{in the work of}} Aloïs Riegl, Heinrich Wölfflin and Wilhelm Worringer. This overview is organized on two panels: a) an implementation of the conceptual frame to be developed and b) a formulation of the subject and goals of the projectImplementation of the conceptual framea) Riegls art theory revisited:Riegls art theory unfolds on two panels: a/ it is a project for a philosophy of art and culture and b/ a system of visual analysis. The first panel: his art theory examines the relation between artefacts and the culture from which they emerge. Here culture refers generically to the active human imprint in shaping the passive nature as the implementation of specifically human values (aesthetic, ethic, economical, religious, etc). Culture is thus approached in opposition to nature. While both man and nature exercise a creative function, according toRiegl man is in a constant creative contest with nature (Wettschaffen mit der Natur). Each artefact is perceived in its cultural density, i. e. it is the relief whose cultural background determines its form. Plastic arts are related to the crystallization of energies and tensions that cultures promote. This is the context for his concept of Kunstwollen. The relation between man and the exterior world materializes itself in every age in a certain specific form that delineates the Kunstwollen of the age. Kunst in Kunstwollen has to be read as Plastic (or Artefact) and Wollen as volition (anonymous), not will (as a personal act). The term designates an impersonal drive materializing itself in different objects. Similar aesthetic characteristics (that visual analysis designates) appear on all plastic creations of an age. Each age has its own Kunstwollen, hence art history known no decline. This implies a contextualization of the judgment of taste. Misinterpretations of artistic form happen when one evaluates a work accordingto standards of taste belonging to another art historical period. His critique is double: firstly, one has to contextualize an artwork within the Kunstwollen it belongs to and, secondly, distinguish it from the judgment of taste we apply to it. The latter is singular and often based on a strict set of attributes that make an object beautiful or ugly. The former is a visual analysis that has to extract the stylistic ideals of the age it represents. Riegl: Modern taste cannot positively conceive Kunstwollen directed towards ugliness and non-animation and the aim of the fine arts is not completely exhausted with beauty and animation (Spätrömische Kunstindustrie, 11) Each age has its own art, or better said, its own specific relation to the world. Corollary to this statement: each artistic form is brought into a closer relation to a broader context. Late Roman Kunstwollen accepts the ugly (shapeless) because it sees it as an interval of beauty, just like evil is privation of the good. This forms the sketch of a philosophy of art and culture where cultural products point to each other, where the density of plastic art and the written discourse, the ethics and the poetics of an age are materialization of a common Kunstwollen. Needless to say, this type of analysis is even more required in our contemporary heterogeneous culture. Can we still speak of a common Kunstwollen that arts nowadays materialize? According to Riegl, in modernity visual arts develop towards increasing subjectivity. Are we still part of this dimension? Is subjectivity (of vision and presentation[1]) still really an issue for current visual arts? Does not Riegls system of visual analysis that is diachronic have to be confronted with a synchronic approach? In other words, is there even a question of development in arts or this system of dichotomies that Riegl and Wölfflin create has to be implemented synchronically, in the individual work? The second panel refers to visual analysis as the history of the line. Art theorys status is that of a science analyzing images through a conceptual apparatus. This visual grammar delineates stylistic characteristic and refers them to the broader historical context in which they appear. Does it require a Nahsehen or a Fernsehen, is it haptic or rather optic[2]? What is the relation between the depicted figure(s) and the depiction of space?And, within a larger philosophical interpretation: what is the relation between the formal characteristic and the Weltanschauung to which the image belongs? For Riegl, each historical period develops a different formal approach in expressing itself through visual means (figurative presentations, ornament, use objects, etc) and visual analysis deals with the how (and not with the what) of presentations. It the possibilitiesthat appear in the correlation of these basic visual elements: line and colour, plane and space. In this sense Riegl introduces a visual semiotic that is worth considering. Each image belongs to a certain artistic age and each Kunstwollen recreates time and again a new equation based on a few elements: line and colour on the plane or in space. This line is sometimes tactic, delineating a self-enclosed object, focusing on its material unity, suppressing space (Egyptian art), sometimes it is optical, colouristic, subjective, invitingspace relations between objects (modern art). According to Riegl, the delineation of space marks the evolution of art: its presentation moves between the close space of the Renaissance and the modern, infinite space. In our interpretation, Riegls and Wölfflins apparatus aims at an approach of form as the unfolding of the line on the plane and in space. Their concepts account for the history of this line, tactic or optic, objective and moving towards an increased subjectivity. In this interpretation the line is the central term in modern art theory; it is the notion in reference to which all transformations are approached. But is the line as material circumference of the correlate (Umriß) still an issue for current arts? The subject and goal of research: visual grammar The bulk of the literature on the aforementioned theoreticians accounts mainly for their art historical input. On one side, our interpretation concentrates on the conceptual apparatus they introduce and stresses its critical value for visual analysis. Their <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomies</b> prove a valuable tool for this scope. Riegl, Wölfflin and Worringer establish a pre-structuralist grammar of visual arts (Riegl writes 10 years before Saussure). They propose a style analysis that for long has been undermined in aesthetics and counterbalanced in art theory by the iconographical approach. A systematic reading of this visual grammar forms the first chapter of the project. On the other side, another chapter interprets Riegls art theory as a philosophy of art and culture. These are the two aims to be reached in a systematic (rather than art historical) analysis of their work. These two sections form {{the first part of the}} project. A second part discusses the 20 th century interpretations of these art theories (Henri Maldiney, Deleuze). While visual analysis functions for the aforementioned art theoreticians as a study of form in terms of dichotomies, their philosophical interpretation employs their concepts to approach form as an intensity that questions figurative representation. Both share the idea that art is to be studied for its form. Riegl (Historische Grammatik der Bildende Künste, 1897 - 1899) and Wölfflin (Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe, 1915) develop a structural grammar of visual arts to account for the change of form in art history. This grammar works on the basis of a series of dichotomies. In Riegl these are: abstract organic, tactic  optic, close view  distant view, Wille  Empfindung. In Wölfflin: classic  baroque, dermalerische  der zeichnische, plane  recession, closed  open form. These are stylistic polarities across which artistic form develops. They all relate to the unfolding of the line throughout the history of arts and its relation to space. Does that mean that this apparatus is dated when it comes to non-figurative (abstract) arts? Or are the latter the very materialization of these dichotomies?Deleuze is on the other hand interested in the intensities that art uses to challenge the stability of figurative artistic expression. In his interpretation (in the line of Maldiney), form is an issue of the intensity of a sensation, of an energy that (de) stabilizes presentation. In a last step, the following question is raised:taking in consideration the complete openness of form in current artistic practice, the wide-range of technique that it incorporates and its divorce from established forms (painting, sculpture), what kind of grammar can still approach it?status: publishe...|$|R

Specifically, section 45 (1) outlines the foundational concept of a “preferential share,” which entitles the surviving spouse to a prescribed financial interest in the estate which is prioritized above all other heirs. The concept of a preferential share stands in sharp contrast with historical English common law methods of devolving intestate estates in which legal entitlements were heavily influenced by an individual’s gender and marital status. In light of the historical influence of gender and marital status on intestacy legislation, this paper investigates the origins {{and development of the}} preferential share provision. This paper uses an analytical framework emphasizing the historically gendered experiences of widows and widowers, and how their gender informed the nature of their legal interests under intestacy. In addition, this essay frames its analysis within historical commentary that demonstrates a sharp <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between the “good wife and deserving widow” or the “bad wife and undeserving widow,” and how such categorization impacted perceptions of what a fair and reasonable devolution entailed...|$|E
40|$|Conceptually re-defining {{the role}} of a 100 -year-old {{waterfront}} brick and timber warehouse structure, it is turned inside-out : interior becomes path. Programmatic functions imitate the physical characteristics of a <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> set in motion by the creation of two sides to the 'path'. Program ranges from flexible and transitional to static and massive, and is laid out laterally along the proposed line. Specific program elements become, relatively, physical archive and digital exhibition space. Denying the over-preserved role of distinct and bound artifact, the old structure attempts animation. The structural patterns of the original warehouse form the armature (interior grid) against which differences are registered. There is no longer bounding geometry but an interplay of landscape and transitional spaces - this is not a 'marker' or symbolic monument but a reconciliation between monumental artifact, material memory, and pattern via path. Traditionally static boundaries are re-interpreted as inverted and fluctuating zones that provide for new forms of spatial, programmatic, and aesthetic engagement. by Sarah Rundquist Reeves.

Highlighted are concerns with the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> that is the foundation of the analysis, how aggression was conceptualized and defined, and the methodological problems in the studies included in the database that were not neutralized by the meta-analysis. These include inadequate measurement of contextual factors and injury outcomes, scaling issues, and sampling concerns. The authors question the degree to which the field is advanced by this meta-analysis when the results are placed in the context of these limitations. Following American Association for the Advancement of Science directives (I. Lerch, 1999), the authors believe that inadequate attention was paid to the policy implications of the'conclusions raising the potential to undermine societal efforts to eradicate violence against women. Archer's work (2000) is a meta-analysis of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS; Straus, 1979) that provides a summary of what has been learned from applications of this instrument, especially with adolescents and young adults in dating rather than long-term relationships. He concluded that more women than men self-repor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Along with Spain and United Kingdom, Italy has {{suffered}} a terrible period of political violence between 1970 and 1982 with hundreds of killings. In this paper I analyse the origins of Luigi FERRAJOLI’s theory of legal guarantee and his criticisms to Italian legislation against terrorism of that time. Therefore, I shed light on three different understanding of such a theory and I offer a review of that legislation that he labelled as «the subsystem of exception ». Moreover I will apply this conception of «special» criminal law to two famous trials against militants {{of a group of}} the extreme left. According to FERRAJOLI, these trials have been an instance of the paradigm of political judgements against internal enemies, in which blatant violations of the ideal of fairness and equal protection under law have occurred. Finally I will present some critical remarks about FERRAJOLI’s thesis on the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> between emergency legislation and the Rule of law. I will argue that this dichotomy is useful as a tool for criticising legalistic ideologies of criminal law, but it lies on a misleading premise: that there are clear borders between emergency and ordinary criminal policies, but often, this is not the case...|$|E
40|$|Women’s {{participation}} in public administration processes {{depends on the}} level of descriptive and substantive representation of women in polity and policy processes. Descriptive representation refers to the proportional representation of women in a profession, organization and/or sector (Lovenduski, 2005). The substantive representation of women involves the representation of women’s interests in decision making and policy processes based on the principle that it is only women who could represent their own interests (see Mackay, 2004; Lovenduski, 2005). This <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of representation raises the argument that without sufficient levels of descriptive representation of women their substantive representation is limited. This argument is consistent with Kanter’s (1977) critical mass theory. Within a public administration context the lack of the descriptive representation of women at senior or leadership echelons of the public service limits women’s ability to impact upon decisions and policy processes, and consequently limits the substantive representation of women in policy. The paper explores gendered dilemmas in United Kingdom (UK) public administration by presenting secondary data which reveals the under-representation of women in leadership positions in various sectors of the public service and the existence of horizontal and vertical gender segregation. The paper argues that gender segregation and in particular the under-representation of women in leadership have implications for UK public administration in the formulation and implementation of policies. ...|$|E
40|$|Neuromodulation is a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature of}} neural systems, allowing flexible, context specific control over network dynamics. Neuromodulation was first described in invertebrate motor systems and early work established a basic dichotomy for neuromodulation as having either an intrinsic origin (i. e., neurons that participate in network coding) or an extrinsic origin (i. e., neurons from independent networks). In this <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy,</b> intrinsic sources of neuromodulation provide a “memory” by adjusting network dynamics based upon previous and ongoing {{activation of the}} network itself, while extrinsic neuromodulators provide the context of ongoing activity of other neural networks. Although this dichotomy has been thoroughly considered in motor systems, it has received far less attention in sensory systems. In this review, we discuss intrinsic and extrinsic modulation {{in the context of}} olfactory processing in invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. We begin by discussing presynaptic modulation of olfactory sensory neurons by local interneurons (LNs) as a mechanism for gain control based on ongoing network activation. We then discuss the cell-class specific effects of serotonergic centrifugal neurons on olfactory processing. Finally, we briefly discuss the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic neuromodulation (metamodulation) as an effective mechanism for exerting global control over olfactory network dynamics. The heterogeneous nature of neuromodulation is a recurring theme throughout this review as the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic modulation are generally non-uniform...|$|E

Some of the famous Hilbert’s problems relate representation theory with fundamental geometric concepts. Starting in the middle 60 ’s of last century, the ‘modern ’ Representation Theory of finite dimensional algebras had a very fast start with three main driving forces: The categorical point of view, represented by Maurice Auslander and his school, leading to the concepts of almost-split sequences, Auslander-Reiten duality, and Auslander-Reiten quivers. The introduction of the concept of quiver representations by Pierre Gabriel, which is now a main tool in the analysis of the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The reformulation of problems from representation theory as matrix problems, associated to the Ukrainian school of A. Roiter lead to classification results in certain representation-infinite situations and the <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of algebras according to their representation type as tame (including representation-finite) or wild.

It is assumed that there is not, per se, a <b>conceptual</b> <b>dichotomy</b> in designing education and training programmes and credentials in a competence-oriented manner to address complex  professional  and scientific  requirements in education and training in a compatible way. The article tries to shift the discussion  from a systemic and institutional focus to a conceptual- and requirement-oriented perspective on qualification design.   Using Germany as an example, it discusses the conceptual intersections of Vocational Education and Training and academic Higher Education  on competence,  and comparatively analyzes competence-oriented instruments for the classification and the transparency of learning outcomes and their application in the education practice of  dual study programmes with vocational reference qualifications. On this basis, the article elucidates identified characteristics of comprehensive professional-scientific competences and relevant requirement areas in education and training. In addition, further  prerequisites for an integrated competence acquisition in education programmes are discussed as well. It is assumed that these characteristics can also be regarded as  important prerequisites for the connectivity of qualifications and permeable pathways  within and between education systems...|$|E
