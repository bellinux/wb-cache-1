25|$|Cotton {{was born}} at Madingley Hall near Cambridge, and was the eldest {{surviving}} son of Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet and Philadelphia Cotton (the daughter of Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley). Cotton's father was an admiral who saw active service during the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars {{and was unable to}} spend much time with his family at Madingley Hall. Cotton was named after his godfather, the Earl of St Vincent (who had taken his title from the Battle of Cape St Vincent). Cotton had an elder brother who had died in infancy, two elder sisters, Philadelphia and Maria, and a younger brother, Charles. In 1812 Cotton's father, who was by then commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet, collapsed and died at Plymouth, and 10-year-old Cotton inherited the baronetcy. Cotton was educated at Westminster School and in 1820 enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford although he didn't graduate. In the summer of 1820 he toured Scotland on horseback with a cousin and a friend; the highlight of the tour was a visit to Fingal's Cave. Cotton's <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> October 1822 was celebrated by three-day's of festivities at Madingley. The following year he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and a captain in the Cambridgeshire Militia.|$|E

Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules."

500|$|Work {{began on}} Bute's <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> 1868 with the {{construction}} of the [...] high Clock Tower. The tower, built in Burges's signature Forest of Dean ashlar stone, formed a suite of bachelor's rooms, comprising a bedroom, a servant's room and the Summer and Winter smoking rooms. Externally, the tower was a re-working of a design Burges had previously used in an unsuccessful competition entry for the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Internally, the rooms were sumptuously decorated with gildings, carvings and cartoons, many allegorical in style, depicting the seasons, myths and fables. In his A History Of The Gothic Revival, written as the tower was being built, Charles Locke Eastlake wrote of Burges's [...] "peculiar talents (and) luxuriant fancy." [...] The Summer Smoking Room rested {{at the top of the}} structure and was [...] two storeys high with an internal balcony that, through an unbroken band of windows, gave views of the Cardiff Docks, the Bristol Channel, and the Glamorgan countryside. The floor had a map of the world in mosaic. The sculpture was created by Thomas Nicholls.|$|E

500|$|Between his <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> 366BC and {{the trials}} {{that took place}} in 364BC, Demosthenes and his guardians {{negotiated}} acrimoniously but were unable to reach an agreement, for neither side was willing to make concessions. At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. According to a story repeated by Plutarch, when Demosthenes was an adolescent, his curiosity was noticed by the orator Callistratus, who was then {{at the height of his}} reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance. According to Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philologist and philosopher, and Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, Demosthenes was a student of Isocrates; according to Cicero, Quintillian and the Roman biographer Hermippus, he was a student of Plato. Lucian, a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and satirist, lists the philosophers Aristotle, Theophrastus and Xenocrates among his teachers. These claims are nowadays disputed. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed Isaeus as his master in rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus's style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself [...] Curtius, a German archaeologist and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to [...] "an intellectual armed alliance".|$|E
500|$|Anne Moody {{mentioned}} the Till case in her autobiography, <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>Age</b> <b>in</b> Mississippi, {{in which she}} states she first learned to hate during the fall of 1955.

Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 novel Your Blues Ain't Like Mine centers on the events of Till's death. Toni Morrison's play Dreaming Emmett (1986), is a feminist look at the roles {{of men and women in}} black society, which she was inspired to write while considering [...] "time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance." [...] Emmylou Harris includes a song called [...] "My Name is Emmett Till" [...] on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's death. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted Open Casket, a controversial work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till's mother of seeing him after his death.|$|E
