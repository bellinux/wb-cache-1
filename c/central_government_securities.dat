40|$|Many {{central banks}} {{around the world}} are faced with the {{challenge}} of implementing their policy goals in the presence of surplus liquidity in domestic banking systems. Surplus liquidity can impair the central bank's ability to control its operational target and impact on its profitability, potentially affecting its ability to operate in an independent manner. Within the range of instruments available, the issuance of central bank securities is one policy option that has been used effectively by a number of central banks. In this handbook we look at the characteristics of central bank securities and how the fit into the broader monetary operations framework of a central bank. We then look at alternative instruments available to a central bank, before considering {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these different options.

40|$|Notwithstanding {{that there}} are good reasons to argue that the power over “general {{regulation}} of trade” cannot serve as a basis for the recognition of a federal authority to regulate the securities market, the Supreme Court of Canada will most probably resort to it as a peg on which to hang the <b>central</b> <b>government’s</b> <b>securities</b> hat. The challenge the high court will the n face will be in establishing limits to the reach of such a power. After underlining the fragile empirical basis of many arguments in favour of a unified federal securities regime, this article describes how the Canadian division of powers has been judicially apprehended in recent years, particularly in commercial and economic matters. It the n discusses how the current understanding of such division of powers constitutes a next to insurmountable obstacle to the preservation of an unassailable provincial sphere of intervention over securities if, indeed, the Supreme Court invokes the federal power over “general regulation of trade” as the basis of a valid federal intervention in that field. Finally, this article examines how a true federal spirit might inspire a less Manichean approach to the regulation of securities. Indeed, if the federal structure of the Canadian state and, paradoxically, the divided nature of our common market, are to be taken seriously into account, the challenge lies in allowing both the <b>central</b> <b>government</b> and the provinces a legitimate and guaranteed space in the regulation of securities...|$|R

By allowing you to commit minor mistakes, the ruling class hides its major crimes. It converts you into its trained henchmen, and makes you fight against the same people whom you wanted to serve.

When asked why, they have derided your capabilities and said that they are aware of how you protected Rajiv Gandhi. While {{it is true that the}} Tamil Nadu police could not save the life of Rajiv Gandhi, it is equally true that the majority of those who died with him were only innocent policemen. Your dedication is unquestionable. But it was later exposed that this Indian intelligence had been careless even after coming to know that there were threats to Rajiv's life... Even if you have been against innocent people all this while, you are one of the pride of Tamil Nadu. At this historical juncture, only if you stand on the side of the people, you can regain the respect that you have lost among the people. Just once try to dedicate yourself to the fellow Tamils. They will carry you in golden plates. The feeling of gratitude among Tamil people is immeasurable. Because somebody spent his own money and built a dam, the Tamils on the Mullai river in Madurai built a temple and name their children after that man. All that you have to do is, when Tamil Nadu is boiling, you should refuse to cooperate with the <b>Central</b> <b>Government</b> officials, and you should reveal to the Tamil people who are the ones working for R.A.W and CBI.

Most of the fiscal rules applied to regional or local levels governments are enshrined in constitution or law, while rules applying to the whole of the general government sector are more frequently based on coalition agreements or political commitments. Similarly, while rules for regional and local governments seem to have relatively strong enforcement mechanisms, rules applying to general and <b>central</b> <b>governments</b> generally don’t envisage ex ante defined actions in case of non-compliance.

40|$|Ghana's {{economic}} program after independence emphasized public investment and spending {{as the road}} to growth, a strategy that led to recurring fiscal deficits and declining growth. Since the 1984 Economic Recovery Program, Ghana's fiscal deficits have declined and the public sector has been rationalized. Average growth rates have become positive. The authors provide two different definitions of the fiscal deficit in Ghana. The first, more conventional approach aggregates components of the public sector, including the <b>central</b> <b>government,</b> the social <b>security</b> and national insurance trust, state-owned enterprises, and the cocoa marketing board. The second way looks at the total financing flows to the public sector. Data on the <b>central</b> <b>government</b> debt are supplemented with data on {{the claims of the}} central bank and banking system against state-owned enterprises and data on public external debt. The authors examine the ways Ghana chose to finance its deficits and how these affected the financial side of the economy. They found that : 1) the fiscal deficit has had only little effect on private consumption; 2) public sector investment in Ghana has mostly substituted for private investment; and 3) the fiscal deficit had a significant negative effect on the external side. The official real exchange rate tended to appreciate, the trade balance worsened, and the black market premium rose.

50|$|After the 1983 riots, the {{government}} worked rapidly {{to expand the}} SLAF inventory, relying largely on sources in Italy, Britain, and the United States. Because of tight budget constraints, the SLAF was compelled to refit a number of non-combat aircraft for military uses in counter-terrorism operations against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorists. From the period 1983 to 1985, the Air Force acquired 11 Bell 212 helicopters, four Bell 412 helicopters, three SIAI Marchetti SF.260s, two Cessna 337s, one Hawker Siddeley HS 748 and two Beechcraft Super King Airs. By 1985, nine more Bell 212s {{were added to the}} fleet, along with four Bell 412s. The 412s along with the SIAI Marchetti SF.260 aircraft advanced the attack capabilities of the SLAF. <b>Central</b> in the <b>government's</b> <b>security</b> efforts were six SIAI Marchetti SF.260TP turboprops which were used for rocket attacks and strafing. Additionally, the air force, with the help of Heli Orient of Singapore, equipped twelve Bell 212 and Bell 412 helicopters to serve as gunships and as transport vehicles for highly successful commando assault operations. The air force had a fleet of approximately eighty aircraft, of which sixty-four were reported to be operational in early 1988.|$|R
