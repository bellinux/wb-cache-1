40|$|ABSTRACT An {{effective}} strategy to prevent renal <b>disease</b> progression in <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> is to early initiate therapy {{in the early}} course of disease when there is still an adequate renal functional reserve. Given the assistances of FE Mg for early screening of disease severity and of appropriate correction of hemodynamic maladjustment with multidrug vasodilators, an effective restoration of renal function is generally achieved in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic nephropathy and {{in a variety of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> with minimal renal impairment...|$|R
40|$|Genetics {{of common}} {{progressive}} renal disease. Familial aggregation of common <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> provides {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate the susceptibility genetic and environmental factors. In the past decade, a wealth of new data has become available concerning the genetic susceptibility leading to numerous nephropathies. Knowledge of the genetic components allows better understanding of initiation and progression of these <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> In addition, one can envision that identification of genetically susceptible individuals might lead to earlier diagnosis and potential reversal of the current epidemic of end-stage renal disease. The goal of the current discussion is to review various issues pertaining to the role of genetic factors in common <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases,</b> as exemplified by two leading causes of end-stage renal diseases worldwide, nephropathy of type 2 diabetes and IgA nephropathy. The genetic and environmental interplay leading to the nephropathies is highlighted...|$|R
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} attitudes and working methods of general {{practitioners}} (GPs) in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods: A questionnaire with questions about primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> in general practice {{was sent to a}} representative sample of 1100 Dutch GPs. The data were analyzed using frequency tables, chi-square and ANOVA. Results: 330 GPs completed and returned the questionnaire. Less than half of the GP’s actively invite patients for preventive measurements. Preventive measures are mainly performed by the GP when a patient asks for it or when patients visit a GP for other complaints. The main reasons for performing preventive tests were a positive family history, obesity and smoking. Most GPs consider detection of these diseases as worthwhile, but detection should particularly focus on the group of patients with the highest risk on these diseases.

5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

40|$|A novel type of {{encephalopathy}} {{associated with}} mushroom Sugihiratake ingestion {{in patients with}} <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> BackgroundThe etiology of encephalopathy in uremic patients is multiple. We recently encountered a novel type of encephalopathy which occurred exclusively in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> after ingestion of a mushroom called Sugihiratake. While the exact etiology of this encephalopathy remained mysterious, we aimed to describe its clinical features. MethodsA total of 32 patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> who had presented with encephalopathy following ingestion of Sugihiratake were enrolled from seven prefectures in Japan., with 24 of the 32 patients undergoing regular hemodialysis. The patient's clinical data were from surveillance by The Japanese Society of Nephrology. ResultsThere was a significant association between Sugihiratake ingestion and the occurrence of encephalopathy in 524 hemodialysis patients questioned for a recent ingestion of this mushroom (P = 0. 0006). The latent asymptomatic period {{before the onset of}} symptoms varied from 1 to 31 days (mean 9. 1 ± 7. 3) days. The patient's symptoms consisted of disturbed consciousness in 30 patients (93. 8 %), convulsions in 25 (78. 1 %), myoclonus in 15 (46. 9 %), dysarthria in ten (31. 3 %), ataxia in eight (25. 0 %), paresis or paralysis in seven (21. 9 %), and skin parasthesia in two patients (6. 3 %). Nine (27. 2 %) patients died, mostly due to respiratory failure. The other patients were either discharged or still in hospitals with various degrees of clinical improvement. ConclusionPatients with <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> are at risk of having serious encephalopathy following Sugihiratake ingestion and must refrain from eating it.

40|$|AbstractChronic <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> – {{arising from}} inborn or {{acquired}} renal disorders – {{are one of}} the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Renal parenchymatous hypertension accompanying bilateral or unilateral <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> is more prevalent than renovascular hypertension. The prevalence and severity of hypertension are influenced by age, weight, type of renal affliction, and depth of renal dysfunction. In multifactorial pathogenesis, sodium retention plays the crucial role together with dysbalance concerning effects of different vasoactive substances; however, unequivocal distinction between volume- and renin-type hypertension is difficult. The treatment of renal hypertension includes appropriate lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, hemoelimination methods and radiological or urological invasive procedures. In <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> with increased albuminuria or proteinuria, ACE inhibitors and AT 1 -blockers are preferred. Combination of several antihypertensives is often required to achieve the target blood pressure. Increased blood pressure represents not only the manifestation of <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> but also an important factor concerning the renal and cardiovascular risk...|$|R

40|$|The renal microvasculature is {{emerging}} as {{a key player in}} acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> Renal microvascular disease involves alterations in endothelial barrier permeability, exaggerated inflammation, impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation involving the nitric oxide system, increased oxidative stress, and loss of angiogenic factors.

25|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (CKD) is {{progressive}} loss in kidney function over {{a period}} of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite.

This disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, pericarditis or renal osteodystrophy (the latter included in the novel term CKD-MBD). CKD is a long-term form of kidney disease; thus, it is differentiated from acute kidney disease (acute kidney injury) in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months. CKD is an internationally recognized public health problem affecting 5–10% of the world population.|$|E
