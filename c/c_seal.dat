50|$|The Idea of {{establishing}} {{an association of}} Public Health was first mooted out at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Calcutta, in 1935. The permission of Government was necessary to create such an association. Most of the health staff then was working under government or municipalities. Hence permission was denied until the Indian Independence. After 1948, Dr. Ganguly and Dr. S. <b>C.</b> <b>Seal</b> revived the movement. The Association was inaugurated on 29 September 1956 by Smt. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, the then Union Health Minister, Government of India. The Public Health personalities responsible {{for the success of}} the association were Dr. B. C. Roy, Chief Minister of West Bengal, Lt. Col. C. K. Lakshmanan, Director of All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Dr. K. C. K. E. Raja, Director General of Health Services, Government of India, Dr. B. C. Dasgupta, Director of Health Services, West Bengal and Dr. T. Lakshminarayanan of Madras. The association has grown over the years and now has a strength of nearly 4,000 members. The body has 22 branches in India. In Chandigarh, IPHA has celebrated World's AIDS day 2014 in Tagore Theatre, where they have invited Snehil Sharma's dance group Adi Shakti Nrityashala and other theater groups for the cultural show.|$|E

40|$|Glasses {{filled with}} ceramic or {{metallic}} powders {{have been developed}} for use as seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC's) as part of the U. S. Department of Energy's Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) Program. The composites of glass (alkaline earth-alumina-borate) and powders ({approx} 20 vol% of yttria-stabilized zirconia or silver) were shown to form seals with SOFC materials at or below 900 C. The type and amount of powder were adjusted to optimize thermal expansion to match the SOFC materials and viscosity. Wetting studies indicated good wetting was achieved on the micro-scale and reaction studies indicated that the degree of reaction between the filled glasses and SOFC materials, including spinel-coated 441 stainless steel, at 750 C is acceptable. A test rig was developed for measuring strengths of seals cycled between room temperature and typical SOFC operating temperatures. Our measurements showed that many of the 410 SS to 410 SS seals, made using silver-filled glass composites, were hermetic at 0. 2 MPa (2 atm.) of pressure and that seals that leaked could be resealed by briefly heating them to 900 <b>C.</b> <b>Seal</b> strength measurements at elevated temperature (up to 950 C), measured using a second apparatus that we developed, indicated that seals maintained 0. 02 MPa (0. 2 atm.) overpressures for 30 min at 750 C with no leakage. Finally, the volatility of the borate component of sealing glasses under SOFC operational conditions was studied using weight loss measurements and found by extrapolation to be less than 5 % for the projected SOFC lifetime...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{oxidation}} resistance property of carbon/carbon composites, the C/C matrix was modified with a borate sol precursor and B 4 C micro-powders by a sol-gel process. The phase compositions, surface and cross-section microstructures of the C/C matrix modified by different B 4 C contents were particularly investigated. Results show that {{the surface of the}} modified composites is covered by a coating composed of B 2 O 3 and B 4 C, meanwhile, the internal micro-holes of the C/C composites are occupied by B 2 O 3 and B 4 C. After oxidation in air at 973 K, the B 2 O 3 glassy phase due to the oxidation of B 4 <b>C</b> <b>seals</b> the cracks and holes and effectively prevents C/C composites from oxidation.

500|$|In the end, the 1968 {{merger with}} the Chicago and North Western (<b>C)</b> <b>sealed</b> the Winston Tunnel's fate. The Great Western's main line through {{northern}} Illinois closely paralleled the North Western's own line, but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas. The steep grades {{of the line}} and the obvious financial burden of the Winston Tunnel also {{played a role in the}} decision to completely abandon the Great Western's trackage in the area. The C operated its last train through the tunnel in 1971. Scrappers pulled up the tracks the following year. Upon abandonment, the C placed chain-link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other trespassers out. [...] A 1973 attempt to turn the right-of-way through Jo Daviess County, including the Winston Tunnel, into a rail trail, failed when ownership of the land reverted to nearby property owners.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the DM- 1 Glider, which had approximately triangular plan form, an aspect ratio of 1. 8 and a 60 degree sweptback leading edge, has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{the determination of the}} separate effects of the following modifications made to the glider on its maximum lift and stability characteristics: (a) installation of sharp leading edges over the inboard semispan of the wing, (b) removal of the vertical fin, (<b>c)</b> <b>sealing</b> of the elevon control-balance slots, (d) installation of redesigned thin vertical surfaces, (e) installation of faired sharp leading edges, and (f) installation of canopy. The maximum lift coefficient of the DM- 1 glider was increased from 0. 61 to 1. 01 by the installation of semispan sharp leading edges, and from 1. 01 to 1. 24 by the removal of the vertical fin and sealing of the elevon control-balance slots. The highest maximum lift coefficient (1. 32) was obtained when the faired sharp leading edges and the thin vertical surfaces were attached to the glider. The original DM- 1 glider was longitudinally stable. The semispan sharp leading edges shifted the neutral point forward approximately 3 percent of the root chord at moderate lift coefficients, and the glider configuration with these sharp leading edges attached was longitudinally unstable, for the assumed center-of-gravity location, at lift coefficients above 0. 73. Sealing the elevon control-balance slots and installing the faired sharp leading edges, the thin vertical surfaces, and the canopy shifted the neutral point forward approximately 8 percent of the root chord...|$|R
