Forty recumbent cows with hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia were alternately allocated to group A or B. Cows of both groups were treated intravenously with 500 ml 40 % <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate,</b> and cows of group B additionally received another 500 ml <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> via slow intravenous infusion and 500 g sodium phosphate administered via an orogastric tube. Thirty-two cows stood within 8 hours after the start of treatment and 8 did not; of the 32 cows that stood, 18 belonged to group A and 14 to group B (90 % of group A vs. 70 % of group B; P = 0. 23). Seven cows relapsed; of these and the 8 that did not respond to initial treatment, 10 stood after two standard intravenous treatments. Downer cow syndrome occurred in 5 cows, 3 of which recovered after aggressive therapy. The overall cure rate did not differ significantly between groups A and B. Twelve (60 %) cows of group A and 14 (70 %) cows of group B were cured after a single treatment and of the remaining 14, 11 were cured after two or more treatments. Two downer cows were euthanized and one other died of heart failure during treatment. Serum calcium concentrations during the first eight hours after the start of treatment were significantly higher in group B than in group A, and oral sodium phosphate caused a significant and lasting increase in inorganic phosphate. More cows of group B than group A were cured after a single treatment (P > 0. 05). These findings, although not statistically significant, are promising and should be verified using a larger number of cows...|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the role of opioidergic processes in the effects of nutrition on the secretion of LH pulses in the mature male sheep. In the first of three experiments, adult Merino rams were acclimatised to a maintenance diet and then allocated to one of three dietary groups (n = 5) : continuation of the maintenance diet (Group M); reduction to half of the maintenance allocation (Group HM); or supplementation of the maintenance diet with lupin grain (Group HD). An initial administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg body weight, i. v.) was followed at 40 -min intervals by three further administrations (1 mg/kg). Blood was sampled every 20 min for 12 h before the initial naloxone administration and then for a further 6 h. LH pulse frequency after naloxone treatment was significantly higher in Group HD than in Group HM (P < 0. 05). The second study tested whether the response to naloxone depended on calcium status. We used 22 adult Merino rams in two consecutive experiments, one in which the rams were fed a maintenance diet, and one in which the rams were fed with the maintenance diet plus 1 kg lupin grain for 5 weeks. In both experiments, rams were allocated to groups that received one of the following treatments: (a) 0. 02 g/kg <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> + 0. 2 mg/kg naloxone hydrochloride (Nal + Ca 2 +; n = 6); (b) 0. 2 mg/kg naloxone hydrochloride (Nal; n = 6); (c) 0. 02 g/kg <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> (Ca 2 +; n = 5); (d) 0. 1 ml/kg NaCl 0. 9 % (Saline; n = 5). All treatments were given as a single i. v. administration daily for 5 days. Blood was sampled every 20 min for 24 h during the acclimatization period (Day 0) and on the last day (Day 5) of treatment. In the first study (under maintenance), none of the treatments affected LH pulse frequency. In the second study (the lupin-supplemented rams), LH pulse frequency was significantly increased (P < 0. 05) by the administration of naloxone + Ca 2 +, naloxone alone and Ca 2 + alone. Overall, rams on a low plane of nutrition showed the smallest response to naloxone, suggesting that an opioidergic mechanism is not involved in the suppressive effect of restricted nutrition on the gonadotrophic axis. Rather, because testosterone secretion was increased on the high plane of nutrition, the LH responses to naloxone are better explained by the effects of testosterone on opioidergic mechanisms. Finally, we failed to observe any interaction between opioids and calcium in the control of LH secretion...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{report the}} {{successful}} recovery of few dairy cattle from botulism {{in response to}} a modified therapeutic strategy. Materials and Methods: Seventy four naturally-occurring clinical cases of bovine botulism encountered during the period of 2012 - 2014 which were confirmed by mouse lethality test became material for this study. Affected animals were made into three groups based on the treatment modifications made during the course of study. Results and Discussion: With the modified therapeutic regimen, 17 animals recovered after 7 - 10 days of treatment. Clinical recovery took 2 - 30 days. Animals which were not given intravenous fluid and calcium recovered uneventfully. Cattle which were already treated with intravenous fluids, <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate,</b> and antibiotics did not recover. They were either died or slaughtered for salvage. Conclusion: In cattle with botulism, administration of Vitamin AD 3 E and activated charcoal aid the clinical recovery. Besides, strictly avoiding anti-clostridial antibiotics, fluid therapy, and calcium therapy may facilitate the clinical recovery. Upon fluid administration, the pulmonary congestion existed in the ailing cattle might have worsened the anoxia. Administration of antibiotics like penicillin, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines further worsen the neuronal paralysis by increasing the availability of botulinum neurotoxin. Cattle in early botulism have fair chances of recovery with the modified therapy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{retrospective}} study describes the clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcome of 461 cattle with caecal dilatation. RESULTS: The general condition and demeanor were abnormal in 93. 1 % of cases, and 32. 1 % {{of the patients}} had colic. Ruminal motility was reduced or absent in 78. 3 % of cattle. In 82. 6 % of cases, swinging and/or percussion auscultation were positive on the right side, and 82. 4 % {{had little or no}} faeces in the rectum. Caecal dilatation could be diagnosed via rectal palpation in 405 (88. 0 %) cattle. There was caudal displacement of the dilated caecum in 291 patients, torsion around the longitudinal axis in 20 and retroflexion in 94. The most important laboratory finding was hypocalcaemia, which occurred in 85. 1 % of cases. Of the 461 cattle, 122 (26. 5 %) initially received conservative therapy (intravenous fluids, neostigmine, <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate)</b> and 329 (71. 4 %) underwent surgical treatment. Ten patients were slaughtered or euthanased after the initial physical examination. Of the 122 cattle that received conservative treatment, 42 did not respond after one to two days of therapy and required surgical treatment. The final number of cattle that were operated was 371 (80. 5 %). Because of a grave prognosis, 24 cases were euthanased or slaughtered intraoperatively. Another 24 cattle did not respond to one or more operations and were euthanased or slaughtered. Of the 461 patients, 403 (87. 4 %) responded to either conservative or surgical treatment and were cured, and 58 were euthanased or slaughtered. CONCLUSIONS: Caecal dilatation can usually be diagnosed based on clinical findings and treated conservatively or surgically. Swinging and percussion auscultation as well as rectal examination are important diagnostic tools.

40|$|Fifteen cows {{with milk}} fever {{were treated with}} 500 ml of 40 % <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> (group A) {{administered}} intravenously. Fifteen other cows with milk fever received the same treatment, supplemented with 500 ml of 10 % sodium phosphate administered intravenously, and 80 g calcium as calcium lactate and 70 g inorganic phosphorus as sodium phosphate administered orally in drinking water. The cows were monitored and blood samples collected for 3 days to measure the concentrations of total and ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium and the activity of creatine kinase. The two {{groups did not differ}} significantly with respect to the course of the disease. In each group 14 cows were cured. A rapid and significant increase in serum calcium concentration from the hypo- to the hypercalcaemic range occurred in both groups within 10 min of the start of treatment, followed by a slow and steady decrease to the hypocalcaemic range. Calcium lactate did not prevent the calcium concentration from returning to the hypocalcaemic range, and the calcium profiles of the two groups did not differ significantly. As expected, treatment had little effect on the concentration of inorganic phosphorus in group A. In group B, treatment caused a rapid increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphorus to a maximum 20 min after the start of treatment. This was followed by a slow decrease in the phosphorus concentration to the normophosphataemic range. Our findings confirmed that combined intravenous and oral administration of sodium phosphate in cows with periparturient paresis attributable to hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia results in a rapid and sustained increase in serum phosphorus, but not in serum calcium concentration. This modified therapy did not improve the success rate of milk fever treatment and further studies are needed to improve treatment of periparturient paresis...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to provide further {{information on the}} ruminal, cardiorespiratory and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPAC) physiological sequelae of hypocalcaemia in dairy calves. The functional picture observed in standing calves experiencing Na 2 EDTA-induced progressive hypocalcaemia showed a biphasic pattern. During the first phase (Ca 2 + varying between 1. 20 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 64 +/- 0. 15 mmol/L, mean +/- SD), the animals became dull and lethargic, shifting their weight from one hind limb to the other, with cool extremities and hypersalivation. Their ventilation was slightly increased but their heart rate, thoracoabdominal pressure, pulmonary mechanics, haemoglobin and temperature remained constant. Conversely, their systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and the amplitude of their ruminal contractions (RCA) were severely decreased. During the second phase (Ca 2 + < 0. 64 +/- 0. 15 mmol/L), there was restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, polycythaemia and, finally, inability to stay upright. It is suggested that the diminished Ca 2 + availability caused smooth-muscle and myocardial dysfunctions which could explain the RCA and SAP changes recorded during the first phase, whereas neural and/or humoral sympathetic discharge probably accounted for the reversal in SAP and heart rate when Ca 2 + was decreased further. Serum cortisol increased regularly and remained significantly correlated with Ca 2 + in each animal. Moreover, regression of delta cortisol/delta Ca 2 + on delta Ca 2 +/delta Na 2 EDTA was significant (p < or = 0. 001). It was concluded that mild asymptomatic hypocalcaemia severely impairs ruminal function, which will progressively worsen the Ca 2 + deficit; that the inability to maintain posture in hypocalcaemia is not due to hypotension; and that the higher the HPAC response to hypocalcaemia, the higher the resistance to its effects. An asymptomatic periparturient cow with barely detectable ruminal activity may merit preventive <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> therapy. Also, the physiological role of hypotension in explaining the clinical picture may be less important than other processes, such as neuromuscular failure. Finally, the present results imply a possible HPAC exhaustion in cows with periparturient paretic hypocalcaemiaPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether oral administration of sodium phosphate in conjunction with intravenous calcium is more efficaceous than intravenous calcium alone for the treatment of parturient paresis. Thirty cows with parturient paresis were examined and treated by the same veterinarian. The cows were divided randomly into two groups of 15 cows each. Cows in group A received 500 ml of a 40 per cent <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> solution containing 15. 65 g calcium gluconate and borogluconate, with a supplement of 6 per cent magnesium hypophosphite (9. 85 g magnesium hypophosphite) intravenously over a period of approximately 15 min. Cows in group B received the same treatment as well as 350 g of monobasic sodium phosphate (70 g inorganic phosphate, NaH 2 PO 4 2 H 2 O, Streuli) dissolved in 0. 5 litres of distilled water orally via a stomach tube. After treatment, the heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, superficial body temperature, rumen motility, appetite and defecation of the cows were monitored every hour for eight h. The cows' attempts to rise and their ability to stand were also noted. Initially, the results of clinical examination and serum electrolyte analyses did not differ between the two groups of cows. Within one hour of treatment, stupor was not observed in any of the cows. The general demeanour after treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. In both groups, the average rectal temperature increased within two hours of the initiation of treatment, from 38. 0 +/- 0. 95 degrees C to 38. 5 +/- 0. 40 degrees C. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate between the groups. Of the 30 cows, 22 (73. 3 per cent) stood within eight hours of treatment (10 cows from group A and 12 cows from group B). The type of treatment did not affect the time required to stand: cows in group A stood within 47. 3 +/- 44 minutes and cows in group B stood within 24. 2 +/- 32 minutes after the start of treatment. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that oral treatment with 350 g of sodium phosphate together with intravenous infusion of calcium in cows with parturient paresis results in an improved outcome, even though all the cows had hypophosphataemia as well as hypocalcaemia...|$|E
40|$|Hypomagnesemia. A {{metabolic}} imbalance underestimated in dairy herds in Costa Rica. A review. Hypomagnesemia is a {{metabolic disorder}} {{characterized by a}} reduction in blood and cerebrospinal fluids magnesium levels, affecting the central nervous system. Hypomagnesemic tetany mainly affects old and high producing cows and incidence can reach epidemic proportions. When magnesium levels drop between 1. 8 to 1. 1 mgl 100 ml, the metabolic imbalance is considered moderate and the animal reduces feed intake, is nervous and milk fat synthesis and total milk production are reduced. This condition predisposes to milk fever. If magnesium levels fall below 1. 1 mg/ 100 ml neuromuscular function is affected and the animals show tetanic spams of the muscules and usually lay with the head arched back and the legs paddling. The eyelids flutter and there is nystagmus. If animals are not treated immediately mortality is high. The most effective treatment for the hypomagnesemic cow is the 500 ml injection of a solution of <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> (8 to 10 g calcium) and magnesium borogluconate (1. 5 to 4 g of magnesium). Injections should be administered slow and intravenously. To prevent relapses is recommended the subcutaneous injection of L 00 to 200 ml of a 20 to 50 % magnesium sulfate solution. Since no hormonal mechanisms {{are in charge of}} keeping the magnesium homeostasis in the organism, the mineral should be always supplied in the diet of the animals {{in order to maintain the}} normal plasma levels (1. 8 to 2. 4 mg/ 1 OO ml). Magnesium level in the dairy cattle diet should be 0. 25 % of dry matter when the K:(Ca+Mg) ratio is below 2. 2. If this relationship is higher the level of the element should be increased to 0. 30 %. Magnesium absorption in the rumen epithelium depends on the concentration of magnesium in solution in the rumen fluid and the activity of the magnesium transport mechanism, which is related to sodium. Among factors affecting the concentration of magnesium in solution in the rumen fluid are the amount of this mineral in the diet, rumen pH and the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in the forages. Magnesium transport across the rumen epithelium is affected by the sodium: potassium ratio in the diet, as well as the ingestion of lush high moisture pastures, which increases the rate of passage of feed from the rumen, reducing the absorption of magnesium. Most of the forages in the Humid Tropics and the Highlands of Costa Rica have conditions that predispose cows to suffer hypomagnemia. Moreover, most of the soils in these areas ale magnesium deficient (less than 1 mgl 100 ml of soil). In those dairy herds where this imbalance is a problem, it is recommended to increase magnesium intake through drinkin...|$|E
