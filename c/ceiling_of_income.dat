40|$|AbstractGiven a divisor A of a {{function}} field, {{there is a}} unique divisor of minimum degree that defines the same vector space of rational functions as A {{and there is a}} unique divisor of maximum degree that defines the same vector space of rational differentials as A. These divisors are called the floor and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> A. A method is given for finding both the floor and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> a divisor. The floor and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> a divisor give new bounds for the minimum distance of algebraic geometry codes. The floor and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> a divisor supported by collinear places of the Hermitian function field are determined. Finally, we find the exact code parameters for a large class of algebraic geometry codes constructed from the Hermitian function field...|$|R

40|$|We {{find the}} optimal target values for fiscal rules and measure their {{aggregate}} effects using {{a model of}} sovereign default. We calibrate the model to an economy that pays a significant sovereign default premium when {{the government is not}} constrained by fiscal rules. For different levels of the default premium, we find that a government with a debt of 38 percent <b>of</b> trend <b>income</b> (typical in the case studied here) chooses to commit to a debt <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 30 percent <b>of</b> trend <b>income</b> that starts being enforced four years after its announcement. This rule generates expectations of lower future indebtedness, and thus it allows the government to borrow at interest rates significantly lower than the ones it pays without a rule. We also study the case in which the government conducts a voluntary debt restructuring to capture the capital gains from the increase in its debt market value implied by the existence of a fiscal rule. In this case, the government is found to choose instead a debt <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 25 percent <b>of</b> trend <b>income</b> that starts being enforced less than two years after its announcement. After the imposition <b>of</b> the debt <b>ceiling,</b> lower debt levels allow the government to implement a less procyclical fiscal policy that reduces consumption volatility. However, the government prefers a procyclical debt ceiling that implies a larger reduction of the default probability at the expense of a higher consumption volatility...|$|R
