500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|E
50|$|All FE and FT engines have a bore spacing (distance between {{cylinder}} centers) of 4.630 in, and a {{deck height}} (distance from crank center to top of block) of 10.170 in.

50|$|The Algol was a {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} radial engine, with nine cylinders {{in a single}} row. The crankcase was a barrel-shaped aluminium alloy casting, with an internal integral diaphragm which held the front <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing.</b> Forward of the diaphragm there was an integrally cast cam-gear case for the double track cam-ring. The reduction gear was housed under a domed casing attached {{to the front of}} the crankcase.|$|E

At {{the beginning of}} this master’s thesis, basic overview of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> design and materials that are used for sliding coatings is given. Then suitable manufacturing technologies for different materials of coatings are described. After describing basic principles of coating technologies and how <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> work, main components used for design of the spraying machine are introduced. Three prototypes of the machine are created in virtual environment to verify ergonomics of control and to fulfill safety requirements. In main part of the thesis, description of all parts and subassemblies, such as frame, spraying circuit, pneumatic regulators and safety features is given. Also functions of all parts of the machine are explained in details. Moreover system for handling and manipulation with coated bearings during all necessary technological operations was created. In addition functionality of the machine was verified and checked by spraying of polymer coating on testing samples and <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R
50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the cylinder head is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the cylinder head is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> caps.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{is made of}} {{grey cast}} iron, both the crankshaft and the camshaft are supported in five bearings. The center bearing of the crankshaft is an axial bearing. The camshaft is driven by a connecting gear, which also drives the injection pump. The housing of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> contains the housing of the oil pump. Some versions of the engine are equipped with a speedometer gear assembly, which {{is connected to the}} injection pump drive.|$|E
50|$|The 4G63 engines {{found in}} 1990-1994 models have a 60 mm {{throttle}} body {{compared to the}} 1995-1999 MY's 52 mm. The intake ports {{on the head and}} runners of the intake manifold are also larger on the 1G. They also have larger <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> journals to allow better lubrication. Because they look similar, {{it is important to note}} that the 1990-1994 cylinder head is more on the side of high air volume, while the 1995-1999 cylinder head is more on the side of high air velocity.|$|E
25|$|Simplicity: Radials have {{shorter and}} stiffer crankshafts, a single bank radial needing only two <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> {{as opposed to}} the seven {{required}} for a liquid-cooled six-cylinder inline engine of similar stiffness.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{versions}} of the M78 had the same bore and stroke as the straight-4 engine from the BMW 3/20. Later on, the bore spacing was increased to allow {{for an increase in}} bore and to provide for more <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional <b>crankshaft</b> with two <b>bearings.</b> However, the profit from sales {{was not enough to}} cover the warranty expenses, and, by the end of 1950, Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1.25millionDeutschmark.|$|R
50|$|At Le Mans {{he raced}} for Talbot in four races, {{finishing}} fourth in 1951. In 1952, driving single-handedly, his car suffered an engine {{failure in the}} last hour of the race with a four lap lead. The failure was due to a bolt in the central <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> having come loose many hours earlier in the race, although many fans placed the blame on driver fatigue. Levegh had refused to let his co-driver take over because he felt only he could nurse the car home. In 1953 he came in eighth, and in 1954 he was involved in an accident in the seventh hour of racing.|$|E
50|$|The {{oil pump}} in the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> housing creates oil {{pressure}} and pumps the {{oil from the}} oil sump through the engine. In the main oil flow a sieve filter cleans the oil, the secondary oil flow has a centrifugal oil filter. Some engine variants don't have a sieve filter but a paper filter instead. The lubrication of the injection pump and the air compressor may either {{be attached to the}} main oil flow or be attached to a separate oil lubrication system. For oil cooling the engine has an involute heat exchanger or a shell and tube heat exchanger. Shell and tube heat exchangers are found mostly in engines for the IFA W50.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{molybdenum}} disulfide containing additives to lubricating oils are claimed to reduce friction, bond to metal, or have anti-wear properties. MoS2 particles can be shear-welded on steel surface and some engine components were even treated with MoS2 layer during manufacture, namely liners in engines. (Trabant for example). They {{were used in}} World War II in flight engines and became commercial after World War II until the 1990s. They were commercialized in the 1970s (ELF ANTAR Molygraphite) and are today still available (Liqui Moly MoS2 10 W-40, www.liqui-moly.de). Main disadvantage of {{molybdenum disulfide}} is anthracite black color, so oil treated with {{it is hard to}} distinguish from a soot filled engine oil with metal shavings from spun <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} bearing technology led {{to the adoption of}} roller bearings, rather than whitemetal. Although they might be considered esoteric today, ball and roller <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> were already in use in the 1920s for such mundane engines as the Austin 7.|$|R
5000|$|The lower powered {{engines in}} the {{commercial}} [...] "Pro" [...] series had a lower compression, a mechanically timed ignition rather than the breakerless setup found in the passenger cars, and a manual choke. The ER had five <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> and the overhead camshaft was driven by a cogged belt.|$|R
50|$|Some {{fundamental}} {{characteristics of}} the M180 remained unchanged with the M123: It only has four <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> and the oil pump, fuel pump and distributor are driven by a shaft inclined at {{the front end of}} the motor, which in turn is driven through a sprocket and a helical gear pair.|$|R
5000|$|The first Y-block on Ford {{automobiles}} was the 1954 239 in³ (3.9 L) Ford engine, {{known for}} its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. Rated at [...] and 193 ft-lbs of torque at 2200rpm, it replaced the [...] 239 in³ (3.9 L) flathead. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. It is known for having oiling problems in the rocker shafts because the oil first went to the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing,</b> then to the camshaft bearings, then to the rocker shafts. This problem plagued the entire Y-block family and could be remedied by running a copper line from the oil pump to the rocker shafts.|$|E
5000|$|The Royal Star had a {{relatively}} small 1" [...] single Amal monobloc carburettor, and later Concentric carburettor, but in 1964 new 8.5:1 pistons and a new gearbox improved performance. The machine had {{a top speed of}} about 90 mph and was relatively free of vibration. Sharing common engine and cycle parts with the larger BSA A65 Star 650 twin, it was an over-engineered machine and proved very robust. The only major fault with the engine design was a plain <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> on the timing side which, when worn, would cause a drop in oil pressure. In 1965, BSA addressed the bearing issues with a roller bearing on the drive side, as it had been on the pre-unit engines, with an improved bronze bushing on the timing side.|$|E
50|$|The pistons {{are made}} of light metal alloy and have three {{compression}} rings {{as well as one}} oil ring. They are connected to the crankshaft with I-shape connecting rods made of heat treatable steel. The bearings of the connecting rods {{are made of}} a lead bronze alloy and are fixed with a pin. Each connecting rod has a small oil pipe for the lubrication of it′s bearings. For weight reduction, the connecting rod pins are hollow-drilled. The crankshaft with hardened pins is supported in five bearings and is equipped with couter-weights to reduce <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> wear. The covers of the crankshaft bearings are mounted with two pin screws each. The flywheel is flanged onto the crankshaft. On the opposite site of the crankshaft, it holds a friction- and vibration damper.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{research}} conducted to improve the renovation technology of the shipboard diesel engines <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Crankshaft</b> renovation is the primary task during the overhauling of the main and auxiliary engines. Technical requirements for these repair operations are: fine surface quality, geometrical accuracy and high surface roughness (texture). Although available technologies are able to deliver these results, they are very expensive, time consuming and usually can be done only in workshop by highly sophisticated and expensive grinding machinery...|$|R
5000|$|The FE and FT {{engines are}} Y-block designs - [...] {{so-called}} because the cylinder block casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, giving great rigidity {{and support to}} the <b>crankshaft's</b> <b>bearings.</b> In these engines, the casting extends 3.625 in below the crankshaft centerline, {{which is more than}} an inch below the bottom of the crank journals.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine bore}} has been {{increased}} from 73mm to 75mm adding 465cc to the swept area {{and it is}} now a 2.9 litre engine. The combustion head, intake manifold, camshaft and silencer are redesigned. Pistons are now aluminium and the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> have been enlarged to meet the greater power output. The steering has been modified.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} of the OM 138 {{consists of}} two parts, the lower part with {{the lower part of}} the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> and the upper part with the cylinder block and the camshaft. The lower and upper crankcase parts are connected with pin screws on the horizontal crankshaft center. The lower crankcase part is strengthened with ribs and made of a light metal alloy. The flange of the gearbox is cast onto the lower crankcase part. The upper crankcase part is made of grey cast iron, it reaches from the crankshaft to the cylinder head. On it′s front, the upper crankcase part has a bulge that holds the camshaft, so that the camshaft can be driven by the crankshaft using only two gears. The camshaft is supported in five bearings. For camshaft maintenance, the bulge on the crankcase front has a removable cover. Mountings for the starter motor, the alternator and the injection pump are also cast onto the crankcase. For the lubrication of the crank- and camshaft, the crankcase has an oil pipe drilled into.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> half shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The HL 230 P30 {{engine was}} a very compact tunnel {{crankcase}} design, which kept {{the space between the}} cylinder walls to a minimum. The crankshaft was composed of seven discs, each with an outer race of roller bearings, and a crankshaft pin between each disc. To reduce the length of the engine further, by one-half a cylinder diameter, the two banks of 6 cylinders of the V-12 were not offset - the [...] "big ends" [...] of the connecting rods of each cylinder pair in the [...] "V" [...] where they mated with the crankpin were thus at the same spot with respect to the engine block's length rather than offset; this required a [...] "fork and blade" [...] matched pair of conrods for each transversely oriented pair of cylinders. Usually, [...] "V"-form engines have their transversely paired cylinders' conrods' [...] "big ends" [...] simply placed {{side by side on the}} crankpin, with their transverse pairs of cylinders offset to match. This compact arrangement with the connecting rods was the source of considerable problems initially. Blown head gaskets were another problem, which was corrected with improved seals in September 1943. Improved bearings were introduced in November 1943. An engine governor was also added in November 1943 that reduced the maximum engine speed to 2500 rpm. An eighth <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> was added beginning in January 1944 to reduce motor failures.|$|E
40|$|When ship {{diesel engines}} are overhauled, the surface {{renovation}} of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> is of critical importance.

New technology has been developed to perform <b>crankshaft</b> crankpin <b>bearing</b> surface grinding directly in the engine housing. This article outlines a further study confirming that the previously adopted grinding platform can be extended to fibre laser build-up welding technology. It is ideally suited to shipboard crankshaft surface renovation and opens up an entirely new dimension in laser build-up welding applications, which offers considerable economic benefits...|$|R

This was joined by four larger cars ranging from the 2.7-litre 15/20 to the 3.7-litre 25.5.|$|R
25|$|The Green D.4 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the Green C.4, a 30-35hp engine used by some early aviators in the UK, such as Roe and the Short Brothers. It was an inline, water-cooled 4-cylinder piston engine with characteristic Green features: cast-steel single-piece cylinders and cylinder heads, two valves per cylinder driven by an overhead camshaft, white metal <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> and copper water jackets, rubber-sealed to allow for differential expansion.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{mechanical}} upgrade, work {{began with the}} engine, in accordance to the new standard now known as ZMZ-402. This produced , but needed 92 octane petrol. The other option was the ZMZ 4021, which gave [...] but only needed the more common 76 octane. The main novelty of the ZMZ-4022 was stratified charge ignition. This was immediately ruled out, due to its complication for the mass-produced car. Other changes, however, were retained. These included fingerless <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> caps, new cast iron camshaft supports with no bushings, inlet and outlet valves of increased diameter with double-wound-springs, a new water pump, vibration dampener on the crankshaft pulley, contactless ignition system with a new alternator, new spark plugs, and an upgraded K-126GM carburettor. Some cars would feature the K-151 carburettor with a paper air filter (as opposed to the traditional oil bath filters), and an idle fuel cutoff solenoid with exhaust gas recirculation. These would often carry the aluminium cylinder block from the ZMZ-4022. Power was now [...] 0 to 100 km/h took 19 seconds, top speed was 147 km/h, and fuel economy [...] The GAZ-3102's braking system was also improved, with atandem brake cylinder that featuring a dual-chambered vacuum servo and pressure regulator on the rear brakes; the 3102's front disk brakes were left out. The 3.9:1 rear axle, clutch and 205/70R14 radial tyres with [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub cups were also carried across. The dashboard and steering wheel were also from the 3102 parts bin.|$|E
5000|$|The R was a {{physically}} imposing engine {{designed by a}} team led by Ernest Hives and including Cyril Lovesey, Arthur Rowledge and Henry Royce. The R shared the Buzzard's bore, stroke and capacity, and used the same 60-degree V-12 layout. A new single-stage, double-sided supercharger impeller was designed along with revised cylinders and strengthened connecting rods. The wet-liner cylinder blocks, crankcase and propeller reduction gear castings were produced from [...] "R.R 50" [...] aluminium alloy; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines, forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts. To make the R as compact as possible, several design modifications were made in comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage.

5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E
