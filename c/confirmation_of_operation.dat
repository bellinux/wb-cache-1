40|$|The IAEA is {{currently}} investigating {{new technologies to}} strengthen the effectiveness of its inspection and verification activities. In particular, the IAEA is looking for new methods and instruments, which are applicable to the detection of undeclared nuclear activities and facilities. Recently the IAEA Department of Safeguards held a Co-ordinated Expert Meeting on Noble Gas Monitoring at IAEA Headquarters in Vienna to review the applicability of noble gas sampling, analysis and monitoring for IAEA safeguards. A feasibility study was performed at the EC-JRC - Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) {{in cooperation with the}} EC-JRC-Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) investigating the potential of identifying reprocessing activities by means of isotopic measurements of xenon and krypton. The KORIGEN code and the SCALE program were used to calculate the nuclear inventory of spent fuel for two scenarios involving high burn-up fuel as well as for two scenarios {{that could be used for}} production of weapons-grade plutonium (low burn-up). Noble-gas isotopes are produced during the fission process: their isotopic composition is largely different from those of natural noble gases. Consequently, significant isotopic alterations are caused by dilution of the released noble gases with those in the atmosphere. This dilution process was ¿simulated¿ for noble gas generation due to high and low burn-up reactor operating scenarios by examining the isotopic alteration of xenon at different blending ratios. The potential and limitations from the analytical measurement point of view, considering routine and reference measurements, to measure these changes in stable xenon and krypton isotopic ratios were discussed. A potential laboratory network approach yielding reasonable cost-benefit quality assurance was suggested. The conclusion was reached that characteristic xenon and krypton signatures originating from irradiated fuel are a promising additional tool for <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> declaration of fuel reprocessed at large nuclear reprocessing plants. Within some constraints the accumulated information gained from xenon signatures could also provide valuable information for nuclear safeguards verification of undeclared reprocessing activities, supplementary to radiometric measurements of 85 Kr.

When the VR designers create applications, {{it is often}} difficult to handle and understand many parameters and functions that have to be set in the application program using documentation manuals only. This complication may disrupt creative imagination and result in inefficient coding. So, we proposed the support application which improved the efficiency of VR applications development and provided the interactive components <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> with haptic sense previously. In this paper, we describe improvements of our former proposed support application, which was applicable to multiple APIs and haptic devices, and evaluate the new application by having participants complete VR program.

Still, while that was a step down in speed, it was a step up in image quality. Modern methods now provide both high speed and high quality.|$|R

50|$|The {{three main}} engines (SSMEs) started at T-6.6 seconds. The main engines ignited {{sequentially}} via the Shuttle's general purpose computers (GPCs) at 120 millisecond intervals. All three SSMEs {{were required to}} reach 90% rated thrust within three seconds, otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an RSLS abort. If all three engines indicated nominal performance by T-3 seconds, they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at T-0. Between T-6.6 seconds and T-3 seconds, while the SSMEs were firing but the SRBs were still bolted to the pad, the offset thrust caused the entire launch stack (boosters, tank and orbiter) to pitch down 25.5 in measured {{at the tip of}} the external tank. The three second delay after <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> SSME <b>operation</b> was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical. At T-0 seconds, the 8 frangible nuts holding the SRBs to the pad were detonated, the SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the SRBs were ignited. By T+0.23 seconds, the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence, and reached maximum chamber pressure by T+0.6 seconds. The Johnson Space Center's Mission Control Center assumed control of the flight once the SRBs had cleared the launch tower.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{transition}} from radiative to guiding {{behavior of a}} half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) is studied throughout this work. The electric near-field distribution in the substrate plane is first demonstrated at different frequencies over the mono-mode operation band and is then related to far-field radiation patterns. The observation shows that the HMSIW, as a semi-open transmission line, suffers from relatively large radiation loss as it operates at frequencies just above the cut-off. However, the radiated power drops drastically {{with the increase of}} frequency. In particular, the attenuation caused by radiation becomes negligible as the frequency increases beyond a critical point. An explanation is given to the phenomena above and an approximate equation is also proposed for estimating the critical frequency point, as low-frequency limit of the HMSIW operational range. These results provide a physical <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the optimal <b>operation</b> frequency range for the use of HMSIW as a low-loss waveguide.

40|$|AbstractThe new {{technologies}} of plants integration on buildings offer new possibilities from the sustainable construction point of view, especially in energy savings. In previous studies the great capacity of double-skin green facade or green screen to intercept solar radiation was confirmed, observing differences up to 18 °C in surface temperatures between sunny and shade {{areas on the}} wall of the building. The experiment presented here consists of two identical house-like cubicles (3 x 3 x 3 m) located in Puigverd de Lleida, Spain. The only difference between the two cubicles is the double-skin green facade installed in one of them. In a first step only the South wall was covered by a provisional green facade. As the results from first experiment were positive with interesting low electrical energy consumptions when only the 50 % of the South wall was covered by plants, a new stable green facade was built covering the South, East and West facades by a deciduous specie well adapted to the Mediterranean Continental climate. With this study the <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the good <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> green facades made with deciduous species as passive system for energy savings in buildings is expected to be characterized...|$|R

40|$|We {{produce and}} analyze eclipse time {{variation}} (ETV) curves for some 2600 Kepler binaries. We find good to excellent {{evidence for a}} third body in 222 systems via either the light-travel-time (LTTE) or dynamical effect delays. Approximately half of these systems have been discussed in previous work, while the rest are newly reported here. Via {{detailed analysis of the}} ETV curves using high-level analytic approximations, we are able to extract system masses and information about the three-dimensional characteristics of the triple for 62 systems which exhibit both LTTE and dynamical delays; for the remaining 160 systems we give improved LTTE solutions. New techniques of preprocessing the flux time series are applied to eliminate false positive triples and to enhance the ETV curves. The set of triples with outer orbital periods shorter than ~ 2000 days is now sufficiently numerous for meaningful statistical analysis. We find that (i) as predicted, there is a peak near i_m~ 40 deg in the distribution of the triple vs. inner binary mutual inclination angles that provides strong <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> Kozai-Lidov cycles with tidal friction; (ii) the median eccentricity of the third-body orbits is e_ 2 = 0. 35; (iii) there is a deficit of triple systems with binary periods < 1 day and outer periods between ~ 50 and 200 days which might help guide the refinement of theories of the formation and evolution of close binaries; and (iv) the substantial fraction of Kepler binaries which have third-body companions is consistent with a very large fraction of all binaries being part of triples.
