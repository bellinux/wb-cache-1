40|$|We discuss {{approaches}} to transduction based on graph <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> functions. More specifically, {{we focus on}} the normalized cut, which is the cost function of choice in many clustering applications, notably in image segmentation. Since optimizing the normalized <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> is an NP-complete problem, much of the research attention so far has gone to relaxing the problem of normalized cut clustering to tractable problems, producing so far a spectral relaxation and a more recently a tighter but computationally much tougher semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation. In this paper we deliver two main contributions: first, we show how an alternative SDP relaxation yields a much more tractable optimization problem, and we show how scalability and speed can further be increased by making a principled approximation. Second, we show how it is possible to efficiently optimize the normalized <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> in a transduction setting using our newly proposed approaches. Positive empirical results are reported...|$|R

5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971.

However, to <b>cut</b> <b>costs</b> with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard.

5|$|Amidst much {{pomp and}} ceremony, with Justinian and the Patriarch of Constantinople in attendance, the Roman fleet set sail around 21 June 533.

Belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to a lull in the wind to train his troops and acquaint the disparate contingents with each other. It was at Methone, however, that 500 men died of dysentery caused by mouldy bread.

40|$|Abstract | The multi-way {{partition}} {{problem is}} very important in various applications. In this paper, we use analytical and experimental results to study the k-way partition problem. We introduce the concept of embedding graph for the the k-way partition problem. Based on this concept, we explain di erent scenarios of using a bi-partition heuristic to solve the k-way partition problem. If C denote the optimal <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> for the k-way partition problem and the bi-partition heuristics we use are-approzimation heuristics (dened in Section 2), we prove that the <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> from the hierarchical approach has an approximate upper bound of C log k while the <b>cut</b> <b>cost</b> from the all-way bipartition, or at approach, has an upper bound of Ck. This is contrary to some claims made in recent literature (and CAD tools designed based on it). Experimental results strongly support our theoretical analysis. Our results show that for large target graph, the hierarchical approach is about 77 % better than the single-pass all-way bi-partition approach. The all-way bi-partition approach will perform better in a multipass set-up. However, the hierarchical approach is still on average 7 : 1 % better in quality and 144 times faster than the multi-partition all-way bi-partition approach. The main conclusion of this paper is, contradicted to what has been suggested in literature, hierarchical bipartitioning is a more e ective multi-way partitioning scheme. I...|$|R
