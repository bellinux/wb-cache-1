40|$|In {{a system}} of {{tripartite}} consultation, workers, employers, and the government work together to improve labor standards and protect workers’ rights. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has advocated for this system {{since its founding in}} 1919. China’s transition toward a market economy and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession calls for a new labor relations <b>consultation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which is more market‐oriented, globalized, diversified, and flexible. In this context, China implemented its own form of tripartite consulta‐ tion in 2001, with the founding of the State Labor Relations Tripartite   Consultation Conference.   The tripartite system in China has been widely adopted and has been an innovative development in Chinese labor relations. However, many argue that it does not meet the standards of the ILO tripartite system. Indeed, China’s tripartite <b>consultation</b> <b>mechanism</b> differs from that advocated by the ILO. The tripartite <b>consultation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in China lacks neutrality, enforceability of consultation outcomes, trade union independence and workers’ representation. Nonetheless, the tripartite mechanism currently utilized in Chinese labor relations is a first step toward a more authentic tripartite   <b>consultation</b> <b>mechanism</b> by ILO standards.

We discuss the organizers' careful delineation of a distinction between “stakeholders” and the “general public,” and their aversion to any sort of “eventfulness” in public deliberations. Finally, we introduce the classical notion of the “idiot”—the individual who minds exclusively his or her own private affairs— and argue for the need to develop a new vocabulary to evaluate the politics of “listening to the public. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{could argue}} that good project {{governance}} positively influences productivity, and that this shapes the economy in a sustainable way. However, there is a prevailing perception in the corporate and government environment that steering committees and boards in some way constitutes good project governance. This perception appears to be based in part upon the presumption that the corporate sector always performs better than government; the corporate sector assures good corporate governance through boards; Ergo everyone else, including government, would perform better if they did the same. The paper argues that this presumption is indefensible {{as there is no}} scientific or rational basis to support it. Moreover, the concept of governance as steering committees and boards can diffuse responsibility and accountability in the hierarchical structures of government departments and large organisations that initiate their own projects and this can lead to project delay, confusion and uncertainty. The paper reviews the literature on governance and project steering committees and concludes that establishing project advisory rather than steering committees removes the potential for organisational power play and provides an effective <b>consultation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that facilitates 'best for project' outcomes. ...|$|E

40|$|Responding to {{internal}} market and social pressures that centre on the inadequate protection accorded to workers' rights, China's government has begun constructing a tripartite industrial relations regime. As this process matures, {{it is to}} be expected that it will {{have a significant impact on}} those business enterprises that elect to invest in China in order to capture the profits to be made by labour exploitation and may well change the national origin of China’s investment inflow.
