A recurrent theme in the SwafS Expert Advisory Group meetings {{was the lack of}} clarity about what RRI is supposed to be. This is an entrance point into a broader reflection on RRI discourse being like the new clothes of the emperor – or perhaps there is not even an emperor (yet).

40|$|Enterprise {{development}} programs recognize &# 039;gender&# 039; {{as an important}} <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue.</b> Strategy to address gender, however, is loosely defined with interpretations varying across agencies. Many such programs consider &# 039;gender&# 039; more like an &# 039;annex&# 039; rather than effectively addressing gender issues in the project design, with appropriate provisions for gender mainstreaming. In spite {{of the importance of}} research on the role of enterprise development initiatives implementing BDS market development approach to facilitating women&# 039;s entrepreneurship and economic growth, the issue has not been adequately studied. Further, academic research with data from such programs is almost non-existent. This paper makes an attempt to address this research gap by presenting data on how {{development programs}} address or struggle to address gender as a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue.</b> It further builds on data of 120 male and female entrepreneurs and business development service providers. The paper argues that addressing gender should often be a matter of &# 039;choice&# 039; for impact, outreach and sustainability and not always of &# 039;cost effectiveness&# 039; of program interventions...|$|R

[...] MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health. [...] These targets are significantly off-track.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Synthetic {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} technology with potentially far-reaching benefits and risks. As a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue,</b> {{different aspects of}} synthetic biology fall {{within the scope of}} different international agreements. Contemporary biosafety and biosecurity frameworks are characterized by important regulatory gaps which policy makers need to address to minimize risks that may arise in the future both from commercial use and weaponization. In some cases, this may require formal treaty amendments, whereas others can possibly be resolved at lower levels, for instance through interpretive statements of treaties’ decision-making bodies...|$|R

It is argued that the formative role played by party manifestos needs to be incorporated into contemporary study {{of the politics of}} disability...|$|R
50|$|Energy {{policy is}} still the most {{important}} <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> in climate and economic policies. Implementation of Green Policy would see electricity generation from 100 percent renewable sources as early as 2040. The development of renewable energy and combined heat and power is also a great opportunity for technical and economic innovation. Solar industry and environmental technologies are already a significant part of key industries providing jobs which need to be developed and promoted vigorously. In addition, a priority of green energy policy is increasing the thermal insulation and energy efficiency of homes, the phaseout of all nuclear energy generation with possible high-efficiency gas-fired power plants operational during the transition phase.|$|R

40|$|The water {{crisis is}} a crisis of governance. A {{literature}} review reveals that this crisis concerns definitional issues, issues of ownership and access, boundary issues, the multiple uses of water, and the levels at which water should be managed. Paradigms for managing water have evolved from integrated water resource management through more experimental and learning based adaptive governance to understanding that water is not a sector but a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> and should perhaps be dealt with through the ‘nexus’ approach. The literature reveals a toolbox of policy instruments, infrastructures and institutions for managing water but concludes that solutions need to be crafted in a context relevant manner taking the relevant drivers of water use and misuse into account...|$|R

The goal is a set of strategies for transforming IDI's vis a vis their current model of sustainability. The result, brought about by applying the CLA framework in an upward motion, reveals how religion could be introduced as a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> in the present development framework; advocating the ability of religion to eradicate poverty; level genders, save the environment, conduct good gover-nance, and promote private sector development.

30|$|Often, {{specific}} information is managed {{by a certain}} ministry or regional authority. The topic of food contamination from the environment is a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>issue</b> for the Ministry of Environment and the ministry responsible for food safety. To effectively address this topic, a close collaboration among ministries is needed. For instance, data on contaminated sites/contaminated water bodies are normally managed by the environmental ministry, whereas data on contamination of feed/food are normally handled by the ministry/authority responsible for food safety. These datasets need to be brought together {{to assess the impact}} of contaminated sites and waters on feed/food contamination. Furthermore, information on potentially contaminated sites could be used for developing monitoring strategies for food-producing animals. Competent authorities should cooperate and inform potentially affected people.|$|R
