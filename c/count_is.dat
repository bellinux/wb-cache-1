The highest traffic <b>count</b> <b>is</b> at I-80 near Austintown, where 38,360 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic <b>count</b> <b>is</b> near US 6, where 5,550 vehicles travel the highway on average each day.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{non-agricultural}} calendar is the Tzolk'in calendar of the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days. This <b>count</b> <b>is</b> based on an earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica. This formed {{part of a more}} comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the breed <b>count</b> <b>is</b> lower than 10,000 cattle worldwide, {{most of them in}} Northern Europe, {{specifically}} Scotland. The breed is 'rare' in the United States and the Livestock Conservancy classifies it as a breed to 'watch'.|$|E

A total of 241athletes from 14 nations participated in 43events in nine sports at these games.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time in history, sample <b>counts</b> <b>were</b> {{released}} by the Elections Department to prevent speculation and misinformation from unofficial sources while <b>counting</b> <b>is</b> underway. All sample <b>counts</b> <b>were</b> released by 10PM - two hours after polling ended. With the exception of Aljunied and Punggol East, where <b>counts</b> <b>were</b> within a 4% error margin, all other figures showed that PAP had comfortable leads in 26 electoral divisions, while WP led in 1 electoral division.|$|R

5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet <b>count</b> <b>is</b> at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet <b>count</b> <b>is</b> rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land <b>count</b> <b>is</b> automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day <b>count</b> <b>is</b> based on the human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
50|$|Abstract numerals, dissociated {{from the}} thing being <b>counted,</b> <b>were</b> invented about 3100 BC. The things being <b>counted</b> <b>were</b> {{indicated}} by pictographs carved {{with a sharp}} stylus next to round-stylus numerals.|$|R
40|$|Additional Christmas Count Information on the Norfolk Christmas <b>Count</b> <b>was</b> {{received}} {{after the}} tabulation was published (NBR).

5|$|Traffic volumes on Highway35 vary {{considerably}} over {{the length of}} the highway, as well as {{over the course of the}} year due to its use for recreational purposes, including snowmobiling, cottaging and camping. Along the Highway35 and Highway115 concurrency, the average daily vehicle <b>count</b> <b>is</b> above 20,000. This drops as Highway35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10,000. This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden, at which point the vehicle count drops below 5,000 and tapers off as low as 2,000 at Highway60.|$|E
5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short Count during the Late Classic period. The Short <b>Count</b> <b>is</b> a count of 13 k'atuns. For this reason, {{there is no direct}} correlation between the Long Count and the European calendar. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of the}} Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period. Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.|$|E
5|$|During in-game cutscenes, the polygon <b>count</b> <b>is</b> {{increased}} to nearly 2,500 polygons, especially on character faces. Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

5|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) publishes yearly {{reports of}} the highway's annual average daily traffic (AADT), with counts usually taken near intersections. In 2011, FM 1528's highest {{traveled}} point was within the city proper of Cooper, with a daily average of 1550 vehicles. Just outside Cooper, the count drops to around 800 vehicles. In Klondike, the AADT is around 300 vehicles, while just west of Klondike, the <b>count</b> <b>is</b> just over 100. The highway's least traveled point is near its western terminus, {{with an average of}} just 90 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood <b>count</b> <b>is</b> undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 <b>count</b> <b>is</b> below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
