40|$|The <b>C-seal</b> is a {{new product}} for {{prevention}} of anastomotic leakage following colorectal anastomosis. Anastomotic leakage is a much-feared complication of colorectal surgery, with an incidence of around 11 %. The <b>C-seal</b> is a biodegradable sheath that {{is attached to the}} inner surface of the bowel, just above the colorectal anastomosis, with a circular stapler. Intestinal contents drain from the body via the <b>C-seal.</b> The <b>C-seal</b> can be used in stapled anastomoses at up to 15 cm from the anus and is compatible with all circular staplers. To date, 50 patients have been treated with a <b>C-seal.</b> Results are encouraging and therefore the <b>C-seal</b> is soon to be investigated under randomized study conditions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage is a {{potential}} major complication after colorectal surgery. The <b>C-seal</b> was developed to help reduce the clinical leakage rate. It is an intraluminal sheath that is stapled proximal to a colorectal anastomosis, covering it intraluminally and thus preventing intestinal leakage in case of anastomotic dehiscence. The <b>C-seal</b> trial was initiated to evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} <b>C-seal</b> in reducing anastomotic leakage in stapled colorectal anastomoses. METHODS: This RCT was performed in 41 hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Hungary and Spain. Patients undergoing elective surgery with a stapled colorectal anastomosis less than 15 cm from the anal verge were eligible. Included patients were randomized to the <b>C-seal</b> and control groups, stratified for centre, anastomotic height and intention to create a defunctioning stoma. Primary outcome was anastomotic leakage requiring invasive treatment. RESULTS: Between December 2011 and December 2013, 402 patients were included in the trial, 202 in the <b>C-seal</b> group and 200 in the control group. Anastomotic leakage was diagnosed in 31 patients (7. 7 per cent), with a 10. 4 per cent leak rate in the <b>C-seal</b> group and 5. 0 per cent in the control group (P = 0. 060). Male sex showed a trend towards a higher leak rate (P = 0. 055). Construction of a defunctioning stoma led to a lower leakage rate, although this was not significant (P = 0. 095). CONCLUSION: <b>C-seal</b> application in stapled colorectal anastomoses does not reduce anastomotic leakage. Registration number: NTR 3080 ([URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} {{to get a better}} insight in the incidence of anastomotic leakage leading to reintervention when using the C-seal: a biodegradable sheath that protects the stapled colorectal anastomosis from leakage. The <b>C-seal</b> is a thin walled tube-like sheath that forms a protective sheath within the bowel lumen. Thirty-seven patients undergoing surgery with creation of a stapled colorectal anastomosis with <b>C-seal</b> were analyzed. Follow-up was completed until 3 months after surgery. One patient (3 %) developed anastomotic leakage leading to reintervention. None of the 37 anastomoses was dismantled. One patient was diagnosed with a rectovaginal fistula. In three patients (8 %), a perianastomotic abscess spontaneously drained. The incidence of anastomotic leakage leading to reintervention when using the <b>C-seal</b> (3 %) is lower than expected based on the literature (11 %).

40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a seal carrier, which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with <b>C-seals,</b> knife edge seals and cup seals. Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|R

40|$|Colorectal anastomotic leakage (AL) is {{a serious}} {{complication}} in colorectal surgery leading to high morbidity and mortality rates 1. The incidence of AL varies between 2. 5 and 20 % 2 - 5. Over the years, many strategies aimed at lowering the incidence of anastomotic leakage have been examined 6, 7. The cause of AL is probably multifactorial. Etiological factors include insufficient arterial blood supply, tension on the anastomosis, hematoma and/or infection at the anastomotic site, and co-morbid factors of the patient as diabetes and atherosclerosis 8. Furthermore, some anastomoses may be insufficient from the start due to technical failure. Currently a new device is developed in our institute aimed at protecting the colorectal anastomosis and lowering the incidence of AL. This so called <b>C-seal</b> is a biofragmentable drain, which is stapled to the anastomosis with the circular stapler. It covers the luminal side of the colorectal anastomosis thereby preventing leakage. The <b>C-seal</b> is a thin-walled tube-like drain, with an approximate diameter of 4 cm and an approximate length of 25 cm (figure 1). It is a tubular device composed of biodegradable polyurethane. Two flaps with adhesive tape are found {{at one end of}} the tube. These flaps are used to attach the <b>C-seal</b> to the anvil of the circular stapler, so that after the anastomosis is made the <b>C-seal</b> can be pulled through the anus. The <b>C-seal</b> remains in situ for at least 10 days. Thereafter it will lose strength and will degrade to be secreted from the body together with the gastrointestinal natural contents...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{colorectal}} anastomotic leak can be life-threatening. We have {{assessed the}} feasibility of a new intraluminal biodegradable bypass device that we designed to avoid anastomotic leakage {{and the necessity of}} a temporary stoma. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent colorectal surgery. Before performing the anastomosis in a standard way, the <b>C-Seal</b> (Polyganics BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) was glued to the anvil of the circular stapler. Consequently, the bypass was fixated in the staple row just proximal of the simultaneously made anastomosis. A water-soluble contrast enema was performed after 1 week. RESULTS: The sheath was well compatible with the standard stapler device and easy to use. All donuts remained intact. No radiologic or clinical leaks were observed after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that the <b>C-Seal</b> can be applied successfully in colorectal surgery. Further investigation with large numbers of patients is now necessary to assess the efficacy of the <b>C-Seal</b> as a protective device. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{surgery is}} a {{frequently}} performed procedure {{with more than}} 10. 000 annual resections in the Netherlands. The majority of resections are performed for colorectal cancer. The {{first part of this}} thesis focused on outcome of colorectal cancer surgery in the Netherlands based on the nationwide data of the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit. Surgical resection with creation of bowel continuance is the primary goal in uncomplicated procedures. An anastomosis however, bears the risk of anastomotic leakage, the most feared postoperative complication. The occurrence of anastomotic leakage is associated with more postoperative re-interventions, high morbidity and even mortality. In order to prevent against anastomotic leakage and its sequelae a defunctioning stoma could be constructed, and in high risk patients avoidance of an anastomosis could be preferred by means of an end-colostomy. Construction of stomas have their own drawbacks including more postoperative complications, higher hospital re-admission rates and stoma care problems. The second part of the thesis focused on prevention of anastomotic leakage in stapled colorectal anastomoses. The <b>C-seal</b> is a biodegradable intraluminal drain, which is fixed to the proximal side of the anastomosis during the stapling procedure, hereby covering the newly made anastomosis and preventing leakage of intestinal contents. The randomized results of the <b>C-seal</b> trial did not show a leakage reducing effect of the <b>C-seal</b> in colorectal anastomoses. Therefore {{there seems to be no}} future role for the <b>C-seal</b> in clinical anastomotic leakage prevention in colorectal surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background Anastomotic leakage (AL) after {{colorectal}} {{surgery is}} a severe complication, resulting in morbidity, reinterventions, prolonged hospital stay and, in some cases, death. Some technical and patient-related aetiological factors of AL are well established. In many cases, however, {{none of these}} factors seem to explain the occurrence of AL. Recent {{studies suggest that the}} intestinal microbiome plays a role in wound healing, diabetes and Crohn's disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the intestinal microbiota of patients who developed AL with matched patients with healed colorectal anastomoses. Methods We investigated the microbiome in the doughnuts collected from 16 patients participating in the <b>C-seal</b> trial. We selected eight patients who developed AL requiring reintervention and eight matched controls without AL. We analysed the bacterial 16 S rDNA of both groups with MiSeq sequencing. Results The abundance of Lachnospiraceae is statistically higher (P = 0. 001) in patient group who did develop AL, while microbial diversity levels were higher in the group who did not develop AL (P = 0. 037). Body mass index (BMI) was also positively associated with the abundance of the Lachnospiraceae family (P = 0. 022). Conclusion A correlation between the bacterial family Lachnospiraceae, low microbial diversity and anastomotic leakage, possibly in association with the BMI, was found. The relative abundance of the Lachnospiraceae family is possibly explained by the higher abundance of mucin-degrading Ruminococci within that family in AL cases (P = 0. 011) as is similarly the case in IBD...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal <b>C-seal,</b> Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange. This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the seating load of the seal. Modeling of this assembly has been achieved using both HKS/Abaqus and COSMOS/M, which are finite element packages for analysis of coupled, nonlinear problems. From these studies, the appropriate seals that are reliable for SNS long coupling cavities and beamline joints were determined...|$|E
