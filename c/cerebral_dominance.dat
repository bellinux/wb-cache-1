40|$|Brain {{lateralization}} is {{a common}} term used to describe dominance of one brain hemisphere over another for a specific function. The right hand dominance in writing, controlled by the left hemisphere, is preceded by development of communicative gesticulation and followed by development of speech in the same hemisphere 1. We assumed {{that some people are}} not aware of their own capability of using the other hand for tasks involving fine motor sequential movements. To prove this hypothesis, {{the participants were asked to}} perform one trained task (writing) and one less-trained task (drawing) with a dominant and a non-dominant hand. The final sample was comprised of 1189 children from 14 elementary schools and 8 high schools in the Osijek area, of which 685 elementary school children were attending 1 st to 4 th grade and 504 high school children were attending 3 rd and 4 th grade.

40|$|Developmental {{stuttering}} is {{a speech}} disorder in fluency characterized by repetitions, prolongations and silent blocks, {{especially in the}} initial parts of utterances. Although their symptoms are motor related, people who stutter show abnormal patterns of <b>cerebral</b> hemispheric <b>dominance</b> in both anterior and posterior language areas. It is unknown whether the abnormal functional lateralization in the posterior language area starts during childhood or emerges {{as a consequence of}} many years of stuttering. In order to address this issue, we measured the lateralization of hemodynamic responses in the auditory cortex during auditory speech processing in adults and children who stutter, including preschoolers, with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We used the analysis-resynthesis technique to prepare two types of stimuli: (i) a phonemic contrast embedded in Japanese spoken words (/itta/ vs. /itte/) and (ii) a prosodic contrast (/itta/ vs. /itta?/). In the baseline blocks, only /itta/ tokens were presented. In phonemic contrast blocks, /itta/ and /itte/ tokens were presented pseudo-randomly, and /itta/ and /itta?/ tokens in prosodic contrast blocks. In adults and children who do not stutter, there was a clear left-hemispheric advantage for the phonemic contrast compared to the prosodic contrast. Adults and children who stutter, however, showed {{no significant difference between the}} two stimulus conditions. A subject-by-subject analysis revealed that not a single subject who stutters showed a left advantage in the phonemic contrast over the prosodic contrast condition.

PURPOSE: Models designed to study neurovascular coupling (NVC) describe a possible <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere <b>dominance</b> dependent on task completed and preference in handedness. We investigated whether passive arm manoeuvre performed with dominant (Dom-Arm) or non-dominant arm (ND-Arm) stimulated haemodynamic differences in either contralateral (Cont-H) or ipsilateral (Ipsil-H) cerebral hemisphere. METHODS: Healthy individuals lying in supine position, had measurements of beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP, mmHg), electrocardiogram (HR, bpm), end-tidal CO 2 (etCO 2, mmHg), and bilateral insonation of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA, cm s(- 1)). Arm movement was performed for 60  s with passive flexion and extension of the elbow (1  Hz), before manoeuvre was repeated on other arm. Data were normalised and effect of treatment was analysed for differences between manoeuvres and within each time period. RESULTS: Seventeen (eight males) healthy volunteers, aged 56  ±  7  years, were studied. Dom-Arm and ND-Arm manoeuvres stimulated a comparable temporal response in peripheral and cerebral haemodynamic parameters between Cont-H and Ipsil-H.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore possible factors for such cancer laterality. Methods: In this work, clinical data for consecutive patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer were reviewed, with emphasis on clinical presentation and family history. Results: Between 2005 and 2012, 687 patients with breast cancer were seen. Two women with incomplete data and eleven men were excluded. In total, 343 (50. 9 %) patients presented with left breast cancer, 311 (46. 1 %) with right breast cancer, and 20 (3. 0 %) with simultaneous bilateral malignancy. There were no significant differences between the three groups, especially in regards to clinical presentation and tumor characteristics. A total of 622 (92. 3 %) patients had unilateral primary, 20 (3. 0 %) had simultaneous bilateral, and 32 (4. 7 %) had metachronous primary breast cancer with subsequent contralateral breast cancer after 7. 5 – 236 months. The worst 10 -year survival was for bilateral simultaneous (18 %) compared with unilateral (28 %) and metachronous primaries (90 %). There were no differences in survival in relation to breast cancer laterality, handedness, and presence or absence of a family history of cancer. There were significant similarities between patients and first-degree relatives in regards to breast cancer laterality, namely same breast (30 / 66, 45. 5 %), opposite breast (9 / 66, 13. 6 %), and bilateral cancer (27 / 66, 40. 9, P= 0. 01163). This was more evident among patients and their sisters (17 / 32, 53. 1 %) or mothers (11 / 27, 40. 7 %, P= 0. 0689). There were also close similarities in relation to age at initial diagnosis of cancer for patients and their first-degree relatives for age differences of ≤ 5 years (48 / 166, 28. 9 %), 6 – 10 years (34 / 166, 20. 5 %), and > 11 years (84 / 166, 50. 6 %, P= 0. 12065).

40|$|Healthy {{young adults}} {{demonstrate}} a group-level, systematic preference for stimuli {{presented in the}} left side of space relative to the right (‘pseudoneglect’) (Bowers & Heilman, 1980). This results in an overestimation of features such as size, brightness, numerosity and spatial frequency in the left hemispace, probably as a result of right <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere <b>dominance</b> for visuospatial attention. This spatial attention asymmetry is reduced in the healthy older population, and can be shifted entirely into right hemispace under certain conditions. Although this rightward shift has been consistently documented in behavioural experiments, there is very little neuroimaging evidence to explain this effect at a neuroanatomical level. In this thesis, I used behavioural methodology and electroencephalography (EEG) to map spatial attention asymmetries in young and older adults. I then use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate these spatial biases, with the aim of assessing age-related differences in response to tDCS. In the first of three experiments presented in this thesis, I report in Chapter Two that five different spatial attention tasks provide consistent intra-task measures of spatial bias in young adults across two testing days. There were, however, no inter-task correlations between the five tasks, indicating that pseudoneglect is at least partially driven by task-dependent patterns of neural activity. In Chapter Three, anodal tDCS was applied separately to the left (P 5) and right (P 6) posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in young and older adults, with an aim to improve the detection of stimuli appearing in the contralateral visual field. There were no age differences in response to tDCS, but there were significant differences depending on baseline performance. Relative to a sham tDCS protocol, tDCS applied to the right PPC resulted in maintained visual detection across both visual fields in adults who were good at the task at baseline. In contrast, left PPC tDCS resulted in reduced detection sensitivity across both visual fields in poor performers. Finally, in Chapter Four, I report a right-hemisphere lateralisation of EEG activity in young adults that was present for long (but not short) landmark task lines. In contrast, older adults demonstrated no lateralised activity for either line length, thus providing novel evidence of an age-related reduction of hemispheric asymmetry in older adults. The results of this thesis provide evidence of a highly complex set of factors that underlie spatial attention asymmetries in healthy young and older adults...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{clinical}} and {{experimental studies of}} patients with unilateral lesions have been more concerned with problems of hemispheric asymmetry than with the somewhat limited notion of <b>cerebral</b> <b>dominance.</b> There are now firm data to support the observation of earlier clinicians (Hughlings Jackson, 1887; Potzl, 1928; Lange, 1936; Dide, 1938) that the right hemisphere plays a special part in visual perception and spatial orientation (McFie, Piercy...|$|E
