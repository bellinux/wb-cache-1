40|$|Cloned {{lines of}} murine {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTL) directed to type A influenza virus confer complete protection upon adoptive transfer to syngeneic mice lethally infected by influenza virus. The exquisite specificity exhibited by a subtype-specific cloned CTL in culture {{is reflected in}} its capacity to eliminate pulmonary virus and mediate recovery only in those mice infected by the virus subtype recognized by this <b>cloned</b> <b>line</b> in vitro. A cross-reactive CTL <b>cloned</b> <b>line</b> protects mice infected by either of two influenza virus subtypes. In mice dually infected with two virus subtypes, the subtype-specific CTL clone only reduces lung virus levels of the recognized virus subtype and cannot prevent these mice from dying. In contrast, adoptive transfer of the cross-reactive CTL clone into mice simultaneously infected with two virus subtypes results in reduction of pulmonary titers of both subtypes and promotes complete recovery. These results directly implicate CTL as an important antiviral defense mechanism in experimental influenza infection. In addition, {{these results indicate that}} both the induction and expression of antiviral effector activity by CTL in vivo is highly specific and therefore favor the concept that CTL express their antiviral effect in vivo by direct cytolysis of infected cells...|$|E

Supernatants from hybridomas constructed from immune spleen cells raised by direct spleen immunization also contain binding antibodies, of which a select number show phenotype-restricted proliferative activity.

40|$|In vitro <b>cloned</b> <b>lines</b> {{derived from}} a primary nickel-induced rat {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} exhibited diverse levels of susceptibility to spontaneous NK activity. The presence of NK target structures was revealed by competition assays on all <b>cloned</b> cell <b>lines,</b> and the NK susceptibility of the tumour lines varied according to their osmotic fragility. Tumour cell lines derived from metastatic lung nodules presented similar NK susceptibilities to cells originating from the primary tumour. However, <b>cloned</b> cell <b>lines</b> differed in their capacity to form lung colonies after i. v. injection, and in their potential for invading lungs after s. c. primary tumour development. No correlation was found between lung colonization potential and NK resistance. Studies of the correlation between metastatic potential and NK sensitivity revealed that (1) all the NK resistant tumour cells were highly metastatic; (2) NK susceptible tumour cells could be either highly or weakly metastatic. Therefore, highly metastatic tumour cells could be either resistant or susceptible to NK lysis. We conclude that the property of resistance to NK contributes to a high metastatic potential. However, other properties could counterbalance and finally prevail over NK susceptibility thus enabling NK susceptible cell lines to be also highly metastatic...|$|R

Although plant identity, metabolism, and genetics affect the abundance and richness of its consumer species, understanding their interactions is even more crucial {{in the context of}} the release of genetically engineered (GE) plants and their potential effect on non-target insects. Aphids can react quite sensitively to metabolic and physiological changes in their host plants, as plant phloem sap and plant secondary metabolites influence aphid performance. 1, 2 Reports indicate detectable differences in the physiology and metabolism of GE plants compared to their non-transformed near isolines. 3, 4 We hypothesized that aphids might be good indicators for assessing whether these differences are relevant to the performance of plant herbivores and their associated food webs. The effects of GE plants on aphid performance have been studied previously. However, these studies failed to account for the genetic variation of aphid genotypes, also referred to as aphid clones.

When this is the case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits remains virtually unexplored. We assessed how mate preferences in a plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant.

A commercial cow was inseminated if net returns from her expected offspring were higher than net returns from an expected contemporary clone. Net returns equaled net milk returns minus the costs required to breed an expected offspring. If not inseminated, a cow could be used for implantation of a cloned embryo. An increase in the genetic difference between cloned embryos and semen or in the annual additive genetic response achieved in the nucleus increased market share of cloned embryos.

These shallow coastal {{habitats}} {{are subject to}} extreme environmental variability, including fluctuating levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High ROS concentrations can be cytotoxic and lead to oxidative stress. Given the importance of tidal marshes for marine biodiversity and their susceptibility to oxidative stress, {{it is important to}} study how resident organisms counteract oxidative stress. N. vectensis is an excellent model system for addressing the evolution of oxidative stress mechanisms because (1) this anemone exhibits tolerance to a variety of environmental stressors, (2) there is clear evidence of local adaptation to stress in different populations and sub-populations, and (3) protein-coding polymorphisms have been identified, some in proteins that are implicated in stress response. I exposed fifteen different <b>clone</b> <b>lines</b> of N. vectensis collected from four estuaries to biologically relevant levels of hydrogen peroxide. Pronounced differences are apparent between <b>clone</b> <b>lines</b> collected from Meadowlands, NJ, Baruch, SC, and Kingsport, NS, as well as among twelve clones collected at a single Cape Cod marsh. This is the first study that demonstrates intraspecific variation in the oxidative stress response of N. vectensis. To understand how the peroxide response of these clones might differ at the level of gene expression, I sequenced the transcriptomes of 7 <b>clone</b> <b>lines</b> under control conditions and when exposed to survivable levels of peroxide for 24 h.

Additionally, I identified pronounced differences in the peroxide-induced transcriptional profiles between genets of N. vectensis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) with epithelial cells {{and the consequent}} role of the virus in the aetiology of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is poorly understood. One important obstacle to {{work in this area}} has been the lack of an epithelial cell culture system in which EBV is stably maintained. Using a previously described approach in which CR 2 -transfected epithelial cells (SVK-CR 2) are rendered susceptible to transient EBV infection (Liet al., Nature 356, 347, 1992), we now demonstrate that the pattern of EBV latent gene transcription in these acutely infected epithelial cells differs from that observed in virus-infected primary B cells. In addition, some of these epithelial cells spontaneously entered the EBV lytic cycle. By cloning Akata virus-infected SVK-CR 2 cells we generated two stable lines which remained EBV positive for more than 1. 5 years at which time further subclones were isolated. These <b>cloned</b> <b>lines</b> carry the EBV genome as an episome and exclusively use the FQp promoter for driving EBNA 1 transcription, display no Cp/Wp promoter activity, and express low levels of the LMP mRNAs. Unlike acutely infected SVK-CR 2 cells, the <b>cloned</b> <b>lines</b> responded poorly to suspension-induced terminal differentiation and were impaired in their ability to enter the virus lytic cycle. These results, showing similarities between the cloned EBV-positive SVK-CR 2 lines and NPC tumour cells, suggest that stable maintenance of EBV in epithelial cells may require an undifferentiated cellular environment...|$|R

Ultraviolet radiation sensitivity was associated with very low DNA repair capacity as measured by DNA repair synthesis and by removal of M. luteus endonuclease-sensitive sites from irradiated DNA. The greater sensitivity of the differentiated cells appeared to be related to a greater degree of DNA damage at a given U. V. dose, resulting from altered cell geometry in the growth mode.

Type 3 cells induce antigen-specific, Ia-restricted B cell proliferation, but do not lead to specific antibody formation, and have been shown previously to have suppressor functions. Type 4 cells are autoreactive, and induce antigen-independent B cell activation and antibody secretion. The distinction between type 1 and type 2 Th clones was analyzed in detail. In bulk cultures, type 1 <b>cloned</b> <b>lines</b> generate an idiotypically heterogeneous anti-PC antibody response, whereas type 2 <b>cloned</b> <b>lines</b> induce a larger response that is dominated by the T 15 idiotype.
