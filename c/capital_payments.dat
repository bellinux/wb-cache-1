40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a dynamic Mirrlees economy with endogenous distribution of skills. Human capital is a private, stochastic state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building {{on the findings of}} the labor literature, we construct a tractable life-cycle model of human capital evolution with risky investment and stochastic depreciation. In this setting, we demonstrate the optimality of (a) a human capital premium, i. e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, (b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle, and (c) a non-zero intratemporal wedge even {{at the top of the}} skill distribution at all dates except the last date in the life-cycle. The main implication for {{the structure of}} optimal linear capital taxes is the necessity of deferred taxation of physical capital. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. However, expected <b>capital</b> tax <b>payments</b> do not equal zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected <b>capital</b> tax <b>payments</b> early in the life-cycle and positive expected <b>capital</b> tax <b>payments</b> late in the life-cycle.

Virtually all the resurgence in corporate profitability during the 1990 s reflects a cyclical increase in profits and a decline in net interest expense associated with deleveraging and lower interest rates. In this sense, {{it is not clear that}} a long lasting upward shift in the economic returns to capital has occurred, after accounting for short-run cyclical-related movements and for how deleveraging and lower interest rates have shifted <b>capital</b> <b>payments</b> away from debtholders toward equityholders.

40|$|Financial {{supply chain}} {{management}} and working capital management are increasingly receiving attention as important avenues to increase profitability in supply chains. By actively managing payment terms and working capital requirements, managers can influence financial performance and achieve significant cost savings. However, measures to improve financial performance implicitly restrict and influence operational performance. In our research we elaborate {{on the benefits of}} equally considering both operational and financial aspects in decision-making for the physical and financial supply chain. We develop a mathematical model that determines the optimal purchasing order quantity under working <b>capital</b> restrictions and <b>payment</b> delays. We analyze the trade-offs between the most commonly used financial and operational measurements, such as service level, return on investment, profit margin and inventory level. Our results demonstrate the significance of payment delays: Increases/decreases in the upstream/downstream payment delays favor the system's operations by decreasing operational costs. Moreover increases in the working capital employed in the system decrease the total operational cost, increase the total financial cost and lower the return on working capital investment.

40|$|By {{using their}} {{financial}} reserves efficiently, pension funds can smooth shocks on asset returns, and can thus facilitate intergenerational risk-sharing. In {{addition to the}} primary benefit of improved time diversification, this form of risk allocation affords the additional benefit of allowing these funds to take better advantage of the equity premium, which also favors the consumers. In this paper, our aim is twofold. First, we characterize the socially efficient policy rules of a collective pension plan in terms of portfolio management, <b>capital</b> <b>payments</b> to retirees, and dividend payments to shareholders. We examine both the first-best rules and the second-best rules, where, in the latter case, the fund is constrained by a solvency ratio and by a guaranteed minimum return to workers' contributions. Second, we measure the social surplus of the system compared to {{a situation in which}} each generation would save and invest in isolation for its own retirement. One of the main results of the paper is that better intergenerational risk-sharing does not reduce the risk born by each generation. Rather, it increases the expected return to the workers' contributions...|$|E
