5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
