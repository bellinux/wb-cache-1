50|$|In {{appearance}} it {{is similar}} to the American robin in size and shape, but it lacks the red chest and is more uniformly brown. Its song and feeding habits are also very similar to its distant cousin. In most of its range, it {{is more likely to be}} confused with the <b>creamy-bellied</b> <b>thrush.</b> Unlike the <b>creamy-bellied</b> <b>thrush,</b> the pale-breasted thrush has a clear contrast between the head and mantle, and it lacks blackish lores.|$|E
50|$|The <b>creamy-bellied</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus amaurochalinus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Turdidae. It occurs {{in a wide range}} of wooded {{habitats}} in a large part of central and eastern South America. It is generally common, even in human altered habitats such as gardens and parks. While the plumage varies from overall greyish to brownish, and the bill from dusky to yellow, adult creamy-breasted thrushes always have distinctive blackish lores. This separates it from other similar thrushes (e.g. the pale-breasted thrush) found in its range.|$|E
5000|$|The tadpoles {{hatch and}} {{feed on the}} trophic eggs; they can remain in the nest for up to 25 days, growing in size. At {{the start of the}} rainy season, the tadpoles move to lentic water, where they will {{complete}} their metamorphosis, feeding on anuran eggs, other tadpoles, and carrion. [...] Other frog species do not lay their eggs until the first heavy rains; the head-start of the L. labyrinthicus tadpoles allows them {{to take advantage of the}} eggs and newly hatched tadpoles of other frog species. L. labyrinthicus tadpoles are mostly active at night, and hide from visual predators (including birds such as the <b>creamy-bellied</b> <b>thrush)</b> during the day by burrowing in gravel and leaves.|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} birds in Uruguay {{frequent}} vineyards and damage grapes, both species that are considered crop pests and species that are protected by law because their conservation and protection are desirable. We surveyed 70 farmers in the Department of Canalones, the main grape growing region in Uruguay, to determine their perceptions {{about the nature and}} severity of bud depredations and the methods being employed to reduce such damage. Sixty-seven percent of respondents reported receiving damage from birds. Bird depredations were considered a serious problem by 58 % of respondents, a moderate problem by 19 % of respondents, and a minor problem by 19 % of respondents. The species most often cited as causing damage were Picazuro pigeons, great kiscadees, and <b>creamy-bellied</b> <b>thrushes.</b> Respondents use a variety of methods to deter bud depredations including firearms, toxic baits, visual deterrents, and chemical repellents. We describe a research proposal to determine more precisely the magnitude of bird depredations in Uruguayan vineyards, to adapt and/or develop management tools, and to formulate and implement a pilot management plan for reducing bird depredations...|$|R
40|$|Nest {{predation}} and brood parasitism are {{key factors}} affecting nest survival in passerine birds. As a result, birds may select nest sites that minimize {{the probability of}} nests being found by predators or by brood parasites. Nevertheless, evidence remains equivocal. My objective {{was to determine the}} relationship between some nest microhabitat characteristics (nest concealment, distance to a road, distance to water, and substrate) and nest predation rates or brood parasitism rates in the <b>Creamy-bellied</b> <b>Thrush.</b> I found no relationship between the microhabitat characteristics studied and nest predation or brood parasitism rates. This study, in concordance with several previous studies, fails to support hypotheses that nest-site selection is shaped by nest predation or brood parasitism. Fil: Astié, Andrea Alejandra.

40|$|Frugivorous birds play a {{key role}} in seed {{dispersal}} and establishment of a range of plant species, including invasive weeds, such as the Brazilian Pepper Schinus terebinthifolius. The potential of seed dispersal of Schinus by birds with varied feeding behaviours was studied through seed-viability tests and germination experiments using seeds obtained from birds in the field and birds kept in captivity. It was found that seeds collected after gut passage in five bird species in the field had higher proportion of germination as well as higher germination rates compared to the control seeds. Viability of seeds ingested by the Blue-and-yellow Tanager Thraupis bonariensis, which mandibulates seeds before ingesting, was significantly lower than control seeds, while reduction in viability of seeds ingested by the <b>Creamy-bellied</b> <b>Thrush</b> Turdus amaurochalinus was nonsignificant. Seeds ingested by birds in captivity germinated earlier than the control seeds, within 1 - 2 weeks, and had proportion and germination rates higher than controls. Probably both mechanical and chemical effects play a role in enhancing germination of seeds. In Brazil where both Schinus and avian frugivores had evolved together, the dependence of Schinus on generalist frugivores had been demonstrated in this study, similar to other countries where the invasive Schinus is dependent on native or introduced avian species for its spreading. This finding has important implications for the restoration of human-altered areas in South America, were Schinus is a native pioneer species, as well as for the management and restoration of areas invaded by Schinus elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Sex {{determination}} {{is important}} for conservation and population studies, particularly for reproduction programs of threatened species and behavioural ecology. Turdus amaurochalinus, <b>Creamy-bellied</b> <b>Thrush,</b> only exhibits sexual dimorphism during the breeding season, when males are considered to show intense yellow bills, and females and immature males show dark brown bills. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the sex of individuals using genetic techniques, and 2) {{to test the hypothesis}} that sex dimorphism can be detected by morphometry. This study was carried out at Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba, a preserved area located on the North coast of Rio de Janeiro State. The birds were captured using ornithological nets, singly marked with metal rings, weighed, measured and had blood samples collected before being released. The sex of 42 T. amaurochalinus individuals was determined using the CHD gene marker. A total of 20 males and 22 females were identified from June to August, with peak capture frequency in June. Turdus amaurochalinus females and males differed significantly in morphometrical measures. The most important traits to distinguish males from females were wing length (Student t-test= 4. 34, df= 40, p= 0. 0001) and weight (Student t-test= 2. 08,df= 40, p= 0. 044) : females were heavier and had significantly shorter wing length than males. Females and males were correctly classified in 86 % and 75 % of cases, respectively, using Discriminant Analysis. The molecular analysis was the most secure method for sex determination in the studied species. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (2) : 789 - 794. Epub 2011 June 01...|$|E

La determinación del sexo es importante para la conservación y los estudios poblacionales. Turdus amaurochalinus no presenta aparente dimorfismo sexual. El objetivo de este estudio fue determinar el sexo a través de una técnica genética, mediante el uso del marcador del gen CHD y se puso a prueba la hipótesis de que el dimorfismo sexual puede ser detectado por morfometría. Este estudio se llevó a cabo en el Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba, una zona protegida situada en la costa norte de Río de Janeiro. Las aves fueron capturadas con redes de niebla, los individuos se marcaron con anillos de metal, se pesaron, medieron y se les tomó una muestra de sangre antes de ser liberados. Un total de 20 machos y 22 hembras fueron identificados en el área de estudio desde junio hasta agosto, con la frecuencia máxima de captura en junio. La prueba de t-student fue usada para evaluar si hembras y machos se diferencian considerablemente en relación a medidas morfométricas. Los rasgos más importantes para distinguir machos de hembras fueron la longitud del ala y el peso: las hembras eran más pesadas y tenían longitud de ala considerablemente más corta que los machos. Hembras y machos fueron correctamente clasificados en un 86 % y 75 % de casos respectivamente, donde se usó un análisis discriminante. El análisis molecular es el método más seguro para la determinación sexual en la especie estudiada...|$|E
