40|$|The {{analysis}} of trade policy shows {{growing interest in}} various types of “standards”. While <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> and standards are introduced to protect the interest of consumers, they can also act as technical barriers to trade (TBT), as foreign suppliers complying with national regulations might be required to bear certain costs of adjustment to the new regime. Recent literature focused {{on the concept of}} standards and concluded that shared standards promote trade. We instead set our attention to <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> of the European Union and concentrate on their effects on trade costs. The analysis is inspired by Gandal and Shy’s (2001) cost reducing standardization union theory. This paper summarizes results of research undertaken within a larger product assessing importance of technical barriers to trade for new EU members. The recent empirical study by Hagemejer (2005), based on detailed trade data of the EU. He has shown that in sectors where the EU <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> are most complicated and require costly adaptation, the trade within EU is booming. He argues that the trade between EU members is more concentrated within the high-TBT products, while the imports from outside are focused on the low-TBT or no-TBT products. Thus, EU <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> might in fact be trade diverting if the difference in productivity between intra and extra-EU partners is large. In this context we analyze the pattern of new members’ exports to the “old” EU. We calculate the trade coverage of various standardisation approaches and analyze the comparative advantage structure of the new EU members. We demonstrate that the structure of TBT’s affecting exports from new EU members is slowly converging with the one that characterizes intra-EU trade. Therefore, we expect that CEEC’s countries will benefit from applying <b>common</b> <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> of the EU after accession. In the last section of our paper we report the results of questionnaire-based research made among Polish companies in December of 2004, i. e. after the Eastern enlargement. It seems that the adjustment costs were moderate and the adaptation process to new <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> is already completed. Therefore, one can expected welfare gains for new members of the EU. We perform a CGE simulation using a GTAP model to assess these gains. ...|$|R
40|$|The wrongly named Third Summit of the Americas held in Quebec from April 21 - 22, 2001, {{with the}} {{attendance}} of President George W. Bush {{and the leaders}} of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries has served to reaffirm the project of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), launched by Presidents Johnson in 1967, and continued by George Herbert Walker Bush (father of the current president) in 1989. However, project negotiations only began during the Clinton administration, starting with the so called first Summit of the Americas, held in Miami in December 1994. Unlike previous projects, the FTAA stems from the U. S. offer to the democratic countries of the western hemisphere (Cuba is not included) to attain greater access to the North American market in exchange for accepting the regulations and political and technical conditions that are already currently in force {{in the context of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA: the USA, Canada and Mexico). The FTAA can be considered a second generation integration scheme, not limited to the mere elimination of customs tariffs, but extended to questions regarding democracy and good government, liberalization of economic reforms, competition, the opening of foreign sectors, and adoption of <b>common</b> <b>technical</b> <b>regulations.</b> In a certain sense it can be said that the FTAA is more like the common market driven by the Single European Act (obviously without any design of a Common External Tariff) than the initial schemes of the European Economic Community of the 1957 Treaty of Rome or of the European Free Trade Association resulting from the 1960 Stockholm Treaty. They have spent forty years, not in vain, to know today, that the non-tariff obstacles, more than the tariffs themselves, are the ones that prevent trade...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that while <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> can improve welfare and facilitate markets, {{they can also}} impede trade. The trade impeding effects of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> are especially worrisome for developing countries: they frequently lack the human and capital resources necessary to satisfy technical measures, and thus {{are more likely to}} be excluded from markets by technical measures. This paper uses highly disaggregated US data on agricultural, mining and manufacturing imports to examine the impact of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> on trade patterns. Using instrumental variables estimation to correct for the potential endogeneity of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations,</b> the analysis suggests that <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> substantially impinge on poor countries' exports: their weaker capacities to satisfy <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> lead them to specialize away from industries with heavier regulatory burdens.
