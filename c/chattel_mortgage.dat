50|$|Originating in Roman law, a hypotheca was {{essentially}} a non-possessory pledge over a person's entire estate, but during the Renaissance the device was revived by civil law legal systems as a hypothecatory security interest taken strictly over immovable property and, like the late medieval obligatio bonorum, running with the land (Latin jus persequendi, French droit de suite, Dutch zaaksgevolg, German Folgerecht). However, under a handful of mixed legal systems, the hypothec was imported as a non-possessory real security over movable property (in opposition to the common-law <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage).</b> Whereas a pledge operates by bailment and transfers possession on delivery and a <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> operates by conveyance and transfers title, a hypothec operates by hypothecation and transfers neither possession nor title.|$|E

50|$|In {{the common}} law it is {{possible}} to place a mortgage upon real property. Such mortgage requires payment or the owner of the mortgage can seek foreclosure.

50|$|There are {{two modes}} of {{foreclosure}} in the Philippines. A mortgagee may foreclose either judicially or extrajudicially, as governed by Rule 68 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and Act. No. 3135, respectively. A judicial foreclosure {{is done by}} filing a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of {{the place where the}} property is located. The judge renders judgment, ordering the mortgagor to pay the debt within a period of 90-120 days. If the debt is not paid within the said period, a foreclosure sale satisfies the judgment. In an extrajudicial foreclosure, the mortgagee need not initiate an action in court but may simply file an application before the Clerk of Court to secure attendance of the Sheriff who conducts the public sale. This is done pursuant to a power of sale. Note that these two modes specifically apply to real estate <b>mortgages.</b> Foreclosure of <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgages</b> (mortgage of movable property) are governed by Sec. 14 of Act No. 1506, which gives the mortgagee the right to sell the chattel at a public sale. It has also been held that as regards <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgages,</b> the law does not prohibit that the foreclosure sale be done privately if it is agreed upon by the parties.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a trailer home, whether it is a fixture or chattel has a bearing on whether a real {{property}} mortgage applies to the trailer. For example, most mortgages contain a clause that forbids the borrower from removing or demolishing fixtures on the property, which would lower the value of the security. However, there have been cases where lenders lend money based on the value of the trailer home on the property, where that trailer is later removed from the property. Similarly, a <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> granted to allow a person to purchase a trailer home could be lost if the trailer is later attached to real property.|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{determine}} when, where, {{and under what}} circumstances the first <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> statutes arose. This article first examines the southern colonial statutes mentioned in those early American appellate opinions and traces them to their earliest version. The article then explores analogous Anglo-American recording statutes for personalty, some mentioned in the early American appellate opinions as potential sources of the southern colonial <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> acts. These two investigations establish that the first <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> acts arose in the Chesapeake colonies during the mid-seventeenth century, shortly after the development of the nonpossessory secured transaction. The article then analyzes the earliest reported southern American opinions, from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, for clues to the circumstances giving rise to the first <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> acts. Lastly, the article reviews the scanty legislative history concerning these first <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> acts. These latter two investigations suggest that southern colonial legislatures first passed these statutes to eliminate the secret lien problem for judgment creditors...|$|E
40|$|A <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{contract}} is {{the expression of}} a real guarantee that gives the creditor precedence over other creditors, in addition to the general pledge upon the belongings of the debtor. It refers to the sale of mortgaged movable assets, exclusively or prioritized in favor of the mortgaging creditor, in case the debtor does not comply with his / her commitments, under the signed mortgage contract. Beginning from this purpose, shared by both sides (as the <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{contract is}} synallagmatic), in case the debtor is unable to fulfill his / her commitments, the sides reach a situation of enforcement of the signed <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> contract.

50|$|However, later, some of {{the first}} laws on <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgages</b> in the Anglo-American world were passed. These early laws {{differed}} from other early laws in that filings and witnesses were required to enforce the security interest to prevent the debtor from fraudulently using the pledged collateral as a security interest in another loan. The issue had been handled differently in Roman law, by allowing the lender to sue a fraudulent debtor, and in Napoleonic law, by banning the transactions.|$|R

50|$|Another form of {{security}} interest which {{flourished in the}} United States in the late 19th century and {{the first half of}} the 20th century was the conditional sale, the ancestor of what U.S. lawyers now call the purchase money security interest (PMSI). It was popular in that era among creditors for two reasons. First, most U.S. states had imposed numerous onerous restrictions upon <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgages</b> in order to protect debtors (at a time debtor's prisons were being abolished but were still within the memory of most persons then living), and second, all U.S. states in that era also had strict anti-usury laws. Conditional sales, at least initially, were seen to be free of both of those problems.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{begins to}} correct the view that <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> acts began in the northeastern United States. First, this Article investigates whether Spanish law {{recognized}} chattel mortgages against third persons. Finding that Spanish law did, this Article then examines whether Spanish officials developed any filing requirements for them. Concluding that these officials did not, this Article next delineates the application of this law in the various Spanish-Borderland provinces. Several of these provinces, at various times, did have filing requirements for some types of chattel mortgages, contrary to the Spanish law otherwise applicable.

An attaching creditor does not stand in privity with the debtor and therefore cannot raise the debtor’s defense of usury.

40|$|In {{considering}} the powers which a partner possessed, it was stated in our former article, {{that he could}} make a <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> to secure a debt due from his firm. It becomes necessary to state, now that we are {{considering the}} powers which he does not possess, that he can not mortgage the partnership realty. And it makes no difference that the mortgage was made to secure a pre-existing debt of the firm, contracted within the scope of the partnership business. In the case last cited it was held that, while a mortgage on lands could not be foreclosed as to the interest of any person who had not executed it, or assented to, or ratified it, yet it could be foreclosed as to the interest of the person who executed it, though in executing it he may have used the partnership name, reciting that {{he was a member of}} the firm. He could not deny that he had an interest in the firm at the date of the execution of the mortgage. It is also settled that he can not make a <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgage</b> for the purpose of securing his own private or individual debts. And if he makes such a mortgage, the other party will not take, though ignorant at the time of the facts constituting the illegality.

40|$|The {{appraisal}} of the “market value ” of homes serving as the collateral for mort-gages is a fundamental part of the underwriting process. If a loan should default, however, {{it is not the}} retail market value that the lender obtains, but rather the “recovery value. ” In this research, we show how recovery values differ from market values at origination and explore the reasons for the differences. Using a large sample of <b>chattel</b> <b>mortgages</b> on manufactured homes, we explore the relationship among the selling prices, the book values, and the fitted values from simple hedonic models with spatial autocorrelation. We then address the differences between selling prices at origination and recoveries from repos-sessed homes. We find that the spread between them varies systematically with home characteristics and especially with “atypicality, ” that is, with mea-sures of how unusual a home is. Selling prices both at origination and recovery affect borrower defaults.
