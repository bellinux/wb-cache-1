On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old <b>Complex</b> <b>Unit.</b> 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E

25|$|More precisely, locally homeomorphic here {{means that}} each point m in the {{manifold}} M has an open neighborhood homeomorphic {{to an open}} neighborhood in Euclidean space, not to the unit ball specifically. However, given such a homeomorphism, the pre-image of an -ball gives a homeomorphism between the unit ball and a smaller neighborhood of m, so this is no loss of generality. For topological or differentiable manifolds, one can also ask that every point have a neighborhood homeomorphic to all of Euclidean space (as this is diffeomorphic to the unit ball), but this cannot be done for complex manifolds, as the <b>complex</b> <b>unit</b> ball is not holomorphic to complex space.|$|E

25|$|The above {{example of}} a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The {{complement}} of {{a point in the}} plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle, such that maps from the circle to itself are really all that need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is homotopic to) one of the standard maps , where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the <b>complex</b> <b>unit</b> circle. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a circle to a topological space form a group, which is called the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the integers, Z; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.|$|E

Some of these formulas, for example B4C, YB66 and MgAlB14, historically reflect the idealistic structures, whereas the experimentally determined composition is nonstoichiometric and corresponds to fractional indexes. Boron-rich borides are usually characterized by large and <b>complex</b> <b>unit</b> cells, which can contain more than 1500 atomic sites and feature extended structures shaped as [...] "tubes" [...] and large modular polyhedra ("superpolyhedra"). Many of those sites have partial occupancy, meaning that the probability to find them occupied with a certain atom is smaller than one and thus that only some of them are filled with atoms. Scandium is distinguished among the rare-earth elements by that it forms numerous borides with uncommon structure types; this property of scandium is attributed to its relatively small atomic and ionic radii.|$|E

They were compared on three problems: prediction of Boston housing prices, the sunspot count, and robot arm inverse dynamics. The <b>complex</b> <b>units</b> at-tained clearly superior performance on the robot arm problem, which is a highly non-monotonic, pure approximation problem.

The difficulty for learners of a foreign language {{lies in the fact that}} in many cases the meaning of those elements of the lexicon does not result just from addition of the meaning of individual constituents. Although (active and passive) knowledge about such lexical elements can be considered essential for successful communication in a foreign language, there still exists a lack (we focus on German as a foreign language, but we assume that the situation is comparable for other languages) of up-to-date and authentic didactic material that takes into account the characteristics of semantically <b>complex</b> <b>units</b> and the learners' cognitive strategies to analyze their meaning.
