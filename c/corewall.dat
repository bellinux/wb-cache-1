50|$|By June 1, 1906, {{construction}} was under way. Once again, Avalon Dam rose on the Pecos, its latest design reflecting {{many of the}} advances made in dam engineering since the original Avalon Dam was constructed in 1889. Avalon remained an earthen dam erected atop a rock-filled foundation, but this time Federal engineers added a thin, concrete and steel <b>corewall</b> and enlarged the spillways to withstand future flooding. The new Avalon Dam, completed in 1907, was 1,025 feet long and up to 50 feet high. It still stands across the Pecos River, its height increased in 1912 and again in 1936; its crest now 58 feet high. Work done in the 1930s was performed by young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal work relief program. During the winter of 1911-12, Reclamation also incorporated two innovative cylinder spillway gates at Avalon, a design incorporated later into the intake towers at Hoover Dam. If a flood was anticipated, the gates could be raised, allowing the reservoir to lower rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|Pathfinder Dam is {{composed}} of granite blocks, quarried from the same stone that forms the river's canyon. With Buffalo Bill Dam, its contemporary, Pathfinder Dam was intended to irrigate semi-arid lands in Wyoming. Buffalo Bill Dam, however, is of concrete construction, owing to its location within 7 mi from the railroad, while Pathfinder Dam is about 45 mi from the nearest railroad. Freight took {{at least three days}} to cover the distance, and once took 76 days. [...] Transportation of cement in barrels was not feasible by horse-drawn wagon, so the dam was built of quarried stone. The dam was faced with stones between 24 in and 36 in thick, laid in a 2 in thick mortar bed. Between these facings was a core of irregularly-shaped granite blocks of up to ten tons in weight, bedded in mortar and quarry tailings. The diversion tunnel was adapted to become the dam's outlet works. Construction costs were $2.5 million in 1909. An auxiliary dike, 38 ft high, extends to the south of the dam. It is an earthfill structure with a concrete <b>corewall.</b> A natural channel was enlarged and straightened to form an uncontrolled spillway {{on the north side of}} the dam.|$|E
40|$|The <b>CoreWall</b> {{project was}} funded {{recently}} (March 2006) by the U. S. National Science Foundation (NSF). It is charged {{to develop a}} basic suite of data integration and visualization applications for broad use in the ocean-, lake-, continental-, and ice-coring communities. A <b>CoreWall</b> workshop was held on 8 – 10 May 2006 in Washington, D. C. to explore possible development pathways for the <b>CoreWall</b> Suite of applications. The original <b>CoreWall</b> application was envisioned by the lake-core community who needed {{a better way to}} visualize their cores, do visual core descriptions, and share core photos and data in an integrated environment. A collaboration of ear th and computer scientists from four universities and one consulting firm was established to accomplish these goals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A dam {{may fail}} when the loading (overtopping flood, flow through or beneath the dam, {{earthquake}} or blasting loading, terrorist attacks, deterioration etc.) exceeds the resistance against overtopping, internal erosion, slope instability, sliding/overturning, excessive deformation etc. To properly describe {{the causes of}} dam failures, {{it is necessary to}} study characteristics of the dams which have experienced failures. In this work, more than 900 dam failure cases throughout the world excluding China are compiled into a database, including details of the dams, the reservoirs, the triggers, and the failures. This paper focuses on failure of earth dams, which makes up 66 % of the whole failure cases in the database. A statistical analysis of the failure characteristics is conducted. According to dam zoning and <b>corewalls,</b> earth dams are divided into four typical categories: (1) homogeneous earthfill dams, (2) zoned earthfill dams, (3) earthfill dams with <b>corewalls,</b> and (4) concrete faced earthfill dams. Further analysis of the failure modes and causes of these subdivided earth dams is carried out. Potential locations at risk are also described to provide the reader with a better understanding of earth dam failures...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia is {{a country}} that is prone to {{earthquakes}} because located at the junction of the earth's tectonic plates, namely the Eurasian tectonic plates, the Pacific, the Philippines, and Indo-Australian. The earthquake caused damage to the building structure, even it effects in fatalities. So, a safe and strong building is a must. One way to maintain the structure stability is by using Shear wall either full or half wall (Schodek, 1999). <b>Corewall</b> is one kind of Shear wall. Shearwall placement must noted so it can work well. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover shearwall placement at the most effective place based on serviceability limit and ultimate limit performance. The method that is used in this study is the dynamic response spectrum analysis by using ETABS. The research method begins by collecting building data to be analyzed as shop drawing, architects drawings, soildata, and other additional data. The modeling structure is done 2 times with SW 1 corresponding to originalplan and SW 2 coresponding to <b>corewall,</b> and then calculate the loading on the structure, like additional dead load (superimposed dead load), live load, and earthquake load. Earthquake load calculation based on soil type and location of building based on SNI 1726 - 2012. If all loads have been calculated and entered on ETABS, the next step is to run the ETABS where the results of the analysis or the output is displacement, drift, and base shear. Further the results of the analysis is controlled according to SNI 1726 - 2012 and Applied Technology Council (ATC- 40). The maximum displacement of the building in the X direction is 0. 1827 m and in the Y direction is 0. 1283 m, so if it is viewed from the serviceability limit and the ultimate limit performance, it is categorized as a eligible building (safely) in accordance with SNI 1726 - 2012. SW 2 is most effective shearwall placement based on displacement that occurs and serviceability limit and SW 1 is most effective placement based on performance limit. The maximum total drift in the X direction is 0. 00279 and the Y direction is 0. 00299. The maximum total inelastic drift in the X direction is 0. 00277 and the Y direction is 0. 00298, so if it is viewed according to ATC – 40, it is included in the level immediate occupancy category.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the structural performance assessment and control for super tall buildings during construction. Due to increasing structural complexity and economic investment of super tall buildings in recent years, the construction duration prolongs. Consequently, potential safety hazards may occur in structure when suffering from horizontal loads and vertical loads {{as well as}} non-loading effects in construction stage. The authors introduced performance based structural design (PBSD) methodology for the performance assessment and control of different structural states in different construction stages. The situation that the structural system will change along with the ongoing of construction procedure is considered. The critical issues with PBSD of super tall buildings during construction are fully addressed. By considering both gravity loads and lateral loads, the design criteria for construction stage structural systems were firstly discussed. A super tall building project was taken as an example in this paper to illustrate the proposed structural performance assessment during construction. It was shown that the proposed structural performance assessment method during construction phase is feasible and effective. It was {{also found that the}} arrangement of the lock-ins of outriggers for different construction stages is the key measure to control the performance of the mega frame outrigger <b>corewall</b> structures during construction...|$|E
