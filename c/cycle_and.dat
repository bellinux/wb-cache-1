40|$|There is a {{considerable}} interest in predicting the fertile days in a woman’s menstrual cycles in couples desiring a pregnancy and among those wishing to avoid conception by periodic abstinence. Cervical mucus detection is potentially an accurate marker of fertile days. It is therefore {{of great interest to}} assess the magnitude of heterogeneity among women <b>and</b> among <b>cycles</b> <b>and</b> among <b>cycles</b> of a given woman, in the evolution in time of the mucus secretions detected during an interval of potential fertility and defined relative to ovulation. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneity in cervical mucus hydration at various times relative to the mucus peak, both among <b>cycles</b> <b>and</b> among women, specifying and estimating appropriate multilevel latent class models for longitudinal data. Results showed that heterogeneity in mucus evolution among <b>cycles</b> <b>and</b> women is non-negligible. Model estimates identified different mucus patterns for groups of <b>cycles</b> <b>and</b> women, and the characteristics of the <b>cycles</b> <b>and</b> the women which influence mucus symptom evolution over time...|$|R
5|$|It was the {{discovery}} of enzymes {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of biochemistry.

One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism.

5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the <b>cycle</b> <b>and</b> the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life <b>cycle</b> <b>and</b> the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
