60|$|Accordingly, he {{had taken}} the {{opportunity}} to lecture the younger of the minister's lasses upon the duty of wearing shoes and stockings; and, as his advice came fortified by a present of six pair of white <b>cotton</b> <b>hose,</b> and two pair of stout leathern shoes, it was received, not with respect only, but with gratitude, and the chuck under the chin that rounded up the oration, while she opened the outer door for his honour, was acknowledged with a blush and a giggle. Nay, so far did Grizzy carry her sense of Mr. Touchwood's kindness, that, observing the moon was behind a cloud, she very carefully offered to escort him to the Cleikum Inn with a lantern, in case he should come to some harm by the gate. This the traveller's independent spirit scorned to listen to; and, having briefly assured her that he had walked the streets of Paris and of Madrid whole nights without such an accommodation, he stoutly strode off on his return to his lodgings.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the textile industry, cotton is used in fishing nets, coffee filters, tents, explosives manufacture (see nitrocellulose), cotton paper, and in bookbinding. The first Chinese paper was made of <b>cotton</b> fiber. Fire <b>hoses</b> were once made of cotton.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the forced wait, De Vac undressed the Prince and clothed him in other garments, which had been wrapped in the bundle hidden beneath the thwart; a little red <b>cotton</b> tunic with <b>hose</b> to match, a black doublet and a tiny leather jerkin and leather cap.|$|R
60|$|In the afternoon, {{after her}} walk or drive, {{she sat with}} Aunt Peace plying her needle, while Aunt Plenty, whose eyes were failing, knitted and chatted briskly, telling many a {{pleasant}} story of old times, till the three were moved to laugh and cry together, for the busy needles were embroidering all sorts of bright patterns {{on the lives of}} the workers, though they seemed to be only stitching <b>cotton</b> and darning <b>hose.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, <b>cotton</b> covered <b>hose,</b> with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an ozone-friendly clean agent and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|R
50|$|On August 7, 1896 a mass {{meeting of}} the {{citizens}} of Washington was held at the town hall to devise ways and means toward purchasing fire equipment and forming an organized fire brigade. From that meeting the first organized fire department was founded. Records from 1898 show that the town of Washington had a volunteer fire department with a fire chief and 33 members. Apparatus listed for the department at that time consisted of two hand hose carts with 350 ft. of 2 ½ in. <b>cotton</b> rubber lined <b>hose</b> on each, One 50 gal hand chemical cart, and One hand hook & ladder cart. All of the apparatus was located at the town hall.|$|R
