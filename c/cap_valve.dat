40|$|Silicon carbide {{ceramics}} are {{the leading}} candidate materials for use as heat exchangers in advanced combined cycle power plants because of their unique combination of high temperature strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal shock resistance, and good high temperature stability and oxidation resistance.

50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner valve body shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} of the valve body permits the valve to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed.

The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed.

40|$|A piezoelectrically-driven {{hydraulic}} amplification microvalve {{for use in}} high {{specific power}} hydraulic pumping applications was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. High frequency, high force actuation capabilities were enabled through the incorporation {{of one or more}} bulk piezoelectric material elements beneath a micromachined annular tethered-piston structure. An hydraulic amplification mechanism was employed to amplify the limited stroke of this piezoelectrically-driven piston structure to a significantly larger motion (40 - 50 x) of a micromachined valve membrane with attached <b>valve</b> <b>cap.</b> This <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> was actuated through its stroke to open and close against a fluid orifice. These design features enabled the valve device to simultaneously meet a set of high frequency (1 - 10 kHz), high pressure(0. 1 -IMPa), and large stroke (15 - 40,um) requirements that had not previously been satisfied by other microvalves presented in the literature. This research was carried out through a series of modeling, design, fabrication, assembly, and experimental testing tasks. Linear and non-linear modeling tools characterizing the structural deformations of the active valve sub-systems were developed. These tools enabled accurate prediction of real-time stresses along the micromachined valve membrane structure during deflection into its non-linear large-deflection regime. A systematic design procedure was developed to generate an active valve geometry to satisfy membrane stress limitations and valve power consumption requirements set forth by external hydraulic system performance goals. (cont.) Fabrication challenges, such as deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the drive element and valve membrane structures, wafer-level silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding operations, preparation and integration of piezoelectric material elements within the micromachined tethered piston structure, die-level assembly and bonding of silicon and glass dies, and filling of degassed fluid within the hydraulic amplification chamber were overcome. The active valve structural behavior and flow regulation capabilities were evaluated over a range of applied piezoelectric voltages, actuation frequencies, and differential pressures across the valve. For applied piezoelectric voltages up to 500 Vpp at lkHz, the valve devices demonstrated amplification ratios of drive element deflection to <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> deflection of 40 - 50 x. These amplification ratios correlated within 5 - 10 % of the model expectations. Flow regulation experiments proved that a peak average flow rate through the device of 0. 21 mL/s under a lkHz sinusoidal drive voltage of 500 Vpp, with valve opening of 17 pm, against a differential pressure of 260 kPa could be obtained. Tests revealed that fluid-structural interactions between the <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> and membrane components and flow instabilities (due to transition between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes through the valve orifice) limited the valve performance capabilities. by David C.

50|$|The trays or plates used in {{industrial}} distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) up {{the height of}} the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. An example of a very simple tray is a perforated tray. The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations. In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing bubble-caps or <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a weir on each tray.|$|R
40|$|Precessional {{dynamics}} are exploited in {{the operation}} of high frequency magnetic devices such as magnetic disk drives, non reciprocal microwave devices and spin transfer oscillators. The trajectory of the precession and its damping are of crucial importance. This thesis presents the characterisation of a variety of magnetic thin film structures performed with a range of phase sensitive techniques. It is possible to obtain new insight by utilising the chemical and site specificity of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) to isolate the precession in different chemical species or at distinct sites in the crystal structure of a chosen material. X-ray Ferromagnetic Resonance (XFMR) combines XMCD and Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) phenomena in a technique capable of measuring the FMR response of an alloy or multilayer with both chemical and site specificity. To complement the XFMR technique a low temperature Time-Resolved Magneto Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) setup has been developed. This allowed for the characterisation of samples at temperatures in the range 4 K to room temperature. A frequency swept Vector Network Analyser FMR (VNA-FMR) setup was developed to allow for a fast method for determining the resonance condition and damping of a range of ferromagnetic thin film samples. In addition a TR-X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (TR-XPEEM) setup has been established which allows images to be obtained with magnetic contrast. The combination of the above techniques has lead to studies on rare earth <b>capped</b> spin <b>valve</b> free layers and the measurement of spin pumping in industrially relevant spin valves.
