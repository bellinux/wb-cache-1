500|$|In Los Angeles {{there were}} a number of record {{mastering}} and pressing plants that were not [...] "first in line" [...] to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These pressing plants were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality. Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1974 Pink Floyd bootleg called Brain Damage was released under the name The Screaming Abadabs, which was one of the band's early names. Because of their ability to get records and covers pressed unquestioned by these pressing plants, bootleggers were able to produce artwork and packaging that a <b>commercial</b> <b>label</b> would be unlikely to issue – perhaps most notoriously the 1962 recording of The Beatles at the Star Club in Hamburg, which was bootlegged as The Beatles vs. the Third Reich (a parody on an early US album entitled The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons), or Elvis' Greatest Shit, a collection of the least successful of Elvis Presley's recordings, mostly from film soundtracks.|$|E

50|$|Rangel {{was both}} an artist, graphic {{designer}} and artisan. Rangel’s painting and design work has a distinctive style {{which has been}} dubbed “Rangelino.” Much of his artwork reflects his views of nature and cultural themes related to Mexico. Rangel’s painting shows an obsession with dividing light and shadow, with works focusing of overall forms and eliminating details {{with the aim of}} conveying the essence of the object. His works are highly stylized. His painting style was not appreciated during his lifetime in Mexico. Many of his paintings are based on the natural landscapes and vegetation of the Nogueras area, synthesizing leaves, flowers, fruits, insects and birds along with backgrounds and plays of light and shadow. Much of his work involved nature but he never painted landscapes. Much of his work focuses on small things, almost microscopic size at times. For a <b>commercial</b> <b>label</b> for tomatoes, he simulated a botanical label with detail given to the image of the divided fruit. However, he never painted landscapes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his essay}} for the 2005 cast album, Jeremy Sams finds it most {{relevant}} to compare Sondheim's work with operas that similarly explore {{the psyche of}} a mad murderer or social outcast, such as Alban Berg's Wozzeck (based on the play by Georg Büchner) and Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes (1945). On the other hand, {{it can be seen}} as a precursor to the later trend of musicals based on horror themes, such as The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Jekyll & Hyde (1997), Little Shop of Horrors (1982) and Dance of the Vampires (1997), which used the description of the trend, [...] "grusical", as its <b>commercial</b> <b>label.</b> Theatre critic and author Martin Gottfried wrote on this subject: [...] "Does so much singing make it an opera? Opera is not just a matter of everything being sung. There is an operatic kind of music, of singing, of staging. There are opera audiences, and there is an opera sensibility. There are opera houses. Sweeney Todd has its occasional operatic moments, but its music overall has the chest notes, the harmonic language, the muscularity, and the edge of Broadway theater." ...|$|E
