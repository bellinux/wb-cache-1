30|$|The <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> {{placed in}} {{service for the}} SRF module(s) on duty used in a {{synchrotron}} light source is typically oversized, following a standard rule of thumb commonly adopted to select a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> with safety factor 1.5 for its refrigeration capacity. The inclusion of this safety factor opens a possibility to support a cryogenic test stand in a parasitic mode while maintaining an uninterrupted operation of the SRF modules on duty. The location of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> is commonly selected to be as near the SRF modules on duty as practical for the light source to benefit the routine operational efficiency, but the cryogenic test stand might be compelled to be located {{some distance from the}} main Dewar (MD) of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> because of space limitations. Under these circumstances, it becomes unavoidable to deliver liquid helium (LHe) from MD of a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> to the tested SRF module at the cryogenic test stand to maintain the level balance of the SRF module and to send the evaporated cold gaseous helium (CGHe) from the tested SRF module to the cold box (CB) of a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant</b> to maintain the pressure balance of a SRF module over a long distance. Some operational challenges are consequently expected, such as insufficient pressure drops and a deterioration of the refrigeration capacity of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plant.</b> Both situations are induced mainly by the unexpected heat loads in the LHe and CGHe transfer lines. Such unexpected heat loads are easily introduced into a long-distance cryogenic transfer line. It might be questioned whether the guideline with safety factor 1.5 to account for the uncertainty of the heat load in the cryogenic designs is applicable also to the design of a long-distance cryogenic transfer line. Its validity must be verified for a design concept of this kind applied to long-distance cryogenic transfer lines of two-phase helium flow.|$|E

40|$|A Global Design Effort (GDE) {{began in}} 2005 {{to study a}} TeV scale electron-positron linear {{accelerator}} based on superconducting radio-frequency (RF) technology, called the International Linear Collider (ILC). In early 2007, the design effort culminated in a reference design for the ILC, closely based on the earlier TESLA design. The ILC will consist of two 250 GeV linacs, which provide positron-electron collisions for high energy physics research. The particle beams will be accelerated to their final energy in superconducting niobium RF cavities operating at 2 kelvin.

40|$|To {{meet the}} helium (He) {{requirements}} of the superconducting supercollider (SSC), the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plants</b> {{must be able to}} respond to time-varying loads. Thus the design and simulation of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plants</b> requires dynamic models of their principal components, and in particular, the core heat exchangers. In this paper, we detail the derivation and computer implementation of a model for core heat exchangers consisting of three partial differential equations (PDES) for each fluid stream (the continuity, energy and momentum balances for the He), and one PDE for each parting sheet (the energy balance for the parting sheet metal); the PDEs have time and axial position along the exchanger as independent variables. The computer code can accommodate any number of fluid streams and parting sheets in an adiabatic group. Features of the code include: rigorous or approximate thermodynamic properties for He, upwind and downwind approximation of the PDE spatial derivatives, and sparse matrix time integration. The outputs from the code include the time-dependent axial profiles of the fluid He mass flux, density, pressure, temperature, internal energy and enthalpy.

40|$|During the LHC {{operation}} in 2010 and 2011, the cryogenic system has achieved an availability level fulfilling the overall requirement. To reach this level, the cryogenic system has profited {{like many other}} beam-dependent systems from the reduced beam parameters. Therefore, impacts of some failures occurred during the LHC operation were mitigated by using the overcapacity margin, the existing built-in redundancy in between adjacent sector <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plants</b> and the "cannibalization" of spares on two idle <b>cryogenic</b> <b>plants.</b> These two first years of operation were also crucial to identify the weaknesses of the present cryogenic maintenance plan and new issues like SEUs. After the LS 1, nominal beam parameters are expected and the mitigated measures will be less effective or not applicable at all. Consequently, a consolidation plan to improve the MTBF and the MTTR of the LHC cryogenic system is under definition. Concerning shutdown periods, the present cryogenic sectorization imposes some restrictions {{in the type of}} interventions (e. g. cryo-magnet removal) which can be done without affecting the operating conditions of the adjacent sector.
