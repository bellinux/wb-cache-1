25|$|The {{majority}} opinion rejected the government's argument comparing the habeas corpus restriction under the MCA to those {{affected by the}} Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which were ruled constitutional after a suspension clause challenge. The Court explained the restrictions of AEDPA on habeas review were not a complete suspension on habeas corpus, but simply procedural limitations, such as {{limiting the number of}} successive habeas petitions a prisoner <b>can</b> <b>file,</b> or mandating a one-year time limit for the filing of federal habeas review that begins when the prisoner's judgment and sentence become final.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands {{used to have}} a semi-separated legal {{profession}} comprising the lawyer and the procureur, the latter resembling, to some extent, the profession of barrister. Under that system, lawyers were entitled to represent their clients in law, but were only able to file cases before the court at which they were registered. Cases falling under the jurisdiction of another court had to be filed by a procureur registered at that court, in practice often another lawyer exercising both functions. Questions were raised on the necessity of the separation, given the fact that its main purpose – the preservation {{of the quality of the}} {{legal profession}} and observance of local court rules and customs – had become obsolete. For that reason, the procureur as a separate profession was abolished and its functions merged with the legal profession in 2008. Currently, lawyers <b>can</b> <b>file</b> cases before any court, regardless of where they are registered. The only notable exception concerns cases brought before the Supreme Court, which have to be handled by lawyers registered in the district of South Holland, mainly for qualitative reasons.|$|E

25|$|Italy has {{class action}} legislation. Consumer {{associations}} <b>can</b> <b>file</b> claims {{on behalf of}} groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government’s agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House {{and has to be}} passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law. In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a type of class action, specifically in the area of consumers’ law. To date, no such law has been enacted, but scholars demonstrated that class actions (azioni rappresentative) do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class action is regulated by art. 140 bis of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.|$|E
25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she <b>can</b> <b>file</b> form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E
500|$|Generally, the Armenian {{nationalist}} groups {{claim the}} area {{east of the}} boundary drawn by US President Woodrow Wilson for the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation and groups supporting the concept of United Armenia claim that the Treaty of Sèvres, signed on 10 August 1920 between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies, including Armenia is the only legal document determining the border between Armenia and Turkey. Armenia's Former Deputy Foreign Minister Ara Papian claims that [...] "Wilsonian Armenia", the territory granted to the Republic of Armenia in 1920 by Wilson in {{the scope of the}} Treaty of Sèvres, is still de jure part of Armenia today. According to him the Treaty of Kars, which determined the current Turkish-Armenian border, has no legal value because it was signed between two internationally unrecognized subjects: Bolshevik Russia and Kemalist Turkey.

2500|$|In the Register's {{earliest}} years, {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPO were small, understaffed and underfunded. Indeed, money was tight, but funds {{were still being}} supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first in house museums [...] and institutional buildings but later in commercial structures as well. During this time period, the SHPO had little time to devote to serious planning, even if it wanted to; the demands of saving historic properties and building the organizations {{from the ground up}} consumed most of the early state office's resources. As a result, neither the State Historic Preservation Offices nor OAHP really took planning seriously. In 1969 Connally told Charles Lee, a State Historic Preservation Officer from South Carolina, [...] "write a paragraph of two on each of these headings.

A spokesman for the agency says it has closed three-quarters of the complaints, typically because it found no violation or after it provided informal guidance to the parties involved." [...] However, in July 2011, UCLA agreed to pay $865,500 in a settlement regarding potential HIPAA violations.

2500|$|The Court's opinion {{stated that}} in {{interpreting}} a statute, courts [...] "look {{first to the}} statutory language {{and then to the}} legislative history if the statutory language is unclear." [...] Here, the relevant statute was Section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code, which defines who may be a debtor under the different chapters or types of bankruptcy case. [...] Section 109(d) provides that [...] "nly a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title, except a stockbroker or a commodity broker, and a railroad may be a debtor under chapter 11 of this title." [...] In turn, Section 109(b) provides that [...] " [...] person may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title" [...] as long as the person is not a railroad, insurance company, or bank or similar financial institution. Nothing in the text of the Code requires that only businesses or individuals engaged in a business <b>can</b> <b>file</b> for chapter 11 reorganization.

2500|$|Farmer {{strongly}} {{disapproved of}} card check. When he first joined the NLRB, Farmer could not muster {{a majority in}} favor of limiting the practice. In Southeastern Rubber Mfg.

Months later, after a shift in NLRB membership, Farmer assumed chairmanship {{of the board and}} was able to overturn Southeastern Rubber Mfg. Co.. [...] In The Walmac Co., the Farmer-led majority specifically overturned M.H. Davidson, finding that the election outcome was final. A year later, the Farmer board went even further. [...] It held in Aiello Dairy Farms that a union has a choice when an employer refuses to recognize the union based on authorization cards: The union can proceed to election, or it <b>can</b> <b>file</b> a ULP alleging that the employer has refused to bargain. Since proving the latter was almost impossible under Southeastern Rubber Mfg. Co., unions were effectively barred from seeking recognition based on card check. In his opinion in Aiello Dairy Farms, Farmer argued that the change in policy was need to prevent unions from wasting the board's time and the public's money by seeking two chances to prove majority status.|$|E
2500|$|When Romney {{suggested}} {{confusion over}} the 1913 law justified postponing {{the implementation of}} Goodridge, Mary Bonauto, the lawyer who successfully argued Goodridge, suggested he get the law repealed: [...] "If he's so concerned about problems, he <b>can</b> <b>file</b> an emergency bill to repeal that law. Massachusetts has basically said discriminating against people {{of the same sex}} is unconstitutional. So why would we try so hard to uphold another state's discriminatory law?" [...] She asked: [...] "Under the governor's logic, if some state again started banning marriages between Catholics and Protestants, then would Massachusetts enforce that?" [...] In an interview on April 23 Romney said: [...] "Massachusetts should not become the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage. We do not intend to export our marriage confusion to the entire nation." [...] His spokesman announced he was sending letters to the governors and attorneys general of the other states to explain his view that same-sex marriage was not legal in their state and asking [...] "if we're wrong" [...] about that. Denying license to all out-state couples became known as [...] "the Romney plan". It also allowed visitors from Ontario to marry, since same-sex marriage was legal there. The Governor's legal counsel, Daniel Winslow, warned that a Justice of the Peace who could not in conscience officiate at a same-sex wedding should resign.|$|E
