This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This {{is the type of}} flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it.

2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be <b>carbonizing</b> (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.|$|E

30|$|The {{adsorption}} {{properties of}} wood <b>carbonized</b> at various temperatures were investigated using a mixed gas containing toluene and α-pinene. Hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) samples <b>carbonized</b> at 500 °– 1100 °C {{were exposed to}} gas mixtures of toluene and α-pinene at 20 °C. The samples <b>carbonized</b> at 500 °– 700 °C only adsorbed toluene, whereas those <b>carbonized</b> at 800 °– 1100 °C adsorbed both toluene and α-pinene. Analysis of the surface structure of the <b>carbonized</b> wood by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature indicated that the sample <b>carbonized</b> at 700 °C had micropores mainly 0.6 nm in diameter and few mesopores, whereas the samples <b>carbonized</b> at 900 °C and 1100 °C had mesopores and micropores larger than 0.8 nm in diameter. With the sample <b>carbonized</b> at 700 °C, the flat-shaped toluene molecules could probably penetrate into the narrower pores, 0.8 nm in diameter, whereas the bulky globular-shaped α-pinene molecules could not. Carbonization at temperatures higher than 900 °C probably enlarged the pore size and thereby reduced the selectivity of adsorption. The results revealed that wood <b>carbonized</b> below activation temperature has a unique flat-pore structure that seems {{to work as a}} kind of molecular sieving carbon, successfully removing only the harmful volatile organic compound (VOC), toluene, and leaving behind a pleasant aroma of α-pinene in the atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|The {{manufactured}} bamboo flooring {{commonly found}} in North American markets is very highly processed. A Bamboo flooring is typically made by slicing mature bamboo poles or culms into strips. These culms are crosscut to length and then sliced into strips depending on the width desired. The outer skin and nodes are removed. To remove starch and sugars the strips of bamboo are boiled in a solution of boric acid or lime. The bamboo is then dried and planed. Natural bamboo color is similar to beech wood. If a darker color similar to oak is desired, the bamboo goes through a <b>carbonizing</b> process of steaming under controlled pressure and heat. The <b>carbonizing</b> process can reduce the floor's final hardness significantly compared to non-carbonized bamboo, rendering it softer than some pines and softer than more common red oak.|$|E

Our research group for several years she has been the development of adsorbent materials for industrial wastewater treatment and rivers. In this research compares the porosity developed by two different treatments using bovine bones to adsorb metal ions. Using bovine bones as raw material, two <b>carbonized</b> samples were obtained under different conditions. One of the <b>carbonized</b> samples was obtained in an oxidizing atmosphere at up to 600 ℃ for 2 hours. The other was obtained in an inert atmosphere at up to 800 ℃, during 2 hours.
