50|$|In October 2009 it was {{confirmed}} that the Byrom Street cutting was a hitching and unhitching point for trains being cable hauled to Edge Hill via the Victoria Tunnel. Shunting locomotives took trains from The Waterloo Good Station to the cutting to be hitched onto the cable. The Cutting was also a water and fuelling point for shunters. After 1895 <b>cable</b> <b>hauling</b> ceased and locomotives pulled trains the whole length of the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. Byrom Street Cutting became a runaway catch point for runaway trains in the tunnel. Byrom Street cutting was never a passenger station. The Victoria and Waterloo tunnels were cleared of debris and reflectors placed on the roof after a survey of the tunnels.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give <b>cable</b> <b>hauling</b> speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E

50|$|Until 1923 {{there was}} no through tram service between Leith and Edinburgh; at the {{boundary}} in Leith Walk {{it was necessary to}} change from a Leith tram (electrically powered) to an Edinburgh tram (<b>cable</b> <b>hauled)</b> until the electrification of the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways in the early 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The lifts at Mt. Baker are {{not named}} but {{referred}} to by number. All are fixed-grip quads. Chairs 3 and 4 access the same point from different sides of the mountain using a continuous loop of <b>cable</b> (<b>haul</b> rope); there is a mid-station at the top for unloading only.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{from the}} {{mountain}} was harvested from the early 1900s to the mid 1920s with seven <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> tramways moving logs from the Ben Cairn - Donna Buang ridge down to sawmills near Warburton. While the forest has regrown and the mountain appears to have never been logged, relics such as tram rails and cables can still {{be found in the}} forest.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{universal}} introduction of electric power, many tramways were <b>cable</b> <b>hauled,</b> with a continuous cable carried in a conduit under the road, and with a slot in the road surface through which the tram could clasp the cable for motion. This system can still be seen in San Francisco in California {{as well as the}} system of the Great Orme in Wales. These needed a rather more substantial track formation.|$|R
50|$|The {{gradient}} {{profile of}} the line had been arranged so as to concentrate the steep grades in three places (either side of Rainhill at 1 in 100 {{and down to the}} docks at Liverpool at 1 in 50) and make the rest of the line very gently graded, say 1 in 2,000. To determine whether and which locomotives would be suitable, the directors organised the Rainhill Trials. When the line opened, the final passenger section from Edge Hill to Crown Street railway station was <b>cable</b> <b>hauled,</b> as was the section down the Wapping Tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.34 km Victoria Tunnel/Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool, England, {{was bored}} under a {{metropolis}} opening in 1848. The tunnel was initially {{used only for}} rail freight serving the Waterloo Freight terminal, and later freight and passengers serving the Liverpool ship liner terminal. The tunnel's path is from Edge Hill in {{the east of the}} city to the north end Liverpool docks at Waterloo Dock. The tunnel is split into two tunnels with a short open air cutting linking the two. The cutting is where the <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> trains from Edge Hill were hitched and unhitched. The two tunnels are effectively one on the same centre line and are regarded as one. However, as initially the 2375 m long Victoria section was originally <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> and the shorter 862 m Waterloo section was locomotive hauled, two separate names were given, the short section was named the Waterloo Tunnel. In 1895 the two tunnels were converted to locomotive haulage. Used until 1972, the tunnel is still in excellent condition. A short section of the Victoria tunnel at Edge Hill is still used for shunting trains. The tunnel is being considered for reuse by the Merseyrail network. Stations cut into the tunnel are being considered and also reuse by a monorail system from the proposed Liverpool Waters redevelopment of Liverpool's Central Docks has been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the opening}} of the <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> Clay Street Hill Railroad in 1873, {{pressure}} grew to convert the city's horsecar lines to the new form of traction. In 1882, Leland Stanford and associates bought the Market Street Railroad Company and converted its lines to cable haulage. In the process, the company's name was changed to the Market Street Cable Railway Company. This company was to grow to become San Francisco's largest cable car operator. At its peak, it operated five lines all of which converged into Market Street to a common terminus at the Ferry Building; during rush hours a cable car left that terminus every 15 seconds.|$|R

50|$|Internally {{the quarry}} {{connected}} to the tramway via a <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> incline that lifted the loaded slate wagons approximately 10 ft from the quarry's mill level to the junction with the tramway. This was operational by 1888, and initially got its power from the portable steam engine which powered the mill. Later it was powered by an air winch, supplied with compressed air by an Ingersoll Rand single cylinder compressor. After 1912, when the quarry was not operating, but slates were still being exported from the stackyard, the haulier on the Rhiwbach Tramway was paid 3 pence per waggon to haul {{them up to the}} tramway with his horse. From the 1930s, waggons were removed by the Tramway locomotive. This was limited to two waggons at a time, as the gradient from the stackyard to the tramway was roughly 1 in 50.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electric}} railway in Great Britain was Volk's Electric Railway in Brighton, {{a pleasure}} railway, {{which opened in}} 1883, still functioning to this day. The London Underground began operating electric services using a fourth rail system in 1890 on the City and South London Railway, {{now part of the}} London Underground Northern line. The Liverpool Overhead Railway followed in 1893, being designed from the outset to be electric traction, unlike the City and South London Railway which was designed to be <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> initially. Main line electrification of some suburban lines began {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, using a variety of different systems. In 1921 a government committee chose 1,500VDC overhead to be the national standard, but little implementation followed and many different systems co-existed. During the interwar period, the Southern Railway adopted the 660 V DC third rail system as its standard and greatly expanded this system across its network of lines south of London.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} a <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> street railway in California belonged to Benjamin Brooks, who {{was not able to}} {{accomplish}} it {{due to the lack of}} capital. Instead, Andrew Hallidie, a Scottish emigre, gave San Francisco the first effective and commercially successful route, using steel cables. Hallidie was a manufacturer of such cables. The system featured a man operated grip, which was able to start the carrier and stop it safely as well. The rope that was used allowed the independent use of more than one cable car at once and soon Hallidie`s concept was extended to the whole city of San Francisco. The carriers had a capacity of between 14 and 16 people but during the rush hours, they could fit between 24 and 26 passengers without any problems. The tickets cost about 5 cents, which was relatively expensive for back then but still seems unbelievable compared to the price today - approximately 5 dollars! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool, England, is {{a former}} railway tunnel, [...] long, which opened in 1849. Its western end was at 53.414829, -2.994385, {{underneath}} Pall Mall. From here the line continued under Great Howard Street to Waterloo Goods railway station, now {{the site of the}} Kingsway Tunnel Ventilation Shaft, after 1895 continuing beyond to the dock railway system and on to Liverpool Riverside at the Pier Head for direct connection to the passenger liners. The eastern end opens into a short (...) cutting, four tracks wide between Byrom Street and Fontenoy Street, which connects to the Victoria Tunnel, which emerges at Edge Hill station. It is effectively one long tunnel from Edge Hill to Liverpool Waterloo Dock with two names along its route. The tunnels were given two different names because initially trains in the Victoria Tunnel were <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> and in the Waterloo Tunnel locomotive hauled. Both tunnels closed on 19 November 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The London Underground was {{the first}} {{underground}} railway in the world, and {{remains one of the}} most extensive. Its construction began in 1860 with the 3.7 mi Metropolitan Railway from Farringdon to Paddington. It was opened in 1863, having caused much disruption by the use of [...] "cut and cover" [...] techniques, which involved digging large trenches along the course of existing roads, and then constructing a roof over the excavation to reinstate the road surface. Tube railways, which caused little disruption because they were constructed by boring a tunnel, arrived in 1890, with the opening of the City and South London Railway, a 3.5 mi line from Stockwell to King William Street. It was planned as a <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> railway, but the advent of electric traction resulted in a simpler solution, and the change was made before the cable system was built. It thus became the world's first electric tube railway. Although the whole system comprises 249 mi of track, only about 45 per cent is actually below ground.|$|R

60|$|Presently a {{ring-shaped}} lifebuoy, {{with something}} {{like a pair of}} short breeches dangling from it, came out from the shore, suspended to a block which traversed on the <b>cable,</b> and was <b>hauled</b> out by means of the whip.|$|R
50|$|The {{third section}} {{does not have}} supports. It is 948.42 metres long, has a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> of 20 mm and a {{carrying}} cable of 40 mm in diameter. The drive {{is located in the}} lower station and has an output of 120 kW and maximum speed of 8 m/s.|$|R
500|$|An {{emergency}} brake engages {{if the air}} pressure needed to control the incline is insufficient; the brake also engages if a dead man's switch is tripped in the operator's booth. In addition to the <b>hauling</b> <b>cables,</b> a [...] safety cable capable of withstanding [...] is also connected to the cars.|$|R
50|$|During the winter, the {{remaining}} two gondola towers and each terminal’s machinery were built at the Garaventa factory in Goldau, Switzerland and the Doppelmayr factories in Wolfurt, Austria and St. Jerome, Quebec. Fatzer AG manufactured the four track <b>cables</b> and <b>haul</b> rope that would suspend the gondola cabins. The five spools of cable left Europe by ship on April 10, 2008. By the time construction started again {{in the spring of}} 2008, ten feet of snow still covered the mountains and concrete had to be transported up the mountain by helicopter. Towers 4 and 1 were completed in early spring using mobile cranes.|$|R
50|$|The Whitby and Pickering Railway {{was opened}} in 1836, with the incline from Beckhole to Goathland {{worked as a}} rope <b>hauled</b> <b>cable</b> railway. A railway station was established.

50|$|The B-29 {{played an}} {{important}} role in developing the effective use of aerial refueling during the late 1940s. The first aircraft involved in this programme were the KB-29M tanker and B-29MR receiver. At first, a grappling system, known as the looped hose method, was used; the tanker would formate behind, above and to the left of the receiver. It would then unreel a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> attached to a 55lb weight (to make it dangle near vertically). The receiver would trail a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> ending in a drag cone (to make this trail near horizontally) and a grapnel. With both cables trailed, the tanker would cross to the right of the receiver so the two cables snagged each other. With cables snagged, the tanker hauled both into its fuselage where the receiver's cable was connected to the tanker's hose. This was then hauled into the receiver. After connecting with internal fuel compartments pumping would begin. When the receiver was full the process was reversed allowing the tanker to recover its hose and the receiver its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable.</b> While this system was clumsy, it was often used in the late 1940s before a better system was developed. It was most notably used to refuel the Lucky Lady II during her famous circumnavigation of the globe in 1949. The ability of the USAF to circumnavigate the globe demonstrated that its bombers could strike at any target. This helped sway the argument as to whether the USAF or US Navy should provide the US's nuclear delivery capability. The USAF won with the consequential massive expansion of the USAF's Strategic Air Command and cancellation of the US Navy's super carriers.|$|R
50|$|The haul rope is 7,875 feet (2400m) of 35mm {{solid core}} cable. The cable has a {{breaking}} strength of 172,230 lb. The <b>haul</b> <b>cable</b> operates at 30,050 lb (15 tons) tension per side. The cabins ride on 2 each 50 mm double locking coil track ropes. Each cable is 3526 ft (1075 m) long with a breaking strength of 616,700 lbs. All cables were manufactured by Fatzer of Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|The Burgberg Cable Car (Burgbergseilbahn) is a {{cable car}} in Bad Harzburg, Germany. It {{was built in}} 1929 by the Bleichert {{engineering}} corporation and has a length of 481 metres. Its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> has a diameter of 18 mm, its carrying cable a diameter of 37 mm. It is driven by a [...] engine at the summit station. It has two cabins carrying up to 18 passengers each.|$|R
6000|$|The first {{difficulty}} {{and the great}} danger was to pass the cable from the stern to the bow, and to turn the ship round, so as {{to enable them to}} steam up to the <b>cable</b> while <b>hauling</b> it in. Iron chains were lashed firmly to the cable at the stern, and secured to a wire-rope carried round the outside of the ship to the picking-up apparatus at the bows. The cable was down in 400 fathoms of water when the paying-out ceased, and nice management was required to keep the ship steady, as she had now no steerage-way; and oh! with what intense interest and curiosity and wonder did Robin Wright regard the varied and wonderful mechanical appliances, with which the whole affair was accomplished! ...|$|R
50|$|The cableway, {{which is}} {{operated}} by the Zugspitzbahn AG, is a reversible system with two carrying cables and no pylons. Its carrying cables have a diameter of 50 mm; its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> a diameter of 34 mm.Drive is provided by 2 motors each of 210 kW in the valley station. The cabins of the Zugspitze Glacier cable car have a capacity of 100 people and can transport 1,000 people per hour in each direction.|$|R
