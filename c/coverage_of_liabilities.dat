40|$|Operation of {{a nuclear}} {{installation}} is connected {{with the creation of}} long-term liabilities for spent fuel management and disposal, and also decommissioning of the installation (power plant, storages). This means that the operator will have to expend considerable amount of financial resources over a long period after the closure of installation. These financial resources will have to be created during operation of the installation. Related costs to be expended in future must be fully included in the price of electricity, in order to ensure fair competition among different operators. Financial resources for future <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> must be continuously invested in order to compensate for inflation and to gain some real interest. Any failure by the operator to comply with its liabilities poses an economic and potentially an environmental hazard for operator’s country. Due attention must therefore be paid to assessing connected costs, defining liabilities and ensuring appropriate regulatory oversight. Appropriate measures must be well defined and firmly anchored in the legislation of countries operating nuclear installations. This paper reviews the basic principles that should ensure operator’s compliance their liabilities, and maps the current situation in the Czech Republic. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent sociological and {{historical}} work suggests that insurance risks often are not reliably calculable, except in hindsight. Insurance is “an uncertain business,” characterized by competition for premiums that pushes insurers into the unknown. This essay takes some preliminary steps that extend this {{insight into the}} liability insurance field. The essay first provides a simple quantitative comparison of U. S. property and liability insurance premiums over the last sixty years, setting the stage to make three points: (1) liability insurance premiums have grown at a similar rate as property insurance premiums and GDP over this period, providing yet another piece of evidence supporting {{the view that the}} growth in U. S. liability costs represents an ordinary consequence of a growing economy rather than an unusual or pernicious feature of U. S. culture; (2) there are systematic variations in the rate of growth in insurance premiums over time that are more pronounced in liability insurance than in property insurance; and (3) because the media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance intensifies during the periods when liability insurance premiums increase sharply, the widely held beliefs in the “litigation explosion” and related myths may result, at least in part, from generalizations drawn from a systematically biased set of observations. The essay then moves in a more qualitative, suggestive direction, exploring the changing terrain of risk and uncertainty on the liability insurance field, closing with the admittedly speculative conclusion that the insurance underwriting cycle might be both a cause and a consequence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurers’ efforts to push the liability and insurability frontier...|$|R

40|$|The sale <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> {{insurance}} presents {{us with a}} basic question. On one hand, individuals want {{to purchase}} liability insurance coverage, suggesting that its ownership is socially good. On the other, the risk against which liability coverage protects its holders is having to pay legally-mandated sanctions. And because the purpose of legal sanctions is in significant part to discourage and to punish unwanted behavior, the fundamental issue arises whether liability insurance might undermine {{the effect of the}} law and thus be socially undesirable. This concern led to early resistance against the sale <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance, and reservations about the wisdom <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance are reflected today by certain limitations on the sale <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b> However, <b>liability</b> insurance is widely held, and without apparently untoward consequences for the functioning of the legal system.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} guest {{editorial}} is {{to place}} the issues discussed at the Seminar 1 —and specifically those concerning the insurance <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>liability</b> risks—in context.

Of course, history never exactly repeats itself. But {{it is also true that}} almost nothing is ever entirely new. Therefore, what I find is that there are both parallels between the current situation and the past, and differences between the past and the present. The first part of this editorial looks at the history of corporate insurance in the United States over the past 30 years. This is a history of both insurance against liability for bodily injury and property damage, and <b>of</b> insurance against <b>liability</b> for corporate wrongdoing that results in financial losses.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{criticism of}} the tort is that it leads to abuse <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance <b>coverage.</b> Most liability insurance policies provide for <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> negligently inflicted injuries but exclude <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> intentionally inflicted injuries. If a victim is intentionally injured by a person, many theorists perceive that the victim will tend to recast the claim as being one for negligence in order to fall within the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the insurance policy.|$|R
40|$|Medical {{malpractice}} insurance policies customarily contain a “cooperation” clause requiring insureds {{to cooperate with}} the insurer’s efforts to defend the insured against a claim. A common stipulation in this clause forbids the insured from “admitting liability ” to an injured or harmed party. Health professionals often understand this clause to have a chilling effect on the truthful disclosure of medical error, which is morally required of physicians when they know that a harm-causing error has occurred. This paper offers a two-part response to the fear that medical error disclosure might result in a denial <b>of</b> {{malpractice insurance}} <b>coverage.</b> Part one describes various legal precedents wherein insurers successfully invoked the cooperation clause to deny <b>coverage</b> in instances <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> admission. This paper shows, however, that the legally sanctioned reasons for denying coverage in these cases address factors other than an insured’s truthful and honest disclosure of what happened to a claimant. Consequently, these cases do not support the belief that legal precedents discourage the truthful disclosure of harm-causing medical errors. Part two of this paper proposes that the cooperation clause’s prohibition <b>of</b> admission <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in instances <b>of</b> medical error disclosure might well be unenforceable, and that the clause might not even be actuarially sound...|$|R

40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause in a professional services contract. Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom of contract.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R
