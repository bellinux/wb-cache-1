25|$|The {{objective}} of the workshops was to recognize and celebrate neglected forms of artistic expression. The ministry created a program of cultural workshops known as, Casas de Cultura and Centros Populares de Cultura. The workshops were set up in poor neighbourhoods and rural areas and advocated universal access and consumption of art in Nicaragua. The ministry assisted {{in the creation of}} theatre groups, folklore and artisanal production, song groups, new journals of creation and cultural criticism, and training programs for <b>cultural</b> <b>workers.</b> The ministry created a Sandinista daily newspaper named Barricada and its weekly cultural addition named Ventana along with the Television Sandino, Radio Sandino and the Nicaraguan film production unit called the INCINE. There were existing papers which splintered after the revolution and produced other independent, pro-Sandinista newspapers, such as El Nuevo Diario and its literary addition Nuevo Amanecer Cultural. Editorial Nueva Nicaragua, a state publishing house for literature, was also created. The ministry collected and published political poetry of the revolutionary period, known as testimonial narrative, a form of literary genre that recorded the experiences of individuals {{in the course of the}} revolution.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet intelligentsiya {{arose from}} the ideological {{commitment}} of the Communist government for the education (professional, scientific, technical) of Russia. Initially, the status-class form of the technocrat intelligentsia was undefined; hence, {{as a measure of}} employability, the Russian bureaucracy classified the mental labour of professionals, scientists, and artists as was classified the physical labour of proletarian workers. So classified, the intellectuals were formally consolidated into intellectual-worker trade unions, such as the Union of Soviet Writers and the Union of Soviet Composers, and given strict standards for evaluating their work, enforced by the corresponding expert boards. In the late Soviet Union the term [...] "intelligentsia" [...] acquired a formal definition of mental and <b>cultural</b> <b>workers.</b> There were subcategories of [...] "scientific-technical intelligentsia" [...] (научно-техническая интеллигенция) and [...] "creative intelligentsia" [...] (творческая интеллигенция).|$|E
