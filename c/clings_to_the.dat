5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him {{nothing more than a}} pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris mates {{once every}} 12–18 months and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young loris <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belly of its mother. After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile during the months of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.|$|E

5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E
5|$|While on foot patrol, Police Constable Don Ross (Anthony Oliver) chances upon {{a gang of}} lorry hijackers {{operating}} {{from the back of}} a transport café. After seeing Diamond (George Murcell) and Johnny (David Graham) drive off in a car with the manageress, Connie Williams (Miriam Karlin), apparently being held hostage in the back seat, Ross jumps onto and <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's side; however, he is quickly thrown into the road, suffering a head injury. Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E
25|$|Pollution levels rise {{significantly}} in winter when cold air <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soil. Rain is more frequent during spring; summer {{is subject to}} thunderstorms and, occasionally, violent hailstorms.|$|E

25|$|Anny – Anny is an English {{woman who}} was once Antoine's lover. After meeting with him, Anny {{makes it clear that}} she has changed a {{considerable}} amount and must go on with her life. Antoine <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past, hoping that she may want to redefine their relationship, but he is ultimately rejected by her.|$|E
25|$|In the Theravada tradition, {{suffering}} {{arises when}} one identifies with or <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition {{asserts that the}} nature of all aggregates is intrinsically empty of independent existence. The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It is not shared by Hinduism and Jainism, which believe that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.|$|E
25|$|Horseshoe Bay is a {{residential}} and commercial district of Vancouver on {{the southern edge of}} the Sea-to-Sky Highway. The highway <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliffside above the BC Ferry terminal at Horseshoe Bay. Restaurants, tourist shops and galleries, a pub or two and recreational marinas are also situated in the community. Ferries from Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver go to Departure Bay in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, Bowen Island, and Langdale on the Sunshine Coast, which is the ferry terminal for the southern Sunshine Coast.|$|E

25|$|George's {{family is}} {{struggling}} {{to deal with her}} death. Her mother, Joy, is depressed, and visibly repressing it. Her father, Clancy (Greg Kean), is having an affair. Her sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), acts out– stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school and hanging them on a tree– until her mother sends her to therapy. Reggie <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that George visits her, but she is starting to lie to cover this up. At the start of Season 2, the family begins to break apart as Joy and Clancy divorce.|$|E
25|$|East Rock hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barren edges of cliffs. Cooler north facing backslopes tend to support extensive stands of eastern hemlock interspersed with the oak-hickory forest species more common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|In {{the climax}} of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Percy returns {{to his family and}} manages to make up with all of them, and {{eventually}} duels new Minister for Magic and Voldemort puppet Pius Thicknesse in the Battle of Hogwarts. While dueling Thicknesse, Percy announces that he is resigning, the first joke he has made in many years, much to Fred's delight. While dueling alongside Percy, his brother Fred Weasley is killed in an explosion, and Percy <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corpse and shields it from further damage. In {{the last part of the}} battle, he and his father work together to defeat Thicknesse. His final appearance is in the book's epilogue, at King's Cross Station, talking loudly about broom regulations.|$|E

50|$|In later years, and to {{preserve}} its main draw, TC has been <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larger models that have mostly gone out of use in Argentine roads, and incorporated imported engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of lycra <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stocking yarn was possibly the biggest break-through in hosiery manufacturing, the result being thigh highs that combine elasticity with <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> <b>cling</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg.|$|R
25|$|West Rock Ridge hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barren edges of cliffs. Lower eastern slopes tend to support oak-hickory forest species common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines support eastern hemlock that block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. These hemlocks have suffered from infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut. Because the ridge generates such varied terrain, it is the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare.|$|E
25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying back out to bring in more pulps. During this process, the queen <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
25|$|Talcott Mountain hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barren edges of cliffs. Cooler east-facing backslopes tend to support extensive stands of eastern hemlock interspersed with the oak-hickory forest species more common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut. Because the trap rock ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare.|$|E
25|$|Pleural {{thickening}} {{may cause}} blunting of the costophrenic angle, but is distinguished from pleural fluid {{by the fact}} that it occurs as a linear shadow ascending vertically and <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ribs.|$|R
50|$|Tobotobo Sea Garden in the Toboto village, {{which is}} ideal for snorkelling and diving. Thousands of bats are seen here <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mangrove}} trees. White and blue pigeons take bath here.|$|R
50|$|Kae and Longopoa did not await this happening. They {{had agreed}} to desert this foolish trip and they made it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reef, Kae <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree, and Longopoa <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock.|$|R
25|$|The Holyoke Range hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent Berkshire plateau containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Because the traprock ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare, such as the timber rattlesnake.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{agrees to}} help the Doctor {{stop the spread of}} Entropy by {{adapting}} the Pharos Project radio telescope on Earth so that they are able to reopen the CVEs. However, when the Master tries to take control of it, the Doctor runs out under the upturned radio dish to sever the cable linking the Master to the CVEs. The Master makes the dish start rotating so that the Doctor will fall to his death. Before he falls, he manages to tear out the cable, only to leave his companions watching as he <b>clings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cable. As his grip begins to slip, he sees visions of all the enemies he's faced over the years, then falls. Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gather around the mortally wounded Doctor and call out his name. The Doctor begins seeing visions of all his companions and even the Brigadier calling his name.|$|E
