50|$|A {{hypersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} {{is designed to}} generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power <b>compressor</b> <b>installation</b> instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 - 212 This {{paper will}} review the best {{practices}} for installation of a centrifugal air compressor without a sound enclosure to obtain the best acoustic environment for reduced operating noise levels. An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and installation of accessory hardware associated with the <b>compressor</b> <b>installation</b> will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and valves for noise reduction, drain line noise attenuation, inlet silencer selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction. In any case, when the compressor is in operation, the noise level measured with a sound level meter is often higher than the actual compressor generated noise.

40|$|This project focusses on {{the study}} of the energy {{efficiency}} in production machines. The main objectives that we seek with the project are: 	Developing an energy monitoring system 	Making a guideline for the design, maintenance and modification of energy efficient equipment or machines, based on our measurement results. The first step is to make a test installation to measure the efficiency of the motor. Afterwards the efficiency of this engine in combination with a gearbox, a pump and a <b>compressor</b> <b>installation</b> are measured. The test installation has to be built with a 4 KW electrical engine, but it must also be valid for other engines. Therefore the design should allow the regulation of the elements that compose the test stand due to the difference in dimensions between the different electrical motors. My goal with this project is to design, calculate and prepare the different test installations in accordance with the machine directives and the related norms. On the one hand we have to choose the necessary equipment following my own design and doing the necessary calculations, {{and on the other hand}} deal with companies in order to get the best offers for our tests. In the first test installation all the technical data we need are measured and the efficiency of the engine showing the results in an ISO efficiency graph is calculated. The next step includes showing the behaviour of the engine when we use it in a pump- or <b>compressor</b> <b>installation</b> and measuring the efficiency of the installation in different conditions (with misalignment, dirty filter, bad settings, over-dimensioning, etc.). The purpose of these last tests is to see the influence of faults in dimensioning, installation, maintenance or use.

40|$|After air {{and water}} mixing, the process of gas {{compression}} in the downcomer shaft or pipe of a hydraulic air compressor is considered nearly isothermal due to (i) the mass {{flow rate of water}} being typically of three orders higher than that of the gas it compresses, (ii) water having a heat capacity approximately four times that of air, and (iii) the intimate contact and large heat transfer area between the gas phase and the liquid phase of the bubbly flow. A formulation for estimation of the efficiency of a closed-or open-loop hydraulic air compressor, expressed in terms of the principal hydraulic air compressor design variables, is presented. The influence of a hitherto underappreciated factor affecting the performance of these installations, such as the solubility of the gas being compressed in the water, is explored. A procedure for estimating the yield of compressed gas, accounting for these solubility losses, is explained and used to determine the mechanical efficiency of historical hydraulic air <b>compressor</b> <b>installations</b> from reported performance data. The result is a significant downward revision of hydraulic air compressor efficiency by approximately 20 % points in comparison to most reported efficiencies. However, through manipulation of cosolute concentrations in the water, and the temperature of the water (through regulation of the ejection of compression heat), the mechanical efficiency can be increased to the formerly reported levels. The thermoeconomic implication of these efficiency determinations is that in a modern context, hydraulic air compressors may be able to outperform conventional mechanical gas compression equipment...|$|R

40|$|Low-pressure, low-producing {{natural gas}} wells {{commonly}} encounter liquid loading during production. Because {{of the decline}} in the reservoir pressure and the flow capacity, wells can fall below terminal velocity. Identifying and predicting the onset of liquid loading allows the operators to plan and prepare for combating the liquid loading hence saving valuable reserves and downtime. The present industrial applications of artificial lift, wellhead pressure reduction by <b>compressor</b> <b>installation</b> at the wellheads and reduction in tubing size are costly and often intermittent. The thesis examines the above aspects to generate a workflow for identifying and predicting the liquid loading conclusively and also assessing the application of Auger Tool and foam combination towards achieving a cost effective and more efficient solution for liquid unloading. In chapters I-IV, I describe the process of using production surveillance software of Halliburton Digital Consulting Services, named DSS (Dynamic Surveillance Software), to create a workflow of identifying the liquid loaded wells based on well data on daily basis for field personnel and engineers. This workflow also decides the most cost effective solution to handle it. Moreover, it can perform decline analysis to predict the conditions of liquid loading. In chapters V-VIII of the thesis, I describe the effort of handling the problem of liquid loading in a cost effective manner by introduction of an inexpensive Auger Tool in the bottomhole assembly and using WhiteMax surfactant soapstick from J&J Solutions. Four different combinations of well completion and fluid were tested for performance in respect to liquid hold up, pressure loss in the tubing, unloading efficiency and critical flow requirement. The test facilities and instruments, along with the operational methods, are discussed in chapter VI. Except for the reduction of the operational envelope with the inclusion of Auger Tool, the performance improved with the insertion of Auger Tool. The best combination of Auger and foam system could be a result of flow modification by the Auger Tool caused by reduced pressure loss and increase in drag coefficient and also by reduced density and surface tension of foam...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{behaving}} {{trends for}} the gas wells {{is one of the}} importance subjects that have to be known for the confidence production fore casting expectations. Once the pressure demand will not be in the ranges that can allow gas to reach the intended customer, there is a need of analyze when that happens and what measures has to be taken in order to return the operating pressure into their normal routine. Normally gas compression is done in order to boost gas pressure and hence returns into the normal intended operating conditions. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze how feasible the process of increasing gas capacity in Songo Songo gas field, from currently 101 MMscft/d to 200 MMscft/d will be, in terms of the gas transportation pressure. The plan of gas capacity increasing was early planned to start in 2015 year. The field currently contains seven production wells, SS- 3, SS- 4, SS- 5, SS- 7, SS- 9, SS- 10 and SS- 11. Among those wells only SS- 4, SS- 7, SS- 10 and SS- 11 are the currently operating wells. The remaining wells were closed because of the corrosion problems PanAfrican Energy Tanzania (2011). In order to meet 200 MMscft/d target, Management decided to re-work over the closed wells, drilling a new well, SS- 12 and adding another gas processing train. In order to have precise prediction, field history matching which specifically involves only wells heads pressure matching from the starting of field production (24 / 06 / 2004) up to 30 / 12 / 2008 were conducted. The process of reservoir performance prediction in order to make history match with the existing well heads production data was done by means of IMEX/ CMG Simulation package. Wells which were involved in the history matching process are SS- 3, SS- 4, SS- 5, SS- 7 and SS- 9. These are the only wells which were present during the specified interval of history matching. The chosen reservoir grid blocks tuning factor for the process was permeability. Several grid blocks permeability&# 146;s multiplication factors were used. The only permeability multiplication factor that provides satisfactory well heads pressure matching was 1. 5. IMEX / CMG Simulation package was again used after history matching process for the purpose of reservoir prediction performance analysis form 24 / 06 / 2004 to 30 / 12 / 2025. From the simulation, flowing bottom hole pressure of each well was determined at each time step and further used for the calculation of the well head pressure estimation. The minimum plants wells heads pressures requirements used, in order to allow gas transportation to customers were (1526 psig). Upon the results, it had observed that the field gas production rate of 200 MMScft/d will not be maintained until 2025, it will start to decline early on 02 / 02 / 2022. Also none of the wells will deliver pressure higher or with the same value as the minimum plant requirement {{until the end of the}} study.

Compressed air systems are as essential a utility as electricity, gas, or oil, and can account for a significant percent of a manufacturing facility's electricity bill.

40|$|The {{following}} report documents a California Polytechnic State University, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project {{sponsored by}} the gas turbine manufacturer, Solar Turbines. The senior project team consisted of four senior mechanical engineering students at Cal Poly, all with general concentrations; Ryan Bruce, Carolyn Honeycutt, Steve Oltrogge, and Emmett Ross. Kenneth Thomas sponsored the group and serves as the point of contact between the senior project team and Solar Turbines. He {{is a member of}} the Solar Turbines Mechanical Design Engineering Team and a Cal Poly graduate. Christoph Maurer served as the project team’s on-campus advisor. A gas turbine uses internal combustion to produce output shaft work and can be broken down into a “cold” section and a “hot” section. The cold section is composed of the air inlet and the air compressor, while the hot section is composed of the burner, turbine, and diffuser. This project was focused on the compressor, specifically <b>compressor</b> blade <b>installation.</b> Solar Turbines’ T 130, Mars, and T 250 turbines all contain multi-stage compressors, meaning that many sets of compressor blades spin around a single shaft to continually compress the air as it nears the burner. Many of the compressor stages are installed using a ring method, where the compressor blades are slid into large slots around the compressor rotor, radially, and held into place, axially, by a large ring. These stages require additional hardware to restrain the blades radially. However, the first several stages of the compressor use axially installed fan blades, where each blade slides into an individual slot on the rotor disk and is held in place, radially by the geometry of the compressor. These stages therefore require additional hardware to restrain the axial movement of the blades. This is accomplished via small steel retainer tabs. This project focuses on the installation of these metal retainer tabs. The current process for installing the early stage compressor blades, those requiring retainer tabs, involves several, individual, time-consuming steps. Additionally, there are numerous tools required for each of these steps and every individual installation technician can have an additional, personal set of installation tools. As a result <b>compressor</b> blade <b>installation</b> is a lengthy and imprecise process that leads to inconsistencies and risks damaging the compressor rotor. The task for the Cal Poly senior project group was to design a tool(s) and a corresponding standardized process to bend these retainer tabs into position. The sponsor, Solar Turbines, owns all Intellectual Property for the tools designed during the course of the project. In return, they provided funding for the project, access to necessary company proprietary information, manufacturing support (as needed), and general project guidance. The overall aim of this project was to design a tool or set of tools that removed as much of the variation from compressor blade retainer tab installation as possible. As well as reduced the time spent installing blades, therefore reducing the risk of damage to the turbine blades and rotors from non-standardized processes and tooling. Additionally the team focused on minimizes the number of tools used in the overall process. The final tool design consisted of two tools, a “backing” and a “bending” tool. Each should decrease the installation time, increase consistency, are more ergonomic, and are safer than the current methods...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 75 - 84 There are {{significant}} advantages in using gas lubricated face seals (dry gas seals) in centrifugal compressor service. Foremost {{among these are}} {{the elimination of the}} seal oil system resulting in lower maintenance, increased safety, and higher operating availability. For these reasons, one of four identical <b>compressors</b> at an <b>installation</b> having severe problems with seal oil contamination was selected for trial conversion to dry gas seals. The rotordynamic engineering portion of this job was done by the compressor manufacturer in conjunction with the gas seal supplier. The seal assembly was designed so that it would be essentially a drop-in conversion from a mechanical standpoint. Rotordynamic studies indicated that the conversion would result in a "better" machine. Unfortunately, sustained operations were not possible, due to excessive vibration levels at startup with the new seals. The shaft vibration exceeded 0. 007 in, peak-to-peak, at a subsynchronous frequency of 4900 rpm (the machine rated speed is in excess of 10, 000 rpm). These levels were sufficiently high to cause extensive damage to all internal labyrinths. The midspan labyrinths were wiped open in excess of 0. 060 in, radial. Analysis of tape recorded data indicated that the vibration was due to a rotor/bearing system dynamic instability. Additional computer simulations of the compressor rotordynamics revealed that the oil seals had provided sufficient damping to the system to bound the instability. This extra damping was not being provided by the gas seals. Bearing redesign to increase stability and realignment of the rotor within the bundle to remove suspected excitation appear to have eliminated the problem...|$|R
40|$|IToday, gas {{turbines}} are generally {{used to produce}} electricity and drive natural gas <b>compressors</b> on offshore <b>installations.</b> The performance of {{gas turbines}} is reduced gradually, and this lead to reduced production capacity of the platform. Degradation of performance of a gas turbine also carry with them higher fuel consumption and higher emissions. Degradation rate of gas turbines {{have proven to be}} very site-specific, but compressor fouling is generally the largest contributor to reduced performance. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} good procedures for detecting performance deterioration, and regain lost performance. Today, all gas turbines equipped with standard instrumentation from the manufacturer. Through these sensors performance data is logged continuously, and can be used to make an assessment of the performance and condition of gas turbine. To regain performance offline water wash is typically used. This method has proven to be the most reliable, with a high degree of performance recovery. In the recent years, increasingly stringent demands require higher gas turbine availability and lower environmental emission rates. Online water washing can be a means to achieve this. Daily injection of water into the compressor section reduces the possibility of fouling formation in the compressor section. This allows offline water wash intervals to be extended, while the gas turbine operates with better performance and lower emissions rates. This report contains an evaluation of suitable parameters for detecting compressor fouling. Data was obtained from 9 different LM 2500 gas turbines operating in the North Sea. The results from the evaluations are that it is difficult to say anything concrete on the basis of the collected data. It is possible to detect a degradation trend for several of the machines, but nothing that would indicate that the current water wash program should be reassessed. Pressure loss over the bellmouth of a gas turbine has been pointed out by several sources in the literature review as the simplest and most sensitive parameter to detect compressor fouling. This measurement was not been available for any of the investigated gas turbines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Today Sweden has 341 {{ice hockey}} arenas, around 140 outdoor ice hockey rinks, 60 ice fields for bandy and about 35 curling arenas. In addition, {{the numbers of}} indoor bandy arenas are increasing. The cooling systems {{installed}} today {{should be able to}} lower its energy consumption with 10 - 30 %. In this thesis, Ronneby ice-arena has been researched. This artificial cooling facility was inaugurated 2011 {{and is one of the}} newest in Sweden. This is an outdoor ice field for bandy and therefor has no roof or walls to cover the field. Ronneby ice-arena has problems with uneven cooling distribution of the ice field. This results in cracks and uneven ice quality. These problems also result in higher energy consumption than necessary. To find a solution for the uneven cooling of the ice field flow measurements were carried out in the brine circuit. To get a better understanding of the cooling distribution, temperature measurements were carried out on the brine feeding lines. A calculation has been performed on what energy savings a speed control of the brine circulation pumps depending on the outdoor temperature could generate. Another calculation was made to see the possible savings with a windshield around the field. In this thesis the benefits of a heat recovery system on the cooling compressors refrigerant has been investigated. The heat recovery system could heat the locker rooms, the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. In order to perform the necessary calculation for this thesis, Fredriksbergs BK and Ronneby municipality provided operating data. The actions proposed to Ronneby ice-arena to solve the uneven cooling of the ice field is to change the location of the brine feeding line connection point. At the same time this work is carried out it’s suggested that the brine feed and return lines get insulated. When the uneven cooling problems have been solved, a speed control system should be installed to control the brine circulation pumps, in order to lower the electricity consumption. Ronneby ice-arena has the possibility to install a heat recovery system. Therefore it is suggested to install a heat exchanger on each cooling <b>compressor</b> refrigerant. This <b>installation</b> is to be used to heat the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. The system to cool the condensers with seawater and currently the heat pump are not optimal designed. The installed heat pump does not work when the seawater temperature is below 5 °C, therefore the system should be redesigned...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of wet gas <b>compressors</b> for <b>installation</b> subsea {{is key to}} increase the recovery {{of oil and gas}} from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Safe operation of the compressor depends on understanding of how wet gas affects the behavior of the machine. The compressor operating range is limited by stall and surge, and it is therefore particularly important to determine how liquid will affect the inception of these phenomena. Measuring pressure transients within the compressor or in the inlet and discharge pipe are widely used in experimental investigation of stall and surge. Spectral analysis of the pressure signal is used to detect aerodynamic instabilities in compressor. Pressure measurements are also {{an important part of the}} anti-surge control systems, and it is used for continuous condition monitoring of the machine. It is therefore important to determine how liquid affect the pressure measurements. This thesis consists of three main parts. The first part describes and explains stall and surge, and introduces various pressure measurement techniques that can be used to measure pressure transients in centrifugal compressors. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors are well suited to this. They have a wide operating range, high stability and sensitivity, and are very robust. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and stress-sensitive films (S 3 F) are interesting alternatives. These techniques measure global surface pressure, which is very useful when investigating complex flow fields. The second part investigates how wet gas affects compressor stability, and how liquid presence affect pressure measurements in wet gas flows. Results from the test facility for wet gas compression at NTNU have shown that wet gas has a stabilizing effect on the compressor. Unfortunately, it is difficult to interpret the measurements due to large uncertainties around how liquid affects pressure measurements. Liquid presence may cause suppression and/or enhancement of certain frequencies, and also introduce additional frequencies that are specifically related to the dynamic characteristic of the liquid phase. The existing literature on this particular topic is very limited, but evaluation of various multiphase experiments has given some insight. It has been shown experimentally that droplets entrained in a gas phase dampen out pressure fluctuations. High frequency components will be most affected, but experiments have also shown significant dampening of frequencies down to 100 Hz. The presence of a liquid film is believed to cause amplification of random frequencies in the lower frequency range. Turbulence and vortex formation causes a chaotic and highly dynamic flow pattern in the film, and this will affect the pressure measured at the wall. The liquid film will also reduce the performance of PSP and make the use of S 3 F more complicated. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors will not be directly affected. To increase the understanding of how liquid affects the pressure measurements in wet gas flows an experiment is planned to examine how thin liquid films will affect the surface pressure in wet gas flows. More knowledge in this field is important for future research of wet stall and surge. The economical consequences of stall and surge are massive. In particular if the compressor is installed subsea. Safe running of the compressors is therefore dependent on a anti-surge system that prevents the compressor from becoming unstable. The final part of the report investigates anti-surge control in subsea compression, and how the performance of different systems is affected by liquid. Surge control based on surge avoidance is currently the safest and most reliable technique. However, the performance of these systems is significantly reduced in wet gas compression. Liquid changes the compressor characteristic, and affects the wear and tear of the machine. Liquid presence will also reduce the accuracy of flow, pressure and temperature measurements. By installing dynamic pressure sensors inside the compressor or outside in the connected pipeline, condition monitoring of the machine could be significantly improved. However, due to the challenging subsea environment and the high requirements to sensor performance, it is difficult to finding an optimal sensor is challenging. It is also difficult to determine where the sensors should be installed. This requires knowledge of how the liquid is distributed in the compressor, and will also depend on detailed knowledge of the liquid will affect the pressure measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 113 - 128 A 10, 000 psi high {{pressure}} natural gas injection compressor train was procured, manufactured, tested and {{installed in the}} Boquer?n production facility in Eastern Venezuela. The injection machinery consisted of three (3) parallel slow speed reciprocating gas compressors each driven by a natural gas driven internal combustion engine through a speed reducing gearbox. The equipment had been purchased in an early phase of the project by the original oil company, so {{it could not be}} changed. Due to the critical timing of compression required to maintain reservoir pressure and incremental oil recovery, the equipment could not be changed without large financial consequences. After preliminary review of the purchased equipment, it was recognized early by the engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) design engineering team that the compressor type and selection including the design were not the preferred arrangement. However, due to schedule and contract constraints the selection and design could not be significantly changed. Although the compressor itself was considered properly selected there was considerable attention given to the drive train. This drive train consisted of the internal combustion engine, a gearbox, a steel torque shaft that connected the gearbox to the compressor and an intermediate bearing/bearing support. As the project progressed there were significant design improvements made to improve the safety, operation, and life of the compressor train. The initial design of the torque shaft indicated that it would fail every time the machinery experienced a shutdown. In order to overcome such a failure the drive train included a special coupling with shear bolts that would shear every time the compressor train had shut down, the function of which was to prevent the torque shaft from fatigue failure. Shearing bolts during every shutdown was not considered safe or acceptable operating practice. During the course of the project, there were significant improvements made, first to the torque shaft, and then to the coupling connecting the gearbox to the torque shaft, then to the coupling between the engine and high speed gear pinion. The torsional characteristics were improved significantly with the upgrades and design improvements. After installation, extensive field testing was conducted on each injection gas compressor to ascertain the torsional characteristics of the drive train, including stresses in critical components during the shutdown events. The data confirmed that the torque shaft was in fact designed for infinite life and would not fail from material fatigue as was feared initially. During the design phases engineering consultants were contracted to perform torsional studies to confirm the torsional critical speeds initially predicted by the <b>compressor</b> manufacturer. After <b>installation</b> the same consultant used strain gauges to measure the torsional shear stresses and the torsional critical speeds. There was an enormous amount of valuable engineering data generated during the design verification process and field testing. The authors feel that this information should be shared with others in {{the oil and gas industry}} when considering this type of machinery and machinery train for their {{high pressure}} injection gas compressor services or projects...|$|R
