I liked it all." [...] Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a drug rehabilitation program at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about 10 days in May of that year.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{my parents}} made a partial living weaving baskets, the two {{concepts}} of 'profession' and 'art' never {{came together in}} my mind until... college... I read everything I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [...] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession {{as well as a}} passion.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{ought to}} have spoken first, that is certain; but ere I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> phrases well arranged, the young lady, {{rendered}} desperate I suppose by my hesitation opened the conversation herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he {{afterward}} {{got in my}} way--that is, thrust himself {{between me}} and something I wanted to do--I would try all I <b>could</b> to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> foot on him, and then perhaps keep it there {{a little longer than}} was necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should say," [...] another said, [...] "that we had best {{make him}} our cook. Old Rollo is always grumbling at being kept at the work, and his cooking gets worse and worse. I <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>my</b> jaws into the meat this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It was all I <b>could</b> do to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|I lit in {{the middle}} of the floor, shot there by the {{electric}} suddenness of the surprise. As soon as I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} has {{something}} to do with poachers." [...] Fitzpiers was still so shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile, and it was not until Grace said, [...] "If I <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> <b>my</b> skirt out nobody would know anything about it," [...] that he bestirred himself.|$|R

60|$|I gave {{my order}} to the {{superintendent}} of the Academy personally. I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches. I was getting tired of doing without these conveniences. I could have them now, as I wasn't going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore <b>could</b> <b>get</b> at <b>my</b> pockets.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not to}} {{be blamed}} in the slightest; but if I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on him at this moment he would regret most {{sincerely}} ever having such a thought in his head." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{their honeymoon}} in Switzerland in 1947, Eric and Salome Estorick met Arturo Bryks, {{a former teacher}} at the Bauhaus, who {{introduced}} them to Umberto Boccioni's book on Italian Futurism. Before returning from their honeymoon they visited Mario Sironi in Milan from whom they bought a large quantity of his work.

60|$|BENTLEY. Well, who'd marry me, dyou suppose, if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> brains with a {{full-sized}} body? No, thank you. I shall take jolly {{good care}} to keep Joey {{out of this}} until Hypatia is past praying for.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; by {{the time}} I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hat on she had heard it, poor thing, and was gone to Backsworth; for he's there, in the county gaol; was taken at the station, I believe; I don't half {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|They ran before I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into <b>my</b> stride, so I {{told the}} dog Harvey what I {{thought of them}} and his mistress. He never shifted his position, but stared at me, an intense, {{lopsided}} stare, eye after eye. Malachi came along when he had seen his sister off, and from a distance counselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again. But the dog Harvey never even cocked his cockable ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{much prefer}} that she should, for then I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up on <b>my</b> legs and answer {{her off the}} reel." [...] Of course {{everybody}} there understood what she meant,--including old John Bates, who stood at the sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself.|$|R
60|$|How he and Jim and Emett {{rolled and}} cracked the stone! For a moment I <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> off <b>my</b> horse; I was chained to my saddle by a strange vacillation {{that could have}} been no other thing than fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a rank shame, Songbird!" [...] he cried, at the {{conclusion}} of the narrative. [...] "I know just how you feel. If I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on that Blackie Crowden, I think I'd put him in the hospital first and in prison afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot go with you, Halbert," [...] {{answered}} Mary, [...] "because I must {{study this}} lesson--it {{will take me}} long to learn it--I am sorry I am so dull, for if I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> task as fast as Edward, I should like to go with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|There he was, {{just the}} same old Jack, with his splendid big {{shoulders}} and his lovely brown eyes. And his necktie was crooked, too; as soon as I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands free I put them up and straightened it out for him. How nice and old-timey that was! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{appetite}} {{needs no}} fillip. It is disgraceful {{to try and}} make me eat more than I do already. I am getting hideously stout. I found my maid in tears to-night because I positively <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> into <b>my</b> most becoming bodice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{know that}} I am being {{followed}} about, {{and if she}} <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into <b>my</b> rooms, it is quite as {{easy for them to}} do so. They may have been there, and I dare say that if I had entered unsuspectingly, and Dan Prince {{had anything to do with}} it, I shouldn't have had much chance. It amused me to see all my drawers turned out and my papers disturbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, John! {{not for the}} world. Gracie must stay, {{and keep}} house for you. She's such a help to you, {{that it would be}} a shame to take her away.
