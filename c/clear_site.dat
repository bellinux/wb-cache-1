This study examines the effect of temporal light reduction by adding two levels of shading to Halophila ovalis plants in two meadows with different light histories, one characterized by a low light (turbid) environment and the other by a relatively high light (clear) environment. Additional shading resulted in complete mortality for both shading treatments at the turbid site while the <b>clear</b> <b>site</b> showed a pattern of decreased shoot density and increased photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) with increased shading.

Inter-annual variation of Chinese fir tree-ring widths were measured for the controlled burning, brush clearing and natural forest sites.

40|$|Sediment cores {{were taken}} and epifaunal counts {{carried out in}} the {{following}} areas: 1. cleared and mown mangrove habitat (<b>site</b> WMA) 2. <b>cleared</b> but not mown mangrove habitat (site WMB) 3. recently <b>cleared</b> mangrove habitat (<b>site</b> WMC) 4. intact mangrove habitat (site WMD) 5. bare (undisturbed) intertidal flat habitat (site WME) Sample analyses confirmed that surface sediments in the 2005 <b>cleared</b> mown <b>site</b> (WMA) are similar in 2008 to those in the existing mangrove habitat, with over 50 % mud present at both sites. Silty (mud-dominated) sediments occur to depths greater than 5 cm in the <b>cleared</b> <b>site</b> WMA, suggesting that the mud is either continuing to accumulate and/or is not being redistributed after mangrove removal. Core stratigraphy revealed silty sands to depths below 12 cm at all <b>cleared</b> <b>sites,</b> suggesting that it would be some time, if at all, before these sites evolve to a purely sandy environment under the present-day hydrodynamic regime. Surface sediments in <b>cleared</b> <b>sites</b> WMB and WMC were dominated by fine and medium sands (with some mud), indicating that some of the mud particles have been winnowed out over time, but that any further significant coarsening of sediments may either not occur, or will occur very slowly. Further core sampling will provide valuable information on erosion of fine sediments over time at these sites. The rate of biomass decomposition influences how surface sediment characteristics change over time, as the mass of fine roots remaining in the sediment still functions to trap fine sediment particles until such time that the roots decompose and break down completely. Sizes and ages of (former) trees at sites WMA, WMB and WMC are unknown because they were cleared before any such measurements could be taken. Interestingly however, the below-ground biomass average of 3. 47 kg m 2 in the highly impacted <b>cleared</b> <b>site</b> (WMA) is higher than that which has been measured in healthy (intact) mangrove habitat in an estuary in Tauranga Harbour (Stokes and Healy submitted). The other <b>cleared</b> <b>sites</b> also still have relatively high levels of root biomass with over 1 kg (dry weight) of root material per square metre. There are two possible explanations for the significantly greater mass of root material found at the highly impacted <b>cleared</b> <b>site</b> (WMA) compared with all other sampling sites; firstly that the highly anoxic and hydrodynamically quiet environment is inhibiting decomposition and breakdown processes, and secondly that these processes have been further inhibited by sediment compaction resulting from vehicle use in the area. Compaction reduces the erosion potential of surface sediments and slows down decomposition processes by creating a highly anoxic zone (as demonstrated by the black colour of the sediments). Surface macrofauna were generally only present in low numbers at all sites. Analyses of temporal trends in the data indicate that benthic invertebrate abundance and diversity are increasing with time and that the disparity in population structure between the mangrove <b>site</b> and the <b>cleared</b> <b>site</b> may decrease as time goes on. However, given that manual (and consented) removal of mangrove seedlings is now a regular occurrence, and that the below-ground environment has been significantly altered in places, the <b>cleared</b> <b>sites</b> are unlikely to revert back to mangrove habitat. The changes observed in the sediment composition and the structure of benthic communities in the cleared areas, along with a significant decline in benthic faunal abundance and species richness indicate that the <b>cleared</b> <b>sites</b> have not recovered within the observation period (2005 – 2008). The results from this study provide some insight into the physical characteristics of the mangrove habitat at Moanaanuanu Estuary, and the intertidal areas that were cleared of mangroves.

Most of the mortality in unfenced areas occurred since the last evaluation eight years ago. Twice as many 90 -cm-tall stumps had surviving sprouts than basal-cut stumps, and these sprouts were both taller and had larger diameters. Differences among harvest dates were relatively small, but there were significant differences among sites for most variables evaluated.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{conceptual}} basis {{for understanding the}} relationship between mechanical loading and skeletal adaptation, along with the specific effect of exercise on bone mass in men. Complete {{understanding of the relationship}} of exercise to bone mass in humans must await development and validation of accurate, quantitative estimates of mechanical loading history. Although this has not yet been accomplished, sufficient information is available to permit general conclusions, as well as speculation about the kinds of exercises that are likely to prove most osteogenic. Cross-sectional studies provide support for the notion that habitual athletic endeavor promotes superior bone density in men compared with that of a sedentary life-style. The magnitude of this difference is likely to depend {{on the nature of the}} activity, the age at which it was initiated, and the number of years spent in training. Physical activity may enhance peak bone mass attained if initiated before the age of 20.

40|$|Background: Olive phenols {{are widely}} {{consumed}} in the Mediterranean diet and can be detected in human plasma. Here, the capacity of olive phenols and plasma metabolites to inhibit lipid and protein oxidations is investigated in two plasma models. Methods: The accumulation of lipid oxidation products issued from the oxidation of linoleic acid bound to human serum albumin (HSA) by AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals is evaluated in the presence and absence of phenolic antioxidants. Phenol binding to HSA is addressed by quenching of the Trp 214 fluorescence and displacement of probes (quercetin, dansylsarcosine and dansylamide). Next, the esterase activity of HSAbound butyrylcholine esterase (BChE) {{is used as a}} marker of protein oxidative degradation. Results: Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, caffeic and chlorogenic acids inhibit lipid peroxidation as well as HSAbound BChE as efficiently as the potent flavonol quercetin. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives bind noncompetitively HSA subdomain IIA whereas no <b>clear</b> <b>site</b> could be identified for hydroxytyrosol derivatives. General significance: In both models, olive phenols and their metabolites are much more efficient inhibitors of lipid and protein oxidations compared to vitamins C and E. Low postprandial concentrations of olive phenols may help to preserve the integrity of functional proteins and delay the appearance of toxic lipid oxidation product...|$|E

The trail contains compact knots and diffuse blobs of ultraviolet and blue optical emission and, thus, it is a <b>clear</b> <b>site</b> of recent star formation but in an unusual environment, surrounded by a million degree intra-cluster medium. We report on our optical spectroscopy of a compact source in the trail, SDSS J 122952. 66 + 112227. 8, and show that the optical spectrum is dominated by emission from a massive blue supergiant star. If confirmed, our report would mark the farthest star with spectroscopic observation. We interpret that a massive O-type star formed in situ in the trail has evolved recently out of the main sequence into this blue supergiant phase, and now lacks any detectable spectral sign of its associated HII region. We argue that turbulence within the ram pressure striped gaseous trail may play a dominant role for the star formation within such trails.

Rig showed <b>clear</b> <b>site</b> preferences, but those preferences varied among rig and over time.

Rig showed strong diel movements during summer, although the diel pattern weakened in autumn. Persistent use of the same day and night sites indicates that diel movements are directed rather than random.

Organic layer characteristics were significantly affected by species, with lower litter decay and higher accumulation under the less palatable beech, even on limestone. However, beech and hornbeam did not show any differences in N-cycling at all. Instead of species, N-cycling was affected by site conditions, albeit different than expected. Microbial N generally increased from acid loam to limestone, but acid loam showed higher net N-mineralization, especially in the organic layer. Also, acid loam showed high instead of low efficiency of N-mineralization per unit microbe, in both organic layer and mineral topsoil. In addition, acid loam showed net consumption of DOC instead of release in both soil layers, which suggests that not N, but C was a limiting factor to decomposition. In contrast, limestone showed low net N-mineralization in the organic layer, despite high mass and well-decomposed organic matter, and low efficiency of N-mineralization per unit microbe in both organic layer and mineral topsoil. DOC was net released instead of consumed, which supported that not C, but N was a limiting factor. The general lack of differences in net N-cycling between species, but relatively <b>clear</b> <b>site</b> effects, is discussed in relation to different microbial strategies. Acid soil may have high net N-release despite low biological activity, because N-requirements of fungi are also low, while in calcareous soil, high bacterial N-demand may counteract high gross N-release. Thus, species producing litter that decomposes rapidly may be planted to improve soil conditions and plant biodiversity, but litter quality effects on N-availability may be less important than soil conditions...|$|E

In this respect we could identify a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal within RTP 1. However, stable and transient expression studies of RTP 1 in different plant species, including the host plant Vicia faba, interfered with plant cell vitality but did not result in detection of RTP 1 protein.

In the second part of this study, two different lines of approaches were taken to study RTP 1 transfer mechanism. First, transient expression of secreted RTP 1 (sRTP 1) also interfered with plant cell vitality. Addition of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal abolished sRTP 1 interference with plant cell vitality, suggesting that RTP 1 can reenter the plant cell from the apoplast after secretion {{in the absence of the}} pathogen.

Our results indicate that U. maydis is capable of secreting high amounts of recombinant RTP 1, showing similar glycosylation pattern as RTP 1 secreted from rust haustoria. Our data propose the use of this model system to study RTP 1 domains mediating its entry into the plant cell...|$|E

His garden backs on to Dale Farm and he has received public death threats. Gridley said the delay in <b>clearing</b> the <b>site</b> has decreased {{the value of his}} property, and has criticised the council's decision to allow the size of the legal site to be increased without planning permission. In 2013 he said [...] "I am going to move abroad and give my land and assets to the gypsies" [...] due to the bad condition of the <b>cleared</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R

In {{this study we}} assessed the species density and relative abundance of termites in peat land in Sarawak, Malaysia. Termites were sampled in near-natural peat swamp forest, logged-over peat swamp forest, young oil palm plantation and a <b>cleared</b> and burned <b>site.</b> Species density and relative abundance were calculated for each site. Both species density and relative abundance differed significantly between sites. Near-natural peat swamp forest had the highest termite density, followed by logged-over peat swamp forest, young oil palm plantation and the <b>cleared</b> <b>site.</b> In contrast, the relative abundance of termites was highest in the young oil palm plantation due to the omnipresent genus Schedorhinotermes. Most of the species found in the <b>cleared</b> <b>site</b> and young oil palm plantation did not occur at the other sites. We conclude that ongoing forest degradation and conversion in tropical peat land result in shifting termite assemblages and declining species density. Species that originally occur at low densities in peat swamp forests are typically lost {{as a result of}} peat swamp forest conversion...|$|R
