Snake cheats Homer out of $20, but Marge exposes the con and Snake takes off. After giving chase, Marge knocks Snake unconscious with a garbage <b>can</b> <b>lid,</b> giving her a sense of exhilaration. Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E
5|$|The second {{featured}} bout on the undercard was {{a standard}} {{match for the}} WWE United States Championship between Eddie Guerrero, and The Big Show. Guerrero {{used a variety of}} tactics including forcing Big Show's head into an exposed turnbuckle, striking him with a trash <b>can</b> <b>lid,</b> punching him with brass knuckles and striking him with the title belt. After hitting Show with the belt, Guerrero performed a frog splash for a near-fall. Show then performed a chokeslam but Guerrero placed his foot on the rope. Show then performed another chokeslam on Guerrero to win the title.|$|E

Victoria choked Trish with a broomstick at the turnbuckle and hit her with a trash <b>can</b> <b>lid.</b> Trish recovered, and sent Victoria into an ironing board before hitting her several times with a Singapore cane. Victoria (with a bloody nose), went under the ring, and came back out with a fire extinguisher. Victoria sprayed Trish with the extinguisher {{and gave her a}} suplex, capturing the Women's title.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a Last Man Standing match between Edge and Chris Benoit. The match started out with Benoit getting the upper hand. Edge then got the upper hand by {{throwing}} Benoit sternum first into the turnbuckles. Benoit then applied the Sharpshooter on Edge. Benoit then performed multiple German suplexes on Edge, which sent Edge outside to the floor. Benoit dived through the ropes, but was met with a trash <b>can</b> <b>lid</b> to the face. Edge hit a superplex on Benoit through a trash can. Edge grabbed a ladder and dragged it into the ring, only to get a German suplex off of the ladder. Benoit missed a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} the ladder, Edge grabbed the Money in the Bank briefcase, but was caught in the Crippler Crossface. Edge got out of the Crippler Crossface and performed an Edgecution on Benoit on the briefcase. Benoit reached his feet at nine, only to get speared by Edge. After spearing Benoit again, Edge pulled a brick out of his briefcase and hit Benoit in the back of his head, leaving Benoit unable to answer the ten count.|$|E
500|$|The first {{match was}} a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL), a match {{in which there}} were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts and the match outcomes could have occurred anywhere. Finlay was accompanied to the ring by his storyline son, Hornswoggle, who was returning from a scripted injury suffered {{at the hands of}} JBL. During the match, JBL hit Finlay with a trash <b>can</b> <b>lid</b> when the latter was about to perform a suicide dive on him through the ropes on the outside. Later on, Finlay tossed JBL through a table that he had set up earlier on the turnbuckle. Hornswoggle also got involved during the match by hitting JBL with a kendo stick, while later on JBL threw a trash can at him. Attacking Finlay's knee with a kendo stick, JBL delivered a Clothesline from Hell to Finlay to score a successful pinfall. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E
2500|$|General Brewing Company of San Francisco marketed their Lucky Lager Beer as [...] "Age Dated" [...] {{as early}} as late 1935. They stamped a date on each <b>can</b> <b>lid</b> to {{indicate}} that the beer was brewed before that date. This was not to ensure that the beer was [...] "fresh" [...] but to ensure that it had been aged properly. [...] So many breweries had rushed beer to market before it was ready when Prohibition ended, that customers were wary of getting [...] "green" [...] beer.|$|E

2500|$|The P-38 {{is known}} as a [...] "John Wayne" [...] by the United States Marine Corps, either because of its {{toughness}} and dependability, or because of an unsubstantiated story that the actor had been shown in an as-yet-unidentified training film opening a can of K-Rations. The can opener is pocket-sized, approximately [...] long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle, with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the <b>can</b> <b>lid.</b> A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is [...] "walked" [...] around to cut the lid out. A larger version called the P-51 is somewhat easier to operate. The handle portion can also double as a makeshift flat-blade screwdriver, with limited ability because of the rather soft sheet metal used. The P-51 is not an official Army can opener although it is often marketed as such.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the time}} it was invented until Lyle's death in 2012, there was much {{experimentation}} with several configurations of instruments based on the guitalin and guinjo (another of Lyle's inventions). Among these experiments were the fretted fiddle or [...] "friddle" [...] or [...] "guiddle", an 8-string fiddle, the dobrolin, the triplin (an instrument Lyle disliked, recorded once, then scrapped), an electric (solid body) guitalin, and even a full-sized, upright guitalin bass. Other notable Mayfield instruments include the guinjo (1974), a bass mandolin (1974), the Coffee <b>Can</b> <b>Lid</b> Banjo (1974), a Commodophone (a spoof instrument using a toilet seat for a top), the Echo Guitar (1992), the Mayfield Guitar (1998), the Mariachi bass (1998), a variation on the hard-top banjo (2006), the Mayfield Pear Guitars (2005), a variation on the Manjo (2006), the Round Cornered Guitalin (Martin Smith, 2006), the Round Head Guitars (Martin Smith, 2007), and variations on the Mandola (2008) and the Dreadnought Guitar (2008).|$|E
2500|$|The P-38 {{is easily}} used. [...] First, the cutting point is pivoted to its 95-degree position, from its stowed, folded position. [...] Then, for a {{right-handed}} user, the P-38 {{is held in}} the right hand by the flat long section, with the cutting point pointing downward {{and away from the}} user, while also hooking the edge of the can through the circular notch located on the flat long section next to the cutting edge. [...] The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the <b>can</b> <b>lid</b> to be punctured. [...] The can is then rotated counter clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counterclockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. [...] The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position; then, the P-38 is returned to its stored location, whether that is dangling on a dog tag chain around one's neck, or in one's pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring. [...] Left-handed users simply hold the P-38 in their left hand, with the cutting point aimed towards themselves, while holding the can to be opened in their right hand, while also reversing the sense of the cutting hand movements just described. [...] By tradition, 38 cuts as just described were supposedly required to open a can of C-Rations.|$|E

2500|$|Irons {{performed}} {{with other members}} of Pearl Jam on Neil Young's 1995 album, Mirror Ball, and subsequently toured Europe as part of Young's backing band. With Irons, the band recorded its fourth studio album, No Code, released in 1996, for which Irons also toured. The band subsequently released Yield in 1998. [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. As a member of Pearl Jam, Irons brought a unique drumming style to the band, particularly in the way he played his fills and with his use of a trash <b>can</b> <b>lid</b> as a cymbal. Irons co-wrote the music for the No Code songs [...] "Who You Are", [...] "In My Tree", [...] "Red Mosquito", and [...] "I'm Open". He also wrote and sang on the Pearl Jam songs [...] "Happy When I'm Crying" [...] (from the 1997 fan club Christmas single), [...] "●" [...] (from Yield), and [...] "Whale Song" [...] (from the 1999 Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 3 compilation). He played with Pearl Jam through March 20, 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] Vedder said, [...] "I think that him deciding that he wasn't {{going to be in the}} band really hurt." [...] Coincidentally, Matt Cameron, from Soundgarden, replaced him again as he did four years prior on Eleven's Thunk.|$|E
