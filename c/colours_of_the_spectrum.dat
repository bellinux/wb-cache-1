500|$|As {{a result}} of the cancellation, Anderson was {{required}} {{to come up with an}} idea for another Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that [...] "Scarlet" [...] would make an unusual codename for this organisation's [...] "indestructible" [...] agent who can come back to life, while [...] "Blue" [...] could be his partner's designation.

The specific objectives were to: a) identify, evaluate, and analyse the different options for a low-cost low-altitude (LCLA) remote sensing system that has potential for precision agriculture, b) develop a LCLA remote sensing system that is appropriate for use in mapping selected crop attributes (i. e. grain protein, yield, maturity and crop type), and c) evaluate <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> classification and prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cereal crop attributes. A low-cost sensor system was developed that incorporated two consumer digital still cameras. One camera captured <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> while <b>the</b> other one (with <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a band-pass filter) captured the near infrared light. Both cameras were modified to be remotely triggered and externally powered. This sensor arrangement utilised 1. 0 megapixel cameras in the earlier investigations and then 5. 0 megapixel cameras in most recent missions. The sensors were equally well suited to mounting on a remotely controlled aircraft or suspended beneath a helium balloon. Various approaches were taken to determine and evaluate the relationships between imagery and crop attributes. Statistical methods included <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> correlation and discriminant function analysis, along with partial least squares regression. Image analysis techniques included <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> both pixel-based (supervised approach) and object-orientated (multi-resolution segmentation) classifications. The results showed that low-cost low-altitude remote sensing systems (incorporating consumer digital cameras with helium balloons or remotely controlled aircraft) have great capacity to quantify variability in cereal grain crops. Excellent relationships were found between the ‘at-harvest’ yield (R 2 = 0. 902) and protein content (R 2 = 0. 660) of wheat using a single image recorded at flowering. Partial least squares regression, using the crossvalidated approach, produced a stronger relationship with a prediction accuracy of 94. 2...|$|R
40|$|Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most widely}} {{distributed}} species along the Apennines in the Southern Italy. However a less technological quality maintains {{this kind of}} wood principally for energy destination. Moreover, chromatic differences inside the wood structure are much {{more evident than in}} other species, with a quite white sapwood and a dark grey heartwood, frequently accomplished by a presence <b>of</b> black heart. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this research was to evaluate <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> reducing aesthetical limiting factors of Turkey oak. This was made by investigating on <b>the</b> combined effect <b>of</b> steaming treatment (in an autoclave) and heat (in a oven) on green wood of Turkey oak. Specimens without any defects were used for the tests. Sapwood and heartwood of samples were also separated. Steaming treatment was carried out for 2 - 6 h at 100 °C, 120 °C and 135 °C and then the same samples were used for a heat treatment for 2 h at 120 and 180 °C. <b>Colour</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood specimens was tested in comparison with untreated ones. The colour results were given in the CIE L*a*b* colour co-ordinate system. In addition, spectral reflectance measures were obtained by using a spectroradiometer provided with a plant probe, in the range between 300 and 1. 100 nm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic <b>spectrum.</b> It is shown that significant colour changes could be obtained by using combined hydro-thermal treatment. With rising temperature <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> change <b>of</b> wood was higher. Turkey oak wood was more sensitive to the steaming temperature at 135 °C combined with heat treatment at 180 °C. Intermediate treatments assured more reliable results on homogenization of hue, while treatments at “ST 100 +H 180 ” and “ST 120 +H 180 ” highlighted noticeable results for lightness. In terms <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> <b>spectra,</b> <b>the</b> combined effect between steaming and heat treatment at 120 °C seems to be moderate. Such treatments could lead to improve aesthetical properties...|$|R
