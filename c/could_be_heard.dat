5|$|The {{sound of}} heavy {{artillery}} fire <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in Jamame town near Jilib, local residents said.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the chief {{machinist}} shouting orders to his crew that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> by the audience, Giselle was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Marie Taglioni, the greatest ballerina of the period.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E
50|$|Ramsey <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> {{in various}} movies, {{including}} Two-Minute Warning.|$|R
60|$|Steps <b>could</b> plainly <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> not far away. Mrs. Cristie looked up.|$|R
50|$|However, {{fighting}} <b>could</b> still <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> at {{a military}} camp south of Jowhar.|$|R
5|$|The {{football}} match {{crowd at}} Hampden were renowned {{for creating the}} Hampden Roar and trying to terrify opposing teams. The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and the Roar <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> whenever Scotland scored an important goal. After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced capacities, the roar has become more muted.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b> In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
5000|$|WBQI served Down East Maine primarily, but <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in Bangor.|$|R
5000|$|WBQX {{served the}} Mid coast primarily, but <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in Augusta.|$|R
50|$|WSNW was {{an adult}} {{standards}} radio station whose programming <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> on WBFM.|$|R
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> penetrating the night air.|$|E
5|$|Soon, Manne {{began to}} {{contribute}} to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) {{are only a few}} of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The jackalope can {{imitate the}} human voice, {{according}} to legend. During {{the days of}} the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} pause, {{during which the}} ticking of the clock <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{distinctly}} <b>heard.</b>|$|R
50|$|KMPS was {{a carrier}} current station. The signal {{traveled}} through telephone lines and <b>could</b> only <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in specifically targeted places. In this case, KMPS <b>could</b> only <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in student housing and the campus center. The schedule was sporadic and {{depended on the}} school schedules of volunteer DJ’s. The station tried to air from noon to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, but occasionally missed an hour or two.|$|R
50|$|He <b>could</b> still <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> {{intermittently}} in North America and by American {{forces in}} Europe up to early 1945.|$|R
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his esophagus, which {{made it difficult for}} him to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged with the murder of Mamah Borthwick, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard,</b> Carlton died of starvation in his cell.|$|E
60|$|While Stead {{longed to}} ask, but <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in the clamour, whether {{his brother had}} been there.|$|R
60|$|The whisper <b>could</b> scarce <b>be</b> <b>heard,</b> so low <b>was</b> it, {{like the}} sighing {{of the wind}} through a misty veil.|$|R
50|$|Because WAYS <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in Salisbury at night, WSAT {{started playing}} Top 40 {{at night in}} the late 1960s.|$|R
5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only just started to move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{broadcast}} had technical issues, as the commentators <b>could</b> barely <b>be</b> <b>heard,</b> consistently being {{drowned out}} by the crowd and ring noise.|$|R
60|$|Shouting <b>could</b> now <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> at a distance, {{and this}} was {{followed}} by a volley of shots which surprised all the listeners.|$|R
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Phips was {{appointed}} as governor. He had successfully straddled a middle political position, cultivating a strong {{connection to the}} powerful New England minister, Increase Mather, {{as well as his}} royalist opposition on the Board of Trade. Phips and Mather returned to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England {{at the height of the}} witchcraft delusion, after numerous executions in Salem. Phips suspended the court proceedings, pardoned several people sentenced to death, and released more than 100 being held in jail before trial. He became enmeshed in related controversies that resulted in his recall to England to answer a variety of charges. Phips died in London at the age of 44 before the charges against him <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution. Survivors reported {{that some of the}} detainees were escorted to the brickyard, from which shots <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard,</b> and those detainees were not seen again. One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front of detainees. Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer of the detainees to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused a clash between Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter wanted to keep the detainees under their control.|$|E
