40|$|SummaryUnravelling {{principles}} underlying neurotransmitter release are key {{to understand}} neural signaling. Here, we describe how surface mobility of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) modulates release probabilities (Pr) of synaptic vesicles (SVs). <b>Coupling</b> <b>distances</b> of 100  nm have been reported for SVs and VDCCs in different synapses. Tracking individual VDCCs revealed that within hippocampal synapses, ∼ 60 % of VDCCs are mobile while confined to presynaptic membrane compartments. Intracellular Ca 2 + chelation decreased VDCC mobility. Increasing VDCC surface populations by co-expression of the α 2 δ 1 subunit did not alter channel mobility but led to enlarged active zones (AZs) rather than higher channel densities. VDCCs thus scale presynaptic scaffolds to maintain local mobility. We propose that dynamic coupling based on mobile VDCCs supports calcium domain cooperativity and tunes neurotransmitter release by equalizing Pr for docked SVs within AZs...|$|R
