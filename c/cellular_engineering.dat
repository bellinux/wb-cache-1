40|$|SummarySomatic cell reprogramming, {{directed}} {{differentiation of}} pluripotent stem cells, and direct conversions between differentiated cell lineages represent powerful approaches to engineer cells {{for research and}} regenerative medicine. We have developed CellNet, a network biology platform that more accurately assesses the fidelity of <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering</b> than existing methodologies and generates hypotheses for improving cell derivations. Analyzing expression data from 56 published reports, we found that cells derived via directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion, as reflected by the establishment of target cell-type gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Furthermore, we discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering</b> paradigm. CellNet provides a platform for quantifying how closely engineered cell populations resemble their target cell type and a rational strategy to guide enhanced <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Genome editing is an {{important}} technology for bacterial <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering,</b> which is commonly conducted by homologous recombination-based procedures, including gene knockout (disruption), knock-in (insertion), and allelic exchange. In addition, some new recombination-independent approaches have emerged that utilize catalytic RNAs, artificial nucleases, nucleic acid analogs, and peptide nucleic acids. Apart from these methods, which directly modify the genomic structure, an alternative approach is to conditionally modify the gene expression profile at the posttranscriptional level without altering the genomes. This is performed by expressing antisense RNAs to knock down (silence) target mRNAs in vivo. This review describes the features and recent advances on methods used in genomic engineering and silencing technologies that are advantageously used for bacterial <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E
40|$|Random {{searches}} {{have been}} the hallmark of directed evolution and have been extensively employed in the improvement of complex or poorly understood phenotypes such as tolerance to toxic compounds {{in the context of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering.</b> While genome-wide mutagenesis followed by selection or screening has been a traditional means of phenotype improvement, the list of experimental methods for <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering</b> based on random searches is rapidly expanding. Adding to the confusion is the element of chance, which lengthens the process and most notably adds to the cost of phenotypic improvement programs. Here we present a method to systematize the effort of finding superior mutants by successively improving random libraries. The method, based on the quantification of phenotypic diversity, is then used to isolate more-robust strains...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic receptors {{provide a}} {{powerful}} experimental tool for generation of designer cells capable of monitoring the environment, sensing specific input signals, and executing diverse custom response programs. To advance {{the promise of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering,</b> we have developed a class of chimeric receptors that integrate a highly programmable and portable nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas 9 (dCas 9) signal transduction module. We demonstrate that the core dCas 9 synthetic receptor (dCas 9 -synR) architecture can be readily adapted to various classes of native ectodomain scaffolds, linking their natural inputs with orthogonal output functions. Importantly, these receptors achieved stringent OFF/ON state transition characteristics, showed agonist-mediated dose-dependent activation, and could be programmed to couple specific disease markers with diverse, therapeutically relevant multi-gene expression circuits. The modular dCas 9 -synR platform developed here provides a generalizable blueprint for designing next generations of synthetic receptors, which will enable the implementation of highly complex combinatorial functions in <b>cellular</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E
