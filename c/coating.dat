5|$|In the {{chromate}} conversion <b>coating</b> process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates {{are used to}} deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This passivation and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the {{chromate conversion}} <b>coating,</b> which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this <b>coating</b> method. Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative <b>coating</b> methods are under development.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime <b>coating</b> {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of <b>coating</b> electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex <b>coating</b> mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux <b>coating,</b> making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>coat</b> of the {{domestic}} dog (Canis lupus familiaris) refers to the hair that covers its body.

Double <b>coats</b> have a top <b>coat,</b> made of stiff hairs to help repel water and shield from dirt, and an undercoat to serve as insulation. The terms fur and hair are often used interchangeably when describing a dog's <b>coat,</b> however in general, a double <b>coat,</b> e.g., like that of the Newfoundland and most mountain dogs, is referred to as a fur <b>coat,</b> while a single <b>coat,</b> like that of the Poodle, is referred to as a hair <b>coat.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{relationships}} between interface bonding strength of <b>coat</b> and residual stress were established, and {{a method to}} measure bonding strength of <b>coat</b> interface between <b>coat</b> and matrixes was studied. The theory of measuring bonding strength of <b>coat</b> interface by XRD (X-ray diffraction) is established, and interfacial bonding strength bewteen <b>coat</b> and substrate is expressed with diffraction peak value of <b>coat</b> residual stress. According {{to the theory of}} measuring film stress by XRD, residual stresses of TiN <b>coat</b> are obtained. A new experimental method of <b>coat</b> measuring bonding strength is established. The results are shown that the peak value of residual stresses is <b>coat</b> interfacial bonding strength, and it is applied to measure interfacial bonding strength of polycrystal <b>coats...</b>|$|R
