40|$|AbstractBackground: Enediyne <b>chromoproteins</b> are potent {{antitumor}} antibiotic agents. They {{consist of}} a labile nine-membered enediyne chromophore non-covalently associated with a stabilizing acidic polypeptide. Studies in vitro on three members of this superfamily of natural products — kedarcidin, maduropeptin and neocarzinostatin — demonstrated that their chromophores cleave DNA at sites specific to each chromophore. Recently, we showed that these <b>chromoproteins</b> possess proteolytic activity against histones in vitro, with histone H 1 as a preferred substrate. Based on these results, we speculated that this selective proteolytic activity may be important in vivo {{in the delivery of}} the enediynes intact to the DNA in chromatin. Results: We show here that each chromoprotein generates a unique set of H 1 fragments as revealed by gel analyses of the H 1 cleavage reaction products. To probe the observed cleavage specificity, we synthesized a 24 -amino-acid peptide representing a basic region of histone H 1. This model peptide was incubated individually with similar concentrations of the kedarcidin, neocarzinostatin and maduropeptin <b>chromoproteins</b> as well as the kedarcidin apoprotein. The reaction products were analyzed by electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that all proteins cleave the peptide at selected backbone amides, and that these sites vary according to the chromoprotein used. Moreover, the kedarcidin apoprotein appears to be less specific than the kedarcidin chromoprotein complex. Conclusions: The small size, unique architecture and very acidic nature of the enediyne <b>chromoproteins</b> are highly unusual. These natural products exhibit the dual functionalities of specific DNA cleavage and selective proteolytic activity. This observation adds to the fascinating properties of these molecules and suggests that it is possible not only to design small moieties to cleave DNA but also to conceive of small proteins to deliver these moieties intact to defined areas of chromatin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{employed}} {{a new approach}} to generate novel fluorescent proteins (FPs) from red absorbing <b>chromoproteins.</b> An identical single amino acid substitution converted novel <b>chromoproteins</b> from the species Anthozoa (Heteractis crispa, Condylactis gigantea, and Goniopora tenuidens) into far-red FPs (emission λmax= 615 – 640 nm). Moreover, coupled site-directed and random mutagenesis of the chromoprotein from H. crispa resulted in a unique far-red FP (HcRed) that exhibited bright emission at 645 nm. A clear red shift in fluorescence of HcRed, compared to drFP 583 (by more than 60 nm), makes it an ideal additional color for multi-color labeling.

The two putative phycoerythrocyanin lyase genes of Mastigocladus laminosus, pecE and pecF, were overexpressed in Escherichia coli.

Amino acids necessary for chromophore attachment in vivo were localized to the amino-terminal 398 residues because mutant proteins this small had covalently bound chromophore. Deletion mutants from the carboxy terminus to residue 653 were spectrally indistinguishable from the full-length <b>chromoprotein.</b> In contrast, further truncation to residue 399 resulted in a <b>chromoprotein</b> with a bleached Pfr absorbance spectrum, Pr and Pfr absorbance maxima shifted toward shorter wavelengths, and reduced Pfr to Pr phototransformation efficiency. Thus, residues between 399 ad 652 are required for spectral integrity but are not essential for chromophore attachment. The sequence(s) between residues 919 and 1093 appears to be necessary for dimerization. Carboxy-terminal mutants containing this region behaved as dimers under nondenaturing conditions in vitro, whereas truncations without this region behaved as monomers. None of the plants expressing high levels of deletion mutants lacking the 35 carboxy-terminal amino acids displayed the light-exaggerated phenotype characteristic of plants expressing biologically active phytochrome A, even when the truncated phytochromes were expressed at levels 6 - to 15 -fold greater than that effective for the full-length <b>chromoprotein.</b> Collectively, these data show that the phytochrome protein contains several separable carboxy-terminal domains required for structure/function and identify a domain within 35 residues of the carboxy terminus that is critical for the biological activity of the photoreceptor in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{fluorescent}} protein and chromoprotein family, {{the phenomenon of}} photoswitching is both intriguing and biotechnologically useful. Illumination of particular <b>chromoproteins</b> with intense light results in dramatic increases in fluorescence efficiency (termed kindling) and involves cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore. Here we report that chromophore isomerization can also be driven via alteration in pH. Specifically, we demonstrate {{that a number of}} naturally occurring <b>chromoproteins,</b> and their engineered variants, undergo a dramatic 20 - 100 -fold increase in fluorescence efficiency at alkaline pH (> pH 9. 0). We have determined to 1. 8 A resolution the structure of one such chromoprotein, Rtms 5 (H 146 S), in its highly far-red fluorescent form (Phi(F), 0. 11 at pH 10. 7) and compared it to the structure of the non-fluorescent form (Phi(F), 0. 002, at pH 8. 0). At high pH, the cyclic tri-peptide chromophore was observed to be mobile and distributed between a trans non-coplanar and a cis coplanar conformation, whereas at the lower pH, only a trans non-coplanar chromophore was observed. Calculation of pK(a) values suggested that titration of the side-chain of the conserved Glu 215 close to the chromophore is involved in promoting the cis-coplanar conformation. Collectively, our data establish that isomerization to form a coplanar chromophore is a basis of the increased fluorescence efficiency at high pH. The phenomenon of pH-induced fluorescence gain has similarities with photoswitching, thereby providing a model to study the mechanism of kindling. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

A thermal reconversion to the 580 nm species occurred with a half time of 76 s at - 6 degrees C. Blue light absorbed by the photoproduct accelerated the re-conversion as well as the re-uptake of protons. Removal of the detergent prevented the light-induced formation of the 410 nm species.

Recently, a polypeptide of apparent Mr = 20, 000 has been purified that contains the halorhodopsin chromophore.

The second class exhibits a higher affinity (KD = 110 ± 50 mM) for chloride and also binds other anions according to the affinity series I-, SCN- greater than Br-, NO- 3 greater than Cl- greater than F-, citrate. Both classes of NMR site remain intact at pH 11, indicating that the essential positive charges are provided by arginine. Also, both classes are unaffected by bleaching, suggesting that the sites are not in the immediate vicinity of the halorhodopsin chromophore.
