5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to <b>care</b> <b>more</b> about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health <b>care</b> <b>more</b> and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his wings {{in the summer}} of 1936. He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior test pilot with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief test pilot. The company was short of test pilots and Cunningham caught the eye of de Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to <b>care</b> <b>more</b> for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four of de Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E

25|$|In nature, {{males and}} females usually differ in {{reproductive}} fitness optima. Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to <b>care</b> <b>more</b> for their offspring and have fewer mates. Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which can help them acquire mates.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{improper}} {{disposal of}} human {{waste in the}} mountain environment there is high risk of health hazards.

Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Decent changes have appeared in recent years–management bodies <b>care</b> <b>more</b> about human waste disposal.

25|$|The England–Germany {{football}} rivalry {{is considered}} to be mainly an English phenomenon—in the run-up to any competition match between the two teams, many UK newspapers will print articles detailing results of previous encounters, such as those in 1966 and 1990. Football fans in England often consider Germany to be their main sporting rivals and <b>care</b> <b>more</b> about this rivalry than those with other nations, such as Argentina or Scotland. Most German fans consider the Netherlands or Italy to be their traditional footballing rivals, and as such, usually the rivalry is not taken quite as seriously there as it is in England.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans do not care about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even remember that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and <b>care</b> <b>more</b> about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

25|$|After {{the early}} studies that {{reported}} that PCE {{children would be}} severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects. Almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to PCE was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition, use of other drugs, depression, and lack of prenatal <b>care.</b> <b>More</b> recently the scientific community has begun to reach an understanding that PCE does have some important effects but {{that they are not}} severe as was predicted in the early studies. The effects of PCE are subtle but they exist. Most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero are normal or close to it.|$|E
25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy {{there should not be}} taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they should <b>care</b> <b>more</b> about what their MPs are talking. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is not an MP of Jobbik anymore.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{had many}} goals. Stewart had sole medical {{charge of all}} {{the boys and girls}} at Lovedale, but he also wanted to create a {{hospital}} there. His first attempt did not work, however {{with the help of the}} Colonial Government he opened the Victoria hospital. He gained the respect of natives by charging a small amount for the medicine and treatment he gave them. This made them value his <b>care</b> <b>more.</b> The hospital was opened in 1898 and after a few obstacles had an annual attendance of five thousand. Stewart also wanted to create a medical college, and planned to eventually expand the hospital at Lovedale into a medical school. He wanted the people of Ethiopia to have access to a full medical education.|$|E

25|$|The precise rate is {{not known}} because {{a large number of}} miscarriages occur before pregnancies become {{established}} and before the woman is aware they are pregnant. In addition, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical <b>care</b> <b>more</b> often than those not experiencing bleeding. Some studies have attempted to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, although these would also not be representative of the wider population. A systematic review found that the cumulative risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks of gestation varied from 11% to 22% in studies assessing miscarriage rates. Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.|$|E
