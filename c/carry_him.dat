5|$|Shabazz {{was in the}} {{audience}} near the stage with her daughters. When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and MalcolmX's associates used a stretcher to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E

5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Angel Mendez (1946–1967) {{was among}} the many men who volunteered to join the Marine Corps right {{after graduating from high}} school. He was {{assigned}} to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division on March 16, 1967, and conducting a search and destroy mission with his company when his company came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. Half of a platoon was pinned down under enemy fire, and Mendez volunteered to lead a squad to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. Mendez exposed himself and opened fire on the enemy. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Ronald Castille, was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Mendez shielded him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, he picked up the lieutenant and started to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Mendez was hit in the shoulder, yet he chose to act as rear man and he continued to shield his lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to sergeant.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{reservations}} {{of some of}} his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abnaʾ, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 15, 1832, Captain Snyder and his men were in Kellogg's Grove when Native Americans were {{discovered}} in the area, during the night a horse was stolen. The next day, June 16, Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest; they came upon four natives and killed them. During the ensuing skirmish, Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded. The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> back to the Kellogg cabin, along the way Mecomson asked that the group stop to rest. The group stopped {{and some of the}} men went for water while the rest waited with Mecomson. As they waited, a large group of Native Americans came upon them; a short battle followed and two more militia members were killed. After the short skirmish, the natives left the area and the militia men returned to the Kellogg cabin and buried their dead the next day.|$|E
5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could <b>carry</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E

5000|$|Fumble {{recoveries}} will {{be awarded}} at the spot of the recovery, not where the player's momentum <b>carries</b> <b>him.</b> This change was passed in response to two regular season games in 2000, Atlanta Falcons-Carolina Panthers and Oakland Raiders-Seattle Seahawks, in which a safety was awarded when a defensive player's momentum in recovering a fumble <b>carried</b> <b>him</b> into his own end zone.|$|R

25|$|Governor Thomas Shirley of the Leeward Islands had Argo <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> to Tortola {{where he}} had {{official}} business. Argo stayed there three weeks until Shirley was ready to return to Antigua. The French found out about this and sent the French 36-gun frigate Nymphe and the 32-gun Amphitrite to intercept him.|$|E
25|$|After Lincoln was shot, {{doctors had}} {{soldiers}} <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> {{into the street}} {{in search of a}} house in which he would be more comfortable. A man {{on the steps of the}} house of tailor William Petersen beckoned to them. They took Lincoln into the first-floor bedroom and laid him on the beddiagonally because of his unusual height. Lincoln died the next morning at 7:22a.m.|$|E

25|$|In various episodes Weebl {{states that}} he cannot move, unlike Bob who rolls or hops to get to places. He can only be seen rolling in the Wobbl and Bob DVD, during the cutscenes when a {{category}} is selected in the menu screen. Otherwise, it remains a mystery of how he moves, although Bob uses methods of transport to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> around in several episodes, it says that Weebl invented sheep especially on the episode 'gravy'.|$|E
25|$|After of {{seizing the}} ship, {{they cut the}} wires leaving the anchor and headed to Puerto Rico. As they passed the island of St. Thomas, without stopping, some prisoners were left in the boat. Vera jexcused himself by {{claiming}} {{that he did not}} deliver it because the captain had asked him not <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> to Puerto Rico because he was sworn not to take up arms against Spain: he had been a prisoner in the privateer Anguilita and had been taken to that place, where he vowed never to return to Colombia's service.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} people were carried across rivers, usually at fords, but not necessarily. A fee would {{normally}} be charged {{or it might be}} part of the 'job description' of a servant. One Ayrshire story tells of a rich farmer who employed a servant girl to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> across the river on his way to church each Sunday. As time went by he became very fond of the servant and eventually they married. She willingly carried him across on the way to their wedding, but she refused on the way back and never carried him again.|$|E

25|$|Reportedly, Siebold was not {{the easiest}} man to deal with. He was in {{continuous}} conflict with his Dutch superiors who felt he was arrogant. This threat of conflict resulted in his recall in July 1827 back to Batavia. But the ship, the Cornelis Houtman, sent to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> back to Batavia, was thrown ashore by a typhoon in Nagasaki bay. The same storm badly damaged Dejima and destroyed Siebold's botanical garden. Repaired, the Cornelis Houtman was refloated. It left for Batavia with 89 crates of Siebold's salvaged botanical collection, but Siebold himself remained behind in Dejima.|$|E
25|$|One day in May 1786, Abraham Lincoln {{was working}} in his field with his three sons {{when he was shot}} from the nearby forest and fell to the ground. The eldest boy, Mordecai, ran to the cabin where a loaded gun was kept, while the middle son, Josiah, ran to Hughes' Station for help. Thomas, the youngest, stood in shock by his father. From the cabin, Mordecai {{observed}} an Indian come out of the forest and stop by his father's body. The Indian reached for Thomas, either to kill him or to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> off. Mordecai took aim and shot the Indian in the chest, killing him.|$|E
25|$|The Pompeians then {{attempted}} to flee over land, constantly pursued and harassed by Caesarian forces. In {{course of the}} flight, Pompeius the Younger was once more wounded, {{this time in the}} shoulder and left leg, so that his men had to <b>carry</b> <b>him</b> on a litter. The Pompeians eventually took refuge at a well defendable wooded hill near the town of Lauro, but they were discovered by a local, who reported them to the Caesarians. As result, Pompeius and his men were surrounded. The Caesarians, under command of Lucius Caesennius Lento, began to attack the Pompeian positions, but thanks to the natural conditions, the defenders were able to repulse multiple assaults. Thus thwarted, Lento's forces settled down to besiege and starve out the Pompeians. Recognizing this, the defenders resolved to try to break through the siege.|$|E
