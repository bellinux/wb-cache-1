25|$|In September 2013, the Children's ombudsmen in all Nordic {{countries}} {{issued a}} statement by which they called for a ban on circumcision of minors for non-medical reasons, stating that such circumcisions violate the rights of children after the Convention on the Rights of the Child to <b>co-determination</b> and protection from harmful traditions.|$|E
25|$|Union law {{varies from}} country to country, as does the {{function}} of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played {{a greater role in}} management decisions through participation in corporate boards and <b>co-determination</b> than have unions in the United States. Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the Group reorganised its {{corporate}} structure. It established Air Berlin plc (registered in England) into which it reversed Air Berlin GmbH & Co. Luftverkehrs KG and subsidiaries. It was {{suggested that the}} reason for the group to establish a UK-based PLC instead of a German-based AG was to avoid the need to have a supervisory board and employee representation as required by the German law of Mitbestimmung or <b>co-determination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission Control Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers <b>co-determination</b> {{on the shop floor}} while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended <b>co-determination</b> at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia, and new provisions for maternity were introduced. In February 1920, an industrial relations law was passed, giving workers in industry legally guaranteed representation, together {{with the right to}} <b>co-determination</b> in cases of hiring and firing, holiday arrangements, the fixing of working hours and regulations, and the introduction of new methods of payment. A Socialisation Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the workers' councils. In addition to workers' councils at national, regional, and factory level, the government made provision for economic councils in which employers and employees would work together on matters affecting {{the economy as a whole}} (such as nationalisation) and lend support to the Weimar parliament.|$|E
25|$|Children’s {{allowances}} for students {{up to the}} age of twenty-seven were introduced, together with a flexible retirement age, new married couples’ and families’ legislation, an extension of <b>co-determination,</b> rehabilitation and special employment rights for the severely handicapped, adjustments and increases in the pensions of war victims, a revision of child benefit, a new youth employment protection law, health insurance for farmers, pension schemes for the self-employed, and guaranteed works’ pensions. Although the principle of the social welfare state was enshrined in the constitution of West Germany, and laws and measures taken (often jointly by the CDU/CSU coalition partners and the SPD) to meet this commitment, it was only when the SPD came to power in Bonn that the provisions of the social welfare system “reached a level which few other countries could equal.” In 1975, three tax levels were introduced that removed many lower-income persons from the tax rolls and raised child benefit payments.|$|E
2500|$|West Germany enjoyed {{prolonged}} {{economic growth}} {{beginning in the}} early 1950s (Wirtschaftswunder or [...] "Economic Miracle"). Industrial production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross national product grew at a rate of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of Western Europe. Labor union supported the new policies with postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, support for technological modernization, and a policy of <b>co-determination</b> (Mitbestimmung), which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system as well as requiring representation of workers on the boards of large corporations. The recovery was accelerated by the currency reform of June 1948, U.S. gifts of $1.4 billion as part of the Marshall Plan, the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market. West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis.|$|E
2500|$|The Palme cabinet {{was also}} {{active in the}} field of education, {{introducing}} such reforms as a system of loans and benefits for students, regional universities, and preschool for all children. [...] Under a law of 1970, in the upper secondary school system “gymnasium,” “fackskola” and vocational “yrkesskola” were integrated to form one school with 3 sectors (arts and social science, technical and natural sciences, economic and commercial). In 1975, a law was passed that established free admission to universities. A number of reforms were also carried out to enhance workers' rights. An employment protection Act of 1974 introduced rules regarding consultation with unions, notice periods, and grounds for dismissal, together with priority rules for dismissals and re-employment in case of redundancies. That same year, work-environment improvement grants were introduced and made available to modernising firms “conditional upon the presence of union-appointed ‘safety stewards’ to review the introduction of new technology with regard to {{the health and safety of}} workers.” In 1976, an Act on <b>co-determination</b> at work was introduced that allowed unions to be consulted at various levels within companies before major changes were enforced that would affect employees, while management had to negotiate with labour for joint rights in all matters concerning organisation of work, hiring and firing, and key decisions affecting the workplace.|$|E

5000|$|This <b>co-determination</b> law is {{the most}} recent {{in a line of}} laws in Germany, {{originating}} with the 1920 “Works Council Act.” However, the impetus for a movement towards <b>co-determination</b> in Germany stems from the Weimar Constitution after World War I, which, in 1919 said that, “Works and staff are appointed to participate with equal rights together with the company in the regulation of wages and working conditions, {{as well as in the}} complete economic development of the producing powers.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{basic concept}} {{involves}} any power-sharing arrangement in which workplace influence is shared among {{individuals who are}} otherwise hierarchical unequals. Such power-sharing arrangements may entail various employee involvement schemes resulting in <b>co-determination</b> of working conditions, problem solving, and decision-making" [...] (Locke & Schweiger, 1979).|$|E
50|$|As with <b>co-determination,</b> {{there are}} three main views about why works councils {{primarily}} exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers {{at the expense of}} owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, the {{rebuilding}} of the country after World War II created a legislative opportunity in which politician Hans Boeckler significantly lobbied for the <b>Co-Determination</b> ("Mitbestimmung") policies which were established, requiring large companies to include a Workers' Council in the Board of Directors. These policies have had some influence on European Union policies.|$|E

50|$|In company law, {{the term}} {{generally}} used is <b>co-determination,</b> following the German word Mitbestimmung. In Germany, companies {{with more than}} 2000 employees (or more than 1000 employees in the coal and steel industries) have half of their supervisory boards of directors (which elect management) elected by the shareholders and half by the workers.|$|E
50|$|German {{industrial}} relations {{are characterized by}} {{a high degree of}} employee participation up to <b>co-determination</b> in companies' boards ("Aufsichtsrat"), where trade unionists and works councils elected by employees have full voting rights. Local trade union representants are democratically elected by union members and formally largely autonomous. Central boards of directors ("Vorstand") are elected by delegates.|$|E
5000|$|The party opposed {{a planned}} economy, land reform and <b>co-determination</b> {{and sought to}} {{represent}} those who {{had served in the}} Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS.The German Party of the 1950s has been characterized as a [...] "party of indigenous Lower Saxonian middle class", that featured extremely [...] "states' rights, monarchist and partially also nationalist (völkisch) positions".|$|E
5000|$|Seven referendums {{were held}} in Switzerland in 1987. The first four were held on 5 April on {{amendments}} to the laws on asylum and foreign residents (both approved), a popular initiative [...] "for the people's <b>co-determination</b> of military expenditure" [...] (rejected) and a federal resolution on the voting system for popular initiatives that also have counter-proposals (approved).|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{financial}} crises 2008 the monastery too has had to face some financial challenges. This has led to for example <b>co-determination</b> procedures. During 2003-2013 the financial reports of the monastery have shown a surplus in two years. 2012 the result was positive mainly because 2012 the monastery received insurance reimbursements due to the fire incident in its main building.|$|E
50|$|The aspects {{and issues}} {{collected}} during the advices are put into practice in the political activity. The sh.asus {{is part of the}} political committee for university education in South Tyrol and has a right of <b>co-determination.</b> Under constant communication with the politicians, the sh.asus tries to improve everything around university studies. Traditional it is very important for the sh.asus to improve the Italian recognition of university degrees, acquired in Austria.|$|E

5000|$|The protests were {{primarily}} coordinated by the [...] "Mediaspree versenken" [...] Bürgerinitiative (citizen's initiative), {{which was founded}} by the architect Carsten Joost, among others. Under the slogan Spreeufer für alle! ("Spree riverfront for all!"), the Bündnis Informationsveranstaltungen für Anwohner (The [...] "Informational Events for Residents" [...] Alliance) organized so-called [...] "neighborhood walks" [...] against the project and led a citizen's campaign for the <b>co-determination</b> of the Spree riverfront.|$|E
50|$|<b>Co-determination</b> enjoys {{intractable}} {{support among}} Germans in principle. In practice, {{there are many}} calls for amendments to the laws in various ways. One of the main achievements {{seems to be that}} workers are more involved and have more of a voice in their workplaces, which sees a return in high productivity. Furthermore, industrial relations are more harmonious with low levels of strike actions, while better pay and conditions are secured for employees.|$|E
50|$|Jones {{then goes}} on to {{describe}} some proposals which he believes would help to reassert the democracy which he claims has been lost in modern Britain. Some of these are: Higher top rates of tax; “Democracy in the workplace”, citing <b>co-determination</b> - Germany's model of employee representation within company board meetings; A system of “democratic public ownership” of key utilities such as railways, electricity companies and banks; laws to shut the revolving door of politics including banning MPs from taking up second jobs.|$|E
50|$|An {{enterprise}} that is self-managed {{is referred to}} as a labour-managed firm. Self-management refers to control rights within a productive organization, being distinct from the questions of ownership and what economic system the organization operates under. Self-management of an organization may coincide with employee ownership of that organization, but self-management can also exist in the context of organizations under public ownership, and to a limited extent within private companies in the form of <b>co-determination</b> and worker representation on the board of directors.|$|E
50|$|Modern social {{democracy}} {{is characterized by}} a commitment to policies aimed at curbing inequality, oppression of underprivileged groups, and poverty; including support for universally accessible public services like care for the elderly, child care, education, health care, and workers' compensation. The social democratic movement also has strong connections with the labour movement and trade unions, and is supportive of collective bargaining rights for workers as well as measures to extend democratic decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of <b>co-determination</b> for employees and other economic stakeholders.|$|E
5000|$|Basically, the {{structure}} of the village corresponds to that of a kibbutz. The management consists of parents or ward representatives, employees and representatives of the disabled. This is the main difference from other disabled facilities. In Kfar Tikvah, the disabled people who live here as members of this [...] "kibbutz" [...] have a right to speak, also on leadership level. The elected representatives of the disabled have the right of <b>co-determination</b> and co-decision, for instance in the occupation of workplaces, in projects, or in the reception of new members. Changing work and responsibility for others and the group, that makes Kfar Tikvah so special.|$|E
5000|$|The Landstände first {{emerged in}} the 14th century, {{although}} the term itself was not used in Middle High German and was probably first translated later from the French word états. [...] But {{it was not a}} new concept. The records of the Roman historian, Tacitus, show that <b>co-determination</b> was already being practised in the classical period at important public occasions. And according to the old Germanic law, public meetings and court hearings - the so-called things - were held, in the open. Even in the later Frankish Empire, alongside the general assemblies of the nobility and clergy, so-called placita are recorded; a form of representation of the people.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Diamant {{also turned}} to the {{question}} of industrial democracy. As always, his observations tended to be cool and objective, when he was discussing it. And yet, his study revealed a critical impetus. The analytic stance and the detachment may have made his critical observations even more effective. Discussing the German model which allowed trade-union representatives to sit on the board of corporations in the name of ‘joint decision-making’ or <b>co-determination</b> (‘Mitbestimmung’), P. Barach and A. Botwinick observed that Diamant provided a “thorough and perceptive study.” Diamant “concluded that the achievements of codetermination «so far are more nearly system-maintaining than system-transforming in character» ….” The words quoted, though carefully phrased and seemingly detached and objective, reveal a certain disappointment.|$|E
5000|$|Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of {{the ruling}} Christian Democratic Union {{implemented}} a new novel economic order amalgamating the promotion of free competition with {{the responsibility of the}} social government. The Wirtschaftswunder or [...] "economic miracle" [...] of West Germany could not have been brought about without secure social peace in the country. Adenauer's program centered on legislation establishing <b>co-determination</b> in the coal and steel industry, the system of employee property formation, the equalization of burdens, the creation of subsidized housing, child benefits, the agricultural Green Plan, and the dynamism of pensions. On 20 June 1948, the principles of the [...] "social market economy" [...] espoused by the CDU became the foundation of modern German economic policy: ...|$|E

50|$|Thanks to {{the years}} during which a {{co-operative}} {{culture has been}} in place, management requests from workers for proposals to improve operations or increase productivity, for example, are no longer considered mere legal formalities; they represent recognition {{of the fact that}} workers play an important part in plant success. In tandem, a practical approach has evolved among both parties, with each aiming to reach decisions based on consensus. In addition, worker representatives no longer automatically reject every proposal for structural reform, increased efficiency of even layoffs; instead, they examine each suggestion from an inclusive, long-term perspective. At the core of this approach is transparency of information, such as economic data. <b>Co-determination</b> is thus practised at every level, from the local plant to firm headquarters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{territory}} of the former GDR is thus to become a [...] "Special Cultivation Zone" [...] separated {{from the rest of}} Germany by edificial means in order to emphasize the visionary idea of such a zone and is to benefit from a de-bureaucratized and streamlined administrative system. Additionally, the PARTEI is demanding health care reform, protection of natural resources and a program for reduction of working time as an alternative to Agenda 2010, an unpopular set of labor market reforms introduced under Chancellor Schroeder in 2003. It also supports improved <b>co-determination</b> rights for citizens, in particular it demands that a new constitution be passed on the basis of wide-ranging discussions, to be ratified by the people (in line with article 146 of the constitution).|$|E
50|$|Inhabitants of the {{surrounding}} municipalities, {{so long as they}} are part of the Markgenossenschaft, have the right to fell timber in the Markwald, to leave their cattle to graze in the forest (e.g. droving or pannage) and so on. Hunting rights were not included however. Members of the Markgenossenschaft have a percentage share in the woods, but no specific claim to ownership. They have the right of <b>co-determination</b> and the type of management to be carried out, is jointly agreed, on the advice of the forester responsible, at their annual general meetings. They can, for example, decide if and where plantations are established and whether wind generators may be built within the forest area. They also benefit for example if the income from timber sales or hunting licences exceeds the expenditure.|$|E
