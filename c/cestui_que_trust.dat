50|$|The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use and <b>trust</b> were {{rooted in}} medieval law, {{and became a}} legal method to avoid the feudal (medieval) {{incidents}} (payments) to an overlord, while leaving the land {{for the use of}} another, who owed nothing to the lord. The law of <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> tended to defer jurisdiction to courts of equity as opposed to common law courts. The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> was often utilized by persons who might be absent from the kingdom for an extended time (as on a Crusade, or a business adventure), and who held tenancy to the land, and owed feudal incidents to a lord. The land could be left for the use of a third party, who did not owe the incidents to the lord.|$|R
5000|$|The cestui que use is {{the person}} for whose benefit the trust is created. The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust</b> {{is the person}} {{entitled}} to an equitable, {{as opposed to a}} legal, estate.

The term, principally owing to its cumbersome nature, has been virtually superseded in modern law by that of [...] "beneficiary", and general law of trusts.|$|E

5000|$|The Statute of Uses {{was enacted}} in 1535, and was {{intended}} to end the [...] "abuses" [...] which had incurred in <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use. It declared that any holder of a <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use became the holder of the legal title of the ownership in fee simple. This voided the advantages of a <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use. The feoffee to uses was bypassed. The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use had seisin. Henry VIII of England got his incidences back. The land owner {{lost the ability to}} will the land to heirs other than those in direct lineage. There could be no bypassing of heirs with a <b>cestui</b> <b>que.</b> This condition was modified in the Statute of Wills (1540). One {{of the effects of the}} Statute of Uses in executing the use, was to make a mere sale of land without feoffment (the formal public transfer) effective to pass the legal estate. The buyer became the owner by operation of the statute. It necessitated a public announcement of the intended sale to determine if the land had been surreptitiously sold to someone else. The Statute of Uses required a public registry of sale of land, later called the Statute of Enrollments.|$|R

5000|$|Many reasons {{have been}} given for the {{invention}} of the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use as a legal device. During the Crusades, and other wars on the Continent, landowners might be gone for long periods of time. Others might be absent because of business adventures or religious pilgrimages. There was no assurance they would ever return home. The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use allowed them to leave a trusted friend or relative with the sort of powers, discretions and they hoped, the duties. Today, this power would be called the [...] "power of attorney". Religious orders such as Franciscans, Cistercians, Benedictines and other mendicant orders took vows of poverty, yet retained the use of donated property. <b>Cestui</b> <b>que</b> use allowed them the benefits of land without legal ownership.|$|R

5000|$|I {{think there}} may be a purpose or object trust, the {{carrying}} out of which would benefit an individual or individuals, where that benefit is so indirect or intangible or which is otherwise so framed as not to give those persons any locus standi to apply to the court to enforce the trust, in which case the beneficiary principle would, as it seems to me, apply to invalidate the trust, quite apart from any question of uncertainty or perpetuity. Such cases can be considered if and when they arise. The present is not, in my judgment, of that character, and it will be seen that clause 2 (d) of the trust deed expressly states that, subject to any rules and regulations made by the trustees, the employees of the company shall be entitled to the use and enjoyment of the land. Apart from this possible exception, in my judgment the beneficiary principle of In re Astor's Settlement Trusts. which was approved in In re Endacott, decd. - see particularly by Harman L.J. - is confined to purpose or object trusts which are abstract or impersonal. The objection is not that the trust is for a purpose or object per se, but that there is no beneficiary or <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust.</b> The rule is so expressed in Lewin on Trusts, 16th ed. (1964), p. 17, and, in my judgment, with the possible exception I have mentioned, rightly so. In In re Wood, decd., Harman J. said 36:"There has been an interesting argument on the question of perpetuity, but it seems to me, with all respect to that argument, that there is an earlier obstacle which is fatal to the validity of this bequest, namely, that a gift on trust must have a <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust,</b> and there being here no <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust</b> the gift must fail."Again, in Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales Viscount Simonds, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:“A gift can be made to persons (including a corporation) but it cannot be made to a purpose or to an object: so also," [...] - and these are the important words - [...] "a trust may be created for the benefit of persons as cestuis que trust but not for a purpose or object unless the purpose or object be charitable. For a purpose or object cannot sue, but, if it be charitable, the Attorney-General can sue to enforce it.”Where, then, the trust, though expressed as a purpose, is directly or indirectly for the benefit of an individual or individuals, {{it seems to me that}} it is in general outside the mischief of the beneficiary principle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{purpose trust}} is a trust {{created for the}} {{fulfilment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. While charitable trusts are also for the benefit of an abstract purpose, charitable purposes for the public benefit are an exception to the standard rule regarding purpose trusts, which is that they are void. The invalidity of purpose trusts is commonly said to have been set in Morice v Bishop of Durham. In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales, Lord Simonds set the principle that: [...] A gift can be made to persons (including a corporation) but it cannot be made to a purpose or to an object; so, also a trust may be created for the benefit of persons as <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust</b> but not for a purpose or object unless the purpose or object be charitable. For a purpose or object cannot sue, but, if it be charitable, the Attorney General can sue to enforce it. Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, argues that {{this is an example of}} the [...] "strict" [...] rule against purpose trusts. A looser application was found in Cocks v Manners, a case with almost identical facts, where the court decided that the trust was valid as a gift to every member of the order individually, with the Mother Superior acting as a trustee.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ratification}} of directorial breaches of fiduciary duties {{is riddled with}} inconsistencies and uncertainties. The authorities suggest first, that ratification in this sense is a matter that falls within the capacity and power {{of a majority of}} the shareholders, and secondly, that the effect of the ratification is to release the errant directors so as to extinguish the company’s claim against them. This concept of ratification is premised on the trust concept of release. However, the application of the trust concept to the corporate context necessitates equating the company with the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust.</b> This gives rise to obvious difficulties, as the company is not a homogeneous entity, and is far removed conceptually from the individual <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> <b>trust.</b> This article submits that the better position to adopt would be to simply accept that ratification cannot have the effect of claim extinguishment or release in the area of breach of directors’ duties. This task is better left to the discretion of the courts in the exercise of their general jurisdiction to relieve an errant director from the consequences of a breach of duty under section 727 of the Companies Act 1985...|$|E

5000|$|From the Doctor and Student (1518) [...] "It will be {{somewhat}} long and peradventure somewhat tedious to show all the causes particularly." [...] By the fifteenth century, <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use was {{a vehicle to}} defraud creditors. The main use was to leave land, or parts of land {{to members of the}} family other than the primary heir. This was a way to avoid primogeniture inheritance. While the use was intact, the occupant of the land could take advantage of the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use to avoid the feudal payments and duties (incidents). Incidents such as wardship, marriage penalties and other gifts, taxes, fines, fees, and knight service were onerous. Common law did not recognize <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> uses as such, and there was difficulty fitting these cases into the existing writs and case law. The incidents could not be enforced against a person who was on a Crusade, or other war, or business adventure. They were not present in the kingdom to be enforced to perform. Since the feudal oath was to the person, and not the land, there could be no lien against the land. A hallmark of medieval feudalism was the person to person oath of allegiance. The feudal incidents could not be enforced upon the beneficiaries of the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use, since these were not the owners of the land. The users had not sworn an oath to the lord. Therefore, they owed the lord nothing. The <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use had no estate. They had no seisin, nor a trespass, and therefore, ejectment could not be effected. These required possession. Assumpsit was of no avail. In 1402, the Commons had petitioned the king for a remedy against dishonest feoffees to uses, apparently with no result. <b>Cestui</b> <b>que</b> use became a new kind of property and property use.|$|R
2500|$|It was not effective. Land {{could be}} still {{be left to}} the Church by the {{mechanism}} of <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use.

50|$|Besides {{the obvious}} {{limitations}} placed on <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> by the Statute of Mortmain, Statute of Uses and the Statute of Wills, its legality was shaped indirectly by provisions within the Magna Carta and Quia Emptores.|$|R
50|$|Example 2: If Jane (women could {{engage in}} <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use), granted Blackacre to Charles {{to the use}} of David, then David became the {{beneficial}} owner and Jane could not vary or detract from that ownership.|$|R
50|$|Concerted {{efforts were}} made under Henry VII of England to reform <b>cestui</b> <b>que.</b> A change in the laws made feoffees the {{absolute}} owners of the property of {{which they had been}} enfeoffed, and they became subject to all the liabilities of ownership. They were the only ones who could take proceedings against those who interfered with their ownership. If a trespass had been committed with the license of the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use they could take proceedings against him, for he was at law only a tenant at sufferance. Similarly, feoffees were the only ones who could take the proceedings against tenants of the land to compel them to perform their obligations.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{debt was}} brought for rent by a <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use, and the {{defendant}} pleaded [...] "nihil habuit tempore dimissions", the plaintiff {{would have lost}} his action {{if he had not}} made a special replication setting out the facts.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{the opinion}} of William Holdsworth [...] quoting such {{scholars}} as Gilbert, Sanders, Blackstone, Spence and Digby, that <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> in English law had a Roman origin. An analogy exists between <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> uses and a usufructus (usufruct) or the bequest of a fideicommissum. These all tended to create a feoffement to one person {{for the use of}} another. Gilbert [...] writes, (also seen in Blackstone): [...] "that they answer more to the fideicommissum than the usufructus of the civil law." [...] These were transplanted into England from Roman Civil Law about the close of the reign of Edward III of England by means of foreign ecclesiastics who introduced them to evade the Statute of Mortmain. Others argue that the comparison between <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> and Roman law is merely superficial. The transfer of land for the use of one person for certain purposes to be carried out either in the lifetime or after the death of the person conveying it has its basis in Germanic law. It was popularly held that land could be transferred for the use from one person to another in local custom. The formal English or Saxon law didn't always recognize this custom. The practice was called Salman or Treuhand. [...] "Sala" [...] is German for [...] "transfer". It is related to the Old English [...] "sellen", [...] "to sell".|$|R
5000|$|Henry VIII {{sought to}} end all <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> uses and regain the {{incidents}} (fees and payments) that had been deprived him. Thomas Cromwell and Audley who succeeded Thomas More vigorously crushed <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> uses in the courts, persuading judges to declare them illegal or void. [...] By 1538-39, over 800 religious land holdings had been returned to the Crown. Many of these were subsequently sold, converted to private dwellings, given to loyal supporters of the English Reformation, dismantled for building materials, or abandoned and allowed to degenerate into ruins. Claims of religious corruption were frequently used to justify reclamation by the Crown. Since many of these religious orders provided charity, much of the local medical and social services were left in disarray. (see: Dissolution of the Monasteries, List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England) ...|$|R
50|$|In many usufructory {{property}} systems, such as {{the traditional}} ejido system in Mexico, individuals or groups may only acquire the usufruct of the property, not legal title. A usufruct is directly equatable to a common-law life estate except that a usufruct can be granted for a term shorter than the holder's lifetime (<b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> vie).|$|R
5000|$|A {{beneficiary}} (also, in <b>trust</b> law, <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use) in {{the broadest}} sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. For example, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person who receives the payment of the amount of insurance after the death of the insured.|$|R
50|$|As {{the lord}} {{at the top}} of the feudal pyramid, the King {{suffered}} most from the employment of uses and evasion of tenurial incidents. The Statute of Uses (1536) was the culmination of various attempts by Henry VIII to solve the problem. The statute operated to execute the use so that the interest of the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use, which was previously an equitable interest, was converted into a legal interest.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{controversy}} in Chudleigh's case {{was whether the}} Statute of Uses had reduced the feoffee to uses to a mere conduit pipe through which possession passed to the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use, or whether he still retained {{some of the old}} powers he had before the Statute of Uses. What the majority judges sought in the case was just what the projectors of the present property reform in England were after, the free alienability of land. Chudleigh's Case became known as the Case of Perpetuities. The case turned on the doctrine of scintilla juris which Bacon called metaphysics of the worst kind. Scintilla juris (Latin: a spark of right), is a legal fiction allowing feoffees to uses to support contingent uses when they come into existence, thereby to enable the Statute of Uses to execute them. Chudleigh's Case represented the turning point of the old medieval common law of <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> uses, and the trend toward modernity. Bacon suggested that Justice Coke had [...] "ripped uses from their cradle." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{appearance of}} <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> {{in the medieval}} period was the feoffee to uses, which like the Salman, held on account of another. This was called the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use. It was because the feoffor could impose on him many various duties that landowners acquired through his instrumentality {{the power to do}} many things with their land. This was a to avoid the rigidity of medieval common law of land and its uses. Germanic law was familiar with the idea that a man who holds property on account of, or to the use of another is bound to fulfill his trust. Frankish formulas from the Merovingian period describe property given to a church [...] "ad opus sancti illius." [...] Mercian books in the ninth century convey land [...] "ad opus monachorum". The Domesday Book refers to geld or money, sac and soc held in [...] "ad opus regus", or in [...] "reginae" [...] or [...] "vicecomitis". The laws of William I of England speak of the sheriff holding money [...] "al os le rei" [...] ("for the use of the king").|$|R
5000|$|One {{reason for}} the {{creation}} of uses was a desire to avoid the strictness of the rules of the common law, which considered seisin to be all-important and therefore refused to allow a legal interest to be created to spring up in the future. Although the common law recognised a use in chattels from an early period, it was clear {{by the end of the}} fourteenth century that land law had no room for this notion. Uses, nonetheless, satisfied contemporary needs in fifteenth century England. Its first application in relation to land was to protect the ownership of the land by the Franciscan friars, who were pledged to vows of poverty and unable to own land. This enabled the feoffee to uses for the benefit of a <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use. The common law did not recognise the <b>cestui</b> <b>que</b> use but affirmed the right of ownership by feoffee to use.The term [...] "use" [...] translates into [...] "Trust" [...] and this was the legal beginning of Trusts and the use of trusts to defeat feudal, death and tax dues.|$|R
