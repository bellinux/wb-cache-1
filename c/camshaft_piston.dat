The first part provides a basic description of plain bearings, their distribution and evolution. It also discusses their materials and the theory of hydrodynamic lubrication. The second part covers concept of sliding bearings in internal combustion engines and their load associated with the election of right material. It also includes description of particular application of plain bearings and the method of oil distribution. It handles the mounting of crankshaft and <b>camshaft,</b> <b>piston</b> pin, connecting rod and other places where sleeve bearings are use...|$|E

50|$|However, one of {{the biggest}} changes were a series of engine {{upgrades}} which included redesigned cylinder heads, now with a single intake and exhaust port for every cylinder, improved intake/exhaust manifolds, new <b>camshafts</b> and <b>pistons</b> and an all-new carburettor called the Rochester Varajet, as well as the fitment of electronic ignition. In total, these upgrades brought up to 25 percent more power and 15 percent better fuel efficiency. The engine block on these motors were painted a blue colour (as opposed to the previous red) and were known as the XT5 versions, although are commonly referred to as the Blue motors.|$|R
5000|$|From 1984 to 1988 the {{standard}} G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters.

5000|$|The {{flagship}} {{model of the}} W140 lineup, the S 600 (600 SEL until 1993) LWB saloon set new standards of performance, {{the likes of which}} had never been achieved with such a heavy robust car up to that time. The S600 L served {{as the basis for the}} development of the Maybach 57 and Maybach 62 models sold by Daimler-Benz. In its mildest state of tune, the M120 6.0-litre V12 engine was capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in as little as 5.5 seconds and with a top speed of 179 mph with the limiter removed. Mid to high range acceleration is immense and closely matches the first generation S 63 AMG model in this regard. Even today the S 600 is still popularly used as an alternative performance option to the newer, more expensive AMG models. There were available, a limited number of the 600 SEL model with an AMG aftermarket power pack upgrade, increasing the power output to approximately [...] with 623 Nm of torque thanks to slightly more aggressive <b>camshafts,</b> <b>pistons</b> and connecting rods and a computerised remap of the original ECU.

50|$|The S4-E {{incorporated}} the technically advanced {{features of the}} S4 DA such as an engine with twin overhead <b>camshaft,</b> hemispherical <b>piston</b> heads with the centrally positioned spark plugs. The chassis featured rack and pinion steering, with independent suspension at the front. However, the front suspension was now refined through the addition of longitudinal torsion bars, an approach probably copied from the Citroën Traction that had appeared the year before. Commentators noted that the new engine and suspension enhancements {{gave rise to a}} combination of performance and road-holding that was among the best in class for the time. Another novelty for the S4-E was a hydraulically controlled brake circuit in place of the then conventional mechanical linkage.|$|R
5000|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, crosshead guide bars, links, piston rods, chilled rolls, granite rolls, brass rolls, rubber rolls, paper rolls, crankshafts, <b>camshafts,</b> <b>piston</b> rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes. Experiments are being carried out on the grinding of cylinders for locomotive and other engines. [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|R
50|$|Pompeo sent a Crosley {{engine to}} Bandini {{for him to}} study and use. Lightweight and compact, this American engine was very versatile, having been used with boats, aircraft, and even in fire pumps. It had {{aluminium}} block with five main bearings, monoblock with to two valves per cylinder, gear driven single overhead cam, and more. Bandini immediately began making modifications for racing, including longer Stroke steel crankshaft (raising the displacement to 747 cc), new <b>pistons,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> and oil pump.|$|R
5000|$|The W07 {{version of}} the 770 was powered by an inline eight-cylinder engine of [...] {{capacity}} with an overhead <b>camshaft</b> and aluminium <b>pistons.</b> [...] This engine produced [...] at 2800 rpm without supercharging. An optional Roots type supercharger, which was engaged at full throttle, would raise the output to [...] at 2800 rpm, which could propel the car to 160 km/h. The transmission had four forward ratios, of which third was direct and fourth was an overdrive (mechanics).|$|R
50|$|The Eric-Campbell 10 (10/22 in 1924) was {{assembled}} from bought-in components with a Coventry-Simplex 1498 cc, four cylinder, {{side valve}} engine driving {{the rear wheels}} through a cone clutch and three speed Moss gearbox. The engine was tuned with a special <b>camshaft</b> and lightened <b>pistons.</b> Half elliptic leaf springs were fitted at the front whilst at the rear cantilever springing was used. A top speed of 55 mph was guaranteed and 60 mph claimed as possible. Two seat polished aluminium bodies were fitted with a simulacrum of a Rolls-Royce radiator.|$|R
50|$|All M112 engines have {{aluminum}} engine blocks with a 90° vee angle with silicon/aluminum lined cylinders. The aluminum SOHC {{cylinder heads}} have 3 valves per cylinder. All use SFI fuel injection with two spark plugs per cylinder. All have forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast <b>camshaft,</b> iron-coated aluminum <b>pistons</b> and a magnesium intake manifold. To {{deal with the}} vibration problems of a 90 degree V6, a balancer shaft was installed in the engine block between the cylinder banks. This essentially eliminated first and second order vibration problems, see engine balance. A dual-length Variable Length Intake Manifold is fitted to optimise engine flexibility.|$|R
5000|$|The Norton Featherbed {{frame was}} {{regarded}} as the best handling item of the day, and the Triton rationale was to combine the [...] "best engine" [...] with the [...] "best frame" [...] by replacing the standard Norton engine with Triumph parallel-twin engine. A popular engine choice was the Triumph Bonneville unit with twin carburettors and twin camshafts. This pushrod engine gave good performance and reliability and could be more easily tuned for greater power using high-profile <b>camshafts,</b> high compression <b>pistons</b> and twin carburettors. In due course, a Weslake 8-valve head became available for the Triumph motor.|$|R
50|$|The B9 {{is based}} on the 528i, whose M30-2.8-liter BMW engine was {{replaced}} by a 3.45-liter Alpina tuned motor.

The engine transmits its power to the rear wheels via a 5-speed gearbox, an automatic transmission was also available. The suspension of the E28 has been modified with Bilstein gas dampers, as standard the B9 was delivered with 16-inch wheels (see picture). Alpina also modified the interior with among other things, recaro seats, a new shifter and a modified instrument cluster.|$|R
5000|$|The D5244T is {{also offered}} as a marine engine by Volvo Penta under the name D3. The marinised engine is in large parts {{identical}} to D5244T.

However, models produced after 2008 had a 4.7-litre [...] V8. Though based loosely on Jaguar's AJ-V8 engine architecture, this engine was unique to Aston Martin and featured race-style dry-sump lubrication, which enabled it to be mounted low in the chassis for an improved center of gravity. The cylinder block and heads, crankshaft, connecting rods, <b>pistons,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> inlet and exhaust manifolds, lubrication system, and engine management were all Aston Martin designs and the V8 engine was assembled by hand at the AM facility in Cologne, Germany, which also built the V12 engine for the DB9 and Vanquish.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the need}} to meet {{proposed}} European Union legislation on emissions regulation, BMW had started to develop an alternate technology to its traditional flat-twin engines {{with the introduction of}} the 1,000 cc BMW K100 from 1983 to 1992. Led by Josef Fritzenwenger and Stefan Pachernegg, the team developed a design prototype based on a liquid-cooled Peugeot car engine. In the base design of the K100, the engine was laid on its side in line with the motorcycle frame, known as a longitudinal four, with the crankshaft on the right hand side of the motorcycle, with the cylinders, <b>pistons,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> injectors and spark plugs on the left hand side.

The minimum compression of the engine must be 18,6 bar, the compression ratio is 19:1. The fuel injetion pressure is 147 bar. The cetane number of the fuel must not be fewer than 44.|$|R
2500|$|All {{variants}} of the R.C.40 had {{much in common}} with construction of the earlier Asso 750 R.C., though they had two, rather than three, banks of 6 cylinders and 4 rather than 2 valves per cylinder. [...] Cylinder barrels were machined from carbon steel with flat-topped heads and valve seats. Each barrel had a separate sheet steel water jacket. [...] Cast aluminium head blocks were bolted to each of the two banks of 6 cylinders, providing valve ports, guides, coolant passages and <b>camshaft</b> supports. The <b>pistons</b> were also aluminium castings. The crankshaft was a 6-throw design with 8 plain bearings and a double row ball thrust bearing between the front two. [...] The connecting rods had bronze bush little ends and white metal big ends. [...] The crankcase was cast in two parts, the upper one with the housings for the crankshaft bearings.|$|R
5000|$|Aston Martin hand-assembles {{a special}} {{version of the}} AJ-V8 for the 2005 V8 Vantage known as AJ37. This unit {{displaced}} 4.3 L (4280 cc/261 in³) and produces [...] at 7000 rpm and 302 lbft Nm at 5000 rpm. This engine is unique to Aston Martin and features race-style dry-sump lubrication, which enables it to be mounted low to lower the centre of gravity. The firing order {{is the same as}} the other AJ-V8 engines although the cylinder numbering is different (AJ37 = 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8 vs. AJ26 = 1-2-7-3-4-5-6-8).

50|$|The V8s used in Aston Martins from 1969 to 2000 {{were based}} on an {{internal}} design by Tadek Marek and were used extensively {{in a variety of}} models, starting with the 1969 DBS V8, followed by the Vantage, Virage, plus Volante convertible versions amongst others. After the Vantage was discontinued in 2000, there were no V8 models until the introduction in 2005 of a hand-built dry-sump version of Jaguar's AJ-V8 with 4.3 L. The block, heads, crankshaft, connecting rods, <b>pistons,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> inlet and exhaust manifolds, lubrication system and engine management are all unique to the Aston Martin. It was used in the V8 Vantage. In 2008, capacity was increased to 4.7 L by using pressed cylinder liners instead of cast-in liners.Aston Martin has since sourced its engines, both V8s as well as V12s, from American manufacturer Ford with additional future engine supply from Germany's Mercedes-Benz.|$|R

It uses a single sparkplug and a single four-cycle chamber, and has no connecting rods, <b>pistons,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> valves, carburetor or crankshaft. It consists of rotating parts on a drive shaft that, on rotating, produces compression and expansion aided by the inertia of a flywheel, based on a pair of blades or [...] "bailadores" [...] that act as pistons, named in honor of his village. These blades replace the rotating cam of conventional motors and are driven by a planetary gear system which forms a combustion chamber between the two blades. The feasibility of this engine has been proven by engineers at the University of Los Andes interested in the subject, but has not been implemented, due to lack of support for blade construction.

Under Appendix J, eligibility was restricted to closed cars with seating for four persons and at least one hundred examples of the model had to have been produced. [...] Bodywork and interior trim had to remain virtually standard; however, engines and suspensions could be modified to improve performance and handling.

40|$|A {{realization}} of the Atkinson cycle provides a way of increasing fuel efficiency through an over-expansion. One way of achieving an over-expanded cycle is through the implementation of Late Intake Valve Closing (LIVC). The aim of this master thesis is therefore to investigate LIVC as a strategy towards improving fuel efficiency. The research includes a numerical study with simulations performed in GT-power, but also an experimental study where tests were performed on a Volvo 2. 0 liter 4 -cylinder turbocharged SI-engine. This was done {{for the purpose of}} verifying the findings from the simulations. For the numerical study, different intake valve closings between 60 and 100 crank angle degrees after bottom dead center were simulated in GT-power with respect to decreased break specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The effects of varying the valve lift were also investigated. Simulations were also performed with increased geometric compression ratio to compensate for the decreased effective compression ratio caused by LIVC. The simulation results suggest that BSFC could be reduced with 7 - 8 % over a wide range of loads and engine speeds. The baseline engine was modified with a new intake <b>camshaft</b> and new <b>pistons</b> in order to be consistent with the simulated engine. An experimental study of the modified engine was then performed and instead of the 7 - 8 % BSFC reduction suggested by the simulations, the experimental results showed a 2 - 6 % reduction of BSFC. This was found for engine speeds up to 2100 rpm and loads up to 8 - 9 bar. At 3000 rpm the BSFC was instead increased which was an unexpected outcome that deviates from what the simulations suggested. This is believed to be partly caused by increased pumping losses at this engine speed as a consequence of high back pressure in the exhaust manifold...|$|R
