40|$|Abstract. The {{electrical}} properties of AlGaN/GaN heterojunction high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) are simulated by using sentaurus software. This paper compares two structures, the HEMT with GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> and the HEMT without GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer.</b> The sentaurus software simulates the DC and AC {{characteristics of the}} two AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The HEMT with GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> can increase the maximum transconductance gm from 177 ms/mm to 399 ms/mm when the doping concentration of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> is 3 × 10 18 cm- 3 compared with the other structure under the same conditions.

30|$|On the contrary, the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> shows a {{completely}} inverse behavior {{compared to the}} Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer.</b> This {{can be attributed to}} the higher melting point (2, 250 °C) than the FePt film, and the negative thermal stress − 0.54  GPa on FePt thin films listed in the Table  1. Based on the discussion above, the high melting point of Ru helps the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> maintain a smooth continuous film until the ordered FePt particles are formed. And the negative thermal stress of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> generates a total in-plane compression stress on the FePt film, which restrains the FePt ordering process. Lastly, we note that the effects of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> on magnetism of 3 -nm-thick FePt films are much more pronounced than the 10 -nm-thick films under the same annealing temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sputter-deposited FePt films exhibit an {{in-plane}} {{magnetic anisotropy}} when they use MgO as <b>capped</b> <b>layer.</b> The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of FePt films are enhanced by introducing Ag <b>capped</b> <b>layer</b> instead of MgO <b>capped</b> <b>layer.</b> Although the in-plane coercivity (Hc ⊥) of FePt films decreases slightly after introducing an Ag capper layer {{instead of a}} MgO <b>capped</b> <b>layer,</b> the perpendicular coercivity (Hc ⊥) is increased significantly from 3169 Oe to 6726 Oe. The Auger electron spectroscopy analysis confirms that the Ag atoms diffuse from <b>capped</b> <b>layer</b> into the FePt magnetic layer and the Ag atoms mainly distribute at the grain boundary of FePt. This phenomenon results in the grain boundary energy enhancement and the grain growth inhibition and therefore increases the perpendicular coercivity and decrease the grain size of the FePt film...|$|R

30|$|A {{suitable}} <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> {{is essential}} in magnetic recording media because it can affect the morphology, microstructure, and magnetic property of the magnetic films greatly. For example, Zhao et al. [11] found that the crystallographic ordering of the L 10 FCT FePt phase was significantly promoted when a Ag layer was deposited {{on top of the}} film; Yuan et al. [12] found that a Au <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> was beneficial for FePt layer forming isolated grains and larger coercivity; Chen et al. [17] found that the exchange couple and magnetic reversal process can be controlled by the Cu <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> diffusion in Cu/FePt/Pt/CrW multilayers. In this study, the effect of Ru and Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> on the microstructure and magnetic properties of ultrathin FePt films was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), vibrate sample magnetometer (VSM), and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We found that the Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer after annealing, which lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form island structure, and enhances the coercivity, whereas the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> shows a completely inverse behavior. The effects can be mainly attributed to the different melting point and thermal expansion stress between the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> and the FePt thin films.|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the impurity-free interdiffusion process on {{the properties of the}} dielectric <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> has been studied, for both unstrained GaAs/Alx Ga 1 -y As and pseudomorphic Iny Ga 1 -y As/GaAs MQW structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The influence of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> hickness, composition, and deposition technique on the degree of interdiffusion were all systematically investigated. Electron-beam evaporated SiO 2 films of varying thickness, chemical-vapor-deposited SiOxNy films of varying composition, and spin-on SiO 2 films were used as <b>cap</b> <b>layers</b> during rapid thermal annealing (850 - 950 degree). Photoluminescence at 10 K has been employed to determine the interdiffusion-induced bandgap shifts and to calculate the corresponding Al-Ga and In-Ga interdiffusion coefficients. The latter were found to increase with the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> thickness (e-beam SiO 2) up to a limit determined by saturation of the outdiffused Ga concentration in the SiO 2 caps. A maximum concentration of [Ga] = 4 - 7 x 10 (19) ccm in the Si 02 caps was determined using secondary ion mass spectroscopy profiling. Larger band-edge shifts are also obtained when the oxygen content of SiOx Ny <b>cap</b> <b>layers</b> is increased, although the differences are not sufficiently large for a laterally selective interdiffusion process based on variations in <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> composition alone. Much larger differences are obtained by using different deposition techniques for the <b>cap</b> <b>layers,</b> indicating that the porosity of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> is a much more important parameter than the film composition for the realization of a laterally selective interdiffusion process. For the calculated In 0. 2 Ga 0. 8 As/GaAs interdiffusion coefficients, activation energies EA and prefactors D 0 were estimated to ranging from 3. 04 to 4. 74 eV and 5 x 10 (3) to 2 x 10 (5) square centimeter/s, respectively, dependent on the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> deposition technique and the depth of the MQW from the sample surface...|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{the entire}} {{vertical}} {{layer of the}} moat, there is dry descending air.

Below the <b>capping</b> <b>layer,</b> the air is moist and has convection with the presence of stratocumulus clouds. The moat gradually takes on the characteristics of the eye, upon which the inner eyewall can only dissipate in strength as the majority of the inflow is now being used to maintain the outer eyewall. The inner eye is eventually evaporated as it is warmed by the surrounding dry air in the moat and eye. Models and observations show that once the outer eyewall completely surrounds the inner eye, it takes less than 12 hours for the complete dissipation of the inner eyewall. The inner eyewall feeds mostly upon the moist air in the lower portion of the eye before evaporating.|$|E

For the past years, controlling the post-growth dopant profiles in compound semiconductors such as III-V materials deterministically has not been well achieved due to the challenges in controlling the recovered stoichiometry after the implantation and sequential annealing. These residual damages can lead to higher junction leakage and lower dopant activation in compound semiconductors. Utilizing the MLD technique with sulfur dopants, a dopant profile abruptness of ~ 3.5 nm/decade with high electrically active sulfur concentrations of ~ 8-1018 cm−3 is observed in InAs without significant defect density.
