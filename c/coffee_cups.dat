The Oakland Athletics talked about moving their stadium to this area. The large Asian population in Mission San Jose comes to Warm Springs for authentic Asian stores such as the 99 Ranch & Marina Food supermarkets, {{as well as more}} traditional supermarkets such as Safeway. It was also home to one of the SF Bay Area's only two coffee houses to employ baristas who wear bikinis, Your <b>Coffee</b> <b>Cups,</b> a concept that's gained some controversy from Bay Area newspapers and news stations. This controversy led to the eventual closing of the business.|$|E
25|$|In March 1742, the British {{who were}} based in Fort St George in Madras sent a modest hamper to Nizam ul-mulk in {{recognition}} of his leadership {{of the most important}} of the Mughal successor states.

In return, the Nizam sent one horse, a piece of jewelery and a note warning the British that they had no right to mint their own currency, to which they complied.|$|E

25|$|Ceramics, coins, and {{the remains}} of {{foodstuffs}} from the excavations attest to Zubarah’s far reaching trade and economic links in the late 18th century, with material deriving from eastern Asia, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, Africa, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Diving weights and other material culture show how closely the connection between the daily life in the town and the pearl fishing and trading were. The discovery of <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> and tobacco pipes in the excavations reveal the growing importance of these commodities all over the Persian Gulf during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The etching of a merchant’s dhow, the traditional wooden boat of Arabia, found incised into the plaster in a room of a courtyard building, details how intimately the town's inhabitants associated their daily lives with long-distance maritime trade and commerce. Date trade also had {{an important role in the}} local economy.|$|E
25|$|The other {{aisles of}} the market are also {{dedicated}} {{to a number of}} specialties.

These include plates, bowls, jars for atole, <b>coffee</b> <b>cups,</b> large platters and more. While traditional pottery still dominates, it is also interspersed with cheaper glass items as well. Another traditional area sells toys and party favors. Traditional wooden, cloth and clay toys can still be found, although they are slowly being replaced with cheaper plastic ones. These include dolls, tops, yo yos, cup-and-ball and many more. This area also carries party supplies such as hats, decorations and piñatas, mostly for children’s events. The area also contains costumes for children, such as animals like rabbits and bears as well as princesses and ballerinas. There are also traditional “indito” (little Indian) outfits mostly used in schools on Corpus Christi.|$|E

50|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{differential}} geometry, the <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> and the donut are different because it is impossible to rotate the <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> in such a way that its configuration matches that of the donut.

This china is different from the 1861 set, as both the outline and the colors were done by hand (no stencil was used). [...] This second order of [...] "Lincoln china" [...] consisted of 391 pieces, and included pickle dishes, custard cups, egg cups, serving dishes of various depths, compote dishes, sugar bowls, baskets, butter dishes, dinner plates, dessert plates, tea plates, soup plates, preserve plates, breakfast <b>coffee</b> <b>cups,</b> regular <b>coffee</b> <b>cups,</b> tea cups, water pitchers, and one salad bowl, cake plate, and ice bowl. There is little documentary evidence, but oral tradition claims that E.V. Haughwout contracted with Edward Lycett, the most famous china painter in the United States at the time, to decorate the china. Glassware was also reordered from Haughwout & Co. in 1866, and manufactured by the New England Glass Co. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E
