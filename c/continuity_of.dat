These <b>continuities</b> represent resources <b>of</b> sequential cohesion by recurrence, in texts of different types, and the research shows that such continuities function as characterizing elements of text types and also have other functions (relevance, focalization, expression of reality/non reality etc.) in the textual-discursive constitution of linguistic sequences, independently of the text type...|$|R

5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may obscure the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral.

5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E

Even so, the character of Blofeld was present in the previous film, You Only Live Twice, and he and Bond had met: this previous meeting was ignored for the plot of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Portions of {{at least}} three prints of the film survive: a {{complete}} nitrate print with the car sometimes painted red, given to Méliès's granddaughter Madeleine Malthête-Méliès by an American collector; an incomplete hand-colored nitrate print, bought by Malthête-Méliès from a Belgian collector; and some fragments at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke highly of the film, noting its careful use of <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a similar vein, Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received with success.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the Conestoga Parkway through Waterloo, Highway85 followed King Street north of Ottawa Street through Kitchener and Waterloo. Within the City of Waterloo, this former alignment is now maintained by the region as Regional Road15. Within the city of Kitchener, the road is simply known as King Street. The parkway was constructed between 1968 and 1977. By 1980, Highway85 was renumbered as Highway86, to improve the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> provincial route numbers. However, when the majority of Highway86 was decommissioned in 1998, the remaining portion was soon renumbered as Highway85 in 2003.|$|E
