The flask was then cooled to −25° and charged with 1.89 g (10 mmol) of p-chlorophenyldichloroborane in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran. To this solution was added dropwise 1.25 g (11 mmol) of ethyl diazoacetate in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran at such a rate (1 mL/3-5 minutes) that nitrogen was evolved smoothly (approximately 1.5 hours).

50|$|Mpemba and Osborne {{describe}} placing 70 ml {{samples of}} water in 100 ml beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator {{on a sheet of}} polystyrene foam. They showed the time for freezing to start was longest with an initial temperature of 25 C and that it was much less at around 90 C. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface. David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid <b>cooling</b> <b>bath.</b> In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically -6 to -18 C before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.|$|E
