5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, <b>cryosurgery</b> may be beneficial. Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone creams may help.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity), both <b>cryosurgery</b> and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E

25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} include <b>cryosurgery,</b> {{in which}} liquid nitrogen {{is used to}} freeze and destroy lesions, as well as scraping them off with a curette. Application of liquid nitrogen may cause burning or stinging at the treated site, which may persist {{for a few minutes}} after the treatment. With liquid nitrogen, a blister may form at the treatment site, but it will slough off in two to four weeks. <b>Cryosurgery</b> and curette scraping can be painful procedures and can result in residual scarring.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} — This, {{and similar}} <b>cryosurgery</b> methods, {{is a common}} surgical treatment which acts by freezing the external cell structure of the warts, destroying the live tissue.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{aggressive}} prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral chemotherapeutic drugs (Temozolomide/TMZ), <b>cryosurgery,</b> hormonal therapy, or some combination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryosurgery</b> {{is another}} method of {{treating}} prostate cancer {{in which the}} prostate gland is exposed to freezing temperatures. <b>Cryosurgery</b> is less invasive than radical prostatectomy, and general anesthesia is less commonly used. Under ultrasound guidance, a method invented by Dr. Gary Onik, metal rods are inserted through {{the skin of the}} perineum into the prostate. Highly purified argon gas is used to cool the rods, freezing the surrounding tissue at −186 °C (−302 °F). As the water within the prostate cells freezes, the cells die. The urethra is protected from freezing by a catheter filled with warm liquid. Impotence occurs up to ninety percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. <b>Cryosurgery</b> involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, <b>cryosurgery</b> is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with <b>cryosurgery.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cryobiology (publisher: Elsevier) is the {{foremost}} scientific publication in this area, with about 60 refereed contributions published each year. Articles concern {{any aspect of}} low-temperature biology and medicine (e.g. freezing, freeze-drying, hibernation, cold tolerance and adaptation, cryoprotective compounds, medical applications of reduced temperature, <b>cryosurgery,</b> hypothermia, and perfusion of organs).|$|E
25|$|While tattoos are {{considered}} permanent, {{it is sometimes}} possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), <b>cryosurgery,</b> and —which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{prostate}} cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), <b>cryosurgery,</b> hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or some combination. Which option is best depends {{on the stage of}} the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, <b>cryosurgery,</b> and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cryosurgery</b> {{procedures}} such as cryoablation use liquid argon {{to destroy}} tissue {{such as cancer}} cells. It is used in a procedure called [...] "argon-enhanced coagulation", a form of argon plasma beam electrosurgery. The procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism and {{has resulted in the}} death of at least one patient.|$|E

2500|$|First, a {{diagnosis}} must be made. If the lesion is a seborrheic keratosis, then shave excision, electrodesiccation or <b>cryosurgery</b> may be performed, usually leaving very {{little if any}} scarring. If the lesion is suspected to be a skin cancer, a skin biopsy must be done first, before considering removal. This is unless an excisional biopsy is warranted. If the lesion is a melanocytic nevus, one has to decide if it is medically indicated or not ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{least six}} major areas of {{cryobiology}} can be identified: 1) study of cold-adaptation of microorganisms, plants (cold hardiness), and animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates (including hibernation), 2) cryopreservation of cells, tissues, gametes, and embryos of animal and human origin for (medical) purposes of long-term storage by cooling to temperatures below the freezing point of water. [...] This usually requires {{the addition of}} substances which protect the cells during freezing and thawing (cryoprotectants), 3) preservation of organs under hypothermic conditions for transplantation, 4) lyophilization (freeze-drying) of pharmaceuticals, 5) <b>cryosurgery,</b> a (minimally) invasive approach {{for the destruction of}} unhealthy tissue using cryogenic gases/fluids, and 6) physics of supercooling, ice nucleation/growth and mechanical engineering aspects of heat transfer during cooling and warming, as applied to biological systems. Cryobiology would include cryonics, the low temperature preservation of humans and mammals with the intention of future revival, although this is not part of mainstream cryobiology, depending heavily on speculative technology yet to be invented. Several of these areas of study rely on cryogenics, the branch of physics and engineering that studies the production and use of very low temperatures ...|$|E

50|$|Both <b>cryosurgery</b> and {{electrosurgery}} {{are effective}} choices for small areas of actinic cheilitis. <b>Cryosurgery</b> {{is accomplished by}} applying liquid nitrogen in an open spraying technique. Local anesthesia is not required, but treatment of the entire lip can be quite painful. Cure rates in excess of 96% have been reported. <b>Cryosurgery</b> is the treatment of choice for focal areas of actinic cheilitis. Electrosurgery is an alternate treatment, but local anesthesia is required, making it less practical than <b>cryosurgery.</b> With both techniques, adjacent tissue damage can delay healing and promote scar formation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cryosurgery</b> {{is an old}} {{modality}} for {{the treatment}} of many skin cancers. When accurately utilized with a temperature probe and cryotherapy instruments, it can result in very good cure rate. Disadvantages include lack of margin control, tissue necrosis, over or under treatment of the tumor, and long recovery time. Overall, there are sufficient data to consider <b>cryosurgery</b> as a reasonable treatment for BCC. There are no good studies, however, comparing <b>cryosurgery</b> with other modalities, particularly with Mohs surgery, excision, or electrodesiccation and curettage so that no conclusion can be made whether <b>cryosurgery</b> is as efficacious as other methods. Also, there is no evidence on whether curetting the lesions before <b>cryosurgery</b> affects the efficacy of treatment. Several textbooks are published on the therapy, and a few physicians still apply the treatment to selected patients.|$|E
