The bandwidth cost incurred by a CDN {{is the sum of}} the amounts it pays each ISP for routing traffic from its servers located in that ISP out to end-users. A large enterprise may also contract with multiple ISPs to provide redundant Internet access for its origin infrastructure using technologies such as multihoming and mirroring, thereby incurring a significant bandwidth cost across multiple ISPs. This paper initiates the formal algorithmic study of bandwidth cost minimization {{in the context of a}} large enterprise or a CDN, a problem area that is both algorithmically rich and practically very important. First, we model different types of contracts that are used in practice by ISPs to charge for bandwidth usage, including average, maximum, and 95 th-percentile contracts. Then, we devise an optimal offline algorithm that routes traffic to achieve the minimum bandwidth cost, when the network contracts charge either on a maximum or on an average basis. Next, we devise a deterministic (resp., randomized) online algorithm that achieves cost that is within a factor of 2 (resp., e e− 1) of the optimal offline cost for maximum and average contracts. In addition, we prove that our online algorithms achieve the best possible competitive ratios in both the deterministic and the randomized cases. An interesting theoretical contribution of this work is that we show intriguing connections between the online bandwidth optimization problem and the seemingly-unrelated but well-studied ski rental problem where similar optimal competitive ratios are known to hold.

40|$|Abstract — Marking in DiffServ at {{the edge}} of the network often follows a demand side policy. It meters a traffic stream and marks its packets {{according}} to some predefined traffic parameters as <b>Committed</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rate,</b> <b>Committed</b> Burst Size, Excess Burst Size and so on. Such marking based on traffic characteristics is irrespective to network dynamics, which causes collision and QoS degradation in DiffServ. This paper proposes flow-based Reservation Marking as a supply side marking at the network edge, which marks stream packets reserved or unreserved according to flow-specific reservation in a distributed resource reservation environment. When conges-tion occurs, anticipant per flow QoS is secured by protecting reserved packets on core routers without any per flow or per trunk management. It provides a simple, scalable and adaptive mechanism of implementing quantitative end-to-end QoS by mapping per flow in IntServ into per class in DiffServ. A “once reserve, no more manage ” framework is constructed to eliminate flow state, avoiding unexpected collision and flow management simultaneously on core routers. Performance evaluation reveals that it affords controllable and quantitative QoS, keeps networks core-stateless and achieves high link utilization at the same time. I...|$|R

The Marine Technology Workshop, Martech 2009 is an {{initiative}} from Tecnoterra Associated Unit (Technical University of Catalonia and Scientific Research Council. Two Broadband Satellite Communication Systems were installed in two of our vessels during 2008. In BO Sarmiento de Gamboa a VSAT Communication System in C band was installed with a data transfer rate of 192 kbps (<b>CIR,</b> <b>Commited</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rate)</b> and a burst capacity of 256 kbps (MIR, Maximum <b>Information</b> <b>Rate)</b> which can be increased to 5 Mbps. While in BIO Hesperides, following Navy specifications (the ship-owner) a TNX 75 Communication System in X band was installed with a data transfer rate of 128 kbps (CIR) which can be also increased to 5 Mbps. Apart from the advantages that an Internet access has had for the researchers, {{one of the most important}} characteristics of this Broadband System is the possibility of configuring a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the vessels and the UTM main offices on shore (Land-Site). This network enables real-time data transmission and remote systems control and operation (Figure 1). Furthermore, web browsing is possible and an IP telephone system has been installed. The installation of this kind of networks is not easy and several difficulties can appear. Therefore, an optimal configuration of protocol architecture has to be looked for. In satellite communication where TCP/IP protocols are used, data links are very sensitive to latency, asymmetric links, and package loss due to congestion or transmission errors. Both vessels are managed by UTM owned by different ministries. Administrative requirements were different at the time of choosing the satellite service providers.

Its simplicity, scalability, and inexpensiveness {{have made it}} an {{attractive}} technology for enterprises to interconnect their metro area networks (MANs). Today, Carrier Ethernet can span over 10, 000 km. Ethernet Services were created to enable companies to distribute their own services through the carrier-grade network.

Among the QoS attributes that are agreed upon is the packet loss rate (PLR) guarantee, <b>committed</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>CIR)</b> and excess information rate (EIR). In this work we study the relation between PLR and throughput performance. This relationship can then be used to increase the throughput performance of the Ethernet Services transport protocol (ESTP).

40|$|Abstract—Differentiated service (DiffServ) {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to assure the achievable minimum bandwidth to aggregate flows. However, analyses in the literature show that the current DiffServ networks are biased {{in favor of an}} aggregate flow that has a smaller <b>committed</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>CIR)</b> when aggregate flows with different CIRs share a bottleneck link. In order to mitigate this unfairness problem, we propose an adaptive marking scheme which provides the relative bandwidth assurance in proportion to the CIRs of the aggregates. By introducing a virtual target rate (VTR) and adjusting it depending on the provision level of the network, each aggregate can obtain its fair share of the bandwidth, regardless of traffic load. This scheme is based on a feedback approach. It utilizes only two-bit feedback information conveyed in the packet header and can be implemented in a distributed manner. Furthermore, the proposed scheme does not require calculating fair shares of aggregates or any additional signaling protocol. Using steady state analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the scheme can provide aggregate flows with their fair shares of bandwidth, which is proportional to the CIRs, under various network conditions.

40|$|The Metro Ethernet network (MEN) {{expands the}} {{advantages}} of Ethernet to cover areas wider than LAN. MENs running Ethernet Services as specified by the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) are known as Carrier Ethernet Networks (CENs). CENs can cover not only metro areas, but it can expand to cover global areas by connecting multiple MENs. Next-generation CENs are expected to support 100 GbE. With arising technologies for Ultra Long-haul (ULH) networks the bandwidth bottleneck of CENs is shifting to other areas like the transport layer protocol (such as the Transport Control Protocol or TCP) and the chip-to-chip channel capacity found at the network edge, which in general has an electrical backplane. Traditional TCP is well known to have difficulties reaching the full available bandwidth, due to its inefficient AIMD mechanisms under a high-delay-bandwidth-product environment. At the network edge, network equipment with electrical backplanes poses many problems including inductive-capacitive effects that limit its bandwidth. These are the two main issues addressed in this work. To resolve the transport layer issue, this work proposes a transport protocol that fully utilizes the available bandwidth while preserving TCP-friendliness and providing QoS support that is compatible with Ethernet Services. It can guarantee throughputs above the <b>Committed</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>CIR),</b> which is specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). To resolve the physical layer limitations, a novel optical coupling technique is examined to {{encourage the use of}} optical backplanes for network-edge and core technology. The proposed technique consists of aligning the normal of the laser emission plane, waveguide plane and the normal of the photodetector active region plane with the purpose of reducing optical power loss caused by common methods of light manipulation. By addressing the shortcomings of both Traditional TCP and electrical backplane technology the overall throughput can be significantly increased. Ph. D.
