It {{was set up in}} 2014 up by alumni of Test Match Sofa, an earlier alternative commentary site. Broadcasts have emanated from a variety of sites in London, where the commentators describe the television coverage to listeners, while engaging in wide ranging discussion of the cricket and anything else taking their fancy. While primarily focussed on England's international cricket matches, several other matches, particularly World <b>Cup</b> <b>white</b> ball cricket, have also been covered. Perhaps the most unusual coverage was of the Under 19 world cup game between England and Namibia.|$|E

50|$|In his {{autobiography}} In Black and White - The Jake White Story, White mentions {{that he was}} approached {{at the start of}} the 2007 international season by lawyer Brian Biebuyck on behalf of the Watson family. Biebuyck, who was also White’s lawyer at the time, passed a nine-point proposal to White. These included the selection of Watson in the World Cup squad; in return, White’s contract with SA Rugby would be extended beyond the 2007 World Cup. Failure to select Luke Watson would result in him losing his job before the World <b>Cup.</b> <b>White</b> claims that the Watsons subsequently backed down. Luke's father, Cheeky Watson, has denied these claims.|$|E

50|$|White {{was one of}} 16 referees {{appointed}} to the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. He was also again selected as a referee at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. He refereed the semi-final of this competition between New Zealand and Australia. He was subsequently {{in charge of the}} 2005 Grand Slam decider between Wales and Ireland. During a 2007 Six Nations match between Italy and Wales, White ended the game after Wales, believing they had time to score a match winning try, kicked for touch from a penalty. White later apologised for the misunderstanding. White was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, his third World <b>Cup.</b> <b>White</b> retired from test match rugby in 2010, refereeing 50 test matches in total.|$|E
50|$|Their next {{encounter}} was {{a crucial}} clash with World Champions England. England, now on a three-game losing streak to the Boks, were on the ropes after a scrappy and poor showing against the USA. It took no longer than four minutes before Du Preez sent Juan Smith over for a try. The Boks dominated their opposition, displaying a tactically astute game plan. Du Preez was the mastermind and he orchestrated South Africa's next try as he regathered a loose ball and tore through England's defence; he sent JP Pietersen over for his first try of the evening {{and later in the}} second half broke away on the blindside to put JP Pietersen away for his second. This victory set the tone for South Africa's triumph. They employed a strong tactical kicking game backed-up by stout defence and the best line-out in the world. With a clinical counter-attacking game the Boks were able to vary their approach and ended the year the number one ranked team in the world.The Springboks' final pool match was against the USA in Montpellier. They ran in nine tries to two to win 64-15 and finish on top of Pool A. The only downside was a knee injury to prop BJ Botha, which would rule him out {{for the rest of the}} World <b>Cup.</b> <b>White</b> was pleased with his team's efforts:What we wanted to accomplish was to get some structure and continuity to our game. Some of the tries we scored were very pleasing. I don't think the US are as weak as the scoreline suggests. The most important thing was that we put things together on a game day. We haven't been executing them that well so far, but I was happy with the way we kept the ball alive.|$|E

50|$|The main {{drawback}} of histograms for classification is {{that the}} representation is dependent {{of the color of}} the object being studied, ignoring its shape and texture. Color histograms can potentially be identical for two images with different object content which happens to share color information. Conversely, without spatial or shape information, similar objects of different color may be indistinguishable based solely on color histogram comparisons. There is no way to distinguish a red and <b>white</b> <b>cup</b> from a red and white plate. Put another way, histogram-based algorithms have no concept of a generic 'cup', and a model of a red and <b>white</b> <b>cup</b> is no use when given an otherwise identical blue and <b>white</b> <b>cup.</b> Another problem is that color histograms have high sensitivity to noisy interference such as lighting intensity changes and quantization errors. High dimensionality (bins) color histograms are also another issue. Some color histogram feature spaces often occupy more than one hundred dimensions.|$|R
