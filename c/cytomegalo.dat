40|$|Persistent virus {{infections are}} {{characterized}} by {{the inability of the}} host's immune system to eradicate the infectious agent. This may result from a failure or dysfunction of the immune response or to a viral property which allows the infectious agent or infected cell to escape immunosurveillance. For example, Scrapie, Kuru, and Jacob-Creutzfeldt agents may not elicit a detectable immune response (1, 2), whereas other viruses such as mouse thymic agent, lactic dehydrogenase virus, or measles virus may alter the immune response owing to their replication in or destruction of lymphoid cells [thymus-derived (T) and bone marrowderived (B) lymphocytes and/or macrophages] which comprise the immune system (reviewed in references 3 and 4). Lack of or diminished response to viral antigens may perhaps also occur alter high antigen loads or by infection before maturation of the immune system (5, 6).

The mechanisms of virus-induced diabetes are hypothesized as follows: The host antigens and/or virus-induced altered host antigens may be released from the damaged beta cells by direct viral multiplication. The antigens are then processed by macrophages and presented to helper T (Th) cells in association with the class II major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) molecule. Th cells secrete interleukins that activate other Th cells, B lymphocytes and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells. The activated Tc cells recognize the host antigens coupled with the class I MHC molecule on the beta cell.

We tested the hypothesis that the depressive symptomatology is associated with a reactivation of latent viruses and inflammation of a coronary vessel. Methods: A blood sample was drawn and a biopsy sample was obtained from the coronary lesion of 15 exhausted and 15 nonexhausted patients treated with directional coronary angioplasty because of severe angina. Blood samples were analyzed to measure antibody titers against Chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, and the cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 b, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a. The biopsy sample was analyzed for the presence of IL- 1 b and TNF-a. Results: Exhausted/depressed patients had higher antibody titers against cytomegalovirus, higher levels of C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin G, and higher levels of IL- 1 b and TNF-a. No associations between the mental state of a patient and cytokine mRNA in the biopsy sample were found. Conclusions: The findings indicate that the mental state of angioplasty patients is positively associated with serological markers of inflammation. It remains to be seen whether the inflammation causes feelings of exhaustion, whether exhaustion and depression set the stage for inflammation, or whether existing feelings of exhaustion are amplified by the inflammation.

40|$|A basic {{principle}} of immunology is that prior immunity results in complete protection against a homologous agent. In this study, {{we show that}} memory T cells specific to unrelated viruses may alter the host 2 Ì† 7 s primary immune response to a second virus. Studies with a panel of heterologous viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), Pichinde (PV), vaccinia (VV), and murine <b>cytomegalo</b> (MCMV) viruses showed that prior immunity {{with one of these}} viruses in many cases enhanced clearance of a second unrelated virus early in infection. Such protective immunity was common, but it depended on the virus sequence and was not necessarily reciprocal. Cell transfer studies showed that both CD 4 and CD 8 T cell populations from LCMV-immune mice were required to transfer protective immunity to naive hosts challenged with PV or VV. In the case of LCMV-immune versus naive mice challenged with VV, there was an enhanced early recruitment of memory phenotype interferon (IFN) gamma-secreting CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells into the peritoneal cavity and increased IFN-gamma levels in this initial site of virus replication. Studies with IFN-gamma receptor knockout mice confirmed a role for IFN-gamma in mediating the protective effect by LCMV-immune T cell populations when mice were challenged with VV but not PV. In some virus sequences memory cell populations, although clearing the challenge virus more rapidly, elicited enhanced IFN-gamma-dependent immunopathogenesis in the form of acute fatty necrosis. These results indicate that how a host responds to an infectious agent is a function of its history of previous infections and their influence on the memory T cell pool...|$|E
40|$|Virazole (1 -Î²-d-ribofuranosyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -carboxamide) is {{a highly}} soluble new {{synthetic}} nucleoside having significant, reproducible activity against {{a broad spectrum of}} deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid viruses in vitro. The drug inhibited viral cytopathogenic effects in monolayers of cells infected for 3 days with type 3 adeno, types 1 and 2 herpes, myxoma, <b>cytomegalo,</b> vaccinia, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, types 1 A, 2, 8, 13, and 56 rhino, types 1 and 3 parainfluenza, vesicular stomatitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, Semliki Forest, Newcastle disease, and measles viruses. Hemagglutinin production by influenza A 2, influenza B, and type 1 parainfluenza viruses in chicken embryo cells was reduced by Virazole treatment. Recoverable intra- and extracellular virus titers were reduced by the drug in experiments with type 1 herpes, vaccinia, type 3 parainfluenza, and vesicular stomatitis viruses. Plaque formation by type 1 herpesvirus was also inhibited by exposure of the infected cells to Virazole. Pretreatment of cells with the compound, followed by its removal before addition of type 1 herpesvirus, severely lessened the antiviral activity; the compound was still moderately effective in reducing the viral effects on the cells when added as long as 22 hr after the virus. Parallel experiments, in which the antiviral activity of a number of known active drugs was compared, indicated Virazole to have at least a comparable degree of activity, and it was also active against a wider variety of viruses than any of these known active materials. The CCED 50 of Virazole to chicken embryo cells was approximately 1, 000 Î¼g/ml, although concentrations as low as 10 Î¼g/ml caused slight (15 %) inhibition in total cellular protein after 72 hr of incubation...|$|E
40|$|Various polyoxometalates proved {{inhibitory}} to the {{replication of}} a number of enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, i. e., herpesviruses (herpes simplex and <b>cytomegalo),</b> togaviruses (Sindbis), paramyxoviruses (respiratory syncytial), rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis), arenaviruses (Junin and Tacaribe), and retroviruses [human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and type 2 (HIV- 2), simian immunodeficiency virus, and murine sarcoma virus]. The most potent compounds, i. e., JM 1590 [K 13 [Ce(SiW 11 O 39) 2]. 26 H 2 O] and JM 2766 [K 6 [BGa(H 2 O) W 11 O 39]. 15 H 2 O], inhibited HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus at concentrations as low as 0. 008 - 0. 8 microM. The polyoxometalates also inhibited giant cell formation in co-cultures of HIV-infected HUT- 78 cells and uninfected MOLT- 4 cells. Studies designed to unravel the mechanism of action of these compounds revealed that they inhibit the reverse transcriptase activity associated with HIV. The polyoxometalates also proved inhibitory to the binding of HIV- 1 virions to the cells. From "time of addition" experiments, whereby the polyoxometalates were added at different times after virus infection, their mechanism of anti-HIV action could be attributed to inhibition of virus-cell binding. There was a good correlation (r = 0. 84) between the inhibitory effects of the compounds on HIV- 1 -induced cytopathicity and their inhibitory effects on syncytium formation and a close correlation (r = 0. 902) between their inhibitory effects on syncytium formation and their interaction with gp 120, whereas there was no correlation between their anti-HIV- 1 activity and their inhibitory effects on HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase. In flow cytometric studies, the compounds did not interfere with the binding of OKT 4 A/Leu- 3 a monoclonal antibody to the CD 4 receptor of uninfected cells, but they inhibited binding of anti-gp 120 monoclonal antibody to HIV- 1 -infected cells. Thus, the binding of the polyoxometalates to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120 is responsible for their anti-HIV activity. status: publishe...|$|E
