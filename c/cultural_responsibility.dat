50|$|These {{attitudes about}} a public <b>cultural</b> <b>responsibility</b> stand in marked {{contrast}} to {{much of the rest of}} the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.|$|E

Inquiries are a sociotechnology of accountability that signal a shift in how personal accountabilities of healthcare professionals are being configured.

In this article, I examine how the output of one particular inquiry – The Report of the Morecambe Bay Investigation – seeks to make culture visible and accountable. I question {{what it means to}} make culture accountable and show how the inquiry report enacts new and old forms of accountability: conventional forms that position actors as individuals, where actions or decisions have distinct boundaries that can be isolated from the ongoing flow of care, and transformative forms that bring into play a remote geographical location, the role of professional ideology, as well as a collective <b>cultural</b> <b>responsibility...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{building}} refurbishment asks for an integrated design approach balancing multiple requirements and multiple goals. It’s {{based on the}} assumption that the management of requirements on existing buildings, both prescriptive and performance-based, should encompass social, environmental and <b>cultural</b> <b>responsibility.</b> This would require the definition of an holistic design approach, aiming at the identification of strategies that are optimized at a large scale but adapted to local conditions and specificities. In this context, the EU concept of “geo-cluster” has been adopted being a virtual homogeneous trans-regional areas where strong similarities are found in terms of climate, environmental context, culture, construction typologies, etc.. A recent Italian research project focuses on the identification of common parameters and requirements for building refurbishment across regions, so to trigger large scale actions and overcome the “case by case” analysis. This paper shows the outputs of the preliminary research work for the implementation of a tool characterizing different “geo-cluster” areas in Italy.

40|$|Along Laura U. Marks’s {{thoughts}} on the “disappearing image” as embodied experience, the article proposes to bring into discussion particular modes of occurrence of “past images,” whether in form {{of the use of}} archival/found footage or of creating visual archaisms in the spirit of archival recordings, within the practice of the Hungarian experimental film making of the 1970 s and 1980 s, more speciflcally, in Gábor Bódy’s films. The return to archival/found footage as well as the production of visual archaisms reveal an attempt of remediation (Bolter and Grusin) that goes beyond the <b>cultural</b> <b>responsibility</b> of preservation: it confronts the film medium with its materiality, historicity, and temporality, and creates productive tensions between the private and the historical, between the pre-cinematic and the texture of motion pictures, between the documentary value of the image and its rhetorical dimension. The paper argues that the authenticity of the moving image in Gábor Bódy’s American Torso (Amerikai anzix, 1975) is achieved through a special combination of the immediacy and the hypermediacy of experience. Bódy’s interest in “past images” goes beyond the intention of experimentation with the medium; it is aimed at a profound, reconsidered archaeology of the image and a distinct sensing of the cinema...|$|E
