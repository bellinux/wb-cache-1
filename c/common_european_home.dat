5000|$|At the time, analysts such as Robert D. Hormats saw {{the nascent}} European Community as primely {{positioned}} {{to take on}} the role of a <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> due to its [...] "moral, political and social [...] - [...] as well as economic [...] - [...] strength." [...] Ronald D. Asmus noted that [...] "Gorbachev's vision of a <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> was predicated on the belief that reform in Eastern Europe could be controlled and that reformist communist parties would continue {{to play an important role}} in their countries' politics, including in the G.D.R." [...] Finally, Coit D. Blacker wrote that Soviet leadership [...] "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Eastern Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe." ...|$|E

40|$|Two sets of {{opposing}} paradigms governing {{the map of}} Europe are struggling to predominate {{at the beginning of}} this second decade of the post-communist era. At the macro (continental) level the struggle is between the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> versus the Europe of Two Empires – the enlarging European Union, and a Russia newly re-assertive towards its near abroad. At the micro (state or entity) level the struggle is between the Nationalising State versus the Europe of Fuzzy Statehood. This double competition of paradigms is most intense and sensitive in Borderland Europe around the frontiers between the two empires, or in their Overlapping Peripheries. It seems that the Europe of Two Empires has much more political energy these days than the Common European Home; and in Borderland Europe the Nationalising State has more energy than Fuzzy Statehood. However these trends should be of concern, since they point to the persistence of tensions and in the worst cases conflicts. A successful and stable Europe would need to see more of the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> and of Fuzzy Statehood. The EU has been instrumental in helping most of its candidate states largely overcome the problems of the post-communist transition through the incentives and demands of accession, and thus converge on the norms of the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home,</b> with elements of the Fuzzy Statehood package included. However in the Overlapping Peripheries of Borderland Europe there is no such mechanism, and many of these entities are stuck in a state of unresolved conflicts, demoralised poverty and confusion over their future. This is where a real strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, not just declarations, could be very useful. Such a partnership would, however, require much bigger political and economic investments than so far seen, as well as some rehabilitation of the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} study "M. S. Gorbachev's {{concept of}} Common European Home" highlights the pro-European oriented idea of Soviet Foreign Policy, which became {{popular in the}} middle 80 's. The concept was a peaceful vision and a new Soviet openness towards {{the policy of the}} United States and the West in an era of the Cold War. This period was characterized by mutual distrust of two ideologically different blocks and by the real threat of nuclear conflict. There were many politicians who engaged with the European Policy in the past. The expansion of European ideas has a considerable historical background. And the expression of the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> was already part of the external policy of Leonid I. Brezhnev. The Soviet concept, however, was first actively promoted by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is also attributed with its authorship. This bachelor study presents the origin, development and disappearance of this Soviet Policy. The work analyses the content of the idea in detail and also discusses its territorial legacy; including accompanying events and the attitude of Western countries. In addition to other key aspects, Gorbachev's <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home</b> is associated with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the disintegration of the Soviet Union...|$|E

40|$|The seven {{institutions}} of the EU, which {{the title of this}} articles announces, structure the institutional basis of the <b>Common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Home,</b> considered to be the emblem of the most dynamic and complex, the most institutionalized and discussed (even controversial) regional integration process. Building the Community Europe has began by the establishment of the Communities having 3 political institutions which represented {{in the evolution of the}} integration process, the triangle that ensured the coherence and the continuity of the Community actions: Council of Ministers, European Commission and the Assembly to which was added the Court and from 1974 the European Council as an indicative body. The five main institutions have formed the Community institutional system which over time had mainly guidance competences, of decision and direction (Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Council) or control skills (the European Parliament and the Court of Justice). Since 1975, the institutional structure was strengthened through the creation of a Court of Auditors with general competences of checking accounts and discharge in Community activities. Maastricht Treaty 1992 (1993) raises this body to the rank of Community institution, without substantially altering its powers. The 6 Community institutions were supplemented by validating the status of Community institution of the ECB by the Lisbon Treaty 2007 (2009). ECB together with the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro make up the Eurosystem. Through the Lisbon Treaty, the institutional structure was subjected to a process of improvement and strengthening of the EU which functions currently through the 7 institutions, interdependent, which are in a complementary relationship determined by the common goals which they pursue in Europe and in relations with other parts of the world...|$|E
