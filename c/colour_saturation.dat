Here we address segmentation by using end-stopped cells tuned to colour instead of to colour contrast. Colour information is coded in separate channels. By using multi-scale cortical endstopped cells tuned to colour, keypoint information in all channels is coded and mapped by multi-scale peaks. Unsupervised segmentation is achieved by analysing the branches of these peaks, which yields the best-fitting image regions. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS...|$|R
500|$|Garland and VFX {{supervisor}} Jon Thum began {{developing the}} Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect {{to replicate the}} visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long {{it could be used}} before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, <b>colour</b> <b>saturation,</b> image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, [...] "You see a whale or a shark breach the water...then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by...how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [...] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time." [...] He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: [...] "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." [...] Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design.|$|E

40|$|We {{will discuss}} colloid {{suspensions}} of pigments and compare their electro-optic properties {{with those of}} traditional dyed low molecular weight liquid crystal systems. There are several potential advantages of colloidal suspensions over low molecular weight liquid crystal systems: a very high contrast {{because of the high}} orientational order parameter of suspensions of rod shaped nano-particles, the excellent light fastness of pigments as compared to dyes and high <b>colour</b> <b>saturations</b> resulting from the high loading of the colour stuff. Although a weak `single-particle' electro-optic response can be observed in dilute suspensions, the response is very much enhanced when the concentration of the particles is sufficient to lead to a nematic phase. Excellent stability of suspensions is beneficial for experimental observation and reproducibility, but it is a fundamental necessity for display applications. We therefore discuss a method to achieve long term stability of dispersed pigments and the reasons for its success. Small angle X-ray scattering was used to determine the orientational order parameter of the suspensions as a function of concentration and the dynamic response to an applied electric field. Optical properties were investigated {{for a wide range of}} pigment concentrations. Electro-optical phenomena, such as field-induced birefringence and switching, were characterised. In addition, mixtures of pigment suspensions with small amounts of ferro uids show promise as future magneto-optical materials...|$|R

50|$|The {{extent of}} dichromatism of {{material}} {{can be quantified}} by the Kreft's dichromaticity index (DI). It {{is defined as the}} difference in hue angle (Δhab) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the chroma (<b>colour</b> <b>saturation)</b> is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DIL) anddichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DID) respectively. Kreft's dichromaticity index DIL and DID for pumpkin oil, {{which is one of the}} most dichromatic substances, are −9 and −44, respectively. This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 degrees in Lab colour space) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5 mm to 2 mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold.|$|E

METHODS: In this study, there was the inclusion of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, current non-smokers, of both sexes.
