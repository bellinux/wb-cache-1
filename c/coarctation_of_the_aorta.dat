25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, <b>coarctation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aorta,</b> {{and some}} other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population.

METHODSThe Mayo Clinic database was reviewed for {{women of childbearing age}} (≥ 16 years old) with a diagnosis <b>of</b> aortic <b>coarctation</b> evaluated from 1980 to 2000. Spectrum of cardiovascular disease, surgical history, and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were determined. RESULTSFifty women with coarctation had pregnancies: 30 had coarctation repair before pregnancy, 10 had repair after pregnancy, 4 had repair both before and after pregnancy, and 6 had no history <b>of</b> repair. <b>The</b> 50 women had 118 pregnancies resulting in 106 births. There were 11 miscarriages (9 %), 4 premature deliveries (3 %), and 1 early neonatal death; 38 deliveries (36 %) were by cesarean section. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 109 offspring, 4 (4 %) had congenital heart disease. A patient with Turner syndrome died of a Stanford type A dissection at 36 weeks of pregnancy. Nineteen women (38 %) were known to have hemodynamically significant coarctation during pregnancy (gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg). Fifteen women (30 %) had hypertension during their pregnancy, 11 of whom (73 %) had hemodynamically significant coarctation during that time (8 with native and 3 with residual/recurrent coarctation).

40|$|Aortobronchial fistula {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{characterized by}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a communication between <b>the</b> <b>aorta</b> and a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bronchial tree that results from processes that arise within <b>the</b> <b>aorta,</b> in <b>the</b> tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mediastinum, or in the adjacent thoracic organs.

At autopsy, <b>coarctation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> was found with a saccular aneurysm distal to this which was joined to the left main bronchus by a mass <b>of</b> necrotic tissue. <b>The</b> bronchus contained a cast of blood; blood was also present within the trachea and within <b>the</b> distal airways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left lung.

40|$|Introduction : Balloon {{angioplasty}} (BAP) and aortic or pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty (BAV, BPV) are well-established {{treatment options}} in congenital heart defects. Recently, significant technological {{progress has been}} made and new catheters have been implemented in clinical practice. Aim: To analyze <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> BAP, BAV and BPV with the new balloon catheter Valver and its second generation Valver II, which the company Balton (Poland) launched and developed. These catheters have not been clinically evaluated yet. Material and methods: We performed 64 interventions with Valver I and Valver II. With Valver I the following procedures were performed: 17 BPV (including 9 in tetralogy of Fallot – TOF), 10 BAV and 27 BAP in <b>coarctations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aorta</b> (CoA) – including 9 native and 18 after surgery. With Valver II ten interventions were done – 3 BPV, 2 pulmonary supravalvular BAP (after switch operations), 2 BAP of recoarctations and 3 other BAP. Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients ranged from a few days to 40 years. Results: All procedures were completed successfully, without rupture of any balloon catheters. The pressure gradient drop was statistically significant in all groups: BPV in isolated pulmonary valvular stenosis 28. 1 mm Hg (mean), BPV in TOF 18. 7 mm Hg, BAV 32. 8 mm Hg, BAP in native CoA 15. 4 mm Hg and in recoarctations 18. 6 mm Hg. In 3 cases during rapid deflation of Valver I, wrinkles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balloons made it impossible to insert the whole balloon into the vascular sheath (all were removed surgically from the groin). No such complication occured with Valver II. Conclusions : Valver balloon catheters are an effective treatment modality in different valvular and vascular stenoses...|$|R
