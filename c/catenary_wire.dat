25|$|There {{are some}} {{additional}} maintenance {{costs associated with}} the electrical equipment around the track, such as power sub-stations and the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.|$|E
25|$|For {{six months}} in 2015, a {{temporary}} Devon Transfer station served as the transfer point between mainline service and Waterbury Branch trains. The first phase of repairs to the adjacent Housatonic River Railroad Bridge over the Housatonic River prevented Waterbury Branch trains from accessing the normal transfer point at Bridgeport, necessitating the temporary transfer station. The Devon Transfer station was re-activated in 2016 from April until October to accommodate additional repairs and <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> work.|$|E
500|$|The station's {{importance}} remained {{through the}} first half of the 20th century. After the Boston & Albany was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900, third and fourth tracks were extended in 1907 to South Framingham from Lake Crossing station in Wellesley. In 1911, the NYC considered laying third rail on the main line as far as South Framingham, as well as on the Highland Branch, to allow more frequent electric service on the lines. This would have been the only electrified commuter service directly into Boston, as neither the later-electrified Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad nor experimental electric service on the South Shore Railroad went directly to downtown. However, the plan was abandoned because the infrastructure cost would have exceeded the annual savings on fuel. (In 1959, the Highland Branch received <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> and was turned into the Green Line [...] "D" [...] Branch).|$|E
50|$|As of 2014, {{the band}} is on {{indefinite}} hiatus, and Fletcher and Pursey now perform as The <b>Catenary</b> <b>Wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{tracks are}} {{electrified}} with overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> {{as is the}} entire Northeast Corridor from Washington Union Station to Boston South Station.|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for electrified operation, the tunnel {{was lined with}} gunite to waterproof the arch and prevent icicles from shorting out the <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, Amtrak began {{installing}} electrification gear {{along the}} [...] of track between New Haven and Boston. The infrastructure included a new overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> made of high-strength silver-bearing copper, specified by Amtrak and later patented by Phelps Dodge Specialty Copper Products of Elizabeth, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Amtrak {{replaced}} the signal and communications system and rebuilt the overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> and upgraded electrical substations {{to provide the}} power needed to operate several electric trains simultaneously on this line. [...] Since October, 2006, Amtrak, having sufficient Acela high-speed trainsets, started using electric push-pull trainsets {{for the first time}} since the mid-1990s. Using AEM7 locomotives and former Metroliner m.u. coaches modified into a push-pull cab-coach (with the locomotive [...] "pulling" [...] westbound trains and [...] "pushing" [...] eastbound), the electrified service is currently used on the Harrisburg-New York Keystone service, while the Genesis diesel locomotives are still used for the Pittsburgh-New York Pennsylvanian service. As on the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak trains between Paoli and Overbrook use the high-speed inner rails for normal operations.|$|E
50|$|Commuter {{trains are}} either powered by {{diesel-electric}} or electric locomotives, or else use self-propelled cars (some systems use both). A few systems, particularly around New York City, use electric power, supplied {{by a third}} rail and/or overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire,</b> which provides quicker acceleration, lower noise, and fewer air-quality issues. Philadelphia's SEPTA Regional Rail uses exclusively electric power, supplied by overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Low floor (S70) trains {{operate on}} the Blue Line {{for the first time}} in January, after new station platforms, {{advanced}} electronic signage, overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> larger shelters and track replacements are implemented.|$|R

50|$|<b>Catenary</b> <b>wires</b> {{are kept}} at a {{mechanical}} tension because the pantograph causes mechanical oscillations in the wire and the wave must travel {{faster than the}} train to avoid producing standing waves that would cause wire breakage. Tensioning the line makes waves travel faster.|$|R

50|$|Tracks 6-16 lead to {{the tunnel}} to the north, and lanes 4, 5 and tracks 16 to 23 are in a {{cul-de-sac}} to the north (track 16 is provided with a switch {{just north of the}} stairs). Tracks 13 to 15 are never used in the northbound direction {{because of the lack of}} <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mariazeller railway in Lower Austria {{operates}} on single phase AC at a 25 Hz utility frequency. The railway {{has its own}} traction current lines with an operating voltage of 27 kV. These lines are mounted on the pylons of the overhead wire over the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Morristown Line east of Dover Station is electrified, using 25 kV, 60 Hz AC {{overhead}} <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> The {{line was}} electrified in 1930 at 3kV DC, but was re-electrified in 1984 at the contemporary standard of 25 kV, 60 Hz. The connecting Gladstone Branch and Montclair-Boonton Line were also re-electrified at this time.|$|E
50|$|MetroLink {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 87 light-rail vehicles composed of 31 SD-400 and 56 SD-460 vehicles. Each 90 ft, single articulated vehicle has 4 high platform doors per side and has a capacity of 72 seated and 106 standing passengers. The cars are powered by an electric motor which gets its electricity from a <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> with a 750 volt supply.|$|E
50|$|Line 51 to Amstelveen runs metro service between Central Station and Station Zuid. At Station Zuid it {{switches}} {{from third}} rail to pantograph and <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b> From there to Amstelveen Centrum it shares its track with tram line 5. The light rail vehicles on this line {{are capable of}} using both 600 volt DC and 750 volt DC.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{were used}} in the early years to pull trains through the tunnel, however concerns about the potential dangers of suffocation should a train stall in the tunnel led to the installation of <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> for electric-powered locomotives by 1907. The first use of electric locomotives through the tunnel in regular service occurred on May 17, 1908.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station is}} {{technically}} {{located on the}} Northeast Corridor. It has two side platforms and five tracks. Only the side tracks serving the PATH platforms have third rail power; the three center tracks, with overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> are used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line, which do not stop at Harrison.|$|R
50|$|Power is transmitted, effectively, at 36 kV {{because the}} 24 kV and 12 kV {{components}} are 180° out of phase. This design has several advantages over the PRR's more traditional {{transmission and distribution}} scheme. The highest voltage, with respect to ground, within the system is 24 kV. This is significantly less than the 69 kV seen in the PRR's system, which required much larger 80 ft towers and larger insulators and transformers. On a small system such as the Reading's, transmission infrastructure of this scale was unnecessary. Secondly, the system uses the 12 kV <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> for both transmission and distribution. This dual use of the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> allows performing both functions with only two wires. The PRR's system in contrast required three wires: two for the single phase 138 kV transmission component {{and one for the}} 12 kV catenary feeder. In both systems, the rail is used as a return path for traction current.|$|E
50|$|The twin {{overhead}} power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface, which are supported by a steel <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers' or 'skates' against the conductors to complete the circuit. These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite, or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good (low resistance) electrical connection.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pantograph}} (or [...] "pan") is {{an apparatus}} {{mounted on the}} roof of an electric train, tram or electric bus to collect power through contact with an overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> It is a common type of current collector. Typically, a single wire is used, with the return current running through the track. The term stems from the resemblance of some styles to the mechanical pantographs used for copying handwriting and drawings.|$|E
