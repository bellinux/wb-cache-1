40|$|The {{interaction}} between a dielectric resonator and a microstrip transmission line is fundamentally a field phenomenon. However, {{the model of}} Figure 1 b widely is used to represent the arrangement in Figure 1 a, and predicts the behavior encountered in practice. The microstrip line of length l = n(lambda) / 4 between the input and coupling planes and the lambda/ 4 open-circuit stub usually {{is assumed to be}} lossless. This paper considers the effect of <b>coupling</b> <b>line</b> loss on the unloaded-Q and coupling coefficient beta of the combination. It shows that transmission line loss can cause the decrease in unloaded-Q that has been observed to occur with tight coupling, and limits the coupling coefficient to a much lower value than would be obtained with a lossless <b>coupling</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

40|$|Orius laevigatus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) {{is a key}} {{predator}} of thrips and is mass {{reared in}} large numbers for use in biological control. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of founder population size on the biological and behavioral performance of O. laevigatus over time. Laboratory lines were started from 1, 10 and 50 founder couples from 750 adults collected in the field and their performance was evaluated at the 5 th– 6 th and 10 th– 11 th generations. Adaptation to the captive rearing situation occurred in the 10 and 50 founder <b>couples</b> <b>lines</b> while it failed in the 1 founder <b>couple</b> <b>line.</b> The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) increased and the period for doubling the population (D) decreased over the generations in the 10 and 50 founder <b>couples</b> <b>lines,</b> while (rm) decreased and (D) increase in the 1 founder <b>couple</b> <b>line.</b> Also, consumption of Frankliniella occidentalis prey was significantly lower for females from the 1 founder <b>couple</b> <b>line</b> at the 5 th generation compared to females from the 10 and 50 founder <b>couples</b> <b>lines.</b> Females of laboratory lines of all founder couples did not respond to odours from thrips infested plants during the 5 th and 10 th generations, whereas wild females strongly reacted to these odours. We suggest that the lack of reaction to infested plant volatiles may be due to the artificial rearing method where mass reared predators do not experience an infested crop. The results showed that the 1 founder <b>couple</b> <b>line</b> differed from the 10 and 50 founder <b>couples</b> <b>lines,</b> suggesting that bottlenecking had an effect at that level. However, no difference was found between the 10 and 50 founder <b>couples</b> <b>lines</b> which suggest that these founder numbers can be used to start laboratory-reared O. laevigatus lines without a significant loss in quality of its relevant biological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new topology of <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> bandpass filter for wideband applications. The concept deals with an even number of identical quarter-wavelength <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> that are interconnected to form two parallel paths of series-connected <b>coupled</b> <b>lines.</b> Such way, a bandpass response of order | + 1 is resulted, where n is the number of identical <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> used. The existence transmission zero at both sides of the passband constitutes the main advantage of this filter topology, where very good selectivity can be ensured, while wide bandwidth can be achieved. The global synthesis of the proposed topology is presented for the case of second order response. The design synthesis was developed to control the electrical characteristics of the resonator such as bandwidth and also to fix the position of the transmission zeros frequencies. Besides, the fractional bandwidth on the in-band matching level can be controlled by varying the value of characteristic impedances of the <b>coupled</b> <b>lines.</b> For implementation of the second-order filter, the uses of symmetrical and asymmetrical <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> are studied in order to obtain better performance. In practice, asymmetrical <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> are more flexible in obtaining higher wave coupling, for better in-band matching level. A further combination of identical quarter-wavelength <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> in the initial second order topology is proposed for higher order design.

Guided by the pattern of underlying symmetries, chiral and conformal, we analyze the two-point functions theoretically and on the lattice, and determine the finite size scaling and the infinite volume fermion mass dependence of the would-be hadron masses.

40|$|We {{consider}} an efficient scheme to simulate fermionic Hubbard models with nonlocal density-density interactions in two dimensions, based on bond-centered auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo. The simulations are {{shown to be}} sign-problem free within a finite, restricted parameter range. Using this approach, we first study the Hubbard model on the half-filled square lattice bilayer, including an interlayer repulsion term {{in addition to the}} local repulsion, and present the ground state phase diagram within the accessible parameter region. Starting from the antiferromagnetically ordered state in the absence of interlayer repulsion, the interlayer interactions are found to destabilize the antiferromagnetic order, leading to a band insulator state. Moreover, for sufficiently strong interlayer tunneling, we also observe the emergence of a direct dimer product state of mixed D-Mott and S-Mott character along the equal <b>coupling</b> <b>line.</b> We discuss the stability range of this state within strong-coupling perturbation theory. Furthermore, we consider the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Such an interaction is found to enhance both charge density and spin-current correlations within the semimetallic region. However, inside the accessible parameter region, they do not stabilize long-ranged charge density wave order nor a quantum spin Hall state, and the only insulating state that we observe exhibits long-range antiferromagnetism.

In the first topic, quarter-wavelength <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> ring resonator integration will be developed, which will result in a single mode resonator with two transmission zeros {{on both sides of the}} passband. The new filter will be presented by its equivalent circuits in order to derive the mathematical modeling and extract the controlling parameters which determine the position of the transmission zeros. Several filters are designed using the new synthesis to show its advantages and new applications. The synthesis of the new topology could be generalized to design higher order filters, which facilitates the design of such filter. Moreover, the filter will be cascaded to offer higher orders and more selective filters. 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th order filters will be designed and simulated to show the feasibility of the new topology. In the second part, the concept of the ring resonator and <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> will be further explored, where the quarter-wavelength <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> will be cascaded with the ring resonator. Such a topology will offer high selective and wideband filter compared to conventional <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> filter.

40|$|International audienceThe vibroacoustic {{behavior}} of axisymmetric stiffened shells immersed in {{water has been}} intensively studied in the past. On the contrary, {{little attention has been}} paid to the modeling of these shells coupled to non-axisymmetric internal frames. Indeed, breaking the axisymmetry couples the circumferential orders of the Fourier series and considerably increases the computational costs. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a sub-structuring approach called the Condensed Transfer Function (CTF) method that will allow assembling a model of axisymmetric stiffened shell with models of non-axisymmetric internal frames. The CTF method is developed in the general case of mechanical subsystems coupled along curves. A set of orthonormal functions called condensation functions, which depend on the curvilinear abscissa along the <b>coupling</b> <b>line,</b> is considered. This set is then used as a basis for approximating and decomposing the displacements and the applied forces at the line junctions. Thanks to the definition and calculation of condensed transfer functions for each uncoupled subsystem and by using the superposition principle for passive linear systems, the {{behavior of}} the coupled subsystems can be deduced. A plane plate is considered as a test case to study the convergence of the method with respect to the type and the number of condensation functions taken into account. The CTF method is then applied to couple a submerged non-periodically stiffened shell described using the Circumferential Admittance Approach (CAA) with internal substructures described by Finite Element Method (FEM). The influence of non-axisymmetric internal substructures can finally be studied and it is shown that it tends to increase the radiation efficiency of the shell and can modify the vibrational and acoustic energy distribution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{methods are}} {{nowadays}} widely {{used to predict}} the vibroacoustic behavior of mechanical systems. Nevertheless, when the system is complex as for instance in the aerospace or naval industry, it is practically impossible to solve for the problem at once, more particularly at medium or high frequencies. That is why substructuring approaches {{have been developed to}} tackle complex systems and save computation costs. Some of these methods consist in dividing the system in several subsystems that can be studied separately and to deduce the response of the whole system by calculating the coupling forces at the interfaces between the subsystems. It is based on admittance, impedance or mobility frequency transfer functions at the coupling interfaces. Such methods have already been used intensively to couple subsystems linked by point contacts. In the case of subsystems coupled along lines, a Condensed Transfer Function (CTF) method is developed in the present paper. The admittances on the <b>coupling</b> <b>line</b> are condensed {{in order to reduce the}} number of coupling forces evaluated. Three variants of the method are presented, where the transfer functions are condensed using 3 different ways: (1) averaged on segments, (2) projected on exponential functions along the line and (3) projected on Chebyshev polynomials. After describing the principle of the CTF method, the case of a plate will be given as a test case for validation. In comparison with a classical Craig-Bampton method, which is used to reduce the size of finite element models, the CTF method has the advantage to be useable with several subsystems which vibrational behavior has not necessarily been described by the finite element method (FEM). For instance, it may be used to couple a submerged non-periodically stiffened shell described using the circumferential admittance approach (CAA) maxit 2010 prediction, with internal substructures described by FEM that offers greater flexibility on their design.

40|$|My PhD thesis {{consists}} of two neuroimaging studies {{in the field of}} cognitive neuroscience of music and sound as following described. (1) In the first research, entitled “Moving soundscape: an fMRI study on auditory self- and object-motion perception”, I investigated the auditory perception related to the discrimination between self- and object-motion, using an fMRI technique. Among scientific literature, no previous imaging studies researched about these two different types of motion perception in the auditory domain. I explored brain activation induced by complex auditory scenes including 64 ecological and binaurally spatialized sound sources moving either coherently or randomly, thus mimicking ecological stimulation during self and object motion respectively. The moving soundscape stimulus was designed in a similar way as the optical “flowfields” which are routinely used to map visual regions specialized for self motion such as V 6 + (Pitzalis et al., 2010) and consisting of white dots moving across different trajectories and directions, either coherently or randomly. HYPOTHESES: I investigated if this novel kind of auditory stimulation is able to elicit activation in the visual motion region V 6 + and whether it is able to engage supposed functional analogues areas in the auditory network. A further hypothesis concerns the cross-modal sensitivity of para- hippocampal place area (PPA), a specialized visual area for scene recognition (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998; Sulpizio et al., 2013). METHOD: 16 participants underwent six distinct 3 T Allegra-fMR acquisition scans: 4 of moving soundscape and 2 of flowfield localizer. For the main experiment, the initial analysis aimed at selecting a set of brain regions more implicated in at least one experimental condition (coherent, random, static) as compared to the baseline (silence condition). The resulting estimates entered a repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) comparing activations between the three conditions. The same analysis was also applied to the V 6 +, as individually defined {{on the basis of the}} flowfield localizer by comparing the flowfields and the random motion conditions. The PPA region was probabilistically defined in Sulpizio and colleagues (Sulpizio et al. 2013) by contrasting passive viewing localizer blocks of scenes vs. faces pictures in a group of 34 subjects separate from the participants of the current study; this region also entered a RM-ANOVA. RESULTS: The main experiment allowed me to observe the involvement of several areas inside and – surprisingly – outside auditory cortex such as: planum temporale (PT:Griffith et al., 2002) in the auditory pathway; hMT/V 5 + (Braddick et al., 2001), lateral occipital region (LOR: Tootell et al., 2001), V 3 A and V 3 B (Larsson et al., 2006), in the dorsal visual motion pathway. Moreover I observed activations in regions involved in visual object recognition such as lateral occipital cortex (LOC: Kanwisher et al., 2001) and fusiform gyrus (FUS: Weiner and Zilles, 2015). The auditory motion coding could seem to have its core area in the right PT able to distinguish between moving and static stimuli, but unable to discriminate between coherent and random motion. V 6 + and the other dorsal visual motion areas surprisingly appeared more responsive to static sound rather than to moving sound stimuli. PPA, LOC and FUS showed the same trend. I supposed that the ecological fitness of moving soundscape has triggered a healthy synesthetic process: visual mental imagery induced by auditory stimuli. Referring to the synesthesia models (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001; Esterman et al. 2006; Hubbard et al. 2007; Hubbard et al. 2011), I supposed an inhibition process to motion induced by strongly overlapping frequencies (also caused by psycho-acoustic indexes) that could explain the greater responsiveness to static rather than to moving stimuli of the dorsal visual pathway areas. Data about PPA, LOC and FUS revealed the cross-modal sensitivity of these regions for object and scene recognition. (2) The second study was entitled “Different brain processes between musicians and non-musicians during preparation, perception and action in visual and auditory decision-making”. I investigated brain and behavioral plasticity induced by musical training and transferred to decision-making processes, using an ERP technique. From a theoretical perspective, I referenced to an adaptation of Moreno’s transfer-effect model (2013). Musical training and skills transfer-effects have been conceptualized as a multidimensional continuum defined by two orthogonal dimensions: 1) the level of affected processing (low-level: sensory; high-level: cognitive) and 2) the transfer domain’s distance (near = auditory; far = visual). Among perceptual decision-making tasks, the Go/No-go task has been chosen to compare musicians and non- musicians, because it requires inhibitory control, an executive function that could represent the link to transfer-effects induced by musical training; moreover I administered the Go/No-go task in two different modalities (visual and auditory) in order to verify the near and far skill’s transfer. HYPOTHESES: I hypothesized that musicians could show differences from non-musicians in premotor, early and late ERPs components and in behavioral performances, proportionally to the transfer-effect distance and to the level of affected processes. Therefore I expected that musicians could show smaller premotor components (reflecting less effort) and higher amplitude both in sensory and cognitive components, above all in the auditory task, with a mirrored behavioral performance. METHOD: 31 participants underwent two separate auditory and visual Go/No-go tasks each made by 10 runs during a 64 -channel EEG recording. The visual stimuli consisted of four squared configurations made by vertical and horizontal bars; the two Go and No-go stimuli were created by <b>coupling</b> <b>line</b> orientations with configuration complexity. The auditory stimuli consisted in four complex tones created by coupling two notes (F-sharp and C) with two ranges of harmonic octaves. Behavioral data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between groups, modalities and conditions about response time (RT), intra-individual coefficient of variation (ICV), false alarms (FA), anticipations and omissions. ERP data analysis entered RM-ANOVAs aiming to detect differences between group, conditions, modalities and electrode sites in an wide window of components: BP, pN, P 1, N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3. RESULTS: I found several differences between musicians and non- musicians. Musicians showed less effort in motor preparation (smaller BP component), faster and more accurate performances in the auditory- domain (decreased false alarm rate, increased N 1 amplitude, increased P 3 amplitude). However, musicians were less accurate than non- musicians in the visual task (increased false alarm rate and decreased P 3 amplitude). Interpreted by means of the Moreno’s pyramidal model (2013), these results appeared only partly in line with this conceptualization, showing that the brain plasticity induced by musical training could transfer to a far domain (such as visual domain), not only in terms of advantages, but also as disadvantages.

Musicians showed less effort in motor preparation (smaller BP component), faster and more accurate performances in the auditory- domain (decreased false alarm rate, increased N 1 amplitude, increased P 3 amplitude). However, musicians were less accurate than non- musicians in the visual task (increased false alarm rate and decreased P 3 amplitude). Interpreted by means of the Moreno’s pyramidal model (2013), these results appeared only partly in line with this conceptualization, showing that the brain plasticity induced by musical training could transfer to a far domain (such as visual domain), not only in terms of advantages, but also as disadvantages...|$|E

After {{a description of}} the simple technological process, the single and <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> characteristics are examined versus several geometrical parameters. Electromagnetic simulations and measurements are compared and a good agreement is obtained between them. The line attenuation is shown to be very low. Another advantage of this technology is the increase of the <b>coupled</b> <b>lines</b> spacing for some given odd and even characteristic impedances in comparison with classical technology, which helps the design of <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> filters. Using the presented <b>line</b> characteristics, a <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> bandpass filter has been designed, fabricated, and characterized in the Ka-band. According to simulations, measurement results show the good performances of the filter: the bandpass is of 28 %, the measured insertion loss and return loss are, respectively, - 2. 2 and - 24 dB at the center frequency.

Implementing a true open circuit in planar technology is not feasible because of the dielectric effect of the substrate which will always ensure that the equivalent circuit contains a shunt capacitance.

40|$|ABSTRACT — In this paper, {{microstrip}} <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> band pass filters using Koch fractal curves {{are proposed}} for the first time. These filters are fabricated on Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate for Ku Band. Conventional microstrip <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> filters are very popular for RF front ends because these can be made easily. However, their large 2 nd harmonic causes {{the shape of the}} pass band to be asymmetric in the upper band and it makes the skirt properties worse. By proper design, the 2 nd harmonic of fractal filters can be significantly suppressed through the use of fractal shapes. In LCP, the maximum harmonic suppression is almost 42 dB.

5000|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission <b>lines</b> physically <b>coupled</b> together with two or more branch lines between them. The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. The main and <b>coupled</b> <b>line</b> are [...] of the system impedance. The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than 10 dB; low coupling also requires narrow tracks. <b>Coupled</b> <b>lines</b> are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for 3 dB hybrids. Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as <b>coupled</b> <b>lines.</b> This style of coupler is good for implementing in high-power, air dielectric, solid bar formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support.|$|R
