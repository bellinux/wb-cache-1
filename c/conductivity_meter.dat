30|$|Bulk density, porosity and field {{capacity}} were {{measured by the}} cutting ring method. Organic matters were  determined by the external heating oxidation; nitrogen by the alkaline solution diffusion method; available phosphorus by the NaHCO 3 extraction colorimetric method and potassium by flame photometer. Soil pH value and electrical conductivity were measured by using pH and <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters,</b> respectively (Bao 2000).|$|R
50|$|An {{electrical}} <b>conductivity</b> <b>meter</b> (EC meter) {{measures the}} electrical conductivity in a solution. It {{is commonly used}} in hydroponics, aquaculture and freshwater systems to monitor the amount of nutrients, salts or impurities in the water.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} {{of water}} {{is directly related to}} the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water. Ions from the dissolved solids in water create the ability for that water to conduct an electric current, which can be measured using a conventional <b>conductivity</b> <b>meter</b> or TDS meter. When correlated with laboratory TDS measurements, conductivity provides an approximate value for the TDS concentration, usually to within ten-percent accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity {{of a solution}} of an electrolyte is measured by determining {{the resistance of the}} solution between two flat or cylindrical electrodes separated by a fixed distance. An alternating voltage is used in order to avoid electrolysis. The resistance is measured by a <b>conductivity</b> <b>meter.</b> Typical frequencies used are in the range 1-3 kHz. The dependence on the frequency is usually small, but may become appreciable at very high frequencies, an effect known as the Debye-Falkenhagen effect.|$|E
50|$|Metal {{detectors}} use {{electromagnetic induction}} to detect metal. Although {{other types of}} instruments (notably magnetometers and electromagnetic <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters)</b> have some sensitivity to metal, specialized metal detectors are much more effective. Metal detectors are available in different configurations, varying in sophistication and sensitivity. Most have some capacity to discriminate between different types of metallic targets.|$|R

ConclusionsThe Hanna HI 98188 and the YSI Pro 30 {{are the two}} most expensive meters and they were the most stable. They were within 5 % of the actual conductivity. The Blue Pen was consistently closer to the actual conductivity than the other two Hanna meters and at only $ 20 it is a cost effective meter...|$|R
30|$|A fractometer is {{a device}} that breaks the radial {{increment}} core along {{the direction of the}} fiber to measure the fracture strength [17]. Many diagnostic devices such as resistographs, stress wave or ultrasonic detectors, electrical <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters</b> and fractometers are available for detecting internal decay and other defects in living trees [18]. These NDT can be used in combination to achieve better accuracy in determining the location and extent of wood deterioration.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Hanna Instruments {{developed}} the first single-probe portable <b>conductivity</b> <b>meter.</b> In 1984, Hanna Instruments {{developed the}} first microprocessor-based handheld pH meter. In 1985, Hanna Instruments {{became the first}} company to introduce a pH electrode with a built-in temperature sensor In 1988, Hanna Instruments became the first company to introduce the pre-amplified pH electrode. In 1992, Hanna Instruments became the first company to offer a portable pH meter with plain-paper printing.In 1997, Hanna Instruments became the first company to offer a pH tester with double junction electrode.In 2000, Hanna Instruments became the first company to offer a multi-parameter (pH/conductivity/temperature) pocket tester.|$|E
50|$|In static {{solution}} culture, {{plants are}} grown in containers of nutrient solution, such as glass Mason jars (typically, in-home applications), plastic buckets, tubs, or tanks. The solution is usually gently aerated {{but may be}} un-aerated. If un-aerated, the solution level is kept low enough that enough roots are above the solution so they get adequate oxygen. A hole is cut in {{the lid of the}} reservoir for each plant. There can be one to many plants per reservoir. Reservoir size can be increased as plant size increases. A home made system can be constructed from plastic food containers or glass canning jars with aeration provided by an aquarium pump, aquarium airline tubing and aquarium valves. Clear containers are covered with aluminium foil, butcher paper, black plastic, or other material to exclude light, thus helping to eliminate the formation of algae. The nutrient solution is changed either on a schedule, such as once per week, or when the concentration drops below a certain level as determined with an electrical <b>conductivity</b> <b>meter.</b> Whenever the solution is depleted below a certain level, either water or fresh nutrient solution is added. A Mariotte's bottle, or a float valve, can be used to automatically maintain the solution level. In raft solution culture, plants are placed in a sheet of buoyant plastic that is floated {{on the surface of the}} nutrient solution. That way, the solution level never drops below the roots.|$|E

50|$|Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} archaeology are magnetometers, electrical resistance meters, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters.</b> These methods can resolve {{many types of}} archaeological features, are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas, and of operating under {{a wide range of}} conditions. While common metal detectors are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications.|$|R
30|$|Media {{used in the}} {{experiment}} were peat-perlite in a 4 : 1 ratio with 2.5  g L− 1 dolomitic lime and peat-ADDF-perlite in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio with 4  g L− 1 gypsum. Physical properties of the mixes including bulk density, container capacity, and water-holding capacity were evaluated before planting using the techniques described by Elliott (1992). Saturated media extracts (Warnke 2011) were taken to estimate media pH and electrical conductivity using Cardy Twin pH and <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters</b> (Horiba Corp., Kyoto, Japan).|$|R
50|$|The common {{laboratory}} <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters</b> {{employ a}} potentiometric method and four electrodes. Often, the electrodes are cylindrical and arranged concentrically. The electrodes are usually made of platinum metal. An alternating current {{is applied to}} the outer pair of the electrodes. The potential between the inner pair is measured. Conductivity could in principle be determined using the distance between the electrodes and their surface area using Ohm's law but generally, for accuracy, a calibration is employed using electrolytes of well-known conductivity.|$|R
30|$|The CMC of {{synthesized}} surfactant {{was measured}} by conductivity method.

40|$|In this article, we {{will talk}} about two of the most popular {{applications}} in the water analysis field: pH <b>meters</b> and <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters.</b> pH {{is a measure of the}} acidity or alkalinity of a solution. As we know, most living things depend on a proper pH level to sustain life. The measurement of pH is critical in many fields ranging from chemical processing, pulp and paper, food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and so on. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity, which is an extremely widespread and useful method for quality control purposes...|$|R
40|$|Ground <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters</b> use {{electromagnetic}} fields for the mapping of geological variations, like {{the determination of}} water amount, depending on ground layers, which {{is important for the}} state analysis of embankments. The VLF band is contaminated by numerous natural and artificial electromagnetic interference signals. Prior to the determination of ground <b>conductivity,</b> the <b>meter’s</b> working frequency is not possible, due to the variable frequency of the interferences. Frequency management based on the analysis of the selected band using track-before-detect (TBD) algorithms, which allows dynamical frequency changes of the <b>conductivity</b> of the <b>meter</b> transmitting part, is proposed in the paper. Naive maximum value search, spatio-temporal TBD (ST-TBD), Viterbi TBD and a new algorithm that uses combined ST-TBD and Viterbi TBD are compared. Monte Carlo tests are provided for the numerical analysis of the properties for a single interference signal in the considered band, and a new approach based on combined ST-TBD and Viterbi algorithms shows the best performance. The considered algorithms process spectrogram data for the selected band, so DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) could be applied for the computation of the spectrogram. Real–time properties, related to the latency, are discussed also, and it is shown that TBD algorithms are feasible for real applications...|$|R
30|$|Digital {{thermocouples}} (resolution of 0.1  °C {{and accuracy}} of +[*] 1  °C) and pressure gauges (range of 0 – 100  kPa) were attached to the feed and lumen side of the membrane module, respectively, to monitor the inlet and outlet temperatures and pressures of the respective process fluids. 0.25  kW peristaltic pumps were used to circulate the heated feed and the cooled condensate and the pickup water (C&PUW) through the MD module. The water vapour that emitted from the feed side (via the membrane) was condensed, collected and weighed in the C&PUW tank.

40|$|The {{method for}} {{inhomogeneity}} investigation of measurement standards for electrical conductivity {{has been studied}} in the conductivity range from 2 MS/m to 14 MS/m. For this purpose a planar spiral coil has been developed and characterized. The impedance values of the coil are measured {{in the air and}} with a conducting plate above the coil at discrete frequencies from 2 kHz to 70 kHz. By selecting the corresponding operating frequency, relative changes in the conductivity value throughout the sample thicknesses have been measured. It was revealed that inhomogeneity of measurement standards has an effect on further measurements with calibrated <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters.</b> The relative <b>conductivity</b> changes of 0. 1 % due to inhomogeneity can be detected with the measurement uncertainty (k = 2) of less than 0. 3 % of the measured value...|$|R
50|$|Electromagnetic (EM) {{conductivity}} instruments have {{a response}} that {{is comparable to}} that of resistance <b>meters</b> (<b>conductivity</b> is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a magnetic field underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features. Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than resistance meters to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to resistance meters. Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments. Unlike resistance instruments, <b>conductivity</b> <b>meters</b> respond strongly to metal. This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest. Some EM conductivity instruments are also capable of measuring magnetic susceptibility, a property that is becoming increasingly important in archaeological studies.|$|R
