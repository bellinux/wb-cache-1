40|$|<b>Contract</b> <b>cleaners</b> are a {{significant}} group of low-paid workers in Australia. This paper examines their pay and working conditions, drawing on ABS data, documents and other secondary literature, {{as well as a}} program of interviews with cleaners and cleaning managers. We argue that low pay for this group of workers is linked not only to low hourly rates but also to short and irregular hours of paid work. This draws {{attention to the fact that}} <b>contract</b> <b>cleaners</b> face problems that extend beyond pay rates to other aspects of job quality such as work schedules and workloads. The dominant profile for cleaning work is one of low pay, compressed schedules and high work intensity. We suggest that this unfortunate mix of job characteristics is anchored in the structure of the industry and the practices of property owners, property tenants and cleaning companies. Particularly important are the imperatives of labour cost-cutting, which push contract cleaning companies to intensify work and to avoid minimum labour standards. 1...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{debate over}} MRSA in our {{community}} is really getting {{to the state of}} the ridiculous. There is no question that this bacterium, which has been around for at least 40 years, is becoming a bigger and bigger menace in hospitals. Prior to the election, the shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, claimed that hospitals are being told to push more patients through beds rather than concentrating on hygiene and this is the cause of the epidemic. He calls for a search and destroy strategy to clean up wards. The health secretary, Dr John Reid, blames the increased use of <b>contract</b> <b>cleaners</b> under the last Tory government for the rise in the rates of infection. This is supported by the Public Sector Trades Union. They believe that it is the high input of patients that prevents MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections being tackled effectively. The answer, they feel, is strict hospital hygiene and frequent hand washing, with a higher proportion of single rooms. Now, we are told that matrons should take charge of cleanliness in hospitals. Despite all the hand wringing and washing, the morbidity and mortality are both in an upward spiral...|$|R

The case will be heard by the Federal Court of Australia, where United Voice will argue that Spotless is in breach of the Fair Work Act as it leaves cleaners worse off than they would be without the IFAs.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the spatial strategies developed by unions in the United States (US) to recruit, represent and bargain for low-wage service workers. To do this, the thesis develops a two-part conceptual framework and {{uses it to}} interpret case studies of labour campaigns. In the first case study, a church group and a large public sector union united to win a `living wage' for <b>contract</b> <b>cleaners</b> and other low-wage service workers in Baltimore, and developed a city-wide union to represent these workers. In the second, a union organised 74, 000 homecare workers dispersed across 100, 000 establishments in Los Angeles, after a twelve-year struggle. While the Baltimore and Los Angeles campaigns were waged by different unions and targeted different low-wage service industries, they share important elements of an emerging `labour market approach' to low-wage service unionism. First, the campaigns sought to create city-wide, rather than workplace-specific, unions of low-wage service workers, and aimed to provide some degree of security for members in the local labour market, but not in particular workplaces. Second, each campaign actively made the local state an object of its demands, using the local state as a lever to achieve some degree of wage regulation in the industries. Understanding the emergence of these non-worksite, labour market-wide spatial strategies requires an extension to dominant geographical analysis of economic restructuring, labour unions and urban (or `local') politics. These approaches have often proceeded from a common starting point, that of an asymmetrical relationship between mobile capital and immobile labour. From this underpinning, geographers have provided important analysis of the implications for regions and workers of spatial competition under conditions of heightened capital mobility, and made prescriptions for oppositional struggle to `scale up'. In so doing, the different patterns of restructuring in low-wage services, where spatial competition may be absent or localised, have received less attention. The differently-scaled responses that are emerging to build unions and regulate wages in these industries have also remained largely unexamined. To provide {{an understanding of the}} emergence of union spatial strategies in low-wage services, the analytical framework developed in the thesis first calls attention to the geography of low-wage service industries, identifying two forms of fragmentation characteristic of this work. Such fragmentation flows on from the in situ restructuring practices of firms and the state, producing intrametropolitan scale employment geographies that are largely outside the purview of dominant geographical approaches to economic restructuring. The second part of the framework highlights the ways in which unions develop spatial strategies to respond to the fragmented geographies of low-wage services. Drawing on approaches in labour geography and urban political analysis, the framework indicates the importance of organising traditions, and of opportunities and constraints in the strategic fields of unions and their community allies, in shaping these spatial strategies. By bringing together analysis of work organisation, organising traditions, and the strategic fields confronting unions, the framework allows for the emergence of an urban labour politics. In such labour politics, unions act in various ways at the scale of the local labour market, and make the local state an object of labour claims.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Federal Government’s Work Choices {{legislation}} has severely curtailed {{the capacity of}} State Governments to regulate labour practices directly by legislation. Of the possible State Government regulatory responses to Work Choices, it {{is the use of}} public procurement as a means for regulating labour standards in the private sector that has been canvassed most extensively. However, there is little consensus on how this might be done most effectively. This report is a case study of the design and administration of the Victorian Government Schools Contract Cleaning Program, which regulates the procurement of cleaning services in over 1500 schools across Victoria. This program was established in 2005 to address complaints about widespread non-compliance with minimum labour standards applicable to <b>contract</b> <b>cleaners</b> in the industry, as well as problems with the quality of services being provided to many Schools. The study found that the program is an innovative response to the challenge of using procurement to improve labour standards in a particular industry. Drawing on program documentation and interviews with representatives of government, trade unions, and employers in the industry, we found that the program has many characteristics consistent with a model of ‘responsive regulation’. If designed properly, responsive regulation maximises the effectiveness of a regulatory regime by involving stakeholders in standard-setting as well as in monitoring and enforcement of standards. Further, employing a ‘regulatory pyramid’ which allows regulators to negotiate compliance through provision of information and education while providing for punitive sanctions if necessary, enhances effective enforcement of regulatory goals. The program achieves some of these ideals by establishing an accreditation process whereby contractors wishing to be considered for Victorian government schools cleaning contracts must apply to be members of a Panel of approved cleaning contractors. The application process is overseen by an assessment committee made up of a number of different stakeholders, including trade unions and a representative of cleaning contractors. Applicants must satisfy the committee of their compliance with iv a number of ‘Key Assessment Criteria’. These criteria include requirements with headings such as ‘Sound practices to promote Occupational Health and Safety’, ‘sound practices in human resource management’, and ‘compliance with relevant Industrial Awards/Instruments’. Although the program is in its infancy, participants in the study were positive about the establishment of the program and its impact on labour standards in contract cleaning in government schools to date. The existence of an active trade union and a strong employers association, along with a well-resourced bureaucracy providing expert assistance and advice, has been important {{to the success of the}} program. However, concerns were raised about the difficulty in oversight presented by the sheer number of contractors which have been afforded Panel Status, to date in excess of 800 firms. Some of these difficulties might be overcome by the establishment of a more formally tripartite monitoring process. Such a process would need to enhance the role of employees and their representatives or other independent monitors in the process of monitoring ongoing compliance by contractors with the labour standards set by the program. This would need to be done in a way which did not undermine the legitimacy of the program in the eyes of contractors. While the Key Assessment Criteria which set labour standards are adequate given the early stage of this program, the study found that the criteria appear to be fairly static. Program processes do not provide for upward revision of labour standards to reflect improved industry conditions and/or changing community expectations regarding employment arrangements. While there are some areas where the design and administration of this program could be improved, the report concludes there is enormous potential to extend this model to other areas of government procurement. If State Governments in Australia are to respond to Work Choices in a way which addresses both minimum labour standards and employee ‘voice’ in the workplaces of government contractors, then the Victorian Government Schools Contract Cleaning Program provides an excellent starting point...|$|R
