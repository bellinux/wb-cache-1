40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to determine the}} effects of press temperature and pressing time on the density distribution of particleboards throughout the thickness, and to make clear the relation of the density distribution to the strength properties of these boards. Wood particle used in this experiment was splinter type (5 - 16 mesh) of Lauan. The bond used was phenol resin and its solid content was 6 % (OD) for weight of a particle-mat. <b>Distance</b> <b>piece</b> of 15 mm thick was used and press temperature was varied within the range of 130 to 190 °C, and pressing time 10 - 35 min. The density distribution of particleboard was measured by soft x-ray and densitometric method. The results obtained will be summarized as follows: (1) The percentages of thickness recovery of particleboards after hot-pressing decrease rapidly with increasing of pressing time as shown in Fig. 1, and critical pressing time is about 25 min for 130 °C of press temperature and about 15 min for 150 - 190 °C of press temperature. (2) The consolidation progress of each layer within particle-mat and the variation of density distribution of the particleboard through the thickness during hot-pressing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. These figures indicate that the final type of density distribution of particleboards which are hot pressed with <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the different press temperature in the range of 130 - 190 °C are not differ from each other. However, the density distribution of the particleboard which is hot-pressed without <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is differ from them (Fig. 4). (3) The bending strength of particleboards depend primarily on the density of the face (back), and so, the values are scarecely affected by press temperature and pressing time after the layers have been consolidated (Fig. 5). In contrast with this, the internal bonding strength depend chiefly on the density of the core layer, and so, the values are affected by the two factors till the consolidation progress of the layer has been completed (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the four-quark dipenguin {{operator}} to the D 0 − ¯ D 0 mixing. It is shown to contribute to the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM) and essential for the CP violation in the neutral meson system. It is well known that because of the GIM cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance box diagram dominates in B 0 − ¯ B 0 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitude. The case of D 0 − ¯ D 0 system is somewhat special: the b-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the box diagram providing ∆C = 2 transition is diminished by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element. Thus, only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. The effect vanishes in the limit of the SU(3) invariance. All of that results in the estimated value for ∆mD being of the order of 10 − 17 GeV if only short distance contributions are taken into account [1], [2]. Calculating a box diagram and constructing the effective Hamiltonian one realizes that the smallness of the short <b>distance</b> <b>piece</b> is guaranteed by a factor of (m 2 s −m 2 d) 2 /M 2 Wm 2 c [2]...|$|R
