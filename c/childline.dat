2500|$|Yorke was {{initially}} unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He [...] commented to The Guardian in 2008, [...] "My standpoint {{has always been}} {{that there has to be}} a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason." [...] However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that [...] "it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform". It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was [...] "a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas." [...] EastEnders worked closely with NSPCC when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced [...] "sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases. The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes. The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, <b>ChildLine.</b> A <b>ChildLine</b> director, Julie Crossan, said, [...] "Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to <b>ChildLine</b> for help." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, Kian Egan {{ruled out}} {{speculation}} that Brian McFadden would reunite {{with them for}} a television show.

[...] With a new compilation album coming out, it was speculated Westlife would be doing a new greatest hits tour.

2500|$|Goozee was {{released}} again in 1993, aged 70, and relocated to Chatham, Kent {{where he was}} provided with sheltered housing. It was here, on 25 December 1995, that Goozee lured two girls aged 12 and 13 into his home where he gave them alcohol and then indecently assaulted them. The attacks came to light after the girls contacted <b>ChildLine,</b> a telephone counselling service for children provided by the NSPCC. Goozee was tried at Maidstone Crown Court in December 1996 where the jury cleared him of the rape {{of one of the}} girls but found him guilty of indecent assault. Mr. Justice Gower sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment and said that Goozee's [...] "horrifying" [...] record should be considered if it was felt he should be released in the future. Predating the newspaper's July 2000 campaign for Sarah's Law, the News of the World highlighted the case as an example of why the government should allow controlled access to the Sex Offenders Register, so parents with young children could know if a sex-offender was living in their area. One of the girls' mothers said: [...] "He was put into the community by the authorities, and none of the parents around here knew that he was a child killer. When I found out what he had done in the past it made me feel physically sick. We could have been burying our kids instead of just trying to rebuild their lives after an horrific ordeal. I hope he rots." [...] The second mother said: [...] "We should have been told this 'sweet old man' was really a child murderer." ...|$|E
