50|$|The {{frequencies}} of the harmonic series, being integer multiples {{of the fundamental}} frequency, are naturally {{related to each other}} by whole-numbered ratios and small whole-numbered ratios are likely the basis of the consonance of musical intervals (see just intonation). This objective structure is augmented by psychoacoustic phenomena. For example, a perfect fifth, say 200 and 300 Hz (cycles per second), causes a listener to perceive a <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> of 100 Hz (the difference between 300 Hz and 200 Hz); that is, an octave below the lower (actual sounding) note. This 100 Hz first-order <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> then interacts with both notes of the interval to produce second-order combination tones of 200 (300 - 100) and 100 (200 - 100) Hz and all further nth-order combination tones are all the same, being formed from various subtraction of 100, 200, and 300. When one contrasts this with a dissonant interval such as a tritone (not tempered) with a frequency ratio of 7:5 one gets, for example, 700 - 500 = 200 (1st order <b>combination</b> <b>tone)</b> and 500 - 200 = 300 (2nd order). The rest of the combination tones are octaves of 100 Hz so the 7:5 interval actually contains 4 notes: 100 Hz (and its octaves), 300 Hz, 500 Hz and 700 Hz. Note that the lowest <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> (100 Hz) is a 17th (2 octaves and a major third) below the lower (actual sounding) note of the tritone. All the intervals succumb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by Paul Hindemith in his book The Craft of Musical Composition, although he rejected the use of harmonics from the 7th and beyond.|$|E
50|$|A <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> (also called {{resultant}} or subjective tone) is a psychoacoustic {{phenomenon of}} an additional tone or tones that are artificially perceived when two real tones are sounded at the same time. Their discovery is credited to the violinist Giuseppe Tartini (although {{he was not the}} first, see Sorge) and so are also called Tartini tones.|$|E
50|$|Combination tones are {{products}} of a signal and a masker. This happens when the two sounds interact causing new sound, which can be more audible than the original signal. This {{is caused by the}} non linear distortion that happens in the ear. For example, the <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> of two maskers can be a better masker than the two original maskers alone.|$|E

50|$|If two {{sounds of}} two {{different}} frequencies are played at the same time, two separate sounds can often be heard rather than a <b>combination</b> <b>tone.</b> The ability to hear frequencies separately is known as frequency resolution or frequency selectivity. When signals are perceived as a <b>combination</b> <b>tone,</b> {{they are said to}} reside in the same critical bandwidth. This effect is thought to occur due to filtering within the cochlea, the hearing organ in the inner ear. A complex sound is split into different frequency components and these components cause a peak in the pattern of vibration at a specific place on the cilia inside the basilar membrane within the cochlea. These components are then coded independently on the auditory nerve which transmits sound information to the brain. This individual coding only occurs if the frequency components are different enough in frequency, otherwise they are in the same critical band and are coded at the same place and are perceived as one sound instead of two.|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{with any}} {{interval}}, take the interval {{produced by the}} highest original tone and the closest <b>combination</b> <b>tone.</b> Then {{do the same for}} that interval. These intervals [...] "converge to a value close to 833 cents. That means nothing else than that for instance for an interval of 144:89 (833.11 cents) both the summation and the difference tone appear...again 833 cents distance from this interval".|$|E
50|$|The {{pitch of}} complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that {{two or more}} {{different}} pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer. When the actual fundamental frequency can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of overtones, also known as upper partials, harmonic or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200 Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200 Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> at 200 Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. In a situation like this, the percept at 200 Hz is {{commonly referred to as}} the missing fundamental, which is often the greatest common divisor of the frequencies present.|$|E
5000|$|For example, 220 Hz and 220 Hz (unison) produce <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> at 0 and 440 Hz. 440 Hz is {{an octave}} above 220 Hz. 220 Hz and 440 Hz produce <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> at 220 Hz and 660 Hz. 660 Hz {{is a perfect}} fifth (3:2) above 440 Hz, and produce <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> at 220 Hz and 1,100 Hz. 1,100 Hz is a major sixth (5:3) above 660 Hz, and produce <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> at 440 Hz and 1,760 Hz. 1100 Hz and 1760 Hz are a minor sixth (8:5), and so on.

50|$|The CARS {{process can}} be {{physically}} explained by using either a classical oscillator model or by using a quantum mechanical model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) harmonic oscillator with a characteristic frequency of ωv. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the difference frequency (ωp-ωS) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the difference frequency of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the difference frequency of two optical waves. When the difference frequency ωp-ωS approaches ωv, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ωp-ωS. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the probe beam. When the probe beam is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ωpr will now get modified to ωpr+ωp-ωS, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the probe beam, and can be detected in a separate direction.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to combination tones based on Helmholtz theory encounter essential interpreting difficulties, which the most known {{example is the}} anomalous behaviour of the <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> 2 f 1 -f 2. Without doubt the phenomenon of combination tones is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this phenomenon is possible {{on the level of}} the ear. This paper proposes different approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information. The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with combination tones. As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with regard to a <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> 2 f 1 -f 2 that it can originate already from the nonlinear distortion of the second order.

Summers et al (2003) found poor agreement (56 %) between PTC- and TEN test results.

The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic dead region relationship between PTCs, modified for beats and/or <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> detection, and the TEN test with levels calibrated in hearing levels (HL), i. e.

Results: The results show an agreement of about 75 %, depending on the criteria applied, between PTC and the TEN[HL] test. Results also show that PTC probe levels affected diagnostic results in PTCs. Conclusions: Recommended criteria based on the highest agreement score included a PTC shift of 20 % and an 8 -dB probe elevation above TEN masking levels for the TEN[HL] test. Low agreement scores and level dependent effects in PTCs and the TEN[HL] test suggest that identification of dead regions using a single test is not reliabl...|$|E

An improvement in this prediction method is desired for system optimization and assessment studies of advanced UHB engines. An assessment of the ANOPP fan inlet, fan exhaust, jet, combustor, and turbine noise prediction methods is made using static engine component noise data from the CF 6 - 8 OC 2, E(3), and QCSEE turbofan engines. It is shown that the ANOPP prediction results are generally higher than the measured GE data, and that the inlet noise prediction method (Heidmann method) {{is the most significant}} source of this overprediction.

40|$|Several {{models of}} {{cochlear}} mechanics have been developed. Wave {{motion in the}} cochlea is described by most of these models in a manner analogous to traveling waves in an electrical transmission line. To model the frequency response of the basilar membrane, the electrical properties of the transmission line must vary {{along the length of}} the line. Linear models match the frequency response characteristics of the basilar membrane quite well;Psychophysical and neurophysiological observations of combination tones indicate the presence of a nonlinear mechanism within the cochlea, but the existence of a mechanical nonlinearity has not yet been proved. The purpose of this investigation is to develop a theoretical justification for nonlinearities in cochlear mechanics. Newtonian theories of fluid and solid mechanics are applied to a simplified physical model of the cochlea. Each nonlinear term in the equations of motion is considered, and its effect on the wave motion in the cochlea is discussed. A cubic nonlinearity results from the nonlinear nature of the compliance of the cochlear partition. A quadratic nonlinearity may also exist if the effects of fluid convection are significant. These results are consistent with existing nonlinear models which exhibit <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> behavior similar to that of the cochlea. It is concluded that a mechanical nonlinearity is predicted by a simply physical model of the cochlea.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{interaction of}} a dual frequency flexural wave with a breathing crack generates a peculiar frequency mixing phenomena, which is manifested {{in form of}} the side bands or peaks at combinations frequencies in frequency spectrum of the response. Although these peaks have been proven useful in ascertaining the presence of crack, they barely carry any information about the crack location. In this regards, the present article analyzes the time domain representation of the response obtained by employing a wavelet spectral finite element method. The study reveals that the <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> generated at the crack location travel with dissimilar speeds along the waveguide, owing to its dispersive nature. The separation between the lobes corresponding to these <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> therefore, depends on the distance that they have travelled.
