5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense <b>component</b> and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow <b>component</b> is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad <b>component</b> is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad <b>component.</b> The broad <b>component</b> is geometrically thicker than the narrow <b>component.</b> This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense <b>component</b> and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow <b>component</b> is 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad <b>component</b> is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad <b>component.</b> The broad <b>component</b> is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow <b>component</b> even vanishes in some places.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While {{integrating}} <b>components</b> into systems, we will {{be confronted}} with problems concerned with the interoperability of <b>components</b> due to the interaction mismatches at multiple levels, such as interaction behaviors between <b>components</b> and features imposed by architectural styles. In this paper, we studied the interoperability of <b>components</b> and explored the approach to supporting high interoperability of <b>components</b> involved in mismatching interactions. First, we formalized <b>components</b> involved in different architectural styles in the pi-calculus. Next, we studied the formal foundation of the interoperability of <b>components</b> for reasoning about {{the conditions under which}} two heterogeneous <b>components</b> are possible to interoperate and interconnect together properly. Then, we described a wrapper-based solution for integrating <b>components</b> into systems that impose mismatching assumptions about usage of the <b>components.</b> In the end, we presented an agent-based implementation for the solution, in which agents are used to wrap <b>components</b> and can automatically resolve multiple levels of interaction mismatches between <b>components.</b> We also gave a simple example to illustrate our approach...|$|R
