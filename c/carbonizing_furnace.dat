40|$|Peat with an {{approximate}} 60 % carbon content {{collected in the}} suburbs of Palangka Raya, Indonesia, was carbonized, followed by activation with steam in an electric furnace. The resultant activated carbon (AC) had ca. 900 m 2 /g of BET surface area and 1000 mg/g of iodine adsorption. This performance implies that this AC can be used as an adsorbent for environmental purification. We had a <b>carbonizing</b> <b>furnace</b> manufactured in Palangka Raya, which did not require electric power. Some AC having 350 mg/g of iodine adsorption was obtained by using this furnace. Although the adsorption ability was much lower than that of commercially available AC, the AC achieved significant decoloration and decrease in chemical oxygen demand of polluted river water. Thus, this article demonstrated the potential of tropical peat soil as a source of AC...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the usage}} of {{commercial}} activated carbon with high associated costs, {{attempts have been made}} to find inexpensive alternative activated carbon precursors as waste materials. Olive stone is among the most widely preferred agricultural wastes for the economical production of activated carbon. In this study, olive stones obtained from an oil factory located in Kuyucak, Aydın was used as raw material for the production of activated carbon via chemical activation which reduced the formation of tar and other by-products, thereby increased the carbon yield. For this purpose, phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and zinc chloride were retained as dehydrating agents. The impregnation ratio, defined by the weight ratio of the impregnants to olive stones, was kept constant as 1 : 1. 5. The samples were <b>carbonized</b> in a <b>furnace</b> heated to 600 ˚C (2 h) under a constant flowing nitrogen atmosphere. The chars obtained were cooled at room temperature and the weight losses due to pyrolysis were determined. Characteristics of the activated carbon were conducted and the pesticide adsorption capacity of each modified-sorbent was also determined separately. It is concluded that chemical agents enhance the quality and quantity of the activated carbon produced. Ingeniería químic...|$|R
