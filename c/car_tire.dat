500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a <b>car</b> <b>tire</b> instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E

500|$|Before [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] was broadcast, {{a promotional}} {{commercial}} aired on television that featured, among other things, {{the announcement that}} [...] "one of Springfield's most beloved will die" [...] and a snippet of {{a scene from the}} episode with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway spectator stand, being hit by a <b>car</b> <b>tire,</b> giving the impression that he would be the one who would die. Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was [...] "a real insensitive thing to do, pretty irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte." [...] Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's Channel 9 Eyewitness News on February7,2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox affiliate in Charlotte, refused to continue showing the commercial for the episode. As a result, Fox distributed a new commercial to the affiliate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny.|$|E

Four years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.|$|E
2500|$|Savage {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Cardinals {{organization}} as a catcher out of high school. He {{was placed in the}} minor leagues to develop, where he mostly played as an outfielder in the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and Chicago White Sox farm systems. Savage was 18 when he began playing minor league baseball; one of his teammates on the 1971 Gulf Coast League Cardinals was Larry Herndon who was also his roommate. Savage would swing a bat into a hanging <b>car</b> <b>tire</b> as a regular training exercise in order to strengthen his hands and make sure he utilized his legs during swings. The technique was so effective that Herndon adopted it and used it during his own career as a baseball coach. Savage injured his natural (right) throwing shoulder after a collision at home plate, and he learned to throw with his left arm instead. Savage's last season was 1974, when he played for the Tampa Tarpons. [...] He played 289 games in four minor league seasons, batting [...]254 with 16 home runs and 66 RBIs.|$|E

2500|$|By 1987, Abu Nidal {{had turned}} {{the full force of}} his {{paranoia}} and terror tactics inwards on the ANO itself. Members were routinely tortured by the [...] "Committee for Revolutionary Justice" [...] until they confessed to betrayal and disloyalty. Men would be hanged naked for hours and whipped until they lost consciousness, then revived with salt or chili powder rubbed into their wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a <b>car</b> <b>tire</b> with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, and salted. Plastic melted under a flame would be dripped onto prisoners' skin. According to recruits who were able to escape, prisoners' genitals would be placed in skillets of boiling-hot oil and fried while the men were held down. Between interrogations, prisoners would be confined alone in tiny cells, bound hand and foot. If the cells were full, a prisoner might be buried alive, with a steel pipe in his mouth to allow him to breathe. Water would be poured into it occasionally. When word came that Abu Nidal wanted the prisoner executed, a bullet would be fired down the tube instead, then the pipe removed and the hole filled in.|$|E
