5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day before}} the election, it was {{reported}} that the National Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals (NSPCA) had ambushed election campaign posters by attaching matching NSPCA posters to the bottom of them. NSPCA spokesperson, Christine Kuch said that the NSPCA campaign hoped to get more political parties to include animal rights in their manifestos.|$|E
5|$|Away from music, Sargent {{was elected}} {{a member of}} The Literary Society, a dining club founded in 1807 by William Wordsworth and others. He was {{also a member of}} the Beefsteak Club, for which his {{proposer}} was Sir Edward Elgar, the Garrick, and the long-established and aristocratic White's and Pratt's clubs. His public service appointments included the joint presidency of the London Union of Youth Clubs, and the presidency of the Royal Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals.|$|E

5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Giving Victims a Voice is {{a report}} {{published}} in January 2013, relating to allegations of sexual abuse made against English DJ and BBC Television presenter Jimmy Savile (1926–2011) {{as part of the}} Operation Yewtree criminal investigation. It was initiated as a result of publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the National Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Children (NSPCC) jointly produced this report. It marked the end of investigations made under the operation regarding Savile alone.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Bana narrated the {{documentary}} Terrors of Tasmania about the endangered Tasmanian devil. The film followed {{the life of}} a female Tasmanian Devil called Manganinnie and discussed the incurable facial cancer which threatens the survival of the species. He has also worked with the Royal Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals, donating money to animal shelters in Berlin while filming Troy in 2004.|$|E
60|$|On one {{of these}} points, {{near the town of}} Stonehaven, are still seen the ruins of Dunottar Castle, bare and desolate, {{surrounded}} on all sides by the restless, moaning waves; a place justly held accursed as the scene of <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> the Covenanters, so appalling and brutal as to make the blood boil in the recital, even in this late day.|$|R
60|$|Galerius died {{soon after}} of a horrible disease, {{during which he}} was filled with remorse for his <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> the Christians, sent to entreat their prayers, and stopped the persecution. On his death, Licinius seized part of his dominions, and there were four men calling {{themselves}} Emperors--Licinius in Asia, Daza Maximin in Egypt, Maxentius at Rome, and Constantine in Gaul.|$|R

5|$|Since its {{original}} release, Cannibal Holocaust {{has been the}} target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> animals, issues which find Cannibal Holocaust in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, Cannibal Holocaust has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly magazine named Cannibal Holocaust as the 20th most controversial film of all time.|$|E
5|$|The Anatomy Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015. Historically, {{the duties of the}} president have been both formal and social. The <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E
50|$|Directorate of Civil Resistance (Polish Kierownictwo Walki Cywilnej, short KWC) {{was one of}} the {{branches}} of the Polish Government Delegate’s Office during World War II. Its main tasks were to maintain the morale of the Polish society, encourage passive resistance, report German atrocities and <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> the Polish Government in Exile, and to organize sabotage. In addition, it was responsible for the law and justice in occupied Poland.|$|R

50|$|By 1864, he {{had moved}} to Washington, D.C., {{to work at the}} War Department under Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. Chipman {{successfully}} prosecuted Captain Henry Wirz, the commander of the Confederacy's infamous Andersonville prison camp, where almost 13,000 Union soldiers lost their lives. For his <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> prisoners of war and eleven homicides, Wirz was hanged in 1865. Chipman published his recollections of the famous Andersonville Trial in his 1911 book, The Tragedy of Andersonville.|$|R
5|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> wounded or to prisoners; no {{poisoned}} arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit of revenge seemed to animate them: they fought us in fair conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy worthy of a more enlightened people.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce was {{convinced}} {{of the importance of}} religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.|$|E
5|$|A Scottish Mason, Samfield was {{committed}} to public service. When Tennessee's first Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals and Children was formed in 1880, he became its first vice-president, and in 1889, he led the fundraising for Memphis's first civilian hospital, St. Joseph's, a Catholic institution. He founded Memphis's Hebrew Relief Association, and the non-sectarian United Charities, and was {{a director of the}} New Orleans Jewish Orphans' Home, Denver's Jewish Consumptive House, and New York's Sheltering House Association. For the last fifteen years of his life he worked to create a home for elderly and infirm Southern Jews, completed in 1927.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, Scindia's excuses were accepted. A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} the dominions that had been wrested from him were restored; and even Holkar, whose atrocious <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> all the British soldiers and officers who fell into his hands should have placed him beyond the pale of pardon, was again invested with most of his former possessions--with the object, no doubt, of counterbalancing Scindia's power as, had Holkar been driven to take refuge in the north, as a fugitive, Scindia would have become paramount among the Mahrattas.|$|R

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals.|$|E
25|$|Under {{all three}} of the {{conceptual}} approaches <b>to</b> animal <b>cruelty</b> discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as <b>cruelty.</b> Due <b>to</b> changes in ethical standards, this type of <b>cruelty</b> tends <b>to</b> be less common today {{than it used to be}} in the past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover, and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travellers on the Grand Tour.|$|R
60|$|This {{would be}} a curious proof of the slow and {{imperfect}} intercourse of communication between Scotland and London, if Baxter had not been particularly informed of Lauderdale's horrible <b>cruelties</b> <b>to</b> the Scotch Covenanters:--and if Baxter did know them, he surely ran into a greater inconsistency to avoid {{the appearance of a}} less. And the twenty guineas! they must have smelt, I should think, of more than the earthly brimstone that might naturally enough have been expected in gold or silver, from his palm. I would as soon have plucked an ingot from the cleft of the Devil's hoof.|$|R

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E
5|$|In March 1911, {{the captain}} of Saratoga, Cleveland Downs, faced legal {{difficulties}} regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges of <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> animals because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and asked that the charges be dropped. A later Saratoga captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff Julius Harburger in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Miller’s arrest delayed {{the departure of the}} ship by two hours.|$|E
