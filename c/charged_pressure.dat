This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{that show that}} the refrigeration efficiency of GM refrigerators can be improved by applying a <b>charged</b> <b>pressure.</b> Recently, there has been remarkable progress in superconducting systems, such as magnetic resonance imaging systems, silicon singlecrystal pull-up apparatus, and cryopumps. GM cryocoolers are used to cool these systems because of their high reliability. Thus, to improve the efficiency of superconducting systems, {{it is important to}} improve the efficiency of GM cryocoolers. If the compression ratio of a GM cryocooler is reduced, its coefficient of performance (COP) will approach the Carnot COP, since the cryocooler will operate with Simon expansion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of varying the <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> of a cryocooler and the cycle frequency on its refrigeration efficiency. We developed a GM cryocooler that can be operated at various charged pressures and we measured its efficiency at various charged pressures and operating frequencies. The optimum <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> and operating frequency were determined by comparing the experimental results with numerical simulation results...|$|E
40|$|General exact (N+ 2) -dimensional,n>= 2 {{solutions}} in {{general theory of}} relativity of Einstein-Maxwell field equations for static anisotropic spherically symmetric distribution of charged fluid are expressed in terms of radial pressure. Subsequently, metrics (e(lambda) and e(nu)), matter density and electric intensity are expressible in terms of pressure. We extend the methodology used by Bijalwan (2011 a, 2011 c, 2011 d) for charged and anisotropic fluid. Consequently, radial pressure is found to be an invertible arbitrary function of w(c 1 +c 2 r^ 2), where c 1 and c 2 (non zero) are arbitrary constants, and r is the radius of star, i. e. p=p(w). We present a general solution for static anisotropic <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> fluid in terms for w. We reduce to the problem of finding solutions to anisotropic charged fluid to that of finding solutions to a Riccati equation. Also, these solutions satisfy barotropic equation of state relating the radial pressure to the energy density. Comment: 4 page...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A resonantly-coupled α-Stirling (RCAS) cooler was {{designed}} and constructed. Tests on air and helium were performed with constant driving displacement over a range of frequencies. The effects of changing driving amplitude and <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> were studied. The use of stainless steel bellows in place of pistons eliminated the problem of piston seals and relaxed the construction tolerances. The fatigue life of the bellow is, however, a problem. The experimental optimization based on Taguchi methods was performed on regenerator mass, regenerator wire diameter, vibrating mass, and damping coefficient. Driven by a voice coil actuator, the characteristic phase shift of the Stirling cycle cooler was demonstrated where the hot-end displacement led the cold-end displacement. The 90 ° phase shift {{was selected as the}} natural frequency. The pressure-volume diagrams for each working space were plotted and the indicated powers were determined. The compression powers in the hot and cold-ends show maximum values near the natural frequency. The mechanisms are different. At the hot-end where the displacement was kept constant, operation near the natural frequency gave a maximum pressure ratio and also maximized the compression power. The phase shifts in the cold-end were, however, relatively constant. The maximum pressure ratio and amplitude gave the maximum expansion power near the natural frequency. The expansion powers in the cold-end as indicators of cooling potential were approximately 2 - 4 watts for the air case, and 3 - 7 watts for the helium case. In both air and helium tests, the value of the parasitic losses reached 12 watts. The temperature difference developed across the regenerator is considered an indication of the cooling capacity. Good correlations were found between the indicated cooling capacity in the expansion space and the temperature difference. For a given size of cooler, the use of helium offered higher cooling capacity due to smaller pressure drop loss and smaller amplitude ratio. Higher cooling performance was also attained from helium at elevated pressures...|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{fundamental}} for Automatic Performance Control (APC). Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is mechanically adjusted on the actuators pushrod between the actuator and the waste gate. At to low basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the engine doesn’t revs up as expected when the throttle is opened quickly. At to high basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> a negative adaptation occurs and maximum <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot be achieved. In addition {{there is a}} substantial risk of engine damage since the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> can’t be lowered enough when regulating with attention to pre ignition/pinging. Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> shall be 0,40 ±0,03 bar (5,80 ±0,43 PSI). After adjustment the push rod must have at least two turns (2 mm) pre tension when connecting to the waste gate lever. The purpose with that {{is to make sure that}} the waste gate is held close when not affected. On new turbo chargers the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to be near or spot on the upper tolerance when the pre tension is two turns. The pre tension may never be lesser than two turns (2 mm). When checking the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> it shall be noted that the pressure decreases at high RPM and increases at low outside temperatures.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Charging</b> <b>pressure</b> {{regulation}} utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s waste gate, the turbo chargers outlet and the compressor’s inlet. The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased. To be able to regulate the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for. This is done by taking a pre programmed value (matrix of values established in respect of RPM and throttle opening). At WOT the pressure values for each RPM are selected {{to make sure that the}} engine gets the requested torque.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We created {{graphene}} blisters {{that cover}} and seal an annular cylinder-shaped microcavity in a SiO 2 substrate {{filled with a}} gas. By controlling the pressure difference between the gas {{inside and outside of}} the microcavity, we switch the graphene membrane between multiple stable equilibrium configurations. We carried out experiments starting from the situation where the pressure of the gas inside and outside of the microcavity is set equal to a prescribed <b>charging</b> <b>pressure,</b> p 0 and the graphene membrane covers the cavity like an annular drum, adhered to the central post and the surrounding substrate due to van der Waals forces. We decrease the outside pressure to a value, pe which causes it to bulge into an annular blister. We systematically increase the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> by repeating this procedure causing the annular blister to continue to bulge until a critical <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> pc i is reached.

40|$|Noise {{generated}} by fluid power applications {{can be treated}} using bladder-style suppressors, and an optimal operating condition for these devices is sought in this thesis. Bladder-style suppressors employ a compliant nitrogen-charged bladder to create an impedance change within the system, reflecting the noise back to the source and preventing it from propagating downstream. The noise in a hydraulic system is created by a pump, the flow source in a hydraulic system, and can be separated into three categories: fluid-borne noise, structure-borne noise and airborne noise. Fluid-borne noise places addition stress on sealing surfaces, potentially causing leaks. Airborne noise can be uncomfortable, even hazardous depending on the level. Bladder-style suppressors primarily treat fluid-borne noise; however, it {{is seen in the}} literature that fluid-borne noise is the cause of structure-borne and airborne noise. This thesis presents an optimization method for finding the optimal <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> for implementation with a given system operating over a broad range of system pressures. The optimization weights suppressor performance by the spectral content of the fluid-borne noise as well as the duty cycle of the system. A single <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> works well over a small range of system pressures, though many fluid power applications operate over a larger range of system pressure than the usable range of a suppressor. For systems operating over an extremely broad pressure range, two suppressors <b>charged</b> to different <b>pressures</b> are used to treat the noise in the entire system pressure range. To determine suppressor performance experimental measurements were performed, and models developed, of the transmission loss of this type of device. A multi-microphone method using transfer function relationships between six sensors determines the transmission loss of the suppressor under test. An equivalent fluid model modeling the wave behavior both upstream and downstream, as well as within the suppressor, was created to predict suppressor transmission loss. Optimal configurations are found for a set of system <b>pressures,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> and duty cycles. Analysis of the results shows the time weighting has a more significant impact on the optimum <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> than the frequency weighting, as shown by duty cycles considered in this thesis. In addition, all <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> selected as optimal for either single suppressor optimizations or double suppressor optimizations, exhibit the highest transmission loss for a single system pressure in the pressure duty cycle for a simulated machine.

50|$|During engine {{operations}} the Ignition cassette continuously {{monitors the}} ion currents in the cylinders and sends {{a signal to}} the Trionic ECU, pin 44, in an event of knocking. The logic for this function rests solely in the ignition cassette and is adaptive {{to be able to handle}} disturbing fuel additives. The Trionic ECU is well aware which cylinder that has ignited and could hence cope with the information feed through one pin. The signal to pin 44 and ion current in the combustion chamber is related to each other, when this signal reaches a certain level the ECU interprets this as a knocking event and firstly lowering the ignition advance by 1,5° on this cylinder. If the knocking is repeated the ignition advance is lowered further 1,5 ° up to 12°. In case of the same lowering of the ignition timing advance in all cylinders the ECU adds a small amount of fuel to all cylinders. If knocking occurs when the MAP is over 140 kPa the knocking is regulated by switching both fuel injection matrix and ignition advance matrix. If this is not sufficient the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowered. This purpose of this procedure is to maintain good performance. If the signal between the ignition cassette and the ECU is lost, the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowered to basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> and the ignition timing advance is lowered 12° when it exist a risk of knocking due to engine load.|$|R

40|$|Combustion system {{development}} for future engine applications {{can be performed}} on a single cylinder combustion research engine {{and then with a}} highly controlled environment. To be able to operate such an engine at relevant conditions comparable to a multi cylinder engine, it is desirable to model and control the boundary conditions, e. g. trough simulation of turbo charging. This work was done as a master thesis during the spring of 2012 at Chalmers University of Technology and the aim was to develop an online simulation of a single turbo system for a single cylinder combustion research engine. The simulation was developed in Matlab/Simulink and integrated in an AVL PUMA test bed system using AVL ARTE. Lab.

To increase the heat transfer area, the inner surface of the displacer cylinder was augmented by means of growing spanwise slots. To perform a better approach to the theoretical Stirling cycle, the motion of displacer was governed by a lever. The engine block was used as pressurized working fluid reservoir. The escape of working fluid, through the end-pin bearing of crankshaft, was prevented by means of adapting an oil pool around the end-pin. Experimental results {{presented in this paper}} were obtained by testing the engine with air as working fluid. The hot end of the displacer cylinder was heated with a LPG flame and kept about 200 Â Â°C constant temperature throughout the testing period.
