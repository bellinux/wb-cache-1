Two singles from the album charted in the U.S., the power ballad [...] "Time Ago" [...] and the alternative rock hit [...] "Wash It Away"; the album also featured the PJ Harvey-penned [...] "All the Money in the World". The LP peaked on Billboard's Heatseekers charts at No.19 in 1998, and sales of the album eventually topped 120,000. Reviews of Your Body Above Me noted the album's dark, melodic modern rock sound, and were mixed but generally positive. The Washington Post <b>called</b> <b>Your</b> Body Above Me [...] "moodily sumptuous", Guitar Player described the music as having [...] "drama and rhythmic urgency", and Allmusic noted the album's [...] "brooding yet propulsive sound that's actually quite intriguing". The band subsequently toured with Days of the New, Cracker, and Our Lady Peace, and were called [...] "The American U2" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle. Black Lab songs were featured on soundtracks to Can't Hardly Wait, Varsity Blues, Permanent Midnight, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the song [...] "Wash It Away" [...] was also included on a charity album, Live in the X Lounge.

2500|$|Men {{and women}} hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds {{the power and}} is {{considered}} {{the head of his}} household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation {{to take care of the}} needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but you still have families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy [...] is all of your maternal aunts are <b>called</b> <b>your</b> mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are <b>called</b> <b>your</b> brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are <b>called</b> <b>your</b> children also because you are a mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer to you as a father.|$|E
