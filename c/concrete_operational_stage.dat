Doctors believed Genie had learned to use her gestalt perception to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via gestalt perception. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> of development, noting that she understood object permanence and could engage in deferred imitation. Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased. Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some optimism about her prognosis.|$|E

A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task. The [...] teacher refers {{him back to his}} text in order to notate the next word before he can define it. [...] A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment. [...] However, a child in the <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> understands the organization, and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given.

5000|$|Elkind’s {{work with}} the {{personal}} fable stemmed from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which describes egocentrism {{as a lack of}} differentiation in a given area of subject-object interaction. According to Elkind, in conjunction with Piaget’s theory, adolescent egocentrism is to be understood in the context of ontogeny (referring to the development of an organism across its lifespan). These ontogenetic changes in egocentrism are thought to drive the development of logical and formal operational thinking. Elkind described an operation as a “mental tool whose products, series, class hierarchies, conservations, etc., are not directly derived from experience.” However, a child in the <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> is not able to differentiate between these mental constructs and reality (their experiences). For instance, a child in the <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> may understand that a dog is an animal, but not all animals are dogs; however, the child is not able to grasp a hypothetical concept such as “suppose that dogs were humans”. The child is likely to respond “but dogs aren’t humans, they are animals.” ...|$|E
40|$|Normative data (e. g., Gesell, 1940; Gesell 2 ̆ 6 Ilg, 1946) {{indicate}} that the course of development is marked by periods of relative equilibrium and disequilibrium. The research literature in personality and social development, however, has not dealt extensively with the specific issues that children must resolve as they develop toward maturity. ^ Issues, as used here, derive their meaning from Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s (1960) model of equilibration. They occur {{as a result of}} the assimilation of stimuli to two contradictory structures; contradictory in the sense that both cannot be applied at the same time. ^ The equilibration process has received its widest application in the field of cognitive development (Flavell, 1963). Since the process is considered intrinsic to all psychological adaptation, however, it should be possible to extend its use into the area of personality and social development (Santmire, 1977). ^ The present investigation addressed three questions: (1) can the equilibration model be used to identify the disequilibria of children in different stages of development? (2) once identified, can consistencies in content be observed (a) within children; (b) across children at the same stage of development; and (c) with differences across stage of development? and (3) can the issues be seen as consistent with Erikson 2 ̆ 7 s (1950) stages of psychosocial development?^ Criteria, consistent with the steps in the equilibration process, were developed for analyzing the data. Groups of children in Preoperational, Early <b>Concrete</b> <b>Operational,</b> and Late <b>Concrete</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>stages</b> were asked to tell stories in response to a projective stimulus. Using these criteria, stories were analyzed for stages of equilibration which could then be used to identify specific issues.

Developmental changes were seen in the areas of (1) interpersonal cooperation; (2) children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of normative rule structures; and (3) children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to resolve structures in disequilibrium.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. Jean Piaget (1896 - 1980) {{played a}} major role in laying the groundwork for many of our current beliefs about {{cognitive}} development. While specific beliefs and ideas of different cultures may vary, Piaget posited that the stages of cognitive development, namely, sensori-motor, pre-operational, <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> and formal operational, unfold in the same sequence at roughly the same ages, irrespective of cultural and educational background. The new political changes in South Africa have transformed the education policies from the content-orientated, rote-learning based curriculum of the past, to a skills-based, interactive learning approach called Outcomes-Based Education (OBE). OBE aims to move away from the old ¡¥tabula rasa¡¦ education policy towards a dynamic learning system that involves learners at a critical level of intelligence. OBE presents itself as compatible with developments in cognitive psychology, particularly Piaget¡¦s theory of intellectual development. With the recent change in curriculum, this research investigated whether children in South Africa have attained concrete and formal operations as OBE purports to encourage. The research takes a closer look at children¡¦s cognitive abilities as assessed by Piaget¡¦s theory of development. With reference to South African education ¡§as part of the far-reaching political, social and economic changes, aimed at an egalitarian and healthy society, the new political dispensation has replaced the previous education policy with a constructivist, Outcomes Based Educational approach. ¡¨ (Skuy et al, 1999, p. 3). This study was conducted on children from grades one through to grades five, at two primary schools. One of the schools implemented OBE „b 4 years ago (experimental group), whilst the other has not as yet implemented OBE (control group). The measuring instruments consisted of Piaget¡¦s cognitive tests for assessing the <b>concrete</b> and formal <b>operational</b> <b>stages.</b> Piaget¡¦s tests are designed to look for a particular type of understanding/reasoning that typifies a particular developmental stage (Bybee & Sund, 1982). The tests consisted of one-to-one interviews designed to evaluate concrete, transitional and formal operational patterns of thought. Due to the relatively small sample group (ten participants per group) and the fact that the data is ordinal, the analysis was carried out using non-parametric and descriptive statistics. Thus, the results of Piaget¡¦s tests were compared to OBE related marks and academic marks using Spearman¡¦s Correlation Coefficient for ranked data, in order to better understand the nature of the relationship between OBE and cognitive development. Since the data is categorical, i. e., categorised as <b>concrete</b> <b>operational</b> and formal operational, the results of each child in the OBE school were also compared to the results of each child in the non-OBE school using the Mann-Whitney-U test (Howell, 1995) in order to determine whether there is a difference between OBE-cognitive development and Non-OBE-cognitive development. The aim of this study was to establish whether O. B. E is indeed a better approach than other methods of teaching with reference to cognitive development. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that O. B.
