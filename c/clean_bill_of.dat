So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{had already}} warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these {{aircraft}} were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic. On 13 May 2006, the FAA refused permission for Biman flight BG001 (Dhaka–Brussels–JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety {{concerns over the}} ailing DC–10 aircraft used on the route. The flight was diverted to Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey. Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft {{and gave it a}} <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers.

5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|Sea vessels were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The <b>Clean</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer.

5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining a <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into five parts; the first part {{introduces}} the subject <b>of</b> misdescription in <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, followed by the second part where briefly the role <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in the contract of carriage, its functions by law {{as well as the}} necessity of an International uniform system are presented. The third part of the system analysis concerns the legal framework on misdescription and in particular the gradual development of carriage of goods by sea over time, the International Conventions on <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading and certain implemented national provisions; here, the English, Greek and Norwegian legal systems are discussed as all three have implemented the Hague-Visby Rules and, being included in the top 10 largest merchant shipping fleets, they have a serious impact on the international maritime business. Part IV explores a question of considerable importance to maritime law and practice; the exchange of letters <b>of</b> indemnity against <b>clean</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, as a relatively common practice in the maritime business. Even though the letter of indemnity is foreseen in the international instruments, in case of intention to mislead the endorsee, the national provisions apply and, as will be concluded, the indemnity will be of no effect. Finally, part V will include the major findings of the paper in a summarized form so as to ascertain the current issues and present possible regulatory solutions for a healthy well-being and development of the international maritime business...|$|R

The purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents. However, the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower life-cycle costs than their legacy incandescent counterparts. Several of the founding member corporations (including Philips, Panasonic, and Sylvania) are manufacturers of high-efficiency bulbs.

6000|$|As {{we began}} by stating, it {{is a popular}} superstition among the learned that the belief in second sight has died out among the Highlanders. Fifty years ago, Dr. McCulloch, in his Description of the Western Islands, wrote thus: 'Second sight has {{undergone}} the fate of witchcraft; ceasing to be believed, it has ceased to exist'. {245} [...] Now, as to whether second sight exists or not, we may think as we please, but the belief in second sight is still vivacious in the Highlands, and has not altered in a single feature. A well- known Highland minister has been kind enough to answer a few questions on the belief {{as it is in}} his parish He first met a second-sighted man in his own beadle, 'a most respectable person of entirely blameless life'. After citing a few examples of the beadle's successful hits, our informant says: 'He told me that he felt the thing coming on, and that it was always preceded by a sense of discomfort and anxiety. [...] . There was no epilepsy, and no convulsion of any kind. He felt a sense of great relief when the vision had passed away, and he assured me repeatedly that the gift was an annoyance rather than a pleasure to him,' as the Lapp also confessed to Scheffer. 'Others who had the same gift have told me the same thing.' Out of seven or eight people liable to this malady, or whatever we are to call it, only one, we learn, was other than robust, healthy, and steady. In two instances the seers were examined by a physician of experience, and got <b>clean</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> mental and bodily health. An instance is mentioned in which the beadle, alone in a boat with a friend, on a salt-water loch, at night, saw a vision of a man drowning in a certain pool of a certain river. A shepherd's plaid lay on the bank. The beadle told his companion what he saw, and set his foot on his friend's, who then shared his experience. This proves the continuity of the belief that the hallucination can be communicated by contact. {246} As a matter of evidence, {{it would have been better}} if the beadle had not first told his friend what he saw. Both men told our informant next day, and the vision was fulfilled 'scarcely a week afterwards'. This vision, granting the honesty of the seers, was a case of 'clairvoyance,' but 'symbolical hallucinations' frequently occur. In our informant's experience the gift is not hereditary.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, for {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett in his season debut. In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Halladay was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to {{walk back to the}} dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the 2008 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of the Indians. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posted a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his arrival}} in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal Gazette writes, [...] "a model inmate". He became widely {{respected}} by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's [...] "patient therapist". [...] "He was helpful to the other patients," [...] Barker told the Globe and Mail, [...] "and they looked up to him." [...] Barker elaborated on this subject {{in an interview with}} the Windsor Star, telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been [...] "one of the most respected therapists in the hospital". Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute. Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at Ontario Police College in Aylmer, where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential. After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person.
