500|$|The {{character}} Mother is {{most commonly}} psychoanalyzed as be complementary to the feminist theory. The most commonly referenced {{pertaining to the}} subject is the Barbara Creed book, The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis, which perceives Mother as being complementary to the archaic mother theme of the 1979 film. Creed cites the crew members being awoken by a figure dubbed [...] "Mother" [...] in a womb-like room, without a father figure, and with the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>directive</b> to provide life support, as being the poignant indicator to support her conclusion. Likewise, in Beyond the Stars: Locales in American popular film by Paul Loukides and Linda K. Fuller, Mother is presented as the central focus for {{the context of a}} mother ship. As the authors describe, Mother maintains an intimate connection with the crew, providing a watchful eye when they are asleep, as well as a small, womb-like computer module for direct communication about sensitive matters. Mother is voiced by Helen Horton in Alien and Lorelei King in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
50|$|Velsius {{refused to}} leave, and went voluntarily in detention, from December 1555 {{to the end}} of March 1556. He asked his {{influential}} friend Viglius to support him, but Viglius declined to get involved. Greatly offended by this refusal, Velsius apparently accused his friend of Protestant leanings, and severed all connections with his former friend. Because of this precedent the council adopted in 1555 a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>directive</b> against all heretics.|$|E

Unsurprisingly, in 2005 the Commission eventually realized that copyright management gave rise to licensing practices that segmented the so-called "Internal Market" on a strictly in-territorial basis, {{in spite of the}} borderless nature of Webbased environments. From then onwards, the Commission has been in search of solutions to tackle economic inefficiencies stemming from territorial restrictions in copyright management and to eventually boost the growth of legitimate online content services, starting with music services...|$|E

40|$|Creation and {{existence}} of order are of philosophical significance and practical utility. This paper spells clear, succinct, yet <b>comprehensive</b> <b>directives</b> for order creation, existence and total destruction, {{in the form}} of nine exclusive directives established from the broken symmetry in the inter-convertibility of order and disorder stated by the Entropy Principle and the Law of Maximum Entropy Production. They form the guiding principles for order creation, stable existence and total destruction, at all scales. A representative mathematical model of order within disorder portrays these directives and spells the sustainability criterion for order existence. Since order is possibly stable only in chaotic systems, some of these directives have a probabilistic tone...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTo date, {{the rules}} and state of {{development}} of the processes of continuing education and the evaluation of skills and competence vary considerably from one European Member State to another. The recognition {{of the freedom of}} establishment of health professionals throughout Europe must be made conditional upon the possession of a given qualification, and also the demonstration of maintained levels of expertise, knowledge and skills. This appears to be of primary importance in order to maintain a good quality of care, and to improve the performances and responsibilities of the infection specialists, within the healthcare system. The role of scientific societies such as The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) can be envisaged as follows: (1) to {{play a key role in}} the coordination of the processes; definition of the main topics and visions, accreditation of the teaching courses and modalities of evaluation (which supposes a high level of cooperation with the platform for professional qualification) (2) to manage training courses (e. g., ESCMID School, postgraduate courses, technical workshops, educational activities within congresses). In order to make the system clearer and easier to apply, a proposal for a single, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>directive</b> is highly necessary...|$|E
40|$|A <b>comprehensive</b> <b>Directives</b> Program {{aimed at}} environmental, safety, and health {{requirements}} and risks was initiated in 1997 {{and will be}} completed in late 1999 or early 2000. The primary objective {{of the program is}} to identify or develop a set of standards that, when implemented, provides reasonable assurance that {{the health and safety of}} the workers, public, and the environment will be protected during the performance of the work. In conjunction with the Directives Program, the use of the voluntary environmental management system, ISO 14000, was evaluated. This includes the only environmental management standard to which an entity can be registered. Plans are to consider the specifications and guidance from this standard in the identification of an effective environmental management system for the merged FETC sites. A performance measurement system continued to be maintained during 1998 to assist in evaluating how effectively activities at FETC meet mission-critical goals and how well missions and strategies are connected in the DOE strategic plan. This system also provides data to assist in gauging performance against the DOE critical success factors, that is, performance against technical objectives. Various environmental milestones can be tracked to completion, thus giving the FETC measures by which to gauge the site's goals of remaining in regulatory compliance and achieving best-in-class environmental performance...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} use of and {{compliance}} with a new <b>comprehensive</b> health care <b>directive</b> by residents of {{a home for the}} aged and to determine the effect of the directive on {{the use of}} health care services. DESIGN: Descriptive study with a before-after design. SETTING: A home for the aged providing residential care to women. PARTICIPANTS: All 119 residents (ages 71 to 103 years, mean age 87. 5 years). INTERVENTION: Introduction of a <b>comprehensive</b> health care <b>directive</b> and follow-up at 1 year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Residents' treatment choices, compliance with the directive, number of hospital admissions and length of hospital stay, number of deaths and places where deaths occurred. RESULTS: Ninety (76 %) of the residents completed the directive. In the event of reversible life-threatening illness 34, 24, 11 and 21 residents requested supportive, limited, maximum and intensive care respectively. For irreversible illness the numbers were 75, 12, 3 and 0 respectively. In case of cardiac arrest 88 % requested that cardiopulmonary resuscitation not be done. In the year before the introduction of the directive there were nine deaths, one in the home and eight in hospitals. In the year after there were 17 deaths, 11 in the home and 6 in hospitals. The mean length of hospital stay was significantly lower in that year than in the year before implementation (p less than 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: This innovative health care directive seems to be feasible, practical and well supported by residents, their families and health care professionals. Further studies are required to establish the generalizability and reproducibility of the data to other elderly people in institutions, to chronically ill patients and to the community at large...|$|R
40|$|No {{significant}} {{environmental problems}} were identified at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) sites in Morgantown (MGN), Pittsburgh (PGH), Tulsa (NPTO) and Fairbanks (AEO) during 2001. No radionuclides were {{released from the}} sites during 2001. The sites maintain two major environmental programs: waste management, and environmental media and release management. These two programs encompass waste handling, storage, and disposal, waste minimization and pollution prevention, air quality emissions, surface-water discharges, groundwater impacts, industrial wastewater discharges, and spill control procedures. The Morgantown and Pittsburgh sites currently maintain complete monitoring programs for groundwater, stormwater discharge, laboratory wastewater discharge, and meteorological data. In addition, an annual air emissions inventory is prepared. A <b>comprehensive</b> <b>Directives</b> Program aimed at managing environmental, safety, health requirements, and risks was initiated in 1997, continued through subsequent years, and will be completed in 2003. The primary objective {{of the program is}} to identify and implement standards that will protect {{the health and safety of}} workers, public, and the environment. This program started with a careful and thorough analysis of risks confronting workers and the communities surrounding NETL sites. Following this analysis, requirements and best management practices were evaluated to determine how requirements could best be used to advance the mission of NETL. Teams of subject-matter experts analyzed the work assigned to determine potential hazards and identify ways to remove or control those hazards. In 2001, NETL developed or revised a series of directives in two major areas: safety analysis and review (SAR) processes, and integrated safety management (ISM) directives. SAR directives were issued for research and development (R&D) operations, support operations, and facilities. ISM directives were released on management processes, such as standards maintenance, performance measures, assessments, corrective actions, lessons-learned, and training. In conjunction with the Directives Program, the use of the voluntary environmental management system, ISO 14001, was evaluated. This includes the only international environmental management standard to which an entity can be certified. NETL is using the specifications and guidance from this standard to identify an effective environmental management system for the NETL sites. An outside consultant performed an environmental management system assessment (also referred to as an initial environmental review), as referenced in ISO 14004. The objective of the assessment was to determine the degree to which NETL's existing integrated safety management system (ISMS), safety analysis review system (SARS), and environmental management programs conformed with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) standard and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Code of Environmental Management Principles. A performance measurement system continued to be maintained during 2001 to assist in evaluating how effectively activities at NETL meet mission-critical goals and how well missions and strategies are connected in the DOE strategic plan. This system also provides data to assist in gauging performance against the DOE critical success factors, that is, performance against technical objectives.

40|$|Interfirm late {{payments}} are a hot {{issue in the}} EU as witnessed by the 1998 bills passed in Italy andin the U. K. and by the soon to be approved EU <b>Directive.</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> information, especiallyon the effective own cost, is however almost absent in the literature. The paper provides the firstdetailed evidence of the trade debt own cost for the Italian manufacturing firms, arising out ofdiscounts offered and of penalties for {{late payments}}. It is shown that, comparing also self-definedbank lending rationed and non rationed firms, interfirm credit received is, if ever, only slightly moreexpensive than bank credit. Cross-section econometric analysis, besides establishing the greaterreactivity of credit received rather granted to the external funds implicit cost, finds that the discountoffered for early payments affects significantly credit granted to buyers. The estimates obtained forthe basic specifications are robust when the sample is split according to various criteria; largerfirms, probably because less financially constrained, react more strongly to sales reductions vialonger credit and debt periods...|$|R
40|$|The {{cardinal}} {{principle of}} California water law {{is that all}} water rights, and all uses of water, must be reasonable. This seemingly simple and innocuous sentence masks a world of meaning and complexity, however, because the requirement of reasonable use embraces at least four interrelated concepts. The determination of reasonable water use is utilitarian: the law seeks to encourage relatively efficient, economically and socially beneficial uses of the state’s water resources. It is situational: the evaluation of individual reasonable use concerns not only the water right holder’s own uses but also other competing demands (both consumptive and ecological) on the water resource. The reasonable use doctrine is also dynamic: the definition of reasonable use varies as the economy, technology, demographics, hydrologic conditions, environment, and societal needs evolve. And, because all uses of water must be consistent with this interdependent and variable definition of reasonable use, the law renders all water rights fragile. A water right that was reasonable when first recognized, and {{which may have been}} exercised reasonably for many years, may become unreasonable as hydrologic conditions change, as California’s economy evolves, as population grows and new demands for water arise, as ecological needs are better understood, and as the environmental laws that protect the state’s aquatic ecosystems and native species are applied in ways that limit the impoundment and diversion of water for consumptive uses. The doctrine of reasonable use is thus both a policy mandate and a limitation on water rights. A part of California’s Constitution since 1928, it applies to all branches of government, to all levels of governmental administration of the state’s water resources, and to public and private uses of the state’s waters. Its overarching <b>directives,</b> <b>comprehensive</b> reach, and infusion into the water rights system make it the most powerful of all of the laws that govern California’s water resources...|$|R
40|$|In Ireland {{many people}} live in homes that are rurally located and not {{connected}} to public wastewater treatment systems. Where this is the case, {{the treatment of the}} wastewater produced must be undertaken by a private on-site wastewater treatment system (OSWTS). Properly built and maintained private on-site wastewater treatment systems can treat effluent in an ecologically sound manner and return the water to the environment. Nevertheless, inappropriately designed, installed and maintained systems can lead to the contamination of ground and surface water resources (Gray 1994; Daly, 2001; Flynn & Kroger, 2003; Gray, 2004; Gill et al, 2005; EPA, 2008; Daly & Craig, 2009 & Gormley, 2009). Such contamination can lead to significant threats to human health as well environmental degradation. The very high dependence by Ireland on these OSWTS’s for domestic wastewater treatment means that it is imperative that the performance and management of the systems is effective and robust. Unfortunately however there is evidence that a huge proportion of OSWTS’s are poorly managed, maintained and operated (EU, 2008; IOWA 2012 & GSI, 2013). This poor performance and management of OSWTS’s has resulted in significant prosecutions and fines for Ireland by the EU with clear and unambiguous conditions set down for what Ireland needs to do to avoid further sanctions. The existing legislation in Ireland for OSWTS’s and some recent amendments {{as a consequence of the}} prosecutions by the EU have made it very clear that the ultimate responsility lies with the homeowner for their wastewater treatment system. Provision is made in the legislation for a new inspection reigeme that will seek to identify pollution from OSWTS’s and attempt to mitigate the contamination of ground and surface waters in accordance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This new inspection reigeme and the revisions to the legislation are required for Ireland to comply with the directions of the ECJ ruling (C 188 - 08) in relation to OSWTS’s and so that the daily fines being imposed against Ireland are suspended. There has been little time available on foot of the ECJ (2008) ruling to educate homeowners on how they should be properly managing and maintaining their OSWTS’s to ensure that they operating effectively and efficiently. Existing research has identified that even where homeowners are aware of their responsibilities towards their OSWTS that they tend not to care with an ‘out of sight out of mind attitude (Gray, 2004). Clearly therefore the issue facing Ireland is not just a knowledge deficiency towards OSWTS’s but also a beahavioural change issue where people tend not to care about how their OSWTS performs. This thesis will examine the evolution of legislation in Ireland relating to OSWTS’s and how circumstances have led to the prosecution of Ireland (ECJ, 2009) for non compliance with the relevant EU <b>Directives.</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> literature reviews will outline existing research undertaken on the contamination of water resources by OSWTS in Ireland and also on techniques that could be utilised to educate homeowners on what they need to do to ensure that their individual wastewater treatment system is compliant with the relevant legislation. The research will adopt a number of research methods such as questionnaires and interviews to collect the data that is required to determine the knowledge that homeowners require about their OSWTS and this will shape the homeowner knowledge model that is to be developed. The publication of the research findings will inform the wastewater industry and the legislature of the key areas where homeowners are deficient in knowedge and understanding towards their OSWTS. These findings will also shape the knowledge model that will seek to address the knowledge and behavioural defieiciences that have led to Ireland being in the precarious position that it now finds itself in from the pollution, contamination and health threats associated with poorly performing and managed OSWTS’s. The implication of having relevant information and a clear understanding of where Ireland currently stands in relation the homowners and their interaction with their OSWTS’s will be of benefit to a whole range of sectors such as academia, industry, local authorities and the EPA. An accurate diagnosis of the problems relating to homeowner knowledge and behaiviour towards OSWTS’s will provide a framework to develop a lasting solution that will help in addressing pollution, groundwater contamination and the associated health risks from poorly constructed, managed and functioning OSWTS’s...|$|R
