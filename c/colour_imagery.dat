40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to solve the challenging task of thematic mapping in urban environments is the integration of multiple data sources to benefit from the complementary types of available information. Within the paper the combination of Digital Surface Models (DSM) resulting from airborne laser scanning and <b>colour</b> aerial <b>imagery</b> for landuse classification in urban environments is described. The laser DSM is used to obtain information on the local height above the terrain surface for each pixel. This information can be applied in order to separate objects higher than the terrain like buildings and trees from objects at the terrain level like streets and grass-covered areas. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to combine the geometric information with additional multispectral information provided from <b>colour</b> aerial <b>imagery.</b> Both types of information are integrated in a pixel-based classification, where the information on the local height above the terrain is applied as an additional channel together with the spectral channels.

40|$|Mental {{imagery is}} an {{internal}} process that resembles perceptual experience without the corresponding external stimulus. Mental imagery has close relations with many cognitive functions, and helps individuals describe the past, present and plan the future. Functional imaging research and studies of brain-damaged patients suggest {{the mechanisms of}} imagery and perception have some degree of overlap. Mental imagery is often treated as a general trait-like process. In the current study, different imagery modalities or features, colour and motion imagery, were investigated separately. The binocular rivalry method was utilized here to assess mental imagery of colour and motion, where participants were instructed to report the initial dominance in binocular rivalry after imagining or passively viewing one of the rivalry patterns. Study 1 investigated the functional effects of pure <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> and perception. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that perceptual dominance during rivalry was significantly biased by the participants prior <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> and perception, but this bias induced by <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> was attenuated by background luminance. Experiment 2 found that <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> could only prime subsequent rivalry when the imagery and rivalry occurred at the same retinotopic location, indicating that <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> was location-specific in retinotopic space. Study 2 tested how motion imagery and motion perception influence subsequent motion rivalry dominance. Experiment 1 found a significant priming effect of motion imagery on subsequent motion rivalry, which was stronger in a condition without background luminance than with. However, unlike the result with <b>colour</b> <b>imagery,</b> motion imagery still significantly facilitated subsequent rivalry {{in the presence of}} background luminance. This suggested that uniform luminance had a limited influence on the generation of motion imagery. In Experiment 2, participants viewed a binocular rivalry stimulus after passively viewing a motion stimulus at different contrasts. High-contrast motion led to suppression of that same pattern in the subsequent motion rivalry, but no significant facilitation effect was observed for low-contrast patterns. Results from the two studies jointly revealed some similarities and differences between colour and motion imagery, and suggest that mental imagery is likely to have a heterogeneous multi-feature structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} of colour is a core element of human vision. Colours provide important symbolic and contextual information not conveyed by form alone. Moreover, the {{experience of}} colour can arise without external stimulation. For many people, visual memories are rich with <b>colour</b> <b>imagery.</b> In the unusual phenomenon of grapheme-colour synaesthesia, achromatic forms such as letters, words and numbers elicit vivid experiences of colour. Few studies, however, have examined the neural correlates of such internally generated colour experiences. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to compare patterns of cortical activity for the perception of external coloured stimuli and internally generated colours in a group of grapheme-colour synaesthetes and matched non-synaesthetic controls. In a voluntary <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> task, both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes made colour judgements on objects presented as grey scale photographs. In a synaesthetic colour task, we presented letters that elicited synaesthetic colours, and asked participants to perform a localisation task. We assessed the neural activity underpinning these two different forms of colour experience that occur in the absence of chromatic sensory input. In both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, voluntary <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> activated the colour-selective area, V 4, in the right hemisphere. In contrast, the synaesthetic colour task resulted in unique activity for synaesthetes in the left medial lingual gyrus, an area previously implicated in tasks involving colour knowledge. Our data suggest that internally generated colour experiences recruit brain regions specialised for colour perception, with striking differences between voluntary <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> and synaesthetically induced colours.

40|$|Bayer {{colour filter}} arrays (CFA) are {{commonly}} used to obtain digital <b>colour</b> <b>imagery</b> from a single-chip CCD or CMOS camera. Colour information is captured via a regular array of colour filters placed over the image sensor, and the full colour image is reconstructed in a demosaicing process. <b>Colour</b> <b>imagery</b> derived {{in such a way}} is prone to visual artefacts including false colours, poor edge definition and a loss of image and colour sharpness. Such artefacts are suspected of degrading the quality of photogrammetric measurements made from demosaiced images. An approach to demosaicing based on the use of tuneable Gaussian filters is proposed. The new approach is designed to minimise image artefacts and is specifically aimed at improving the quality of photogrammetric measurements made with the demosaiced imagery. Results are given for a specific application of Bayer CFA cameras to underwater stereo length measurement of fish.
