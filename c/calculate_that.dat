5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to <b>calculate</b> <b>that</b> this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.|$|E

25|$|A July 2010 {{paper by}} Moody's Investors Service's chief {{economist}} Mark Zandl and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder {{predicted that the}} US recession {{would have been far}} worse without the government intervention.

Despite the lack of deficit spending, without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 US federal budget deficit was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.|$|E
25|$|Also the {{deflection}} {{of light}} by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it {{allowed him to}} <b>calculate</b> <b>that</b> the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world. This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordström was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small {{by a factor of}} two, because the approximation he used doesn't work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.|$|E

25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can <b>calculate</b> <b>that</b> the probability of not taking the red ball in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{precession}} in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year {{are relevant to}} understanding his work. The tropical year is {{the length of time}} that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to <b>calculate</b> <b>that</b> his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the amount}} of energy {{available}} per square meter at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun, it is possible to <b>calculate</b> <b>that</b> most known substances would be reradiating energy in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

500|$|A 2014 study {{published}} in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America looks at the potential of large-scale urban adaptation to counteract the effects of long-term global climate change.

[...] Large-scale adaptive design could completely offset this increase, however.
