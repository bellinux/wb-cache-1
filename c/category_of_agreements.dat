50|$|In California, an {{agreement}} is very powerful. A couple can waive {{their rights to}} share property (community property). It can limit spousal support (although a court at the divorce can set this aside if it deems that the limitation is unconscionable). The agreement {{can act as a}} contract to make a will requiring one spouse to provide for the other at death. It can also limit probate rights at death, such as the right to a probate allowance, the right to act an executor, the right to take as a predetermined heir, and so forth. In California, Registered Domestic Partners may also enter into a prenup. Postmarital agreements are treated very differently in California law. Spouses have a fiduciary duty to one another so premarital agreements come under a special <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements.</b> There is a presumption that the postmarital agreement was obtained by undue influence if one party gains an advantage. Disclosure cannot be waived {{in the context of a}} postmarital agreement.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} some {{facets of}} the emerging European level of collective negotiations. The paper argues that in general the acquis communautaire and other international acts can already accommodate this new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements.</b> At {{the same time it}} finds out that lack of a specific legal framework may have negative implications for the binding force of the agreements in question and for their enforcement. The existence of those agreements beyond or parallel to law causes hence confusion in regard to roles that the social partners at the national and the European level should play. Thus, in order to put some structure into the debate, it is argued that a differentiation between, on the one hand, national collective bargaining and transnational collective agreements or negotiations, and, on the other hand, consultation and negotiation powers should be applied. Consequently, the author provides an answer to the title question by stating that even though the growing engagement of European Works Councils into transnational collective negotiations represents a functional development of their practice, it is an example of transgressing their information and consultation competences.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis was to {{describe}} and analyse {{the system of the}} block exemptions. Briefly, the block exemption is a kind of exemption from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU because it is supposed to fulfil the criteria of article 101 (3) TFEU. It exempts certain <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements,</b> which are covered by the special regulation issued by the Council or more often by the Commission. The paper is divided into seven chapters and the first opening chapters are dealing with more general aspects of block exemption: the function, process of issuing, non- application and the advent of block exemption where the regulation 1 / 2003 (Modernisation Regulation) should be of special attention. It abolished the regime of previous notification of agreements to the Commission. An introduction to the system of other exemptions from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU is also described there. The following part (chapter 4) focuses more detailed on the kinds of block exemptions, which are divided into the vertical, horizontal and sector exemptions. The former exemptions issued by the Czech Office for the Protection of Competition are no longer applicable and therefore only the block exemptions of the EU are of the concern of this paper. Furthermore, the special competition regime of some [...] ...|$|E

50|$|The {{classical}} British {{perspective on}} competition was that certain agreements and business practice {{could be an}} unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods.

40|$|This thesis {{conducts a}} robust and {{granular}} {{examination of the}} concept of ‘object’ under Article 101 (1) TFEU and its resulting legal and practical implications. To that end, a methodology focusing on the case law of the European Courts and other primary sources is adopted. This enables a legal analysis of the meaning, application and role of restrictions of competition by object to be undertaken. The case law reveals three key approaches adopted by the European Courts to restrictions by object: the ‘orthodox approach’, the ‘more analytical approach’ and an amalgamation of these two approaches, the ‘hybrid approach’. This finding immediately questions the dominance of the orthodox approach within legal discourse over the years. The orthodox approach contends that a limited <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered by law to automatically restrict competition by virtue of their object. This is reflected in the European Commission’s Article 81 (3) Guidelines and is encapsulated by the widely recognised ‘object box’. This thesis poses a direct challenge to such narrow interpretation of the law. It argues that this depiction of the law does not fully reflect the jurisprudence of the European Courts. Rather the case law reveals an alternative interpretation {{of the concept of}} object based on the seminal case of Société Technique Minière concerned more with determining the aim of the agreement within its legal and economic context as opposed to its categorisation. Moreover, the ‘more analytical approach’ benefits from greater judicial support. Having established the three key approaches and their application under Article 101 (1) TFEU, the question of what is the best interpretation of the law on restrictions of competition by ‘object’ is reflected on. Based on the case law of the European Courts, it is argued the more analytical approach provides the best interpretation of the law. This is assessed in relation to the framework of Article 101 TFEU as a whole. Finally, this thesis briefly explores whether such conclusion is then consistent with the optimum function of the object criterion from an enforcement perspective...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the second}} section of a three-part article. The first {{appeared}} in 74 YALE L. J. 775 (1965). The first section of this article argued that the uncertainty and inconsistency which patently afflict the law concerning price fixing and market division are attributable to the twofold failure of Sherman Act courts {{to be clear about}} the ultimate values the law implements and to develop a realistic analysis of the economic phenomena with which the law is required to deal. The main tradition of the Sherman Act 2 ̆ 7 s rule of reason –established by Justice Peckham, Judge Taft, and Chief Justice White in 1911 –necessarily rests, whether phrased in such terms or not, upon the premise that the law 2 ̆ 7 s exclusive concern is with the maximization of wealth or consumer want satisfaction. Though this premise {{is not the only one}} upon which social legislation may be based, it is implicit- and sometimes explicit-in the key decisions which established the main tradition of the rule of reason, and it is, moreover, the only premise capable of producing rational decisional law under the Sherman Act as now written. Acceptance of consumer want satisfaction as the law 2 ̆ 7 s ultimate value requires the courts to employ as their primary criterion the impact of any agreement upon output, and thus to determine whether the net effect of the agreement is to create efficiency, and thereby increase output or, alternatively, to restrict output. This common acceptance of the wealth-maximization premise and its inherent standards of judgment explains why the interpretations given the Sherman Act by Peckham, Taft and White, despite their widely differing phrasings, were so similar in result, and why each assigned a prominent place within the rule of reason to a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> illegal per se. The primary deviant tradition of the rule of reason-originally espoused by Justice White in 1897 and in 1918 by Justice Brandeis- rejects consumer welfare as the sole value of the law and admits competing considerations, most notably, perhaps, concern for small producers. The criteria required by the simultaneous use of wholly inconsistent values are necessarily either arbitrary or indefinable. Probably because this deviant strain has never become dominant, the criteria of the Brandeis tradition have in fact remained rather vague. They seem reducible, however, to the idea, early rejected by the judges of the main tradition, that a cartel should be judged by the 2 ̆ 2 reasonableness 2 ̆ 2 of the price it fixes. White 2 ̆ 7 s 1897 Trans-Missouri dissent is thus to be equated with Brandeis 2 ̆ 7 reading of the Act in the 1918 Chicago Board of Trade opinion. The introduction of values incompatible with consumer welfare, values that could, in fact, be furthered by cartel agreements at the expense of consumers, was the reason that neither White (in 1897) nor Brandeis (in 1918) gave a prominent, or perhaps any, role to the per se concept. The main tradition, with its insistence upon efficiency and restriction of output as the standards of the Sherman Act, is, therefore, entitled to be preferred not merely as a matter of precedent but also because of its exclusive ability to achieve those attributes of rationality, efficacy, tolerable certainty, and the proper demarcation of the respective functions of legislature and judiciary which are characteristics of good law. Though a proper choice of values is necessary to good law it is not sufficient. The Sherman Act, which deals with price fixing and market division in widely varying business contexts, requires a coherent analytical structure to translate values into conclusions. The Act, however, has not evolved doctrine adequate to cope with this diversity of phenomena. Too often the law deals with particular forms of price fixing and market division as isolated and unique topics, neglecting to locate each within a rational conception of the whole. Perhaps just as often the law commits the opposite error of failing to make distinctions corresponding to economic differences, and applies broad formulas to situations in which they are wholly inappropriate. This second section of a three-part article attempts to provide a general theory capable of making the law of price fixing and market division internally consistent, congruent with the law of similar behavior, and effective in serving consumer welfare...|$|E

Objective: To develop and test {{the reliability and validity of}} a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire for Bolivian adolescents. Setting: La Paz, September - October 2004. Methodology: A convenience sample of 82 students from a secondary participated in the study. A semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire was applied twice with one month interval (Q 1 and Q 2). A 3 days dietary record (3 R) was obtained from 32 of the Students as standard. Results: Most of the questions (87 %) reporting intake of each individual food item agreed moderately to substantially while only 2 individual food items fell into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> slight <b>agreement</b> and 11 into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> fair <b>agreement</b> using the kappa statistic.

40|$|The first {{researches}} in the Ukrainian {{language are}} devoted to the studying <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> / disagreement as a sentence, word-sentence, non-divided sentence. As for communicative orientation words-sentences are divided into affirmative, negative and others.

Negative word-sentences are actually divided into proper negative, negative word-sentences, which show disagreement and proposal or argument of the speaker and into negative word-sentences, which the speaker denies himself or herself. One-word agreement / disagreement has been seen as an affirmative / negative non-divided sentences that are nominated by word-sentences. Non-divided sentences can be expressed by particles, modal structures, interjections and idioms that express modal-logic meaning <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> / disagreement. Further agreement / disagreement is analyzed as a speech act based on different languages. All scientists who are engaged in research of speech phenomena agree that: 1) the basic form <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> and disagreement design is a dialogical unity; 2) <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> and disagreement serves to express acceptance or adoption of the views of the speaker; 3) in semantic terms in this <b>category</b> modal evaluation <b>of</b> the expression of interlocutor about the compliance or noncompliance reality is shown.

Subjects: Thirty children, 18 boys and 12 girls between 1 and 5 years of age (mean age 2. 5 years +/- 14. 2 SD, Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-IV). Measures: the children were classified {{by means of the}} MACS by two independent observers. Interobserver reliability was analysed using Cohen's kappa. Results: Overall interobserver reliability of the MACS for children aged 1 - 5 years was moderate, with a linear weighted kappa (kappa) of 0. 62 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 49 - 0. 76).

Following these premises, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the impact that has been exercised on the EC’s contentious practice by interpretations of the WTO system given by the EC courts, in fine tuning with the stand taken by the EC’s political bodies. After having considered the legal and political reasons behind the case-law of the Community’s courts on ‘direct effect’, the paper attempts to analyse to what extent the EC’s conduct in the framework of the WTO dispute settlement process has been influenced by the ‘scope for manoeuvre’ argument, devised by the ECJ in the Portugal ruling.

40|$|Competition law, as {{it applies}} to the {{maritime}} industry has on a global scale been subject to a "laissez-faire"-attitude. In fact, collusion has been encouraged. Collusion in the maritime industry has its historic origin in the colonial period. The evolution within this particular industry truly is a study in industrial organizational structure. This Thesis sets out to explain and analyze the current regulatory scheme of the European Union, {{as it applies}} to the maritime industry (European, as well as non-European). This is accomplished through an in-depth statutory interpretation of EU Council Regulation 4056 / 86 dated 22 / 12 1986, laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome to the maritime transport (Conferences), as well as the Commission Regulation 870 / 95 dated April 20, 1995 on the application of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty of Rome to certain <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements,</b> decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (Consortia). This Thesis concludes that the former regulatory scheme is no longer up to date and thus requires replacement. The Thesis favours current developments within the maritime industry which call for increased co-operation and concentration among the carriers and providers of services (as well as co-operation as between the carriers and shippers), counter-balanced by restrictive regulation through the application of conditions, market share-restrictions and a limited five year application of the regulatory framework. The former regulatory scheme, Council-Regulation 4056 / 86, which remains in force, must therefore be interpreted restrictively, and in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, in particular Articles 85 and 86. Finally, this Thesis provides various solutions to soften the impact of full-scale application of the competition law of the European Union, as it will be applied in the maritime industry...|$|R

However, when one or both parties claims that the mahr agreement does waive divorce rights, then that party should have the burden of showing both that this reading <b>of</b> the mahr <b>agreement</b> is reasonable, and that any such waiver was consistent with the procedural and substantive fairness safeguards created by state law to protect those who might otherwise make such waivers in an inconsiderate way...|$|R
40|$|PhDThis study {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of subject clitic (henceforth, SCl) variation in Ligurian, a variety spoken in the north-west of Italy. Through the examination of empirical data, this work shows that variation can be incorporated {{in the theory of}} a single grammar. In particular, this study determines which linguistic and extra-linguistic factors influence SCl variation and whether these factors vary among individual speakers, and it applies notions of minimalist theory to account for variable and categorical cases. Three variables in the Ligurian SCl paradigm are examined, where overt variants alternate with a zero form. These are: 3 rd singular u, a/Ã 9 ̆ 8, 3 rd plural i/e/Ã 9 ̆ 8, and 1 st person e/a/Ã 9 ̆ 8. In these variables, the zero form is always affected by adjacent negation and object clitics, by processing factors, and occasionally by following phonological context, though never by age of the speaker. In contrast, factors that influence overt SCl alternation vary: subject-verb agreement in 3 rd singular contexts, morpho-phonological factors in 3 rd plural contexts, and phonological, syntactic, and extra-linguistic factors in 1 st person contexts. Following the general view that SCls in northern Italian dialects express subject agreement features (e. g., Poletto, 2000), I propose that SCl variants are phonological expression of different phi-feature combinations <b>of</b> two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agreement</b> (Number and Person) which include underspecification of features and feature values (Adger, 2006). Overt variants may show underspecification of the number and/or gender features of Number, whereas a null underlying variant always has unvalued number and gender. In variable cases, all variants in the set are formally satisfied and significant factors trigger the choice of the variant. In categorical cases, only one SCl variant in the set has its feature requirements fulfilled. Furthermore, I propose a four-fold interpretation of the zero form, namely, as null underlying variant, as nonpronunced SCl projection due to blocking by syntactic elements, as absence of phi-features, and as phonological deletion of overt variants (inter-speaker variation) ...|$|R
30|$|There were no {{significant}} differences between low-dose CT screening and follow-up standard diagnostic CT for lung cancer screening in all 11 criteria. The concordance rate for the diagnoses was approximately 80 % (p[*]<[*] 0.001) for all <b>categories.</b> <b>Agreement</b> <b>of</b> the evaluation <b>of</b> all <b>categories</b> in the final diagnosis exceeded 94 % (p[*]<[*] 0.001). Five physicians detecting and characterizing the pulmonary nodules did not recognized the difference between low-dose CT screening and follow-up standard diagnostic CT. With low-dose CT, the effective dose ranged between 1.3 and 3.4  mSv, whereas in the follow-up diagnostic CT, the effective dose ranged between 8.5 and 14.0  mSv.|$|R
40|$|Background Foot disease complications, such as foot ulcers and infection, {{contribute}} to considerable morbidity and mortality. These complications are typically precipitated by "high-risk factors", such as peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. High-risk factors are {{more prevalent in}} specific "at risk" populations such as diabetes, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. To {{the best of the}} authors' knowledge a tool capturing multiple high-risk factors and foot disease complications in multiple at risk populations has yet to be tested. This study aimed to develop and test the validity and reliability of a Queensland High Risk Foot Form (QHRFF) tool. Methods The study was conducted in two phases. Phase one developed a QHRFF using an existing diabetes foot disease tool, literature searches, stakeholder groups and expert panel. Phase two tested the QHRFF for validity and reliability. Four clinicians, representing different levels of expertise, were recruited to test validity and reliability. Three cohorts of patients were recruited; one tested criterion measure reliability (n?=? 32), another tested criterion validity and inter-rater reliability (n?=? 43), and another tested intra-rater reliability (n?=? 19). Validity was determined using sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPV). Reliability was determined using Kappa, weighted Kappa and intra-class correlation (ICC) statistics. Results A QHRFF tool containing 46 items across seven domains was developed. Criterion measure reliability of at least moderate <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> (Kappa?>? 0. 4; ICC?>? 0. 75) was seen in 91 % (29 of 32) tested items. Criterion validity of at least moderate categories (PPV?>? 0. 7) was seen in 83 % (60 of 72) tested items. Inter- and intra-rater reliability of at least moderate categories (Kappa?>? 0. 4; ICC?>? 0. 75) was seen in 88 % (84 of 96) and 87 % (20 of 23) tested items respectively. Conclusions The QHRFF had acceptable validity and reliability across the majority of items; particularly items identifying relevant co-morbidities, high-risk factors and foot disease complications. Recommendations have been made to improve or remove identified weaker items for future QHRFF versions. Overall, the QHRFF possesses suitable practicality, validity and reliability to assess and capture relevant foot disease items across multiple at risk populations. Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>of</b> the {{collective}} <b>agreement</b> policy <b>of</b> IG BAU is centralized. Many {{of the national}} collective agreements have been declared generally binding by the German federal government and so apply to all employers and workers in certain sectors like e.g. construction and the building cleaning trades. Because there is no general legal minimum wage in Germany yet the IG BAU lobbied from 1990 onwards for the introduction of sectoral legal minimum wages based on the loewest <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> sector-wide collective <b>agreements</b> and succeeded in 1996. Since that time IG BAU - together with sectoral national employer organisations - has created legal sectoral minimum wages for general construction http://ecmin.efbww.org/default.asp?issue=emwn&language=EN&CID=DEU, demolition, painting, scaffolding, roofing and building cleaning incl hotel cleaning and janitors by collective agreements, which have been declared generally binding by a federal order of the federal labor ministry. These minimum wages also apply to foreign companies who send their workers temporarily to Germany.|$|R
