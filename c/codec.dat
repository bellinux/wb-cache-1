5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and <b>codec,</b> {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the <b>Codec</b> radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The <b>Codec</b> {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
5|$|On April24,2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company Section23 and the licensing company Sentai Filmworks announced their {{acquisition of the}} license and plans to release a digital version and the North American bilingual DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. The DVD and Blu-ray were both were released on August6,2013. The Blu-ray used 1080p AVC (Advanced Video Coding) with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 Widescreen and audio encoded with the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio <b>codec.</b> Its packaging did not include inserts or a reversible cover.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist is Solid Snake, {{a legendary}} infiltrator and saboteur. During the mission, Snake {{receives}} support and advice via <b>codec</b> radio. Colonel Roy Campbell, Solid Snake's former commanding officer, supports Snake with advice and tactics. While he initially keeps {{a number of}} secrets from Snake, he gradually reveals them. He is joined by Naomi Hunter, who gives medical advice; Nastasha Romanenko, who provides item and weapon tips; Master Miller, a former drill instructor and survival coach; and Mei Ling, who invented the soliton radar system used in the mission and is also in charge of mission data; the player can call her to save the game.|$|E

5|$|The score {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from various soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral {{analysis of the}} content of the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for lossy codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio were able to identify the lossy <b>codec</b> that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio <b>codec,</b> which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth <b>Codec</b> frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
50|$|POTS <b>codecs,</b> ISDN <b>codecs,</b> and IP <b>codecs</b> {{are used}} for remote {{broadcasts}} when {{it is possible to}} have specialized equipment {{at both ends of the}} connection. POTS <b>codecs</b> work with analog lines, ISDN <b>codecs</b> with ISDN lines, and IP <b>codecs</b> with any link that can provide IP connectivity. These employ audio data compression and decompression at each end. Audio bandwidths up to 20 kHz can be achieved this way. Compression is often via MPEG MP3 or AAC.|$|R

25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the most}} common <b>codec</b> of the four WMA codecs. Colloquial usage of the term WMA, {{especially}} in marketing materials and device specifications, usually refers to this <b>codec</b> only. The first version of the <b>codec</b> released in 1999 is regarded as WMA 1. In the same year, the bit stream syntax, or compression algorithm, was altered in minor ways and became WMA 2. Since then, newer versions of the <b>codec</b> have been released, but the decoding process remained the same, ensuring compatibility between <b>codec</b> versions. WMA is a lossy audio <b>codec</b> based on the study of psychoacoustics. Audio signals that are deemed to be imperceptible to the human ear are encoded with reduced resolution during the compression process.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions regarding the design of a digital radio system is the choice of which audio <b>codec</b> to use, because the efficiency of the audio <b>codec</b> determines how many radio stations can be carried on a multiplex at a given level of audio quality. The capacity of a DAB multiplex is fixed, so the more efficient the audio <b>codec</b> is, the more stations can be carried, and vice versa. Similarly, for a fixed bit-rate level, the more efficient the audio <b>codec</b> is the higher the audio quality will be.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{reputation}} for poor audio quality, the mobile telephone industry {{has started to}} make some progress on wideband audio.

40|$|Radio-frequency {{spectrum}} {{restrictions in}} radio broadcasting, and space limitations in other applications (such as audio storage on high cost media) demand bit-rate reduction. At the Communications Research Centre, {{we have been}} evaluating the subjective quality of audio <b>codecs</b> that reduce digital audio bit-rate by factors of 4 or more, depending on the application. The algorithms used to achieve such reductions are based on psychoacoustic models of hearing so that, theoretically, <b>codecs</b> {{should be able to}} operate transparently. With the best of these <b>codecs,</b> operating at their higher bit-rates, such transparency is likely to be true for average listeners. However, very subtle differences among these <b>codecs</b> can become magnified, for example, by operating several of these <b>codecs</b> in tandem, or by post-processing applied after bit-rate reduction (typical in broadcasting).
