40|$|The complex {{motorcycle}} wheel {{components of}} AM 50 A magnesium alloy had been <b>formed</b> by double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> and die casting, respectively. The surface quality of components <b>formed</b> by double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> {{was much better}} than die casting parts. When double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> was used to replace die casting to form motorcycle wheel components, the tensile strength increased from 149. 4 MPa to 207. 0 MPa and the elongation increased from 5. 6 % to 10 %. The fracture mode was transformed from brittle one of die casting parts to ductile one of double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> parts. The average grain sizes in the spoke region and the hub region of double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> wheels were 16 μm and 20 μm, respectively, which were smaller than those of die casting components. The matrix phase of the spoke part was α-Mg, the second phase was Mg 17 Al 12. A fishbone morphology of {{the second phase of}} die casting parts was found in the grain boundaries. The second phase of double <b>control</b> <b>forming</b> parts was like needle or rod presence at the grain boundaries.

40|$|Previous {{authors have}} focused on technical, {{radiographic}} and perceptual aspects of dental radiology but scant {{attention has been paid}} to the thought processes and recording methods used in interpretation. The purpose of this investigation was to test the efficacy of a report-form template for radiological interpretation. Sixty-four senior dental students were divided into two groups. Group A received panoramic radiograph X and group B radiograph Y. Both groups completed the customary, blank report form (<b>control</b> <b>form).</b> Subsequently, group A was given radiograph Y and group B radiograph X, and they both completed the test form which contained pathology-directed subheadings. The number of missed lesions and false-positive observations on each form were compared and the students asked which form they preferred. More findings were missed when students used the <b>control</b> <b>form</b> (P 0. 05). All but one of 64 students preferred the test form. A pathology-directed report form may therefore be of assistance for teaching undergraduate dental students oral radiological interpretation. © 1990. Articl...|$|E
