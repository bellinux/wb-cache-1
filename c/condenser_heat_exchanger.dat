40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of superheated vapor in <b>condenser</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{is common in}} many applications, as heat pump or organic Rankine cycle. Rarely taken into consideration {{in the literature of}} plate heat exchangers, the present article focuses on the influence of the superheated vapor on the condensation characteristics of an organic fluid (pentane) in a brazed plate heat exchanger (BPHE). A specific experimental approach has been developed for this objective. The tested BPHE prototype consists of 2 channels with chevron angle of 55 degrees, and a hydraulic diameter equal to 4. 4 mm. The effect of the pentane mass flux, 9 - 30 kg m(- 2) s(- 1), and the vapor superheat, 5 - 25 K, at a mean constant saturation temperature of 36. 5 degrees C (1. 029 bars), on the global and local thermo-hydraulic characteristics has been identified. An infrared (IR) metrology is used to distinguish the different fluid state distributions, which are representative of various heat transfers along the BPHE. The IR thermography shows a significant impact of the vapor superheat, on the fluid distribution at the channel inlet depending on the mass flux. Comparing the results with vapor superheat going from 5 to 25 K, we note: 1 /an increase of the heat transfer coefficient reaching 70 % for the lowest mass flux; 2 /an increase of the pressure drop, whose rate (18 %) is equivalent to the increase of the heat transfer coefficient for the larger mass fluxes. Superheated vapor is therefore very favorable to heat transfer for condensation in the gravity mode compared to the convective one. Based on experimental measurements and observations, various vapor desuperheating scenarios are tested. The analysis justifies that the suitable desuperheating scenario involves condensation from superheated vapor directly from the channel inlet with liquid vaporization from the condensate film.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to investigate a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) for the double concrete containment of the Korean Next Generation Reactor (KNGR). Two conceptual PCCS designs: the thermosyphon loop and the internal evaporator-only (IEO) were studied. Based on their requirements, a number of full-scale single-tub experiments have been conducted to investigate {{the performance of the}} evaporator, the key component in both PCCS designs. The thermosyphon loop design consists of an evaporator (with integrated exit steam separator) and a <b>condenser</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The evaporator heat exchanger is located in the containment atmosphere; on its outside tube surfaces steam condensation in presence of noncondensable gases takes place. The <b>condenser</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is placed in a large water pool located exterior to the containment building; its storage capability serves as the final heat sink. The numerical simulation in GOTHIC of this design shows that, depending on the water pool initial temperature, ten to fourteen thermosyphon loops are needed {{in order to keep the}} containment temperature and the total pressure below the design values for the design basis accident (60 psia) and three-to-five loops for the severe accident (120 psia). The IEO design is similar to the PCCS concept using internal condensers discussed earlier by KAIST. The difference between the IEO and the thermosyphon loop is that the steam exciting the evaporator is directly vented to atmosphere in the IEO rather than the exterior condenser in the thermosyphon loop design. The target of this system is to keep containment pressure below 8. 3 bar (12 psia) in the absence of any other containment cooling following a severe accident, which postulates core damage and hydrogen combustion. A DBA scenario (LB LOCA, ECCS flow and no spray) and a severe accident scenario (LB LOCA without ECCS and containment spray flow, 100 % Zr oxidation and complete hydrogen combustion), as used in KNGR safety analyses (similar to those in the standard safety analysis report for SYSTEM 80 +) were modeled using the GOTHIC computer code. GOTHIC performance analysis of the IEO for the DBA condition shows that this concept can likely meet the design peak pressure of 60 psia, if 10 IEOs are used assuming that the separator water level is sufficiently low. However it is inherently difficult to meet the second design criterion of half of peak design pressure within 24 hours because the temperature difference between the containment and the IEO wall is low in the long term. Fir the severe accident, even with two IEOs, there is no problem in meeting the design criteria of 120 psia during the long-term period, with a generous margin. In addition the peak pressure is just 110 psia even assuming 100 % zirconium oxidation and the complete burning of hydrogen. The fouling effect by aerosols on the IEO performance was calculated to be negligible. Judging from the above findings for the performance analysis involving DBAs and severe accidents, it is concluded that the IEO has considerable merit for severe accident mitigation and is worthy of further evaluation. A smooth tube, an axial-finned tube and a radial-finned tube have been tested to experimentally estimate the performance of the reference smooth evaporator tube and the enhancement factors, which may be achieved by finning smooth tubes. An empirical correlation has been developed for numerical analysis use. The Diffusion Layer Model (DLM) has been recommended for use beyond the range of this empirical correlation. Condensation in the presence of helium and tube bundle effects were also studied. Theoretical analysis and experimental results of the two finned tubes suggested an enhancement factor of 4 be used in GOTHIC simulation of the PCCS concept based on smooth tube modeling.

A thermodynamic model for the cycle is proposed which can simulate the operation of a carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle. This model takes into account the practical effects of the thermo-physical properties of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant in a trans-critical cycle. One and two-stage compression processes were considered for comparison purposes. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted so that cycle performance can be estimated.

The second portion of the thesis deals with the concept of reheat air conditioning, and looks at the performance of different reheat cycles. The thesis looks at reheat systems that utilize different placements of the reheat coil. The overall performance of these reheat systems is then calculated. These systems require no additional electric power to reheat the air after it is cooled and dehumidified in the evaporator.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the present work {{was to develop a}} new scale-prevention technology by continuously precipitating and removing dissolved mineral ions (such as calcium and magnesium) in cooling water while the COC could be doubled from the present standard value of 3. 5. The hypothesis {{of the present study was}} that if we could successfully precipitate and remove the excess calcium ions in cooling water, we could prevent condenser-tube fouling and at the same time double the COC. The approach in the study was to utilize pulse spark discharges directly in water to precipitate dissolved mineral ions in recirculating cooling water into relatively large suspended particles, which could be removed by a self-cleaning filter. The present study began with a basic scientific research to better understand the mechanism of pulse spark discharges in water and conducted a series of validation experiments using hard water in a laboratory cooling tower. Task 1 of the present work was to demonstrate if the spark discharge could precipitate the mineral ions in water. Task 2 was to demonstrate if the selfcleaning filter could continuously remove these precipitated calcium particles such that the blowdown could be eliminated or significantly reduced. Task 3 was to demonstrate if the scale could be prevented or minimized at condenser tubes with a COC of 8 or (almost) zero blowdown. In Task 1, we successfully completed the validation study that confirmed the precipitation of dissolved calcium ions in cooling water with the supporting data of calcium hardness over time as measured by a calcium ion probe. In Task 2, we confirmed through experimental tests that the self-cleaning filter could continuously remove precipitated calcium particles in a simulated laboratory cooling tower such that the blowdown could be eliminated or significantly reduced. In addition, chemical water analysis data were obtained which were used to confirm the COC calculation. In Task 3, we conducted a series of heat transfer fouling tests using a <b>condenser</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in the laboratory cooling tower, from which we confirmed that the plasma water treatment technology could prevent or significantly mitigate mineral foulings in condenser tubes when compared with the no-treatment case.

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and <b>condenser</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is also {{very important to the}} overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has {{to do in order to}} provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{are used}} in many space {{applications}} in the thermal and humidity control systems. In the International Space Station (ISS), humidity control is achieved by using a water cooled fin surface over which the moist air condenses, followed by "slurper bars" that take in both the condensate and air into a rotary separator and separates the water from air. The use of a cooled porous substrate as the condensing surface provides and attractive alternative that combines both heat removal as well as liquid/gas separation into a single unit. By selecting the pore sizes of the porous substrate a gravity independent operation may also be possible with this concept. Condensation of vapor into and on the porous surface from the flowing air {{and the removal of}} condensate from the porous substrate are the critical processes involved in the proposed concept. This paper describes some preliminary results of the proposed condensate withdrawal process and discusses the on-going design and development work of a porous media based <b>condensing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> at the NASA Glenn Research Center in collaboration with NASA Johnson Space Center...|$|R

Recently, a porous media based gravity insensitive <b>condensing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> for humidity control {{has been proposed}} and successfully demonstrated by the authors. A strongly hydrophilic porous substrate is essential for condensing and trapping water vapor from the airstreams. However, most porous media which have good thermal characteristics are poorly wetting to water. This poses a significant obstacle {{in the development of}} the porous media based <b>condensing</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> In response to this problem, a clay based process was developed for improving the wettability of non-wetting and partially wetting porous media. It was demonstrated that poorly wetting porous graphite as well as porous stainless steel could be converted to a completely wetting porous substrate by kaolinite treatment. The process enhances the wettability of both the surface and the interior pores. The paper presents experimental results of enhanced wettability of the treated substrate in terms of imbibition rate and capillary pressure as a function of saturation. The long term stability of the treated surface is also investigated and discussed...|$|R
