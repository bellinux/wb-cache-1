25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or <b>cyclohexane</b> to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With <b>cyclohexane</b> as the entrainer, the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% <b>cyclohexane,</b> and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough <b>cyclohexane</b> is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new catalytic asymmetric methods for the efficient construction of structurally diverse and highly functionalized carbocycles and heterocycles is an important task. Particularly tandem / domino / cascade and multi-component strategies win lately more and more attention in asymmetric synthesis, based {{on the concept of}} organocatalysis. It was shown that it is possible {{with the help of the}} non-covalent catalysis, to synthesize <b>cyclohexanes,</b> chromans and tetrahydropyrans asymmetrically. The concept of multi-catalysis has been extended so far that poly-functionalized <b>cyclohexanes</b> are synthesized stereoselectively from beta-keto esters, nitroalkenes, and alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes in an one-pot reaction via domino Michael-/Michael-/ 1, 2 -addition sequence. The preparation of functionalized chroman derivatives was achieved via a domino-Michael- Hemiacetalization sequence, starting from beta-keto esters, and 2 -nitrovinyl phenols.

25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, <b>cyclohexane</b> adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of <b>cyclohexane.</b> Another conformation of <b>cyclohexane</b> exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If <b>cyclohexane</b> is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclohexane</b> has two {{crystalline}} phases.

The low-temperature (below 186 K) phase II is ordered. Two other low-temperature (metastable) phases III and IV have been obtained by application of moderate pressures above 30 MPa, where phase IV appears exclusively in deuterated <b>cyclohexane</b> (note that application of pressure increases the values of all transition temperatures).|$|E
