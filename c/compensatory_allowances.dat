However, pastoralism in the EU is mostly associated with mountainous ecosystems areas which exist in southern {{as well as in}} northern Europe, where mobile livestock rearing is also practiced outside mountainous environments. LFAs benefit from different forms of <b>compensatory</b> <b>allowances,</b> i.e. the LFA payments - now called Natural Handicap Payments, and from a number of payments for structural adjustment.

However, although Regional Development Organisations were set up in 1969, there has not been a clearly articulated strategy for regional policy. The only clear semblance of a regional policy which can be identified is the existence of measures such as regionally differentiated industrial grants, devised in an attempt to influence the spatial dispersion of mobile investment, and the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Allowance</b> Scheme (“headage” payments) in the case of agriculture which is targeted towards the so-called disadvantaged areas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} finding {{solutions}} {{for improving the}} economic activities in Romania’s undeveloped areas, which still represent {{a major problem for}} this country’s economy. During 1999 and 2009, these areas were considered tax havens, due to some facilities accorded by the Government and the EU (headage compensatory allowances*, tax deductions, non-refundable funds). Many had the opportunity to invest in those regions, but no positive effect was to be seen. Tulcea County (Danube Delta area), coal mine regions, rural areas and the North-East area (Suceava and Botosani county) are considered to be Romania’s less favoured areas. * The objective of these schemes is to provide a reasonable level of income for farmers where natural production conditions are least favourable so as to conserve the countryside by the prevention of further depopulation of rural areas. <b>Compensatory</b> <b>allowances</b> are payable to farmers for the keeping of cattle, sheep and goats.

Policy {{reform and}} the {{sustainability}} of farming in the uplands of the United Kingdom: conflicts between environment and social support. Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning, 3 (1), 43 - 63 The European Union's support for farming in'less favoured areas' (LFAs) is currently implemented in the United Kingdom through headage payments for cattle and sheep, although reforms to the system are under way. These payments have caused environmental concern, since, although formally social in nature, they are implicated in processes of agricultural intensification and management practices that reduce ecosystem integrity and landscape interest. In this paper, we examine {{the extent to which}} enhancement of the policy mix could take such concerns into account. Initially, we review the evidence of environmental change, also taking into account afforestation and increasing recreational demands on the hills and uplands. An analysis of the environmental perspective is interwoven with current economic, cultural and social difficulties, based on summaries of farmer attitudes drawn from a range of inquiries. We then examine options proposed for change, particularly the conversion of the Hill Livestock <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Allowances</b> headage payments to an area-based compensation, and greater cross-compliance with environmental preconditions. We conclude that scope exists for improved integration of social support for farming with measures to conserve and enhance the environment in hill and upland areas. However, more coherent policies that encompass marketing to pro-ecological, pro-social consumers, education and research, community and infrastructure could strike a more effective balance in attaining objectives for farming and society as a whole, by according a pivotal role to organic farming as a standard for low-input agriculture.

40|$|The Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Directive (75 / 268) {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1975, was the first common European instrument of regional agricultural structural policy. LFAs are areas where agriculture is hampered by permanent natural handicaps. The major objectives were to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level and preserving scenic landscapes and environmentally valuable habitats. In the Netherlands, the LFA measure is used as an additional payment, to compensate farmers for negative economic effects due to the conservation of these natural handicaps. It was not implemented as a stand alone policy, but is linked to measures aiming at active nature and landscape conservation management. In this paper, the effects will be examined of the regulations aiming at the conservation of natural handicaps on farm businesses within LFAs, when comparing them to farm businesses outside LFAs, where these regulations and handicaps do not exist. The main data source that was used is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Reference groups of farms were compiled {{with the use of}} the simple and multiple imputation approach in Stars (Statistics for Regional Studies). Both analyses were tested with the use of a parametric and a nonparametric test. When comparing the results of both analyses, it can be concluded that there is no evidence that there is a statistical difference in family farm income corrected for and not corrected for LFA payment between the LFA farm businesses and the reference groups. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the size of the <b>compensatory</b> <b>allowances</b> is small and there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on the family farm income of LFA farm businesses. The main purpose of the Dutch LFA policy is to compensate farm businesses for negative economic effects due to the conservation of natural handicaps. Although this may be true for some individual farms, based on the methods used in this paper, it appears not to be the case for the collectivity of LFA premium beneficiaries as a whole.

40|$|Two new {{enforcement}} instruments As of January 2009, Dutch municipalities {{can make}} use of two new instruments for out-of-court settlements of public order violations: the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’ and the ‘bestuurlijke boete overlast’. These instruments give local law enforcers the authority to issue an penalty for minor punishable offences such as stray dogs, dog droppings, household waste dumps or violation of other local bylaws. In {{the case of the}} ‘bestuurlijke boete’ the municipality is responsible for the administrative process. In the case of the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’, the municipality sends the written charge (‘proces-verbaal’) to the Central Fine Collection Agency (‘Centraal Justitieel Incassobureau or CJIB) after which the CJIB sends a copy of the charge with a giro payment slip to the accused. If the accused refuses to pay the penalty, the case is submitted to the public prosecutor for further judgement. After that, the case can be brought to court. If the fine is paid, the case will not be evaluated by the public prosecutor. Evaluation Three years after the introduction of both instruments, this evaluation has been conducted. To what extent have both instruments been implemented by municipalities? What are the results of the instruments and of the financial <b>compensatory</b> <b>allowance</b> scheme? To answer these questions, DSP-groep has conducted research from November 2011 to April 2012 for the Scientific Research and Documentation Center (WODC) of the Ministry of Security and Justice. The legal framework and the legal and political reasoning resulting in the introduction of both instruments has been studied by Prof. Mr. Dr. Arthur Hartmann of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. DSP-groep conducted the rest of the research: a survey among Dutch municipalities in which 301 municipalities participated (72 % response), in-depth interviews with 23 representatives of six municipalities and representatives of the CJIB, the Central Processing Unit of the Public Prosecution Service (CVOM) and the Ministries of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, DSP-groep has performed a quantitative analysis on a database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ issued between early 2009 and February 2012 (over 50. 000 cases). The CVOM has analysed all cases that have been evaluated by the Public Prosecution Service and cantonal judges. An independent committee has supervised the progress and quality of the research. The survey among Dutch municiplaities is part of this dataset. The in-depth interviews, and the database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ are not available...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{payments}} are recurring non-market transfers to farmers {{whether they are}} production related or not. There are three main types: (a) <b>compensatory</b> <b>allowances</b> (headage), (b) premia and (c) agri-environmental payments. In 1998 total payments amounted to £ 967. 3 million, up from £ 158. 4 million in 1992. The objectives {{of this study were}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these payments in maintaining farm units, their implications for farm efficiency and competitiveness and their impact on sustaining viable farm units and rural areas. Data from the National Farm Survey shows the average level of payment was £ 6, 670 in 1997 but varied substantially by farm size. For instance, farms over 100 ha on average received £ 28, 207 in contrast with £ 3, 305 for farms between 10 and 20 ha. Similarly, the distribution of payments by different farm systems shows considerable variation with tillage farmers receiving £ 15, 760 and cattle farms receiving less than £ 6, 000. The most significant feature, however, is the extent of the dependency of farm incomes on direct payments. For instance, on tillage and drystock farms these payments represented close to, or even exceeded the family farm income earned. This means that the income from sales are just about sufficient to cover the costs of production; the cheque in the post being the farm income. Without direct payments large segments of the farm population would operate at a loss; a situation which obviously could not be sustained. The impact of direct payments on farm efficiency and competitiveness is not so clear cut. Analysis of 1996 NFS data shows that the response on cattle farms to increased levels of direct payments was to reduce farm output. However, in terms of farm practice the dominant response was to increase stock numbers and farm inputs, such as feed and fertiliser. This latter response can be taken as adjustments to ensure sufficient stock numbers to maximise the level of payments and not necessarily a contradiction of reduced output responses. For instance the dominant anticipated response to a decoupled payment system is a reduction in farm inputs and stock numbers, a response associated with the more progressive sector of farmers. Notwithstanding the present level of these payments it is clear that the viability of farm units on most small to medium-sized drystock farms can not be assured in a farm context only. Increasingly farmers and their spouses are opting for off-farm employment to supplement their household incomes and to sustain the viability of the family farm unit. Ultimately the optimum use of family labour which is marginal or surplus to farm activities, is deployment off the farm; this clearly has a positive influence on the viability of rural areas.

40|$|The EU's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is a {{regional}} cap-and-trade {{program in a}} world with no binding international climate agreement. This climate regulation may induce a relocation of production away from Europe, with potentially negative consequences for the European economy. This relocation could lead to carbon leakage, i. e. a shift of greenhouse gas emissions from Europe into regions with less stringent climate policy. In response, installations in sectors deemed to be vulnerable receive <b>compensatory</b> free emissions <b>allowances.</b> The European Commission compiles a carbon leakage list of vulnerable sectors. The current mechanism distinguishes two levels of leakage risk. The criteria used lead {{to the majority of}} European industry regulated under the EU ETS benefiting from the additional compensation. Whereas industry representatives argue that the current level of compensation should be maintained if not increased, the evidence suggests that under the current framework overcompensation may occur. We describe the mechanism currently used to address the risk of carbon leakage in Europe, and for comparison outline the more differentiated system of assessing leakage risk used in the Californian cap-and-trade system. Applying such a more differentiated mechanism in the European context would lead to a re-distribution of compensation from sectors with an intermediate level of leakage risk to high-risk sectors...|$|R
