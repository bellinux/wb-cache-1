5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} <b>convergence</b> incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} <b>convergence.</b> One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with <b>convergence</b> due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without <b>convergence.</b> Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based <b>convergence</b> is expected. Pattern-based <b>convergence</b> is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based <b>convergence</b> is when the <b>convergence</b> is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

In particular, we revisit the results about when these <b>convergences</b> are topological by means of the use of pretopologies. This yields a presentation of the bornological <b>convergences</b> as a certain kind of hit-and-miss pretopologies. Furthermore, we characterize the precompactness and total boundedness of the natural quasi-uniformities associated to these <b>convergences.</b> We also obtain an extension of the classical result of Künzi and Ryser about the compactness of the topology generated by the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity to this framework...|$|R

5|$|The <b>convergence</b> of both {{series has}} very {{different}} properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive <b>convergence</b> radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact subset of the <b>convergence</b> interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform <b>convergence</b> (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the <b>convergence</b> is uniform).|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the <b>convergence</b> of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of <b>convergence</b> following the introduction of the euro after a phase of <b>convergence</b> in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price <b>convergence,</b> in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of <b>convergence</b> may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
