Two experiments examined this issue by having subjects construct a set of warning signs from <b>component</b> <b>sections.</b> In Experiment 1, participants manipulated <b>component</b> <b>sections</b> and assembled them onto a metal plate (of limited size). In Experiment 2, subjects worked with a technician to produce the signs on a computer. The relative importance of the individual components was determined by examining (1) use vs. omission rates, (2) size, and (3) order. The results show that few subjects used all the components in their warnings. Participants enlarged certain statements (Experiment 1) or added pictorials (Experiment 2) which necessitated the omission of other, presumably less-important, elements. The order of sign components was consistent only for signal words, which were placed generally at the top. The results suggest that, for certain hazards, the overall quality of information conveyed by a sign might be improved by eliminating or making smaller less important information, while simultaneously increasing the size of more relevant verbal information (or adding pictorials) ...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{propagation}} in {{an acoustic}} waveguide is examined using a hybrid numerical technique. Here, the waveguide {{is assumed to}} be infinite in length with an arbitrary but uniform crosssection. Placed centrally within the guide is a short <b>component</b> <b>section</b> with an irregular, nonuniform, shape. The hybrid method utilises a wave based modal solution for a uniform section of the guide and, using either a mode matching or point collocation approach, matches this to a standard finite element based solution for the <b>component</b> <b>section.</b> Thus, one needs only to generate a transverse finite element mesh in uniform sections of the waveguide and this significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required. Moreover, utilising a wave based solution removes the need to numerically enforce a non-reflecting boundary condition at infinity using a necessarily finite mesh, which is often encountered in studies that use only the standard finite element method. Accordingly, the component transmission loss may readily be computed and predictions are presented here for three examples: an expansion chamber, a converging-diverging duct and a circular cylinder. Good agreement with analytic models is observed, and transmission loss predictions are also presented for multi-mode incident and transmitted sound fields. 2 Kirby, JASA I...|$|R

30|$|A {{key factor}} for {{assessing}} the suitability of different evacuation models for the simulation of tall building evacuations is their ability to represent different egress components and the evacuee interaction with them. According to the discussion in Egress <b>components</b> <b>section,</b> models {{should be able to}} simulate both horizontal and vertical egress components if they are to represent the range of viable procedures employed. In this context, it is important to assess if models are able to simulate emergency elevators. The specific need for elevator modelling is caused by many factors, such as possible long travel distances involved in high-rise building evacuations. In fact, long distances make the use of elevators more likely which then in turn requires elevator modelling capabilities to assess egress procedures which employ them. The complex decision making process {{associated with the use of}} elevators in the case of multiple egress components available should also be addressed by the models.|$|E
