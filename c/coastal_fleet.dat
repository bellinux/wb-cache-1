5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} Yemen, the Ayyubids {{developed}} a <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet,</b> al-asakir al-bahriyya, which they used to guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E

25|$|Skirmishes and {{landings}} {{continued in}} the Finnish archipelago even later in the autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet</b> defeated its Russian adversaries {{at the battle of}} Grönvikssund, forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade Åland, and making them concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes landed again, this time at Lokalax, while the <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet</b> covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the battle of Palva Sund on 18 September. The troops landed were forced with withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but were landed in Finland again on 26 September. However, only a portion of the troops intended for the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, owing to bad weather, and the landing resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the Swedish defeat. A {{successful}} Russian blockade at Porkala prevented two archipelago frigates, roughly twenty galleys, and several gun sloops and yawls from reaching Svensksund in August 1789. Ehrensvärd's preparations for defense were hampered by King Gustav III's opposition to his plan. Ehrensvärd's decision not to blockade the narrow between Tiutine and Koiromsari due to his belief {{that it was too}} shallow to navigate was a crucial error; and delayed construction of obstacles in the straits opening towards Frederikshamn made it possible for the Russians to clear them quickly. Inadequate sounding of the Swede's selected battleground caused several Swedish ships to run aground during the battle. The Swedes might have been victorious at Svensksund in 1789 had the king allowed Ehrensvärd to withdraw to Svartholm after defeating Balle's squadron as Ehrensvärd had planned. King Gustav III was aware his fleet was running low on ammunition when he gave the order to fight against the main force of the Russian <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Swedish <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet</b> {{had been}} unable to sail for Sweden for the winter and had to be fitted out in Finland.

The Swedish <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet</b> was able to sail from Sveaborg in late May and moved to the vicinity of Frederikshamn. However, after Hangö had been fortified, the Russians had moved in to blockade the coastal sea route at Porkala on 10 June. This effectively split the Swedish <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet,</b> as reinforcements from Sweden were unable to join with the main body, putting the <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet</b> at a severe disadvantage against the Russian <b>coastal</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. The {{fundamental}} externality of {{a common}} property, that is considered a fishery, was introduced by Hardin (1968). One the ideas presented by Hardin: the landings that one fisherman obtains depend on the mortality rate applied by him and by the on the available biomass which depends on the total exploitation rate. Here we present a case study where the exploitation of the sea bass by many professional and recreational fishermen is analysed. The sea bass is a natural resource of economic importance exploited by professional fishermen since about thirty years. The sea bass is currently the fourth specie in value landed by the professional fishermen in France. This specie is captured with the line, the net and the trawl by more than 2 500 professional fishermen and more than 700 000 recreational fishermen. The economic problem results from the reciprocity of the negative externalities. The inshore and <b>coastal</b> <b>fleets</b> predominately target sea bass stocks and the total of the catches are not important. The inshore and <b>coastal</b> <b>fleets</b> are financially dependent on the sea bass. Other fleets catch the sea bass in small quantities {{but this is a}} accessory specie. The stock externality problem in the international context (France, Ireland, United Kingdom) may be very difficult to solve. Here, externalities can be resolved by agreement between the different fleets involved...|$|R
