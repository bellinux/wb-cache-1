500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trees have}} now {{grown up on}} the once bare hillside. The windows {{at the front of}} the house look over a garden where King’s sculptures sit among the eucalypts and shrubs. Inside, the house is full of books and art works: small sculptures, paintings, prints, postcards, ceramics, {{aboriginal}} artefacts and bark paintings, cover every available surface. King said: “Robin Boyd used to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and say ‘This house should look awful, but it doesn't.’” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{most notorious}} matchups {{of the era}} took place in 1993, 1995, and 1996, in which Ohio State entered the game each year undefeated. The Buckeyes had a 9–0–1 record heading into the 1993 game and were looking to claim an {{outright}} Big Ten title against a Michigan team that had already lost four times. Michigan receiver Mercury Hayes and running backs Jon Ritchie, Che Foster, and Ed Davis each scored a touchdown as the Wolverines shocked the Buckeyes, 28–0. After the game, Cooper said: [...] "This {{is one of the}} most embarrassing games I've ever been involved with." [...] "They outplayed us on offense, on defense, and in the kicking game. If you'd told me we would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and get beat 28–0, I'd have probably stayed home." ...|$|E
