40|$|The paper {{describes}} how high energy crashworthiness {{with respect to}} ship collisions of a jacket can be predicted through explicit finite element analyses. The classical issue of the material models is discussed. In addition the topics of global jacket dynamics and the definition of failure are discussed. The structural arrangement of the jacket in relation to <b>colliding</b> <b>ship</b> shapes is touched upon. The paper starts with a brief discussion on ship impact energy probability distributions. Finally some recommendations are given for further research. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E
40|$|Severe ship {{accidents}} and {{the probability of}} radioactive material release from spent reactor fuel casks were investigated previously. Other forms of RAM, e. g., plutonium oxide powder, may be shipped in large numbers of packagings rather than in one to a few casks. These smaller, more numerous packagings are typically placed in ISO containers for ease of handling, and several ISO containers may be placed in one of several holds of a cargo ship. In such cases, {{the size of a}} radioactive release resulting from a severe collision with another ship is determined not by the likelihood of compromising a single, robust package but by the probability that a certain fraction of 10 `s or 100 `s of individual packagings is compromised. The previous analysis involved a statistical estimation of the frequency of accidents which would result in damage to a cask located in one of seven cargo holds in a collision with another ship. The results were obtained in the form of probabilities (frequencies) of accidents of increasing severity and of release fractions for each level of severity. This paper describes an extension of the same general method in which the multiple packages are assumed to be compacted by an intruding ship`s bow until there is no free space in the hold. At such a point, the remaining energy of the <b>colliding</b> <b>ship</b> is assumed to be dissipated by progressively crushing the RAM packagings and the probability of a particular fraction of package failures is estimated by adaptation of the statistical method used previously. The parameters of a common, well characterized packaging, the 6 M with 2 R inner containment vessel, were employed as an illustrative example of this analysis method. However, the method is readily applicable to other packagings for which crush strengths have been measured or can be estimated with satisfactory confidence...|$|E

This paper introduces a new type of super-element for considering properly the case of inclined plating.

The proposed formula is then validated by numerical simulations on individual components. In the second part of the study, we consider the example of a <b>collided</b> <b>ship</b> having inclined plating elements.

40|$|The thesis studies ship {{collisions}} computationally and experimentally {{on large}} and model scales. On {{the basis of}} the experimental observations a 3 D simulation model is proposed that couples the motions of the ships to the contact force, and considers all the major hydromechanical forces that act on <b>colliding</b> <b>ships.</b> Additionally, the effects of sloshing and the dynamic bending of the hull girder are investigated and implemented into the simulation model. Large-scale experiments were analysed {{in order to get a}} deeper insight into the collision dynamics. On {{the basis of the}} large-scale experiments a model-scale test setup is designed using the Froude's scaling law. There, the emphasis was laid on the external dynamics and the structural response, properly scaled from the large-scale test, was modelled using homogeneous foam in the side structure of the struck ship model. It is shown that the model-scale experiments illustrated the large-scale tests both qualitatively and quantitatively. A wide range of symmetric, both with and without sloshing, and non-symmetric collision scenarios are studied on a model scale. The experimental findings are exploited in the development of a coupled collision simulation model. The model is formulated in three-dimensional space, and the contact force between the <b>colliding</b> <b>ships</b> considers both the normal and frictional components. A discrete mechanical model for sloshing is implemented into this time-domain model. This linear sloshing model describes the fluid in partially filled tanks with a single rigid mass and with a number of oscillating mass elements that interact with the ship structure through springs and dampers. The dynamic bending of the ship hull girder is included by modelling it as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. Both the experiments and the simulations emphasised the importance of the coupling between the motions and the contact force. It was especially obvious in the case of non-symmetric collisions and in the experiments with sloshing. The penetration paths calculated with the developed time-domain simulation model agreed well with those from the experiments. The total deformation energy was predicted with a deviation of about 10 %. The hydrodynamic radiation forces acting on <b>colliding</b> <b>ships</b> proved to have a strong influence on the energy distribution as at the end of the contact they accounted for up to 25 % of the total available energy. However, if the interest is in the maximum deformation, the approach with the hydrodynamic damping ignored yields an error of about 5 % in the deformation energy. The results of the large- and model-scale experiments with partially filled liquid tanks emphasised the importance of sloshing for collision dynamics. The structural deformation energy in the tests with sloshing was only about 70 %- 80 % of that in similar collision tests without sloshing. The simulation method with the linear sloshing model overestimated the deformation energy by up to 10 % for low filling levels of water, but in the case of medium filling levels the predictions agreed amazingly well...|$|R
