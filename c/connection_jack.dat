50|$|Ardour's {{recording}} {{abilities are}} limited by only the hardware it is run on; there are no built in limits in the software.

Monitoring options include monitoring with external hardware (a feature dependent on sound card support), monitoring with Ardour itself, and monitoring with <b>JACK</b> Audio <b>Connection</b> Kit (<b>JACK).</b> Monitoring with Ardour makes it possible to apply plug-in effects to the signal while it is recorded in real-time, although with some unavoidable, yet ideally unnoticeable, amount of latency. Using the audio server JACK, Ardour can record both from the audio card and JACK-compatible software concurrently.|$|R
