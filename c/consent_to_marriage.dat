25|$|Watta satta is {{a tribal}} custom in which brides are traded between two clans. In order to marry off a son, one {{must also have}} a {{daughter}} to marry off in return. If there is no sister to exchange {{in return for a}} son's spouse, a cousin, or a distant relative can also do. Even though Islamic law requires that both partners explicitly <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> women are often forced into marriages arranged by their fathers or tribal leaders. Watta satta is most common in rural parts of northwest and west Pakistan, and its tribal regions.|$|E
25|$|This {{commission}} {{resulted in}} a number of changes, implemented in 1993, which instituted provisions that (among other things) required a bride’s verbal <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> eliminated a father’s right to force his daughter to marry, and mandated the obtainment of a judge’s permission in cases of polygamy and a husband’s repudiation of his wife. Generally these reforms were considered superficial, but significant as an indicator that the Mudawana was not an unchangeable standard, as it had previously been perceived. Considering the religious origin of the laws, {{the fact that they had}} been amended at all was a significant step in demonstrating that they were subject to the process of ijtihad and not completely unchangeable.|$|E
