The system <b>clock</b> <b>timings</b> {{are derived from}} the video frequency, which simplifies glue logic and allows the Amiga 1000 {{to make do with}} a single crystal. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset DMA so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.|$|R

5000|$|Jitter : A {{measurement}} {{of the variation in}} period (periodic jitter) and absolute timing (random jitter) between measured <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> versus an ideal clock. Less jitter is generally better for sampling systems.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately, in many cases, spatial clock skew remains fairly {{constant}} from {{cycle to}} cycle, {{so that the}} rest of the total <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> uncertainty can be well approximated by a single common clock jitter value.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a clock schedule algorithm {{to obtain a}} clock schedule that achieves a shorter clock period {{and that can be}} realized by a light clock tree. A shorter clock period can be achieved by controlling the <b>clock</b> input <b>timing</b> of each register, but the required wire length and power consumption of a clock tree tends to be large if <b>clock</b> input <b>timings</b> are determined without considering the locations of registers. To overcome the drawback, our algorithm constructs a cluster that consists of registers with the same <b>clock</b> input <b>timing</b> located in a close area. In our algorithm, first registers are partitioned into clusters by their locations, and clusters are modified to improve the clock period while maintaining the radius of each cluster small. In our experiments for an industrial data of 888 registers, the clock period achieved is 27 % shorter than that achieved by a zero-skew clock tree, and 1 % longer than the theoretical minimum. The computational time is about 24. 9 seconds and the wire length and power consumption of the clock tree is comparable to these of a zero skew tree. 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{regenerator}} includes circuitry {{to recover}} the <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> information, which is then used to determine when the output signal switches its state. This ensures that the recovered data from the threshold detector is adjusted to provide the correctly timed signal output.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in {{the usual}} case of sending and {{receiving}} registers at different locations, {{there is no clear}} way to separate the total <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> uncertainty into spatial skew and jitter. Thus some authors use the term clock skew to describe the sum of spatial clock skew and clock jitter. This of course means that the clock skew between two points varies from cycle to cycle, which is a complexity that is rarely mentioned. Many other authors use the term clock skew only for the spatial variation of clock times, and use the term clock jitter to represent the rest of the total <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> uncertainty. This of course means that the clock jitter must be different at each component, which again is rarely discussed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to clock skew due to static {{differences in the}} clock latency from the clock source to each clocked register, no clock signal is perfectly periodic, so that the clock period or clock cycle time varies even at a single component, and this variation is known as clock Jitter. At a particular point in a clock distribution network, jitter is the only contributor to the <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> uncertainty.|$|E

40|$|A Choleski {{method is}} {{described}} {{and used to}} solve linear systems of equations that arise in large scale structural analysis. The method uses a novel variable-band storage scheme and is structured to exploit fast local memory caches while minimizing data access delays between main memory and vector registers. Several parallel implementations of this method are described for the CRAY- 2 and CRAY Y-MP computers demonstrating the use of microtasking and autotasking directives. A portable parallel language, FORCE, is used for comparison with the microtasked and autotasked implementations. Results are presented comparing the matrix factorization times for three representative structural analysis problems from runs made in both dedicated and multi-user modes on both computers.

5000|$|Micro-PNT {{integrates}} {{a highly}} accurate master <b>timing</b> <b>clock</b> into an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) chip, {{making it a}} [...] "TIMU" [...] ("Timing & Inertial Measurement Unit") chip. So these TIMU chips for Micro-PNT have an integrated 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a 3-axis magnetometer. Together with the integrated highly accurate master <b>timing</b> <b>clock,</b> it simultaneously measures the tracked movement and combines that with timing from the synchronized clock. With sensor fusion, it does absolute position tracking, all without external transmitters or transceivers.|$|R
50|$|Deterministic jitter {{is a type}} of <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> jitter or {{data signal}} jitter that is {{predictable}} and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream (data-dependent jitter) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and intersymbol interference.|$|E
50|$|The BNC {{connector}} is {{used for}} composite video on commercial video devices. Consumer electronics devices with RCA connector jacks {{can be used with}} BNC-only commercial video equipment by inserting an adapter. BNC connectors were commonly used on 10base2 thin Ethernet network cables and network cards. BNC connections can also be found in recording studios. Digital recording equipment uses the connection for synchronization of various components via the transmission of word <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> signals.|$|E
50|$|As an approximation, it {{is often}} useful to discuss the total <b>clock</b> <b>timing</b> {{uncertainty}} between two registers as the sum of spatial clock skew (the spatial differences in clock latency from the clock source), and clock jitter (meaning the non-periodicity of the clock at a particular point in the network). Unfortunately, spatial clock skew varies in time from one cycle to the next due to local time-dependent variations in the power supply, local temperature, and noise coupling to other signals.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical model {{reduction}} is a long-standing technique used both to {{gain insight into}} model subprocesses and to reduce the computational costs of simulation and analysis. A reduced model must retain essential features of the full model, which, traditionally, have been the trajectories of certain state variables. For biological <b>clocks,</b> <b>timing,</b> or phase, characteristics must be preserved. A key performance criterion for a clock {{is the ability to}} adjust its phase correctly in response to external signals. We present a novel model reduction technique that removes components from a single-oscillator clock model and discover that four feedback loops are redundant with respect to its phase response behavior. Using a coupled multioscillator model of a circadian clock, we demonstrate that by preserving the phase response behavior of a single oscillator, we preserve timing behavior at the multioscillator level...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new clock tree {{synthesis}} method for semi-synchronous circuits. A clock tree obtained by the proposed method is a multi-level multi-way clock tree such that a clockinput timing of each register is a multiple of a predefined unit delay {{and the length of}} interconnection from a parent node to its child is upper bounded. The clock trees are constructed for several practical circuits. The size of each clock tree is comparable to a zero skew clock tree. In order to assure the practical quality, they are examined under the five delay conditions, which cover various environmental and manufacturing conditions. As a result, they are proved stable under each condition and improve the clock speed up to 17. 3 % against the zero skew clock trees.

50|$|Measurement of {{wow and flutter}} {{is carried}} out on audio tape machines, {{cassette}} recorders and players, and other analog recording and reproduction devices with rotary components (e.g. movie projectors, turntables (vinyl recording), etc.) This measurement quantifies the amount of 'frequency wobble' (caused by speed fluctuations) present in subjectively valid terms. Turntables tend to suffer mainly slow wow.
