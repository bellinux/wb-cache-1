40|$|This paper {{challenges}} {{three key}} contentions in current theory regarding {{the relationship between}} <b>corporate</b> trust and <b>corporate</b> reputation. The first contention being challenged is that <b>corporate</b> trust plays less of {{a critical role in}} the sustained success and survival of an organisation than <b>corporate</b> reputation does. The second contention challenged is that, when the role of <b>corporate</b> trust in relation to <b>corporate</b> reputation is recognised, it is regarded as an antecedent of <b>corporate</b> reputation. This latter contention suggests that much of the current understanding {{of the role of the}} <b>corporate</b> trust construct is superficial and that the use of and differentiation between the <b>corporate</b> trust and trustworthiness constructs in relation to <b>corporate</b> reputation are blurred and indistinct. The third contention this paper challenges relates to the more generally accepted antecedents of <b>corporate</b> reputation, where current theory either does not include <b>corporate</b> trustworthiness as an antecedent or where it incorrectly includes <b>corporate</b> trust (viz-à-viz trustworthiness) as an antecedent to <b>corporate</b> reputation. This paper introduces a conceptualisation of <b>corporate</b> trust, in relation to <b>corporate</b> reputation, within a broader framework of <b>corporate</b> sustainability. We propose a conceptual model illustrating the relationship between <b>corporate</b> trust and <b>corporate</b> reputation. Where trust is usually regarded as an attribute or antecedent of reputation, our model suggests an inverse direction to this relationship, namely that <b>corporate</b> trust is an outcome of <b>corporate</b> reputation.

25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as <b>corporates,</b> governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E
