50|$|In {{most areas}} of the United States, {{contractors}} who need temporary water may purchase permits to use hydrants. The permit will generally require a hydrant meter, a gate valve and sometimes a <b>clapper</b> <b>valve</b> (if not designed into the hydrant already) to prevent back-flow into the hydrant. Additionally, residents who wish to use the hydrant to fill their in-ground swimming pool are commonly permitted to do so, provided they pay for the water and agree to allow firefighters to draft from their pool {{in the case of}} an emergency.|$|E
50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the <b>clapper</b> <b>valve,</b> used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The <b>clapper</b> <b>valve</b> often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
5000|$|Aboiteau farming on {{reclaimed}} marshland is a labor-intensive {{method in}} which earthen dykes are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland. A wooden sluice or aboiteau (plural aboiteaux) is then {{built into the}} dyke, with a hinged door (<b>clapper</b> <b>valve)</b> that swings open at low tide to allow fresh water to drain from the farmland but swings shut at high tide to prevent salt water from inundating the fields. Aboiteau farming is intimately linked {{with the story of}} French Acadian colonization of the shores of Canada's Bay of Fundy in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the Kamouraska region of the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec, aboiteau diking of salt marshes was closely tied to the modernization of agriculture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.The Acadians constructed earthen dykes to isolate areas of salt marsh from repeated inundation by the tides.A rare original [...] "aboiteau" [...] is the jewel of the West Pubnico Acadian Museums' artifacts. In 1990, local residents found a couple of boards sticking out of an eroding beach on Double Island, West Pubnico. They returned to the site in 1996 to remove the aboiteau, to preserve and display it at the museum.|$|E
2500|$|In 1848, {{the first}} US patent for an air purifying {{respirator}} was granted to Lewis P. Haslett [...] for his 'Haslett's Lung Protector,' which filtered {{dust from the}} air using one-way <b>clapper</b> <b>valves</b> and a filter made of moistened wool or a similar porous substance. Following Haslett, {{a long string of}} patents were issued for air purifying devices, including patents for the use of cotton fibers as a filtering medium, for charcoal and lime absorption of poisonous vapors, and for improvements on the eyepiece and eyepiece assembly. Hutson Hurd patented a cup-shaped mask in 1879 which became widespread in industrial use, and Hurd's H.S. Cover Company was still in business in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Water is {{not present}} in the piping until the system operates; instead, the piping is filled with air at a {{pressure}} below the water supply pressure. To prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the piping, {{the design of the}} dry pipe valve (a specialized type of check valve) results in a greater force on top of the check <b>valve</b> <b>clapper</b> by the use of a larger <b>valve</b> <b>clapper</b> area exposed to the piping air pressure, as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area.|$|R
60|$|Then Jonas cut a small leather strap, and nailed {{one end of}} it {{down upon}} {{one side of the}} clapper, and the other end upon {{the other side of the}} clapper. He put one little carpet nail into each end of the strap. The strap, when it was nailed, passed {{directly}} across the <b>clapper</b> or <b>valve.</b> It was not drawn tight across, but it lay upon the clapper loosely. The ends were nailed tight, but the middle rested loosely upon the clapper.|$|R
50|$|The upper Pamet River {{is made up}} of a {{freshwater}} marsh. The marsh {{occupies the}} broad floor of the upper Pamet River valley. Originally, 12,000-13,000 years ago, this was the glacial outwash channel that drained water away from the glacier westward, northward and finally eastward into the Atlantic some distance from where Provincetown now lies. Sea level was then 300 to 400 ft lower than it is today. There was no Cape Cod Bay, and Stellwagen Bank and the Grand Banks were hills well above the ocean. The subsequent rise of the Atlantic Ocean, which continues to this day, nearly drowned the outer Cape, including the Pamet, which is now only four miles long, compared to 30 mi long thousands of years ago. This upper freshwater marsh dates from the middle 19th century, when, to promote agriculture, the saltwater tides were prevented from entering by means of a dike that traverses the valley where Route 6A (Truro Center Road) now passes. A one-way <b>clapper</b> <b>valve</b> permitted fresh water to leave at low tide. The result is the meandering, slow-flowing stream that flows from the Atlantic dunes at Ballston Beach west to the bay, with low, flat banks that lie just above the water table. The entire valley, fresh and salt, is underlain by a thick mat of peat derived from the original salt marshes. All plant species growing in this upper portion were brought in as seeds, mostly by birds and mammals. All are indigenous, and virtually none is tolerant of seawater.|$|E
40|$|Using an {{additional}} <b>valve</b> (i. e. <b>clapper</b> check <b>valves)</b> downstream the main closing valve, fast valve closing is possible without any cavitational hammer. Additionally a new passive safety system (ABS-Armatur) {{for the prevention}} of water hammer upstream the main closing valve is introduced. Upstream the closure valve, a brake line connects the transport liquid of the m ain pipe with a hydraulic brake system. In case of valve action (closing), the pressure upstream the valve increases rapidly causing a fast interruption of the closing process. With decreasing pressure the closing process may continue. By combination of both methods pressure up - as well as downstream the closing valve may be safely controlled...|$|R
