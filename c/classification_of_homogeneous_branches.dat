40|$|An inverse semigroup S is a semigroup {{in which}} every element has a unique inverse {{in the sense of}} semigroup theory, that is, if a ∈ S then there exists a unique b∈ S such that a = aba and b = bab. We say that an inverse semigroup S is a {{homogeneous}} (inverse) semigroup if any isomorphism between finitely generated (inverse) subsemigroups of S extends to an automorphism of S. In this paper, we consider both these concepts of homogeneity for inverse semigroups, and show when they are equivalent. We also obtain certain <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> inverse semigroups, in particular periodic commutative inverse semigroups. Our results extend both the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> semilattices and the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> certain classes <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> groups, in particular the homogeneous abelian groups and homogeneous finite groups.

40|$|Classifying the zero-temperature {{ground states}} of quantum field {{theories}} with finite charge density {{is a very}} interesting problem. Via holography, this problem is mapped to the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> extremal charged black brane geometries with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. In a recent paper [1], we proposed a Bianchi <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the extremal near-horizon geometries in five dimensions, in the case where they are homogeneous but, in general, anisotropic. Here, we extend our study in two directions: we show that Bianchi attractors can lead to new phases, and generalize the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> phases in a way suggested by holography. In the first direction, we show that hyperscaling violation can naturally be incorporated into the Bianchi horizons. We also find analytical examples of "striped" horizons. In the second direction, we propose a more complete <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> horizon geometries where the natural mathematics involves real four-algebras with three dimensional sub-algebras. This gives rise to a richer set of possible near-horizon geometries, where the holographic radial direction is non-trivially intertwined with field theory spatial coordinates. We find examples of several of the new types in systems consisting of reasonably simple matter sectors coupled to gravity, while arguing that others are forbidden by the Null Energy Condition. Extremal horizons in four dimensions governed by three-algebras or four-algebras are also discussed. Comment: 58 pages, 1 figure and 1 cartoon. v 2 : references adde...|$|R

We study homogeneous Einstein metrics for a class <b>of</b> compact <b>homogeneous</b> spaces, namely generalized flag manifolds G/H with second Betti number b_ 2 (G/H) = 1. There are 8 infinite families G/H corresponding to a classical simple Lie group G and 25 exceptional flag manifolds, which all have some common geometric features; for example they admit a unique invariant complex structure which gives rise to unique invariant Kähler [...] Einstein metric. The most typical examples are the compact isotropy irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces for which the Killing form is the unique homogeneous Einstein metric (which is Kähler). For non-isotropy irreducible spaces the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneous</b> Einstein metrics has been completed for 24 of the 26 cases. In this paper we construct the Einstein equation for the two unexamined cases, namely the flag manifolds _ 8 /(1) ×(4) ×(5) and _ 8 /(1) ×(2) ×(3) ×(5). In order to determine explicitly the Ricci tensors of an _ 8 -invariant metric we use a method based on the Riemannian submersions. For both spaces we classify all homogeneous Einstein metrics and thus we conclude that any flag manifold G/H with b_ 2 (M) = 1 admits {{a finite number of}} non-isometric non-Kähler invariant Einstein metrics.
