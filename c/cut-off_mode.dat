5000|$|Two {{significant}} {{design challenges}} for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation {{as short as}} possible. [...] "Dead time" [...] is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into <b>Cut-Off</b> <b>Mode</b> and both are [...] "off". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as [...] "shoot-through". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states {{as fast as possible}} to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in Linear Mode—the state between <b>Cut-Off</b> <b>Mode</b> and Saturation Mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} a growing {{importance}} of subthreshold conduction is that the supply voltage has continually scaled down, both to reduce the dynamic power consumption of integrated circuits (the power that is consumed when the transistor is switching from an on-state to an off-state, which depends on {{the square of the}} supply voltage), and to keep electric fields inside small devices low, to maintain device reliability. The amount of subthreshold conduction is set by the threshold voltage, which sits between ground and the supply voltage, and so has to be reduced along with the supply voltage. That reduction means less gate voltage swing below threshold to turn the device off, and as subthreshold conduction varies exponentially with gate voltage (see MOSFET: <b>Cut-off</b> <b>Mode),</b> it becomes more and more significant as MOSFETs shrink in size.|$|E

The main- and vernier-scale are calibrated by measuring large groups of fine spectra at different <b>cut-off</b> <b>mode</b> resonances in a small RI range, and the use of vernier-scale certainly reduces the RI measurement uncertainty resulted from the discrete cladding mode resonances.

40|$|We reanalyse the {{question}} whether the quantum Bogomolnyi bound is saturated in the two-dimensional supersymmetric kink and sine-Gordon models. Our starting point is the usual expression for the one-loop correction to the mass of a soliton in terms of sums over zero-point energies. To regulate these sums, most authors put the system in a box with suitable boundary conditions, and impose an ultraviolet cut-off. We distinguish between an energy <b>cut-off</b> and a <b>mode</b> number <b>cut-off,</b> and show that they lead to different results. We claim that only the <b>mode</b> <b>cut-off</b> yields correct results, and only if one considers exactly {{the same number of}} bosonic and fermionic modes in the total sum over bound-state and zero-point energies. To substantiate this claim, we show that in the sine-Gordon model only the <b>mode</b> <b>cut-off</b> yields a result for the quantum soliton mass that is consistent with the exact result for the spectrum as obtained by Dashen et al. from quantising the so-called breather solution. In the supersymmetric case, our conclusion is that contrary to previous claims the quantum Bogomolnyi bound is not saturated in any of the two-dimensional models considered.

40|$|A {{treatment}} of the modal decomposition of the pressure field in a combustor as determined by two Kulite pressure measurements is developed herein. It is applied to a Pratt & Whitney PW 4098 engine combustor over a range of operating conditions. For modes other than the plane wave the new part of the treatment {{is the assumption that}} there are distinct frequency bands in which the individual modes, including the plane wave mode, overlap such that if circumferential mode m and circumferential mode m- 1 are present than circumferential mode m 2 is not. Consequently, in the analysis used herein at frequencies above the first <b>cut-off</b> <b>mode</b> frequency, only pairs of circumferential modes are individually present at each frequency. Consequently, this is a restricted modal analysis. A new result is that the successful use of the same modal span frequencies over a range of operating conditions for this particular engine suggests that the temperature, T, and the velocity, v, of the flow at each operating condition are related by c(sup 2) -v(sup 2) = a constant where c is the speed of sound...|$|E
40|$|Stopping and {{accelerating}} at {{traffic lights}} {{is one of}} the main contributing factors to vehicular emissions in urban environments. The work in this paper demonstrates a generic guideline for minimizing CO 2 emissions at traffic lights. This was done using an adaptive control, which uses a cost function for optimization, rather than network-specific control parameters. A new version of the emission model PHEMlight was used, which added of a fuel <b>cut-off</b> <b>mode</b> during coasting and other improvements compared to the previous version. Using this model, it could be determined that the emission optimal ratio between delay time and stops for the cost function of an adaptive control should be 1 : 165 at 50 km/h. When the speed limit increases the ratio also increases with 1 : 296 for 70 km/h. However, it was also found that the optimal free flow travel speed was around 70 km/h. Therefore with long distances between intersections and a low amount of average stops, the maximum speed should be higher than 50 km/h for emission optimality. Application of the ratio for 50 km/h to the adaptive control algorithm ImFlow resulted in a CO 2 emission reduction of 6. 3 % compared to a vehicle actuated control...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{previous}} studies have proven that pneumatic hybridization of an internal combustion engine is a technically viable and cost-efficient alternative to electric hybridization. Because the heat transfer process remains a first order factor while the engine operates in a motored or pneumatic mode without combustion, an accurate instantaneous heat transfer model is {{required in order to}} predict the in-cylinder pressure. This study shows that the original Woschni model is not suitable for describing the shape of the measured instantaneous heat flux versus crank angle while the engine operates in a motored pneumatic mode, because of the extinction of tumble motion near Top Dead Center (TDC). A modified form of the Woschni model is therefore proposed here that better describes the instantaneous heat flux during compression and expansion strokes, applicable to pneumatic and motored with fuel <b>cut-off</b> <b>modes.</b> First, the new constant parameter model is identified from experimental measurements performed in various motored mode conditions. Next, the pneumatic supercharged mode without combustion (ignition not performed) is investigated with the new model using the same identification values as for the motored mode. This study shows that the modified model remains fully applicable to the supercharged mode, despite of a certainly modified in-cylinder aerodynamic structure created by the opening of the charging valve under a high pressure ratio...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{fluctuations}} of {{the electron}} density and of the magnetic field in the Earth's magnetosheath to identify the waves observed below the proton gyrofrequency. We consider two quiet magnetosheath crossings i. e. 2 days characterized by small-amplitude waves, for which the solar wind dynamic pressure was low. On 2 August 1978 the spacecraft were in the outer magnetosheath. We compare {{the properties of the}} observed narrow-band waves with those of the unstable linear wave modes calculated for an homogeneous plasma with Maxwellian electron and bi-Maxwellian (anisotropic) proton and alpha particle distributions. The Alfvén ion cyclotron (AIC) mode appears to be dominant in the data, but there are also density fluctuations nearly in phase with the magnetic fluctuations parallel to the magnetic field. Such a phase relation can be explained neither by the presence of a proton or helium AIC mode nor by the presence of a fast mode in a bi-Maxwellian plasma. We invoke the presence of the helium <b>cut-off</b> <b>mode</b> which is marginally stable in a bi-Maxwellian plasma with &#x 03 B 1; particles: the observed phase relation could be due to a hybrid mode (proton AIC+helium cut-off) generated by a non-Maxwellian or a non-gyrotropic part of the ion distribution functions in the upstream magnetosheath. On 2 September 1981 the properties of the fluctuations observed {{in the middle of the}} magnetosheath can be explained by pure AIC waves generated by protons which have reached a bi-Maxwellian equilibrium. For a given wave mode, the phase difference between BVert and the density is sensitive to the shape of the ion and electron distribution functions: it can be a diagnosis tool for natural and simulated plasmas...|$|E
40|$|The several {{phenomena}} {{involved in}} theoretical prediction of the far-field sound radiation attenuation from an acoustically lined duct have been studied.

This information is essential for the design of acoustic suppressors in engine ducts. With reasonable simplifying assumptions the single mode radiation pattern was shown to be reducible to a function of <b>mode</b> <b>cut-off</b> ratio only (modal indices removed). With modal cut-off ratio as the dominant variable, multimodal radiation patterns can be reduced to a simple explicit expression. This approximate expression provides excellent agreement with an exact calculation of the sound radiation pattern using equal acoustic power per mode.

The basic formulation for the upstream and downstream acoustic power based on the analytical theory of Smith [Discrete frequency sound generation in axial flow turbomachines, Reports and Memoranda no. 3709, Aeronautical Research Council, 1972] and its generalization to broadband noise due to Cheong et al. [High frequency formulation for the acoustic power spectrum due to cascade–turbulence interaction. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 119 (2006) 108 – 122]. The MAP has been expressed as the sum of cut-on acoustic modes, whose modal power {{is the product of}} three terms: a term that specifies the wavenumber distribution of mean square velocity, a sound power factor that specifies the efficiency of radiation, and an acoustic blade response function. The effect of these terms on the MAP is discussed in detail in this paper. The acoustic blade response functions are found to determine the modal lines of minimum sound power in mode-frequency maps of the MAP. The upstream sound power factor is less than the downstream power factor, which is generally large, especially away from the cut-off frequency. Both power factors are small for <b>modes</b> close to <b>cut-off.</b> <b>Modes</b> close to <b>cut-off,</b> therefore, do not contribute significantly to the radiated acoustic power in the downstream direction, even though the modal pressure amplitude for these modes is high since they are excited close to resonance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to develop an analytical model for the coupling of active noise control (ANC) piston-type actuators that are mounted flush to {{the inner and outer}} walls of an annular duct to the modes in the duct generated by the actuator motion. The analysis will be used to couple the ANC actuators to the modal analysis propagation computer program for the annular duct, to predict the effects of active suppression of fan-generated engine noise sources. This combined program will then be available to assist in the design or evaluation of ANC systems in fan engine annular exhaust ducts. An analysis has been developed to predict the modes generated in an annular duct due to the coupling of flush-mounted ring actuators on the inner and outer walls of the duct. The analysis has been combined with a previous analysis for the coupling of modes to a cylindrical duct in a FORTRAN computer program to perform the computations. The method includes the effects of uniform mean flow in the duct. The program can be used for design or evaluation purposes for active noise control hardware for turbofan engines. Predictions for some sample cases modeled after the geometry of the NASA Lewis ANC Fan indicate very efficient coupling in both the inlet and exhaust ducts for the m = 6 spinning mode at frequencies where only a single radial mode is cut-on. Radial mode content in higher order <b>cut-off</b> <b>modes</b> at the source plane and the required actuator displacement amplitude to achieve 110 dB SPL levels in the desired mode were predicted. Equivalent cases with and without flow were examined for the cylindrical and annular geometry, and little difference was found for a duct flow Mach number of 0. 1. The actuator ring coupling program will be adapted as a subroutine to the cylindrical duct modal analysis and the exhaust duct modal analysis. This will allow the fan source to be defined in terms of characteristic modes at the fan source plane and predict the propagation to the arbitrarily-located ANC source plane. The actuator velocities can then be determined to generate the anti-phase mode. The resulting combined fan source/ANC pressure can then be calculated at any desired wall sensor position. The actuator velocities can be determined manually or using a simulation of a control system feedback loop. This will provide a very useful ANC system design and evaluation tool...|$|R

The full numerical modelling and design of components for the testing of a novel, single cavity gyro-multiplier experiment has been documented. In addition, numerical simulations of a configuration featuring three distinct cavity sections have also been conducted. The introduction of an eight-fold azimuthal corrugation into {{the walls of a}} cylindrical cavity allows for the realisation of a single cavity gyro-multiplier arrangement, with generation of 2 nd harmonic, TE 2, 2, and 4 th harmonic, TE 4, 3, resonances, at frequencies of 37. 5 GHz and 75 GHz, respectively. The interaction region is of mean radius, 8 mm, with a corrugation depth, 0. 7 mm, and is 39 mm in length. The idealised electron beam utilised is of voltage, 60 kV, with current between 5 A and 10 A, confined in a magnetic field of ~ 0. 7 T. Separation of the two emission frequencies was intended {{through the use of a}} 6 mm length <b>cut-off</b> taper; however, <b>mode</b> conversion to two above <b>cut-off</b> <b>modes</b> has been numerically demonstrated. The power contained in the 4 th harmonic has been estimated at ~ 10 - 50 W. Extension of the output taper has proven to be sufficient to reduce the mode converted signals by an order of magnitude, while not impinging on the propagation of the 4 th harmonic signal. The design and simulation of a knife-edge electron gun and kicker system has also been performed, with the final beam predicted to have a velocity spread of ~ 19 %. In order to demonstrate the “cold” response of the interaction region to the 2 nd harmonic signal, the design, construction and testing of several additional components are also documented. Novel slotted wall mode converters, capable of generating TEm, 1 modes from a rectangular TE 1, 0 input signal, have demonstrated high spectral purity and large, ~ 10 % bandwidth. A set of TE 2, 1 launchers, of 3. 98 mm radius, operating between 37 - 41 GHz have demonstrated ~ 56 % conversion efficiency, while a similar set for the TE 4, 1 mode, of 3. 78 mm radius, demonstrated 20 % conversion efficiency, between 70 - 80 GHz. A set of ripple wall mode converters, of maximum radius, 8. 7 mm, featuring a 20 period, axial sinusoidal ripple, of depth 0. 30 mm, designed to convert the TE 2, 1 mode to a TE 2, 2, have also been demonstrated. These converters display ~ 20 MHz bandwidth, at ~ 38 GHz. Using these couplers demonstrated the corrugated interaction region dispersion was insensitive to the polarisation of incident quadrupole modes, in keeping with theory. By examining a gyro-multiplier setup with three distinct cavity sections, it has been demonstrated that by operating the first and third cavities at the fundamental harmonic, effective generation of a 4 th harmonic signal can be realised from a second cavity of radius slightly larger than that of the initial cavity. The interaction regions examined were of radius 0. 7 mm, 0. 783 mm, and 1. 5 mm, and of lengths 2. 4 mm, 2. 4 mm and 3. 6 mm, respectively. By using an idealised electron beam of voltage, 80 kV, beam current of 0. 7 A, and pitch factor of 1. 4, generation of the TE 1, 2 and TE 1, 3 modes at a fundamental frequency of 342. 5 GHz, and 4 th harmonic, polarised in the TE 4, 6 mode at a frequency of 1. 37 THz has been predicted, for a modest confining magnetic field of ~ 14. 15 T.
