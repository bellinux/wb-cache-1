The main goal aims at evaluating the efficiency and overall performance of the service, mainly with regard to users information needs and high level requirements. This project will also assess the fitnessfor-purpose of the C 3 S with a specific emphasis {{on the needs of}} European Union (EU) Policies and translate these recommendations into programmatic and technical requirements. The C 3 S Climate Data Records (CDS) include various Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) that are derived from space sensors, including from <b>Copernicus</b> <b>Sentinels</b> sensors. One module of the F 4 P platform focuses on the benchmarking of data sets and algorithms, in addition to radiative transfer models used towards understanding potential discrepancies between CDS records. Methods and preliminary results of the benchmark platform are presented in this contribution. JRC. D. 6 -Knowledge for Sustainable Development and Food Securit...|$|E
40|$|The {{world of}} Earth {{observation}} (EO) data is rapidly changing, driven by exponential advances in sensor and digital technologies. Recent decades {{have seen the}} development of extraordinary new ways of collecting, storing, manipulating, and transmitting data that are radically transforming the way we conduct and organize science. This convergence of technologies creates new challenges for EO scientists and data and software providers to fully exploit large amounts of multivariate data from diverse sources. At the same time, these technological trends also generate huge opportunities to better understand our planet and turn big data into new types of information services. This article briefly describes some {{of the elements of}} the European Space Agency’s (ESA) EO Open Science program, which aims to enable the digital transformation of the EO community and {{make the most of the}} large, complex, and diverse data delivered by the new generation of EO missions, such as the <b>Copernicus</b> <b>Sentinels...</b>|$|E

These components support on the discovery of marine wildlife migratory behaviours, some of which may be a direct consequence of the changing Met-Ocean resources and the globe climatic changes. In EO 4 wildlife, we specifically focus on the implementation of web-enabled advanced analytics web services which comply with OGC standards and make them accessible to a wide research community for investigating on trends of animal behaviour around specific marine regions of interest. Big data connectors and a catalogue service are being installed to enable access to <b>COPERNICUS</b> <b>sentinels</b> and ARGOS sat-ellite big data together with other in situ heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, da-ta mining services are being developed for knowledge extraction on species habi-tats and temporal behaviour trends.

Wind speed and wind flow is strongly influenced by land surface properties.

Earth observation data are used already in wind resource models to some extent. However, the new advances and especially the possibilities which open up through the <b>Copernicus</b> <b>Sentinel</b> satellites are not considered yet. Opportunities include seasonal mapping of land cover which will allow a precise quantification of vegetation cover which has a direct influence on heat fluxes. The use of newest DEMs like Tandem-X with a 12 m resolution allows detecting also small landscape feature like rows of hedges and trees. Further, elevation models derived by either photogrammetric approaches or airborne laser scanning can further refine the information.

40|$|The {{study of}} urban climate {{requires}} frequent and accurate monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), {{at the local}} scale. Since currently, no space-borne sensor provides frequent thermal infrared imagery at high spatial resolution, the scientific community has focused on synergistic methods for retrieving LST that can be suitable for urban studies. Synergistic methods that combine the spatial structure of visible and near-infrared observations with the more frequent, but low-resolution surface temperature patterns derived by thermal infrared imagery provide excellent means for obtaining frequent LST estimates at the local scale in cities. In this study, a new approach based on spatial-spectral unmixing techniques was developed for improving the spatial resolution of thermal infrared observations and the subsequent LST estimation. The method was applied to an urban area in Crete, Greece, for the time period of one year. The results were evaluated against independent high-resolution LST datasets and found to be very promising, with RMSE less than 2 K in all cases.
