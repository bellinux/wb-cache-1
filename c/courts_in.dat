5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle {{a large number of}} cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit <b>courts</b> <b>in</b> some parts of the world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high <b>courts</b> <b>in</b> collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High <b>courts</b> <b>in</b> India is 3 years.|$|E
