25|$|A tape {{dispenser}} holds {{a roll of}} tape and has a mechanism on one end to easily shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Clear {{tape dispenser}}s are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> usage and improve ergonomics. The first tape dispenser with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.|$|E

50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper punch tape to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> and was mounted on the printer. The length of the carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of paper. The looped carriage tape was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|E

50|$|Traffic <b>Control</b> Device <b>Tape</b> - {{this type}} of barrier tape, as its name implies is used to control traffic, whether foot traffic or vehicle traffic. Traffic <b>control</b> device <b>tapes</b> are used as {{temporary}} traffic signal to redirect traffic during parade or whenever a road is closed. These are usually brightly colored, either in solid orange or orange-white combination.|$|R
50|$|Sekharipuram Narayaniyer Seshadri (1937-1986) was an Indian control {{engineer}} {{and the head}} of the Reactor Control Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. He established the control systems for the Satellite Receiving Station at Arvi, near Pune and the Ooty Radio Telescope. Subsequent to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in June 1985, he conducted the examination of the cockpit voice recorder and air traffic <b>control</b> <b>tapes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 402 and 403 were {{primarily}} {{controlled by a}} removable control panel. Additional controls included a carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> and mechanical levers called hammersplits and hammerlocks, that controlled some printing functions. Both the [...] and [...] were considered smaller models of the prior model IBM 405.|$|E
50|$|Many {{printers}} supported ASA {{carriage control}} characters which provided a limited {{degree of control}} over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a paper carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.|$|E
50|$|Like most IBM {{printers}} of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded {{paper with}} perforated edges for tractor feeding. A carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> or, later, a buffer, under program control, specified form length and the form line where printing {{was to begin}} so that paper of various sizes could be used.|$|E

50|$|When {{recorded}} to tape, DVCPRO uses wider {{track pitch}} - 18 μm vs. 10 μm of baseline DV, which reduces {{the chance of}} dropout errors during recording. Two extra longitudinal tracks provide support for audio cue and for timecode <b>control.</b> <b>Tape</b> is transported 80% faster compared to baseline DV, resulting in shorter recording time. Long Play mode is not available.|$|E

5000|$|In 1963 as well, Ampex {{introduced}} EDITEC, electronic video editing, allowing broadcast television editors frame-by-frame recording <b>control,</b> simplifying <b>tape</b> {{editing and}} the ability to make animation effects possible.

50|$|The line {{printers}} had 12 {{sensors to}} recognize 12 independent {{positions on the}} carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape.</b> Each position was called a channel, numbered from 1 to 12. If a hole was punched for a channel, then this hole marked a position that the printer could 'jump to' quickly by advancing until the hole was sensed by the corresponding channel sensor. This is called skip to channel number n.|$|E
50|$|A tape {{dispenser}} is {{an object that}} holds a roll of tape and has a mechanism at one end to shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Abundant and most common, clear {{tape dispenser}}s (like those used in an office or at home) are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> usage and improve ergonomics.|$|E
5000|$|Like its audio counterpart, moving tape {{past the}} read/write heads on nine-track digital {{required}} precise control, accomplished by a capstan motor. The capstan motor {{was designed for}} very smooth operation. Feedback to the control electronics was accomplished by a tachometer, usually an optical [...] "tone wheel", to <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> velocity. Starting and stopping the capstan was controlled by ramp generators to ensure a properly sized inter-record gap, the gap between blocks of information.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{terminals}} {{were connected}} to a single controller, and in turn to the 7090 via its Channel C input. Channel A and B were used to <b>control</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> drives, and Channel D controlled the 1301 disk.|$|R
50|$|Particularly iconic {{designs were}} the Mullard 5-10 and the Mullard 5-20, ten and twenty watt power amplifiers. Circuits for preamplifiers with tone <b>controls</b> and <b>tape</b> {{recorder}} amplifiers were also included, along with information regarding record and tape equalisation standards.|$|R
25|$|On 20 July 2011, retired SAA captain Clair Fichardt {{announced}} that he had made a statement in connection with the missing Jan Smuts air traffic <b>control</b> <b>tapes,</b> after he was persuaded to do so by Klatzow. Fichardt claimed that captain James Deale admitted to handing the tapes to captain Mickey Mitchell, who was chief pilot at the Johannesburg control centre {{on the night of the}} crash. Deale would further have stated that Gert van der Veer, head of SAA, and lawyer Ardie Malherbe were present during the transfer of the tapes. Earlier, during the TRC hearings, Klatzow had cross-examined Van der Veer, Mitchell and Vernon Nadel, the Operations Officer who was on duty.|$|R
50|$|A {{tension arm}} is a device used in {{magnetic}} tape recorders/reproducers {{to control the}} tension of the magnetic tape during machine operation. The recorders equipped with a tension arm can utilize {{more than one of}} them to <b>control</b> <b>tape</b> tension in different direction of winding or during different modes of tape operation. Tension arms can also be found on digital data recorders and other types of recorders/reproducers using continuous tape media such as magnetic digital tape, perforated paper tape, and analog magnetic tape.|$|E
50|$|The 24 {{channels}} of the input tape {{were divided into}} three fields of eight channels. Each accumulator, each set of switches, and the registers associated with the input, output, and arithmetic units were assigned a unique identifying index number. These numbers were represented in binary on the <b>control</b> <b>tape.</b> The first field was the binary index of {{the result of the}} operation and the second, the source datum for the operation. The third field was a code for the operation to be performed.|$|E
50|$|Mainframe {{printers}} {{originally had}} a Carriage <b>control</b> <b>tape,</b> with 12 channels (1 through 9 and A through C) {{that can be}} assigned a fixed position on the page by punching a hole, allowing the printer to skip a variable distance down the page to a fixed location. Newer printers such as the IBM 4248 have done away with the physical tape and use a Forms Control Buffer (FCB) containing {{an image of the}} tape data. Normally only channel 1 is preassigned, {{to the top of the}} page.|$|E
50|$|Older {{controls}} frequently had no port {{capable of}} receiving {{programs such as}} an RS232 or RS422 connector. In these cases, a device known as a Behind The Reader or BTR card was used. The connection between the <b>control's</b> <b>tape</b> reader and the internal processor {{was interrupted by a}} microprocessor based device which emulated the paper tape reader's signals, but which had a serial port connected to the DNC system. As far as the control was concerned, it was receiving from the paper tape unit as it always had; in fact it was the BTR or Reader Emulation card which was transmitting. A switch was frequently added to permit the paper tape reader {{to be used as a}} backup.|$|R
