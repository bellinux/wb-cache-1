The {{purpose of this study is}} to convert carboxylate salts (e. g. <b>calcium</b> acetate, <b>propionate,</b> and butyrate) into carboxylic acids (e. g., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids). The carboxylate salts can be produced from wastes, such as paper fines, municipal solid wastes, sewage sludge, and industrial biosludge. Using a proprietary technology owned by Texas A&M University the wastes are first treated with lime to enhance reactivity. Then they are converted to calcium carboxylate salts using a mixed culture of microorganisms derived from cattle rumen or anaerobic waste treatment facilities. The paper fines and municipal solid waste provide energy, whereas the industrial biosludge and sewage sludge provide nutrients for the microorganisms. The calcium carboxylate salts are concentrated and reacted with a low-molecular-weight tertiary amine and carbon dioxide to precipitate calcium carbonate. In a distillation column, the low-molecular-weight amine carboxylate reacts with a high-molecular-weight tertiary amine allowing the low-molecular-weight amine to be recovered from the top of the column. The resulting high-molecular-weight amine carboxylate is converted to amine and carboxylic acid in a reactive distillation column. This project focuses on the conversion of the carboxylate salts produced via fermentation into their corresponding acids via reactive distillation. The primary objective is to determine the optimal operating conditions of the distillation. A secondary objective is to optimize the precipitation step in the recovery process...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Previous studies using tertiary amines to extract water from reagent-grade carboxylate salts (<b>calcium</b> acetate, <b>propionate,</b> and butyrate) have shown selectivity for water and not for the carboxylate salts. These results allow the design of an extraction system to concentrate fermentation broth from a mixed culture of acid-forming microorganisms. To design the extraction system, equilibrium data from amine and actual fermentation broth systems were obtained. These data are similar to the data found previously for reagent-grade pure components. The data were manipulated to obtain graphs for the Ponchon-Savarit procedure used to design multi-stage extractors. Different cases were studied in which the feed was varied. A 3. 8 wt% solution could be concentrated to 17. 5 wt% using five countercurrent stripping stages; however, the recovery of carboxylate salts was poor (68 wt%) with this design. To overcome this, a reflux stream and an enriching section were employed. The Janecke procedure was followed to determine the member of equilibrium stages for the skipping and the enriching sections and their operating conditions. For this case, eight stages (two enriching and six stripping) were required to concentrate the carboxylate salts from an initial concentration of 3. 8 up to 20 wt%. The salt recovery was 91 %, the amine:water ratio was 2. 5 : 1 and the reflux:feed ratio was 2. 4 : 1. This design gives good results and will be implemented in a pilot plant. To study the separation of the organic and aqueous phases, a bench-scale mixer/settler extraction tank was designed and constructed. This apparatus had three sections: a mixing section to blend the two phases, a coalescence section in which the amine and water phases coalesce, and a decanting section in which the liquids completely separate. Several experiments were made to determine the hydrodynamic properties of the mixer/settler. The experiments showed that the apparatus is suitable to perform liquid-liquid extraction. Independent experiments were made using a coalesced apparatus to better analyze what occurs in the coalescing section. A model to describe the hydrodynamic of the liquid mixture in the coalesced apparatus was applied to the system giving good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

Treatments consisted of a control ration of 40 % grain; 30 mg/kg of monensin in a diet with 40 % grain; 10 g/kg <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> in a diet with 30 % grain; and the combination of both additives in a diet with 30 % grain. The gas production was measured up to 72 h of incubation and all incubation procedures were repeated three times on days 1, 10, and 20. On incubation day 20, the volume and production of methane and minor gases were measured. There was an interaction between <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> and monensin for maximum gas production, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), carbon dioxide, and minor gases. Monensin reduced gas production on days 1 and 20, whereas <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> increased gas production (Vm) on day 1. The rate of gas production (s) was reduced by <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> on day 1 and by the combination of additives on day 10. Lag time was reduced by monensin on day 10; however, it declined linearly with the feeding time of the additives. Monensin had no effect on IVDMD (62. 29 vs. 62. 24 %), while <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> increased the IVDMD (60. 00 vs. 64. 53 %).

Bread starter was prepared from the culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the collection of lactic acid bacteria of Food Institute of Kaunas University of Technology). The quality of the sliced and non-sliced rye-wheat bread was evaluated. The efficiency of different concentrations of sorbic acid and <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> on the suppressing growth of microscopic fungi in rye-wheat bread was determined. Two ways of including preservatives into experimental samples were tested – 1) by spraying a preservative {{on the surface of}} bread and 2) by adding into the dough. It was determined that the maximum permissible level (2. 0 g/kg sample) of <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (added it into the dough) in the sliced rye-wheat bread reduced the number of microscopic fungi effectively and the influence of small and average quantities of <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (0. 5 and 1. 0 g/kg sample) was not effective. The addition of sorbic acid (0. 5 g/ 1000 g sample) resulted in the reduction of the number of microscopic fungi in the sliced rye-wheat bread more than by 100 times, in not sliced bread – more than by 10 times. Average and big amounts of sorbic acid (1. 0 and 2. 0 g/kg sample) inhibited the growth of spores of microscopic fungi effectively in the sliced and non-sliced rye-wheat bread irrespectively of the way of addition of the preservative.

The effect of potassium sorbate on growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds was studied {{in the presence of}} selected competing molds in yeast extract sucrose (YES) broth which were separated by a dialysis membrane (MWCO 12, 000). Growth of competing molds reduced growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds. The colonizing ability of aflatoxin producing molds in the presence of competing molds was studied on the surface of corn meal agar or corn kernels. Aspergillus flavus was more competitive on damaged corn kernels with 18 % moisture than on undamaged kernels with 26 % moisture. Aspergillus niger was the competing mold most effective in reducing growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds in YES broth with or without sorbate treatment. The presence of A. niger and sorbate had an additive effect in reducing aflatoxin production. A. niger was most competitive in YES broth containing 0. 25 % yeast extract and 20 % sucrose.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} combining a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp {{procedure of}} four sequential 2 -h periods and an isotope dilution method of [U- 13 C]glucose determined {{the effect of}} supplemental <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> on blood glucose metabolism during insulin and glucose infusions in adult sheep. They were fed lucerne hay cubes and commercial concentrate with and without supplementary <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (Prop and Cont diets, respectively) in a crossover design for each 21 -day period. At the preinfusion period, blood glucose turnover rate (GTR) was greater (P < 0. 05) for the Prop diet than for the Cont diet. Blood GTR, endogenous glucose production rate (EGPR) and the ratio of EGPR to blood GTR were greater (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 05, respectively) for the Prop diet than for the Cont diet. Blood GTR and glucose infusion rate (GIR) increased (P < 0. 001) and the ratio of EGPR to blood GTR was reduced (P < 0. 01) with increased insulin infusion rates. The maximal GIR tended to be (P < 0. 10) greater for the Prop diet than for the Cont diet but plasma insulin concentration at half maximal GIR did not differ between diets. It is suggested that in adult sheep, dietary propionate supplementation enhances insulin action on glucose metabolism, however, changes in measures of tissue responsiveness and sensitivity were not significant...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} the oral administration of propylene glycol and <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> on performance of dairy cows. Treatments were 10 l water (control), 10 l water+ 300 ml propylene glycol (GP) and 10 l water+ 500 g <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (CP). Animals were mainly of Holstein breeds and were fed and managed in a commercial setting. The cows were divided randomly into an experimental group, n= 24 (n= 12 with PG and n= 12 with CP) and a control group, n= 11. Cows received the assigned treatment within 10 hours of calving and 24 hours after calving. Health events were recorded during calving and for the first 21 days in milk (DIM). Health examinations were performed on cows that appeared not well. The cows were milked three times daily and milk production was recorded electronically. Milk solid content and somatic cell score were determinate from three consecutive milking weekly till 20 DIM and than monthly till 110 DIM. Retained placenta, hypocalcaemia, displaced abomasums, ketosis and metritis were low in treatment groups (with PG and CP). The cows receiving PG had 2. 8 Kg/day grater milk production than control group. The cows receiving CP had 1. 7 kg/day grater milk production than control group. Prophylactic administration of PG and CP drenches to Holstein cows may be justified by potentially higher milk yields and reduced health complications...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium {{application}} and solution pH on ready-to-eat (RTE) baby-leaf spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) texture and structure preservation was studied. Spinach leaves {{were treated with}} calcium chloride, calcium lactate and <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate,</b> at two different pH conditions (5 and 7), packaged and stored for 7 days at 5 C. After 24 h, the leaves crispness increased 49 and 29 % for leaves treated with calcium chloride and lactate at pH 5 and the elasticity increased 100 % after <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> treatment at pH 7. During spinach shelf-life, the tissue flexibility decreased (20 – 60 %) for all calcium treatments at pH 5 and 7 while tissue crispiness increased (7 – 40 %) only for calcium treatments under pH 7. The electrolyte leakage increased throughout storage and was higher for all calcium treated samples when compared with controls. The chlorophyll content slightly decreased (12 %) {{by the end of}} product shelf-life and did not differ according the calcium treatments. Total vitamin C content was lower in leaves treated with calcium chloride at pH 5 (31 %) and pH 7 (19 %) while the remaining treatments did not affect vitamin C content. The different calcium additives tested for potential texture quality maintenance did not provide the expected benefits on baby spinach leaves but increasing solution pH from 5 to 7 lead to an increased firmness by the end of shelf-life. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The use of gluconeogenic {{supplements}} for {{dairy cows}} {{during the transition}} period has produced contradictory responses in the literature, {{making it difficult to}} recommend them. The objective of this trial was to evaluate supplementation with propylene glycol (PG), <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (CP), and "Dairy Power Drench®" (DR) on the transitional period of Holstein cows. Parameters studied were variation of body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), milk production (MP), reproductive efficiency and nonesterified fatty acid concentration (NEFA). One hundred and sixty five animals from two commercial herds were used. Treatments consisted of: C- Control; DR- administration of "Dairy Power Drench®" (3 applications) during postpartum; CP- daily administration of <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate</b> (500 g); PG- daily administration of propylene glycol (500 mL). Variation sources studied were the effect of treatments and blocks as function of farm and parity. No interaction between time (weeks) and treatments, or treatment effects, were found for BCS. However, there was a quadratic effect of time. Body weight and its variation were not affected by treatment nor by the time × treatment interaction. However, a quadratic effect of time was observed. An interaction time × treatment was observed on MP, but possible differences within each week were not detected. Treatments also did not affect reproductive efficiency parameters. On average, the number of days to first detected postpartum estrus was 69. 5, with 2. 23 services per conception and 172. 6 days open. The mean concentration of nonesterified fatty acids was 376. 6 mmol L- 1 and no effect of the interaction time × treatment, or of treatment, was observed. However, a linear effect was observed with time, with a decrease of 48. 2 mmol L- 1 per week...|$|E

The {{results showed that the}} shelf time of CSB reached over 78  h when incorporating the complex of vinegar and <b>calcium</b> <b>propionate,</b> while it felt below 12  h when vitamin c and ethanol were used. Besides, it is notable that, adding complex spicy essential oil diluted by pure ethanol (0.3  μl/L) together with cold storage condition can prolong the shelf time of CSB significantly [25]. Moreover, the impact of sourdough (10, 20, 30 %) on quality and microbial shelf life of CSB was investigated. Results showed that the addition of sourdough (10, 20 and 30 %) decreased the pH of CSB to 4.5, 4.3, 4.0, and extended the microbial shelf life to 8, 30 and 40  days, respectively [111].|$|E
