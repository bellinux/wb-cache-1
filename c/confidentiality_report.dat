40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the role of}} penalties as providers of incentives to prevent medical errors and ensure that such incidents, once they occur, become common knowledge. It is shown that a scheme with two penalties (accountability and non-report) induces the first-best solution.

Alternative sanction systems, such as voluntary reporting and immunity, are found to have less desirable properties. An exception is confidentiality (anonymity) {{which turns out to}} be an optimal scheme. Finally, the examination of various penalty restrictions (scope and scale) shows that such barriers may promote both tougher and softer sanction schemes.

Methods: Qualitative semi- structured interviews with 14 general practi- tioners and hospital physicians in Norway. Ex- amination of transcribed verbatim interviews using qualitative content analysis. Results: The subjective burden of confidentiality is likely linked with factors such as perception of pro- fessional role, social support from colleagues, partners and friends; size of patient population, organizational factors and work environment, and the overlap between personal and profess- sional relationships.

40|$|School-based {{interventions}} {{for young people}} with emotional/mental health problems are often provided by external practitioners and their relationship with host schools is a key influence on implementation. Poor integration within school systems, schools’ tendency to define interventions around pupils’ behaviour and teachers’ control over access, may undermine therapeutic relationships. This study examines how one school-based intervention—Bounceback—addressed these challenges. Methods comprised interviews with programme staff, school staff and service users. Bounceback sought to develop therapeutic relationships through creating a safe, welcoming place and maximising pupils’ choice about how they engaged with it. To ensure Bounceback was delivered as intended, staff developed five conditions which schools were asked to meet: adhering to referral criteria, ensuring that attendance was voluntary, appropriate completion of referral forms, mechanisms for contacting pupils and private accommodation to maintain <b>confidentiality.</b> Pupils <b>reported</b> high levels of acceptability and described relationships of trust with Bounceback staff. Although pupils had choice about most aspects of Bounceback, teachers controlled access to it, partly in order to manage demand.

40|$|Background: Supporting the {{education}} of {{children and young people}} with complex emotional mental health difficulties requires schools to have knowledge of their needs. Exchanging information about less visible mental health difficulties is, however, known to be complex. Exploring the perceptions of young people experiencing problems can explicate some of this complexity and identify solutions. Yet their views are rarely given credence in this context. Methods: The findings were derived from a broader qualitative study exploring the school experiences of young people, aged 14 – 16 years, identified by CAMHS as having severe emotional difficulties. Their parents’ and teachers’ perceptions were also explored. Data were collected via semi structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Findings demonstrated that young people experiencing emotional difficulties need to feel safe about exchanging private information pertaining to their mental health. Teachers having a basic knowledge of mental health promoted their safety as this ensured <b>confidentiality.</b> Participants <b>reported</b> that CAMHS practitioners needed to be more proactive regarding the practicalities of exchanging information. Conclusions: Arguably, teachers need to have basic knowledge of mental health and schools need clearer mental health confidentiality guidance.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Immunization {{coverage}} {{is a major}} health indicator. In Israel, routine childhood immunizations are provided at community public well-baby clinics. Immunization monitoring is an important cornerstone of a national health policy; however data obtained through sampling carries the risk of under-representation of certain population strata, particularly high-risk groups. Despite high national average immunization coverage, specific sub-populations are under-immunized, as highlighted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Methods: Implementation of a national childhood immunization registry. Results: The mean national immunization coverage at age two years (2007 data) was: DTaP-IPV-Hib 4 (all 95 %), HBV 3 (99 %), MMR 1 (97 %), HAV 1 (93 %). These reports {{are based on a}} 17 % population-based sample in some districts and on cumulative reports in others. The new national immunization registry requires data completeness, protection of <b>confidentiality,</b> compulsory <b>reporting</b> by providers, and links to other computerized health records. It would provide individual immunization data from infancy to adulthood and be accessible to both providers and consumers. During 2008 the Ministry of Health in Israel launched a national immunization registry based on immunization reporting from well-baby clinics using a web-based computerized system. As of December 2010, 210 well-baby clinics are connected to the nascent registry, which includes the records of some 100, 000 children.
