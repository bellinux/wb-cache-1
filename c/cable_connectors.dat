2500|$|Bletchley Park's {{commanding}} officer Edward Travis acquired a £100,000 {{budget for the}} construction of Turing's machine, and the contract to build the bombes was awarded to the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) at Letchworth. BTM placed the project under the direction of Harold 'Doc' Keen. Each machine was about [...] wide, [...] tall, [...] deep and weighed about a ton. On the front of each bombe were 108 places where drums could be mounted. The drums were in three groups of 12 triplets. Each triplet, arranged vertically, corresponded to the three rotors of an Enigma scrambler. The bombe drums' input and output contacts went to <b>cable</b> <b>connectors,</b> allowing the bombe to be wired up according to the menu. The 'fast' drum rotated at a speed of 50.4 rpm in the first models and 120 rpm in later ones, when the time to set up and run through all 17,576 possible positions for one rotor order was about 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The Macintosh mouse {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{original}} Lisa version and is completely interchangeable. The case was a slightly darker brown than Lisa's beige coloring and it had less formal lines, with a thick chamfer around its edges to match the Macintosh case. Mechanically, the Lisa's steel ball {{was replaced by a}} rubber covered steel ball, but otherwise connected with the same DE-9 connectors, though updated with a square-shape and standard thumb screws. When the Macintosh Plus debuted in 1986, Apple had made minor revisions to the mouse mechanism and across all product lines, unified the <b>cable</b> <b>connectors</b> and used a more rounded shape. The following year, Apple once again unified its product lines by adopting a uniform [...] "Platinum" [...] gray color for all products. In 1987 this mouse had its final design change, updating both its color to Platinum with contrasting dark gray [...] "Smoke" [...] accents and minor mechanism changes.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the accident causes of mining flame-proof high voltage (F-HV) <b>cable</b> <b>connector,</b> {{the temperature and}} ampacity of LBG 1 - 200 / 6 high voltage <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> are analyzed. At first, the material properties and structure of connector are introduced from the aspects of electrical, insulation and thermal. Then the electromagnetic field and thermal field coupling model of <b>cable</b> <b>connector</b> are established by the finite element method. Finally, in the numerical examples, temperature distribution and ampacity change caused by power harmonics, dielectric loss and slight structure change are quantitatively plotted and analyzed.
