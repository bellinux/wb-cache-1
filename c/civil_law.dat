5|$|Canon law {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} <b>civil</b> <b>law.</b> In its own field it gives force to <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. Similarly, <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|Roger was consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154.

Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> into England, and did so under the patronage of Roger. He wrote a standard textbook on the <b>civil</b> <b>law,</b> the Liber pauperum, and was an important advisor for Roger.|$|E
5|$|He {{may already}} have been a Doctor of <b>Civil</b> <b>Law</b> by that point, because in the {{following}} year, on 22 November 1350, he is found as such acting as the Regent of Orléans presenting a candidate for licence. Having studied <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to canon law. By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law). This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from Pope Innocent VI another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. (doctor utriusque juris), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.|$|E
40|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>laws</b> and <b>civil</b> {{justice in}} early China have not {{received}} sufficient scholarly attention, because scholars tend to assume that laws in pre-modern China were merely criminal laws promulgated and enforced to maintain public order. This dissertation challenges that view by analyzing excavated evidence and reexamining transmitted evidence. Chapter One establishes the existence of <b>civil</b> <b>laws</b> in early China by examining non-criminal case reports preserved in the Juyan strips and by assessing the role of district bailiffs in handling civil disputes. Chapter Two further demonstrates the existence of <b>civil</b> <b>laws</b> and reveals the civil justice system by studying domestic statutes and how two cases of inheritance disputes preserved in the Comprehensive Discussion of Customs (Fengsu tongyi, comp. ca. 200) illustrate {{the application of the}}se statutes. Chapter Three examines two important civil legal concepts: zhi (a straight account of the facts) and mingfen (title and portion) to reveal the underlining notions that uniformly guided the application of the <b>civil</b> <b>laws.</b> Chapter Four, the concluding chapter, goes beyond the boundaries of <b>civil</b> <b>laws</b> to address larger issues, such as the legal ideal of reforming people's morals to reduce lawsuits, the relationship between rituals and laws, and the Classics as a source of legal authority in litigations. Overall, I conclude that <b>civil</b> <b>laws</b> and <b>civil</b> justice existed in early China; and that this distinctive body of <b>civil</b> <b>laws,</b> while not systematically codified, were substantial, sophisticated, and empire-wide in application and authority...|$|R
