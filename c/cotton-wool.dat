60|$|The {{researches}} of Schroeder and Dusch in 1854, and of Schroeder alone, in 1859, {{cleared up}} this point by experiments which are simply refinements upon those of Redi. A lump of <b>cotton-wool</b> is, physically speaking, {{a pile of}} many thicknesses of a very fine gauze, the fineness of the meshes of which depends upon {{the closeness of the}} compression of the wool. Now, Schroeder and Dusch found, that, in the case of all the putrefiable materials which they used (except milk and yolk of egg), an infusion boiled, and then allowed to come into contact with no air but such as had been filtered through <b>cotton-wool,</b> neither putrefied, nor fermented, nor developed living forms. It is hard to imagine what the fine sieve formed by the <b>cotton-wool</b> could have stopped except minute solid particles. Still the evidence was incomplete until it had been positively shown, first, that ordinary air does contain such particles; and, secondly, that filtration through <b>cotton-wool</b> arrests these particles and allows only physically pure air to pass. This demonstration has been furnished within the last year by the remarkable experiments of Professor Tyndall. It has been a common objection of Abiogenists that, if the doctrine of Biogeny is true, the air must be thick with germs; and they regard this as the height of absurdity. But nature occasionally is exceedingly unreasonable, and Professor Tyndall has proved that this particular absurdity may nevertheless be a reality. He has demonstrated that ordinary air is no better than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute solid particles; that these particles are almost wholly destructible by heat; and that they are strained off, and the air rendered optically pure, by its being passed through <b>cotton-wool.</b>|$|E
60|$|A speedy {{application}} of the hearth-rug quenched the conflagration, and when a minute burn had been enveloped in <b>cotton-wool,</b> like a gem, a coroner sat upon the pinafore and investigated the case.|$|E

6000|$|Quest {{took the}} box {{into his hands}} and removed the lid. It seemed half full of <b>cotton-wool.</b> On the top were a few lines of writing and beneath them the {{signature}} of the parted hands. He read the form out slowly: ...|$|E
6000|$|They did so, {{and shouted}} with merriment {{when the next}} {{despatch}} from Jill arrived. A pasteboard jumping-jack, with one leg done up in <b>cotton-wool</b> to preserve the likeness, and a great lump of molasses candy in a brown paper, with accompanying note:-- ...|$|E
60|$|They {{took him}} into the house, and a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb, {{and said he was}} not dead but half choked; so they wrapped him in <b>cotton-wool,</b> and warmed him and {{he opened his eyes and}} sneezed.|$|E
6000|$|Reluctance, shame, disgust, {{would have}} been visible on poor Bunter's countenance if the great part of {{it had not been}} swathed up in <b>cotton-wool</b> and bandages.

60|$|Our {{vessel was}} a {{beautiful}} ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted with <b>cotton-wool</b> and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.|$|E
60|$|Though every {{vestige of}} her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still had {{something}} of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had covered her to the throat with white <b>cotton-wool,</b> and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, Angela put her {{statement}} {{and the accompanying}} letter into a large envelope. Then she took the queer emerald ring off her finger, and, as there was nobody looking, she kissed it, and wrapped {{it up in a}} piece of <b>cotton-wool,</b> and stowed it away in the letter, and sealed it up. Next she addressed it, in her clear miniature handwriting, to ...|$|E
6000|$|He drew it {{from the}} zinc-well {{in which it was}} packed in moss and <b>cotton-wool,</b> and {{wondered}} what he should do with it. He could not leave such a thing about, nor would he take it away. Suddenly an idea struck him, and he repacked it in its case as carefully as he could in the original moss and <b>cotton-wool,</b> and then looked about for the sheet of tissue-paper that should complete the covering. He had destroyed it, and had to search for a substitute. In so doing his eye fell upon a long envelope on his dressing-table and he smiled. It contained his marriage licence, and he bethought him that it was a very fair substitute for tissue-paper, and quite as worthless. He extracted it, and, placing it over the flowers, closed up the box. Then he carefully directed it to [...] "Mrs. George Caresfoot, Abbey House," [...] and, ringing the bell, desired the boots to find a messenger to take it over.|$|E
60|$|Abbleway {{obtained}} {{leave of}} absence and added a journey to Fiume to his lifeâ€™s adventures. He left Vienna on a cold, cheerless day. The flower shops were full of spring blooms, and the weekly organs of illustrated humour were full of spring topics, but the skies were heavy with clouds that looked like <b>cotton-wool</b> that has been kept over long in a shop window.|$|E
6000|$|... "We went acrost to the 'Albion' to talk it over. There's several bars there, and {{the landlady}} always keeps <b>cotton-wool</b> in 'er ears, not 'aving {{been brought up}} to the public line.

6000|$|The second {{cupboard}} revealed (in {{the upper}} division of it) some really beautiful cameos--not mounted, but laid on <b>cotton-wool</b> in neat cardboard trays. In one corner, half hidden {{under one of}} the trays, there peeped out the whit e leaves of a little manuscript. I pounced on it eagerly, only to meet with a new disappointment: the manuscript proved to be a descriptive catalogue of the cameos--nothing more! ...|$|E
60|$|She had flushed crimson; {{her eyes}} filled but dried again almost at once. And, looking at her face, now gone very pale, and those lips {{tightened}} to a line, Betty stopped in her outburst of ejaculation. When they had wrapped the baby's arm in remedies and <b>cotton-wool,</b> Gyp went into her bedroom, and, throwing herself down on her bed, burst into a passion of weeping, smothering it deep in her pillow.|$|E
60|$|Dickory was so {{filled with}} pride that this fair being could wear his shoes, {{and that she was}} wearing them, that he could only mumble some stupid words about being so glad to serve her. And she, wise girl, said nothing about the {{quantities}} of soft <b>cotton-wool</b> which Dame Charter had been obliged to stuff into the toes before they would stay upon the small feet they covered.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the inside}} that's the worst, mother; perhaps {{if you put}} a bit of <b>cotton-wool</b> there and tie it round the back it will do; we can't go out with our hands all swaddled round like that. And now, please, {{directly}} you have done we want to go down again to see the fire. Just you go up to the road corner, mother. It's a grand sight, I can tell you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she hesitated}} no longer, but, taking the letter, {{slipped off the}} piece of twine, and drew its {{contents}} from the envelope. The first thing to fall out, wrapped in a little <b>cotton-wool,</b> was the ring. She looked at it, and recognized it as Arthur's engagement ring, the same that Lady Bellamy had taken with her. Then, putting aside the statement, she deliberately unfolded the letter, and read it.|$|E
60|$|Furthermore, it {{has been}} found that {{experiments}} made in the manner described above answer well with most infusions; but that if you fill the vessel with boiled milk, and then stop the neck with <b>cotton-wool,</b> you 'will' have infusoria. So that you see there were two experiments that brought you to one kind of conclusion, and three to another; which was a most unsatisfactory state of things to arrive at in a scientific inquiry.|$|E
60|$|The mole {{closed up}} the hole again which {{let in the}} light, and then escorted the ladies home. But Thumbelina could not sleep that night; so {{she got out of}} bed, and plaited a great big blanket of straw, and carried it off, and spread it over the dead bird, and piled upon it thistle-down as soft as <b>cotton-wool,</b> which she had found in the field-mouse's room, so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried.|$|E
60|$|His {{peculiar}} voice, as if {{filtered through}} <b>cotton-wool</b> was inaudible {{on the other}} side of the deck. Poor Flora, taken very much unawares, made an inarticulate murmur, shook her head vaguely, and glanced in the direction of the pacing Anthony who was not looking her way. It was no use glancing in that direction. Of young Powell, leaning against the mizzen-mast and facing his captain she could only see the shoulder and part of a blue serge back.|$|E
60|$|He {{had come}} to be almost morbidly on the {{look-out}} for evidence which might go to prove that this <b>cotton-wool</b> existence was stealing from the child the birthright of courage which was his from both his parents. Much often depends on little things, and, if Bill had replied in the affirmative to the question, it would probably have had the result of sending Kirk there and then raging through the house conducting a sort of War of Independence.|$|E
60|$|With {{a united}} effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there {{came from the}} inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. A body lay within, its head all wreathed in <b>cotton-wool,</b> which had been soaked in the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and {{disclosed}} the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a sitting position.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the hardest}} {{thing in the world}} to frighten a {{mongoose}}, because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoose family is 'Run and find out'; and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He looked at the <b>cotton-wool,</b> decided that it was not good to eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} his arm was again round me. I clung {{to him as}} to a rock, for of a truth I had never felt a grasp so steady and withal so gentle and kindly, as was his around my shoulders. I tried to murmur words of thanks, but again that wretched feeling of {{sickness}} and faintness overcame me, {{and for a second}} or two it seemed to me as if I were slipping into another world. The stranger's voice came to my ear, as it were through <b>cotton-wool.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} from these facts that the grains of chlorophyll, as they exist in living plants, cannot be attacked by the secretion; for these grains consist of protoplasm merely coloured by chlorophyll. My son Francis placed a thin slice of spinach leaf, moistened with saliva, on a leaf of Drosera, and other slices on damp <b>cotton-wool,</b> all exposed to the same temperature. After 19 hrs. the slice on the leaf of Drosera was bathed in much secretion from the inflected tentacles, and was now examined under the microscope. No perfect grains of chlorophyll could be distinguished; some were shrunken, of a yellowish-green colour, and collected {{in the middle of}} the cells; others were disintegrated and formed a yellowish mass, likewise {{in the middle of the}} cells. On the other hand, in the slices surrounded by damp <b>cotton-wool,</b> the grains of chlorophyll were green and as perfect as ever. My son also placed some slices in artificial gastric juice, and these were acted on in nearly the same manner as by the secretion. We have seen that bits of fresh cabbage and spinach leaves cause the tentacles to be inflected and the glands to pour forth much acid secretion; and there can be little doubt that it is the protoplasm forming the grains of chlorophyll, as well as that lining the walls of the cells, which excites the leaves.|$|E
60|$|Every season, however, {{sees the}} European tourist {{more and more}} pampered, and the {{difficulties}} and consequent pleasure and interest of his journey more and more curtailed and spoilt. In a few years' time, he will be packed in <b>cotton-wool</b> in his own back-parlour, labelled for the place {{he wants to go}} to, and unpacked and taken out when he gets there. The railway now carries him round Mount Ettal to Oberau, from which little village a tolerably easy road, as mountain roadways go, of about four or five English miles takes him up to the valley of the Ammer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Waacht een beeche," [...] said Jess, [...] "there is {{some water}} in that pool," [...] and telling John {{to pull up}} she sprang from the trap and led the man, who was half-blinded with blood, to the spring. Here she made him kneel down and bathed the wound, which {{was not a very}} deep one, till it stopped bleeding, and then, having first placed a pad of <b>cotton-wool,</b> some of which she {{happened}} to have in the cart, upon it, she bound her handkerchief tightly round his head. The man, brute as he was, appeared to be much touched at her kindness.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} other objects of delight and {{interest}} claiming his instant attention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks {{in the shape of}} snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come. How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with aromatic <b>cotton-wool,</b> and between the layers of <b>cotton-wool</b> were little brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to see and to handle. Less promising in appearance was a large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured pictures of birds. And such birds! In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures. And as he was admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation of his name came from the gooseberry garden without. She had grown suspicious at his long disappearance, and had leapt to the conclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the sheltering screen of the lilac bushes; she was now engaged in energetic and rather hopeless search for him among the artichokes and raspberry canes.|$|E
6000|$|In an hour {{entered the}} mysterious {{stranger}} with the haunting eyes. Helen {{was in the}} willow rocker, knitting a useless thing in <b>cotton-wool.</b> He ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat. Sitting {{across the table from}} her, he also poured out his narrative of love. And then he said: [...] "Helen, do you not remember me? I think I have seen it in your eyes. Can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years? I wronged you deeply--I was afraid to come back to you--but my love overpowered my reason. Can you, will you, forgive me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{did find}} a ladder, and {{fortunately}} it was long enough. Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were out when I arrived, possibly on the hunt for cheap photo frames and Japanese fans. I {{did not want to}} make a mess. I removed the house neatly into a dust-pan, and wiped the street clear of every trace of it. I had just put back the ladder when Mrs. Sparrow returned with a piece of pink <b>cotton-wool</b> in her mouth. That was her idea of a colour scheme: apple-blossom pink and Reckitt's blue side by side. She dropped her wool and sat on the waterspout, and tried to understand things.|$|E
60|$|In an hour, {{the train}} started. Every place was occupied. Ewart {{had spoken to}} his friends, as they arrived, and they had all taken places in the same compartment. The journey lasted forty hours, and Gregory {{admitted}} that the description Captain Ewart had given him, of the dust, {{was by no means}} exaggerated. He had brought, as had been suggested, a water skin and a porous earthenware bottle; together with a roll of <b>cotton-wool</b> to serve as a stopper to the latter, to keep out the dust. In a tightly fitting handbag he had an ample supply of food for three days. Along the opening of this he had pasted a strip of paper.|$|E
60|$|It remains yet in {{the order}} of logic, though not of history, to show that among these solid destructible {{particles}} there really do exist germs capable of giving rise to the development of living forms in suitable menstrua. This piece of work was done by M. Pasteur in those beautiful researches which will ever render his name famous; and which, in spite of all attacks upon them, appear to me now, as they did seven years ago, to be models of accurate experimentation and logical reasoning. He strained air through <b>cotton-wool,</b> and found, as Schroeder and Dusch had done, that it contained nothing competent to give rise to the development of life in fluids highly fitted for that purpose. But the important further links in the chain of evidence added by Pasteur are three. In the first place he subjected to microscopic examination the cottonwool which had served as strainer, and found that sundry bodies clearly recognisable as germs were among the solid particles strained off. Secondly, he proved that these germs were competent to give rise to living forms by simply sowing them in a solution fitted for their development. And, thirdly, he showed that the incapacity of air strained through <b>cotton-wool</b> to give rise to life was not due to any occult change effected in the constituents of the air by the wool, by proving that the <b>cotton-wool</b> might be dispensed with altogether, and perfectly free access left between the exterior air and that in the experimental flask. If the neck of the flask is drawn out into a tube and bent downwards; and if, after the contained fluid has been carefully boiled, the tube is heated sufficiently to destroy any germs which may be present in the air which enters as the fluid cools, the apparatus may be left to itself for any time and no life will appear in the fluid. The reason is plain. Although there is free communication between the atmosphere laden with germs and the germless air in the flask, contact between the two takes place only in the tube; and as the germs cannot fall upwards, and there are no currents, they never reach the interior of the flask. But if the tube be broken short off where it proceeds from the flask, and free access be thus given to germs falling vertically out of the air, the fluid, which has remained clear and desert for months, becomes, in a few days, turbid and full of life.|$|E
