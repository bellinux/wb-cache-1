50|$|Since {{the first}} Germans {{migrated}} to Valdivia in the mid-1840s, German cultural influence has been {{visible in the}} city. Germans in Valdivia settled mostly in the Isla Teja and <b>Collico</b> suburban areas. Until the building of Pedro de Valdivia Bridge, inhabitants of Isla Teja lived isolated from the city, where it was common that children first learned to speak German before Spanish. Nowadays the German language is preserved by the Instituto Alem√°n Carlos Anwandter one of Latin America's oldest German schools. German descendants also form Valdivia's oldest fire station Germania, located in Isla Teja.|$|E
