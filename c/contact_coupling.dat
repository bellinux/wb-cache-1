40|$|International audienceTribological {{systems are}} complex systems {{that require a}} multi-disciplinary (mechanical, material, physico-chemical) {{approach}} where numerous influence factors can be involved. To characterize a <b>contact</b> <b>couple,</b> the intrinsic parameters of the materials {{as well as the}} parameters related to the contact loading and the surrounding environment need {{to be taken into account}}. Fretting analysis, by means of running condition-fretting maps (RUM), allows the behavior of the <b>contact</b> <b>couple</b> to be taken into account and to predict the boundary between partial slip and gross slip conditions. This article presents the study of a steel/polycarbonate couple during fretting tests. The study was carried out by performing a complete factorial experiment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{proposed}} contribution {{deals with}} the method for the railway wheel profile development {{on the base of}} the intended shape of wheelset / track contact geometric characteristics. The base of the iteration method, which is of the highest important in this article, is to develop the new profile under the given conditions — prescribed shape of the contact points distribution and the shape of Delta r function. The new developed wheel profile in the couple with given rail profile will have requested chosen characteristics. This method can be after modification used for a design of rail profile in accordance to the wheel profile. The developed railway wheel is tested for the results based on the shape of the wheelset/rail characteristics and for the normal and tangential stresses distributions that may have the influence on the fatigue behaviour of the material of railway / wheel <b>contact</b> <b>couple.</b> The designed NEWRAD profile gives better results than the standard <b>contact</b> <b>couple...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose is}} the {{creation}} of new materials by combining the mechanisms forming the structure of dispersion-hardened alloys and determination of the mechanism of formation and realization conditions of <b>contact</b> <b>coupling</b> at dynamic methods. The kinetics of the internal oxidation process has been established; a means of increasing the dispersivity of isolations in alloys by their additional alloying has been suggested; a deformation parameter defining the formation of the contact couplings has been determined.

The dependence of the deformation value causing the appearance of a localization strip on the original structure has been established.

The calculation is performed {{in the framework of}} chiral effective field theory which is applied systematically to both the parity-conserving and parity-violating interactions. The asymmetry is calculated up to next-to-leading order in the parity-odd nucleon-nucleon potential. At this order the asymmetry depends on two parity-violating low-energy constants: the weak pion-nucleon coupling constant h_π and one four-nucleon <b>contact</b> <b>coupling.</b> By comparison with the existing data, we obtain a rather large range for h_π= (1. 1 ± 2) · 10 ^- 6.
