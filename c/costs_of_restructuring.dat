So too {{can be the}} <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> for workers and communities, layoffs, plant closings, and long-term unemployment are often the consequences of restructuring. Normally, those adversely affected by restructuring are not due any compensation other than short-term unemployment benefits. But in instances where corporations have illegally sought to shift the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> to workers by selectively denying them their pension and benefit rights, US federal courts have held that compensation is possible. The question is, however, what is appropriate compensation, given legal entitlements and abstract theoretical notions of just compensation? This question is explored with reference to case studies of corporate restructuring in the US that have involved identified violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In this context, {{it is argued that}} current remedies and recipes for compensation are wholly inadequate when justice is delayed.

40|$|AbstractÐLow {{coupling}} between modules {{and high}} cohesion inside each module {{are the key}} features of good software design. This is obtained by encapsulating the details about the internal structure of data and exporting only public functions with a clean interface. The only native support to encapsulation offered by procedural programming languages, such as C, is the possibility to limit the visibility of entities at the file level. Thus, modular decomposition is achieved by assigning functions and data structures to different files. This paper proposes {{a new approach to}} using concept analysis for module restructuring, based on the computation of extended concept subpartitions. Alternative modularizations, characterized by high cohesion around the internal structures that are being manipulated, can be determined by such a method. To assess the quality <b>of</b> the <b>restructured</b> modules, the trade-off between encapsulation violations and decomposition is considered and proper measures for both factors are defined. Furthermore, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> is evaluated through a measure of distance between original and new modularizations. Concept subpartitions were determined for a test suite of 20 programs of variable size, 10 public domain and 10 industrial applications. On the resulting module candidates, the trade-off between encapsulation and decomposition was measured, together with an estimate <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Moreover, the ability of concept analysis to determine meaningful modularizations was assessed in two ways. First, programs without encapsulation violations were used as oracles, assuming the absence of violations as an indicator of careful decomposition. Second, the suggested restructuring interventions were actually implemented in some case studies to evaluate the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> and to deeply investigate the code organization before and after the intervention. Concept analysis was experienced to be a powerful tool supporting module restructuring...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 The {{economies of}} the European former Soviet Union were {{dependent}} upon energy subsidies {{in the form of}} virtually free oil and natural gas imports from Russia, the loss of which implied dramatic shocks to domestic production structures, and the maintenance of which implied continued policy concessions to Russia. Yet some of these states actively pursued integration into the global economy while others sought to maintain the shelter of domestic markets and Russian energy subsidies. While the economic costs of openness and restructuring would be high in all cases in the short term, it is the political costs of openness and restructuring that determine the policy of the state. Where the high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> are borne by a politically disenfranchised group, a consensus coalition can emerge in favor of rapid restructuring and energy reorientation. Where the benefits of the status quo accrue to a well-organized coalition closely allied with the state, a consensus coalition emerges in favor of maintenance of energy subsidies from and political relationship with Russia. Where the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> are borne broadly or by a well-organized minority group, power oscillation and fragmentation will lead to inconsistent policy and slow progress toward energy reorientation and reform. Integrating a state-in-society approach to coalition formation within the field of international political economy, the author argues that states dominated by globalist-liberalizing-nationalist coalitions were able to implement energy trade reorientation by politically disenfranchising the ethnic minorities who populated the sector most vulnerable to energy contraction, heavy industry. These "globalizers," Estonia and Latvia, bore the high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> industries and importing energy at world prices. Belarus, dominated by pro-Moscow-statist-leftist coalitions, sought to preserve energy subsidies through political and economic reintegration with Russia. States ruled by divided governments or an oscillation of power failed to implement either policy consistently, resulting in continued energy dependence on Russia. Lithuania, Moldova, and Ukraine, the "hybrids," sought to limit their energy dependence on Russia, but could not meet their energy needs at world-market prices. They remained dependent on Russian energy, while struggling toward energy trade diversification...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model for analysing {{the contribution of}} investments in physical and institutional infrastructure to the transition process. In addition to the direct cost savings, infrastructure investment generates important indirect effects, or transition impacts. The model shows that, by reducing transaction costs, infrastructure intensifies product market competition. This leads to more effective weeding out of the existing high-cost firms in the market. In this model, infrastructure also increases the incentives for low-cost firms to restructure which generates additional efficiency gains, but exacerbates the existing cost asymmetry in the economy. Finally, infrastructure investment enhances the incentives for relatively low-cost firms to enter the market, and thus improves {{the efficiency of the}} entry process. The importance of these transition impacts of infrastructure depends on features of the economy, such as the degree <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetry among firms, the proportion of high-cost firms, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring,</b> and entry <b>costs</b> for new firms.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} underwent large and permanent reductions in employment growth {{at the beginning}} of this decade, a process we label as restructuring. We describe how restructuring occurred and what its consequences were for the economy. In particular, we find that restructuring stemmed largely from relative demand shocks (though technology shocks were important in some industries) and that elevated levels of permanent job destruction and permanent layoffs were distinguishing features of industries subject to restructuring. In addition, most workers displaced in restructuring industries relocated to other sectors. While this process of reallocation led to large increases in productivity (and a reduction in labor’s share) in industries shedding workers, it also resulted in prolonged periods of unemployment for displaced workers. Moreover, relocating workers suffered sizable reductions in earnings, consistent with substantial losses in their specific human capital. Putting these pieces together, we estimate the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> to have been between ½ and 1 percent of aggregate income per year.

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the issues of {{privatisation}} and restructuring in transition economies. The topics are addressed in both a descriptive and empirical manner. The centre of the analysis is the interrelation of privatisation, the resulting ownership form and the expected and actual effect on restructuring behaviour of firms. The essay identifies a slow progress in privatisation, paired with an overweight of insider owners. Furthermore substantial evidence on slow restructuring is collected. Overmanning and excessive social assets prevail in the privatised firms - in part regardless of the new ownership structure. Finally, the link to the government’s fiscal situation is drawn, the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> to the government budget are identified. In presenting such account of the privatisation and restructuring situation, the essay provides a basis for formal explanations of slow privatisation and sluggish restructuring. ...|$|E

In contrast to the consequent sharp {{reduction in the number}} of firms, however, the estimated share of broadly-defined SOEs that includes limited liabilities companies controlled by the State has shown virtually no sign of decline. We explain the backgrounds of this seemingly paradoxical persistence of state-ownership by looking into two distinctive types of large SOEs: traditional SOEs that remain dominant in oligopolistic industries and manager-controlled SOEs surviving in competitive industries. The two types exemplify several factors constraining further progress of SOE reform such as, financing the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring,</b> redefining the role of the State as the single dominant shareholder, and balancing the interests of the State and managers as entrepreneurs. Sorting these issues out will take time, which means that instabilities associated with state corporate ownership will remain in place in the foreseeable future in China.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} evaluate the different market-making systems found in most developed capital markets and to provide guidance to emerging market regulators for a possible implementation of such a system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper looks closely at the market design of seven developed countries focusing on the obligations and privileges of market makers. Through a case study and empirical evidence the paper identifies advantage and disadvantage of a possible implementation of a similar design to an emerging market. Findings – The paper identifies three forms of market making applied today: the quote-driven, the centralized and non-centralized systems. Four factors are proposed that regulatory authorities in emerging markets should consider when deciding whether, and which of, the three market-making systems they should implement. These are: current exchange design and the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring,</b> international and domestic investors' sentiment towards the exchange, size of the emerging market and the market designs in countries hosting the target foreign capital. Research limitations/implications – The paper looks at the implementation of a market-making system in an emerging market. Further research may investigate other ways of how emerging markets authorities can restructure their markets into more efficient, compatible and trustworthy financial venues in order to attract both domestic and foreign investors. Originality/value – The area of emerging markets' microstructure design and market quality is still relatively under-studied.

40|$|The cost {{of state}} {{bankruptcy}} in the euro area is incalculable {{due to the}} repercussions for the financial system. As a result of contagion effects, {{there is a risk}} that the entire Monetary Union could be pushed into deep recession. This forces euro area member states to implement rescue packages during periods of crisis, at a high costto taxpayers. The bailout policy adopted during the most recent crisis was an indication that sovereign debt in the euro area would be subject to joint liability. This temporarily eliminated incentives for national budgetary discipline. On this basis, it is argued that enhancing the institutional framework of the euro area in the long term by issuing common bonds would alleviate existing distortions of fiscal incentive effects in the euro area. Such a "safe haven" for the euro area could make a major contribution to stabilizing the financial system during periods of crisis. The positive impact this would have on the banking system could reduce the indirect <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> government debt which, in turn, would make restructuring debt from public debtors in the euro area economically feasible. This would strengthen the no-bailout rule which, again, is likely to result in an increasingly risk-based approach to interest on national debt. With this in mind, limited joint liability under strict conditions would be a welcome measure since it takes advantage of market incentives to cut public spending and consequently helps alleviate the problem of over-indebtedness in the euro area in the long term. As a prerequisite for creating common bonds, binding fiscal rules must be introduced in order that some sovereignty rights can be delegated to a central fiscal authority. In the short term, therefore, the required conditions for common bonds are not in place...|$|E
