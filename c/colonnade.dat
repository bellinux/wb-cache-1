5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a <b>colonnade</b> with a tiled roof, {{probably}} supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} <b>colonnade,</b> a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} <b>colonnade</b> supported a balcony above.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} parking tower {{are the main}} {{architectural}} structures. They are the landmarks of Zuoying, and their scale meets {{the conditions of the}} environment. As the major public construction in the city, the station applies glass screens to frame Half-Screen Mountain in the backdrop, a technique referred to as “scenery-borrowing.” The glass screens are supported by a <b>colonnade</b> on the ground floor. As one of the architectural characteristics of southern Taiwan, the <b>colonnade</b> here can relieve the pressure the building might bring to the streets.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{quantity}} of the field data is limited, the face widths of the welded tuff vary with elevation. In addition, Park et al. (2005) showed that the tuff emplacements that generated the Mt. Mudeung <b>colonnades</b> experienced little flow, which implied that the lava was emplaced on a near-planar surface. Thus, we can hypothesize that {{the formation of the}} columnar joints of the welded tuff occurred in the emplaced tuffs without lateral deformation. If the tuff was emplaced separately, within a time span shorter than the standard deviation of the age dating, welded tuff at the summit area of Mt. Mudeung (>~ 1100 masl) could have been generated by tuff emplacement onto previously existing tuff emplacement (<~ 1100 masl) because the face widths of these <b>colonnades</b> are larger than those of the underlying <b>colonnades.</b> These underlying <b>colonnades</b> can be divided into upper and lower <b>colonnades</b> because the mean face width (~ 1.3  m) of the upper <b>colonnades</b> (Seoseok-dae and Ipseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> are found from ~ 950 to ~ 1100 masl) is much smaller than that (~ 2.9  m) of the lower <b>colonnades</b> (Gwangseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> are found above ~ 850 masl and assumed to be extended to ~ 950 masl, which is {{at the bottom of the}} Ipseok-dae <b>colonnades).</b> The ratio of the vertical extent of the upper <b>colonnades</b> to that of the lower <b>colonnades</b> (6 : 4) is consistent with their differences in extent (150 to 100  m), which indicates that the two <b>colonnades</b> resulted from a single thick tuff emplacement (thickness: ~ 250  m). The <b>colonnades</b> at the lowest elevation (~ 700 to 850 masl) had a much smaller mean face width (1.2  m) than did the overlying lower <b>colonnades</b> (2.9  m), so the lower <b>colonnades</b> must have been formed from an earlier tuff emplacement. This scaling analysis suggests that three separate tuff emplacements generated the welded tuff found in Mt. Mudeung from ~ 700 to 1187 masl (summit), excluding the Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades.</b>|$|R
30|$|Columnar {{jointing}} of the Ipseok-dae (IS) <b>colonnades</b> (950 masl) {{are located}} ~ 1  km {{southwest of the}} summit of Mt. Mudeung and ~ 500  m away from the Seoseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> (Fig.  1 c and Additional file 2 : Figure S 3 a). The face widths of the <b>colonnades</b> range from approximately 0.7 to 2.2  m (mean face width: ~ 1.3  m), and the column diameters are approximately 1.5 to 3  m, {{similar to those of}} the Seoseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> (Table 3). Horizontal cross sections of the <b>colonnades</b> show that pentagonal or hexagonal shapes and secondary vertical and horizontal fractures are developed. Riedel shear-like joints are also observed in several columns, which implies that shear stress acted on the <b>colonnades</b> (Additional file 2 : Figure S 3 b–d).|$|R
30|$|However, it is {{not clear}} whether the extents and face widths of <b>colonnades</b> are {{reasonably}} correlated, especially whether the face widths of the upper and lower <b>colonnades</b> from 850 to 1100 masl are consistent with the extent of the observed <b>colonnades.</b> If face widths and growth rates are correlated, the growth rate of the columnar joints of the <b>colonnades</b> should be consistent with the larger face widths. Therefore, we conducted a scaling analysis and ran simple numerical models that evaluated the relationship between the thicknesses of the tuff and the face width (or growth rate) of the columnar joints of the <b>colonnades.</b>|$|R

5|$|The entire <b>colonnade</b> of {{the temple}} {{collapsed}} in a devastating June 4, 1679 earthquake, the epicenter of which was, according to many scholars, located in gorge of Garni. Most of the original building blocks remained scattered at the site, allowing the building to be reconstructed.|$|E
30|$|Several {{columnar}} joints of <b>colonnades</b> occur {{along the}} Baekma ridge extending from Jangbul-jae to Mt. Anyang. Several pentagonal or hexagonal {{faces in the}} Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades</b> are observed (~ 800 masl) (Additional file 2 : Figure S 6). Due to safety issues, only a few columns were examined, but their sizes and {{the style of the}} columnar jointing {{are similar to those of}} the Ipseok-dae <b>colonnades.</b> Although columnar joints are observed in the <b>colonnades</b> distributed along the Baekma ridge, extensive talus exposed on the slope at the base of the ridge indicates that a much larger number of <b>colonnades</b> existed previously.|$|R
30|$|The {{welded tuff}} in MMNG is not geochemically distinguishable. In addition, the {{absolute}} ages of welded tuff fall within {{a margin of}} error, except for the Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades</b> which are ~ 2  Ma older than the others. Therefore, all of the <b>colonnades</b> of the welded tuff, except for the Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades,</b> seem {{likely to have been}} established by one massive emplacement of the andesitic-dacitic tuff. However, because the face widths of <b>colonnades</b> are inversely proportional to the growth rate of columnar joints from the cold margin (Goehring et al., 2009; Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995), variation in the face widths of the <b>colonnades</b> with elevation implies several discontinuous episodes of tuff emplacement, cooling, and compaction in MMNG, rather than a single event occurring after the earlier tuff emplacement resulting in the Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades.</b> Because striae are observed only {{at the north end of}} the Seoseok-dae <b>colonnades,</b> the growth rate of the columnar joints cannot be determined using striae spacing.|$|R

5|$|A Roman <b>colonnade</b> {{was built}} in the third century, {{probably}} by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and <b>colonnade</b> columns have been damaged by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E

30|$|Columnar {{jointing}} of the Sinseon-dae (SSD) <b>colonnades</b> {{is found}} approximately 2.3  km {{away to the}} northeast of the summit of Mt. Mudeung (Additional file 2 : Figure S 5 a) at approximately 750 masl, which is ~ 100  m lower than the Gwangseok-dae <b>colonnades.</b> Well-developed pentagonal or hexagonal column faces are observed (Additional file 2 : Figure S 3 b and S 5 b). Face widths range from approximately 0.7 to 1.9  m (mean face width: ~ 1.2  m) (Table  3), which are slightly smaller {{than those of the}} Seoseok-dae and Ipseok-dae <b>colonnades.</b> Most <b>colonnades</b> have significant secondary fractures developed by weathering.|$|R
30|$|Columnar {{jointing}} of the Gwangseok-dae (GS) <b>colonnades</b> (850 masl) are ~ 100 masl {{lower than}} the Ipseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> and approximately ~ 950  m away to the southeast of the summit of Mt. Mudeung (Fig.  1 a, d). The Buddhist temple Gyu-bong-am, stands on a plane seemingly formed by secondary horizontal fractures across the <b>colonnades</b> (Fig.  1 d). These <b>colonnades</b> consist of pentagonal or hexagonal faces and have the largest face widths from 1.3 to 9  m (mean face width: ~ 2.9  m). The formation of foliation-like structure observed {{on the faces of}} the Gwangseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> resulted from the vertical compressive stress by the lithostatic pressure of hot ignimbrite accumulation. The hot clasts experienced flattening and stretching by welding compaction as a result (Additional file 2 : Figure S 4).|$|R
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} chapel {{were drawn}} up by J.H.Perkins, a local school master, with seating for 2,500. In 1859 a <b>colonnade</b> {{was added to the}} front of the chapel, with a window and cornice above. This was {{designed}} by Staffordshire architect Robert Scrivener. Further alterations were made in 1887, including the extension of the minister's vestry, replacement of the windows and renewal and restoration of the pews.|$|E
5|$|The Corridor {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} retail arcades, {{designed by}} architect Henry Goodridge and built in 1825, with a glass roof. The High Street end has a Doric <b>colonnade.</b> Each end has marble columns. A musicians gallery, with a wrought iron balustrade and gilt lions heads and garlands, is in the centre of the arcade. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine with Henry Goodridge as the architect.|$|E
5|$|The Funerary Temple no.86 (also {{known as}} the House Tomb) {{is located at the}} western end of the Great <b>Colonnade.</b> It was built in the third century AD and has a portico of six columns and vine {{patterns}} carvings. Inside the chamber, steps leads down to a vault crypt. The shrine might have been connected to the royal family as it is the only tomb inside the city's walls.|$|E
30|$|Mount Mudeung National Geopark (MMNG), Gwangju, Republic of Korea (1187 masl), {{is known}} for its huge, broad occurrences of {{columnar}} jointed <b>colonnades</b> in the Cretaceous Mudeungsan Tuff. To understand the genesis of columnar joints infilling a volcanic vent, integrated geochemical and geophysical studies were conducted. Most <b>colonnades</b> in the Geopark are located in regions higher than 700 masl and show elevation-dependent variations in the mean face width of the columns. These mean widths are approximately 1.7, 1.3, 2.9, and 1.2  m for the summit (> 1100 masl), upper (950 – 1100 masl), lower (850 – 950 masl), and lowest (700 – 850 masl) <b>colonnades,</b> respectively. This variation implies that columnar jointing resulted from discontinuous tuff depositions on relatively planar ground, which is associated with caldera structures and landslides from the emptied caldera rim. Geochemical analyses of major, minor, and trace elements show that the andesitic-dacitic Mudeungsan Tuff resulted from the arc magmatism associated with subduction of the Izanagi Plate and involved crustal components. Few geochemical variations of the Mudeungsan Tuff indicate that tuff originated from a single magma chamber. U-Pb age dating indicates that the Mudeungsan Tuff was deposited at ~ 85  Ma except for the Chotdae-bong <b>colonnades,</b> which were dated to ~ 87  Ma. However, a scaling analysis of the elevation-dependent variations of face widths and simplified numerical model calculations indicate that the variation in face widths with elevation indicates the sequential emplacement, cooling, and compaction of separate welded tuffs. Thus, the welded tuffs of MMNG can be thought to be formed by three discontinuous large explosive eruptions with periods of repose after each eruption. These tuffs include 1) the highest-elevation columnar joints of <b>colonnades</b> in the summit area (> 1100 m), corresponding to the lower <b>colonnades</b> of the third tuff; 2) the intermediate-elevation columnar joints of <b>colonnades,</b> corresponding to the upper (950 – 1100  m) and lower (850 – 950  m) <b>colonnades</b> of the second tuff; and 3) the lowest columnar joints of <b>colonnades</b> (700 – 850 masl), corresponding to the upper <b>colonnades</b> of the first tuff.|$|R

5|$|The Temple of Nabu and the Roman theater {{were built}} on the colonnade's {{southern}} side. Behind the theater were a small senate building and the large Agora, with {{the remains of a}} triclinium (banquet room) and the Tariff Court. A cross street at the western end of the <b>colonnade</b> leads to the Camp of Diocletian, built by Sosianus Hierocles (the Roman governor of Syria). Nearby are the Temple of Al-lāt and the Damascus Gate.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open <b>colonnade,</b> possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Internally, however, it {{consisted}} of various spaces. On {{either side of the}} front entrance in Corn Street were a coffeehouse and tavern, each of four storeys. Above and below the main entrance were rooms designed as strongrooms. In the centre of the Exchange was an open court, surrounded by a <b>colonnade.</b> At the back of the building was a two-storey range, consisting of an arcade on the ground floor and a long first-floor room. Facing All Saints Lane were two four-storey houses for business or trades persons, and on the frontage to Exchange Avenue were a further three houses. Below these various elements were cellars. Those below the five houses were each separate; the others were mostly interconnected.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a <b>colonnade</b> street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 {{until the beginning of}} the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the <b>colonnade</b> beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
30|$|Other {{groups of}} {{columnar}} jointed <b>colonnades</b> occur in MMNG. Although many are obscured because of significant weathering and secondary jointing, several groups {{can be observed}} along the ridge from {{the ruins of the}} Donghwa-sa (Buddhist temple) to Jangbul-jae along the trail between the Ipseok/Gwangseok-dae <b>colonnades</b> and Buk-bong. Thus, there are vast extents of columnar joints of <b>colonnades</b> in MMNG (Additional file 2 : Figure S 7). Aerial photographs show numerous groups distributed across MMNG, which signal that Mt.
