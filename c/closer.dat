5|$|Because of its name, Prosaurolophus {{is often}} {{associated}} with Saurolophus.

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow <b>closer.</b> The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew <b>closer,</b> plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
