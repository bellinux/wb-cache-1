5|$|T. cruzi {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} through blood transfusions. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated antibodies), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether T. cruzi <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> through frozen-thawed blood components.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms {{that can cause}} spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

5|$|Diseases which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> {{from one}} {{organism}} to another {{are known as}} infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E
50|$|Both {{adults and}} larvae {{of the common}} blossom thrips feed on flowers and pollen. The flowers are damaged causing discolouration, {{distortion}} and stunting, and may die. Secondary damage {{is caused by the}} viruses that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmited</b> between plants. The insect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a vector of tomato spotted wilt virus, which causes a serious disease of groundnuts and other crops.|$|R

5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The virus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent {{during the first week of}} the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact. Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> through sound, sight, {{and smell}} (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped {{behaviors such as}} scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E

50|$|The virus <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> {{from mother}} to child. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> before, {{during or after}} childbirth. The virus <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> to an unborn child {{if there is a}} damage to the {{placenta}} otherwise an infected mother can give birth to a healthy baby. A baby on the other hand can get infected through breast feeding. The infected mother is thus expected to only bottle feed the baby since the breast milk contains HIV. AIDS <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> further spread through un-sterilized instruments like needles, razors, knives. This mainly affects traditionalists who are exposed to such objects especially during circumcision.|$|R
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted.</b> The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans {{have a better chance}} for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted.</b> Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E
