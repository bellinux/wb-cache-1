40|$|At {{present the}} theory and {{calculation}} of single-stage high-pulse transformer (PT) are well developed. Their characteristics are determined {{depending on the type}} and load parameters. However, the method of calculation of PT executed in cascade is not fully developed. The main advantage of the cascade scheme is the transfer of the insulation from the inside to the outside. Due to this electric field intensity can be reduced at the inner insulation number of times, the number of PT components in cascade. The paper presents the results of comparative experimental studies of the characteristics of single-stage and two-stage PT included in the resistive load and recharge mode capacitive storage through to PT exacerbates capacity. There are considered two types of PT with the same ratios, the number of turns of the windings and the section of magnetic cores, but different magnetic properties of the cores. The methodology of comparative research is to determine the forming properties of one- and two-stage PT schemes in the storage capacitor discharge on resistive and capacitive load across PT with following oscilloscope current and voltage at the load. Comparative studies have defined the scope of the cascade of PT schemes.

This module can be placed in multicopy vectors or in the chromosome of a host strain by means of minitransposons. Using reporter genes, we evaluated gene regulation capacity and gross production of the system with different configurations. The highest yield was obtained when the expression module was in a multicopy plasmid after a 6 -h induction. However, expression modules in plasmids showed low stability after induction even with selective pressure. The chromosomal configuration had the lowest basal levels and induced levels comparable to those of plasmid configurations, resulting in accumulation of more than 10 % of the total protein.
