40|$|CDATA[A {{flock of}} 146 adult Awassi ewes was {{available}} at Abu-Graib area (central of Iraq, Latitude 33. 7 N) {{to study the}} effect of using 30 mg Acetoxy Progesterone (<b>Cronolone)</b> vaginal sponges administered for 12 days together with PMSGH injections at sponges withdrawal on fertility and prolificacy in these animals. Ewes were allocated to five groups (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and injected with O (control) 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 IU PMSGH respectively. Mating rates following natural mating,using 1 : 10 ram ewe ratio,were 73, 93, 86, 96 and 100 % respectively. Conception rates to treated (and mated) ewes were 69. 2 (94. 7), 50 (53. 6), 60 (69. 3), 43. 3 (44. 8) and 40 %(40 %) respectively. Number (and%) of experimental groups lambing twins were 4 (26. 7), 6 (33. 3), 3 (23. 1) and 4 (33. 3 %) respectively, as compared with 2 (11. 1 %) in the control, while number (and%) of ewes lambing triplets were 2 (13. 3), 2 (11. 1), 3 (23. 1) and 2 (16. 7 %) as compared with only one (5. 6 %) in the control. Only one ewe (5. 6 %) yielded one set of quintuplets in the group which received 800 IU PMSGH. Increasing PMSGH doses beyond 800 IU may depress, rather enhance conception, lambing and prolificacy rates. More research is recommended under good nutrition and management using optimum ram: ewe ratio of 1 : 5 during normal and autumn breeding seasons. ]]...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the vaginal bacteria flora in black Iraqi goats subjected to estrus synchronization. Sixteen multiparous black Iraqi goats presented in the farm of the College Veterinary Medicine, Al-Anbar University, were included in this study, during the breeding season, from May 2011 to July 2011. The ages of the animals rwere 2 - 4 years. A polyurethane sponge containing 20 mg of micromsed <b>cronolone</b> (fluorogestone acetate progestagen) was inserted in the vagina for 14 days. Standard bacteriological procedures were performed on vaginal mucus swabs obtained before application of the sponges and at sponges withdrawal. Results of this study revealed that the most bacterial flora was Gram positive Bacilli before insertion of sponges, while most of Gram negative Bacilli were present after sponges withdrawal. Bacterial culture of vaginal swabs taken before insertion of sponges showed 8 isolates (50 %) G _ and 8 isolates (50 %) G +, while after withdrawal of sponges the bacterial culture showed 10 isolates G _ (45. 4 %) and 12 isolates (54. 6) G +. The most prevalent bacteria isolated were S. aureus (10 isolates) 26. 3 %. E. coli (6 isolates) 15. 8 %, P. vulgaris (6 isolates) 15. 8 %, C.

40|$|The {{timing of}} {{seasonal}} anestric sheep {{is a very}} useful method in sheep production units, produces offspring in non-breeding season however, it is sometimes unaffordable for ovinocultor. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of using sponges domestic and commercial development on the percentage of estrus, fertility and prolificacy in anestrous ewes. A total of 60 sheep were used suffolk/hampshire seasonal anestrus, divided into three groups. Treatment 1 (T 1), 25 sheep, each was fitted with an intravaginal sponge with 40 mg domestic production of progesterone, Treatment 2 (T 2) with 25 sheep, they trade Intravaginal sponges with 20 mg of <b>cronolone.</b> In both treatments, the sponges were kept in the sheep for 12 days and they received 400 IU eCG intramuscularly 24 h before removing the sponges Witness Group (WG) with 10 sheep. The percentage of onset of estrus was different be tween groups (T 1 = 72 %, T 2 = 92 %, GT = 50 %). As the fertility rate were observed but not very significant differences (T 1 = 64 %, T 2 = 76 % and GT = 50 %). No differences in the percentage of litter in all treatments were single births. In conclusion, anestrous ewes treated with intravaginal sponges of domestic production are induced to estrus efficiently and showed an acceptable pregnancy rate compared with sponges commercial development, plus the cost of production is relatively low compared to existing products market, the use of intravaginal sponges domestic production is an economically viable for ovinocultor however, requires a higher dose of eCG to increase the lambing percentage...|$|E

The animals were kept in a game preserve and their food consisted of pasture and water were unlimited. Heat is conducted in the month of November. Blood was collected from the jugular vein before synchronization (day 0) and on days 5, 8, and 12 during treatment with tampon Chronogestcrvag. spong. a. u. v. (<b>Cronolone</b> 20 mg / tampon). To induce oestrus in moufflons eCG was used during oestrus and they were fertilized. Sampling continued in the days and on days 5, 12, 18 and 33 after oestrus. Sodium concentration and K were determined in serum by absorption spectrometry method and tools AtomspecFY-RangHigler. The concentration of Ca, P, total lipids and cholesterol were determined using BIO-Lachematests (Lachema, Brno). A statistically significant decrease was observed at the peak of oestrus (p < 0. 01) and also {{at the end of the}} trial (p < 0. 001). K value decreased, were statistically significant (p < 0. 01) in the days and after oestrus in the days following oestrus 5, 12, 18 and 33 (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Ketosis was {{diagnosed}} in {{a flock of}} Merino ewes that conceived from synchronised oestrus in the early autumn period. On day 140 of pregnancy the ewes were sampled for determination of βOH-butyrate (BHB), AST, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total cholesterol (TCH), insulin, T 4, T 3, cortisol, IGF- 1 and leptin. The results were evaluated according {{to the number of}} fetuses born some days later and the presence of hyperketonaemia (BHB: ≥ 1. 60 mmol/l). In May, about 3 months after lambing, cyclic ovarian function was induced (<b>Cronolone</b> + eCG), and the ewes were inseminated artificially (AI) 48 h after the removal of gestagen-containing sponge. At the time of AI and 10 days later blood samples were collected again to check the plasma levels of the same constituents as previously (in samples taken at AI), and to monitor the ovarian response by assaying progesterone (in both samples). On day 140 of gestation significantly lower BHB levels were detected in dams with single (n = 41) than in those with twin (n = 57) pregnancies. Hyperketonaemia was found only in ewes bearing twins (n = 27). These animals had higher NEFA and cortisol, and lower TCH, insulin, IGF- 1, leptin and T 3 levels than their normoketonaemic twin-bearing flock-mates, and those with single pregnancy. The blood glucose concentrations varied within a wide range, and the means of groups did not exhibit any significant differences. The formerly hyperketonaemic individuals were characterised by lower leptin level 3 months after lambing, and they showed a poorer response to the cycle-induction procedure than the others. The non-responders had lower IGF- 1 and leptin levels than those ovulated after this treatment. It was concluded that the subclinical form of ovine ketosis is characterised by complex endocrine alterations, reflecting an obvious form of negative energy balance. If attempts to induce cyclic ovarian function outside the breeding season are made soon after lambing, the ovarian response and fertility of these ewes may also be depressed...|$|E
40|$|Early {{pregnancy}} {{detection and}} prediction {{of the number}} of lambs would be profitable for sheep breeders, as this enables nourishment of pregnant ewes to their individual needs. Nonpregnant ewes can be separated and sold before winter. Prediction of sex is interesting for the curiosity of impatient breeders. Early pregnancy detection (before 45 days after mating) by means of ovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (ovPAGs) {{has proved to be a}} more reliable test than the commonly used transrectal ultrasound. The concentration of ovPAG has been claimed to be related to the number of lambs, their sex and birth weight, but contradictory results were obtained in different small-scale studies. In this study the correlation between number of lambs, their sex and birth weight and the ovPAG concentration in the serum of the ewes was examined. In a field trial, 160 and 70 ewes of the Texel and Suffolk breed, respectively, housed on 6 different farms, were synchronized by means of intravaginal sponges impregnated with 40 mg <b>cronolone</b> (Chronogest®, Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherlands). At the moment of synchronisation (T 0) and at 25 (T 25), 35 (T 35) and 45 (T 45) days after mating or artificial insemination, blood samples were taken by jugular vein puncture. A heterologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to determine the ovPAG concentration. In the heterologous RIA boPAG molecules were used as tracer, and ovPAG molecules as standard, while rabbit antibodies against ovPAG were used as antiserum. At parturition, number, sex and birth weight of the lambs were registered and their effect on ovPAG concentrations was statistically evaluated. No significant difference in ovPAG concentration was found between ewes pregnant of a single male or female lamb (P = 0. 29). ovPAG concentrations were affected by the total birth weight (P < 0. 05). In ewes pregnant with multiples, the ovPAG concentrations were higher (P < 0. 01) than in ewes pregnant with singles at T 25, T 35 and T 45, respectively. Because ovPAG concentrations were affected by the farm, it was impossible to predict the number of lambs by the ovPAG level. In conclusion, ovPAG concentrations were not affected by the sex of the lamb. However, ovPAG concentrations were related to the total birth weight. Within the farm, increased ovPAG concentrations may indicate pregnancy of multiples. Peer reviewe...|$|E
