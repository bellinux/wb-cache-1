50|$|The Science Research Department is a {{four-year}} elective program {{situated in the}} school's Biotechnology Laboratory. It allows students with a declared interest in science to conduct original research alongside of researchers at college, university, hospital, and medical school laboratories. The courses include Introduction to Science Research, which introduces students to the research experience with the basic skills necessary to conduct research experiments. Science Instrumentation and Problem Solving is the next course in the sequence. This teaches students how to adequately prepare reagents, perform sterilization exercises, run and maintain a biotechnology laboratory. Students also are instructed in various molecular biology techniques, such as DNA amplification via polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme analysis, and bacterial <b>culture,</b> <b>identification,</b> and transformation. In the summer before 11th grade, research students find a mentor to work with on an original research experiment. This is carried {{throughout most of the}} junior year with the students working on paper to present their findings. This is subsequently entered into the Siemens-Westinghouse and/or Intel Science Talent Search, as well as other science competitions. Students have previously been named semifinalists and region finalists, winning college scholarship money. Teacher Steven Beltecas has {{played a critical role in}} improving the school's performances at these competitions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBlood {{samples were}} {{collected}} for quantitative 16 S rDNA analysis from the vascular access device (VAD) of patients presenting with fever at participating centres of the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group. In total, 260 of 301 episodes of fever were evaluable and were classified as probable, possible, unlikely or unclassifiable VAD-associated infection. The sensitivity of the 16 S rDNA assay declined concomitantly with delays from time of presentation to sampling. The sensitivity with > 0. 125 pg of bacterial DNA/μL of whole blood was 80 % for the 20 probable VAD-associated infections diagnosed with samples collected {{on the day of}} or day following presentation. The specificity rose with increasing amounts of bacterial DNA, from 93 % with > 0. 125 pg, to 98 % with 0. 25 – 0. 5 pg, and to 100 % with > 0. 5 pg/μL blood. The positive predictive value (for probable or possible) was 88 % (95 % CI 70 – 98 %) with 0. 25 pg/μL, and 100 % (95 % CI 83 – 100 %) with > 0. 5 pg/μL. All 18 (6. 8 %) episodes with > 0. 5 pg of bacterial DNA/μL blood were associated with positive blood <b>cultures.</b> <b>Identifications</b> derived from the DNA sequence were consistent with the blood <b>culture</b> <b>identifications</b> for 15 of the 17 episodes with a DNA sequence identification. The VAD was removed because of suspected infection in six (2. 8 %) of 216 episodes with 0. 5 pg/μL. A bacterial DNA concentration of > 0. 5 pg/μL in blood drawn through a central venous catheter at the time of fever presentation had a high positive predictive value for VAD-associated infection and predicted an increased risk of VAD removal because of suspected infection...|$|R

Despite its prevalence, the relationship with one’s nation has not been investigated empirically {{in terms of an}} attachment theory framework. Two studies employed an attachment theory approach to investigate the construct validity of symbolic attachment to one’s nation of origin, and its association with acculturation (operationalized as heritage and mainstream <b>culture</b> <b>identification).</b> Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment.

The aim {{of this study was to}} detect, using molecular techniques, the role of Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma spp. in respiratory secretion and blood specimens of preterm newborns with or without RDS and to evaluate the prevalence of perinatal U. urealyticum or U. parvum infection. The influence of chemotherapy on the clinical course was also evaluated. Methods Tracheal aspirate or nasopharingeal fluid samples from 50 preterm babies with (24) or without RDS (26) were analysed for detection of U. urealyticum and U. parvum by <b>culture</b> <b>identification</b> assay and PCR. Sequencing analysis of amplicons allowed us to verify the specificity of methods. Clarithromycin (10 mg kg - 1 twice a day) was administered in ureaplasma-positive patients who presented clinical signs of RDS.
