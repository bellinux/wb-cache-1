5000|$|<b>Cross-{{collateral}}ization</b> is a {{term used}} when the collateral for one loan is also used as collateral for another loan. [...] If a person has borrowed from the same bank a home loan secured by the house, a car loan secured by the car, and so on, these assets {{can be used as}} cross-collaterals for all the loans. If the person pays off the car loan and wants to sell the car, the bank may veto the deal because the car is still used to secure the home loan and other loans. Technically, <b>cross-collateralization</b> expires when the borrower has no outstanding loans with the bank. In the context of bankruptcy, <b>cross-collateralization</b> also means the collateralization of general unsecured prepetition debt by collateral securing postpetition loans.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} <b>cross-collateralization</b> occurs when an {{individual}} may have a checking account and a loan at the same bank. If the individual becomes past due on the loan, the financial institution may take {{money out of the}} bank account or freeze the account until the loan becomes current. Because cross-collaterlization reduces the lender's risk, credit unions often offer cross-collateralized loans as a way to give borrowers lower interest rates.|$|E
5000|$|Bridge {{loans are}} {{typically}} {{more expensive than}} conventional financing, {{to compensate for the}} additional risk. Bridge loans typically have a higher interest rate, points (points are essentially fees, 1 point equals 1% of loan amount), and other costs that are amortized over a shorter period, and various fees and other [...] "sweeteners" [...] (such as equity participation by the lender in some loans). The lender also may require <b>cross-collateralization</b> and a lower loan-to-value ratio. On the other hand, they are typically arranged quickly with relatively little documentation.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the Saybrook decision {{in the context of}} prior case law and the general principles underlying the Code. The first section lays the foundation for an analysis of Saybrook by identifying the fundamental tenets of the Code and outlining the protections available under the Code to preserve secured creditors 2 ̆ 7 property interests in their collateral and to induce lenders to provide DIPs with new credit. The next section defines <b>cross-collateralization,</b> analyzes the Saybrook decision in the context of prior case law, and considers whether <b>cross-collateralization</b> is permissible under the Code 2 ̆ 7 s express provisions and general policies. The authors conclude that the Code 2 ̆ 7 s language, history, and policies should be construed to prohibit <b>cross-collateralization</b> liens because such liens violate the Code 2 ̆ 7 s policy of equitable distribution among similarly situated creditors and are inconsistent with the provisions of the Code governing the protection of pre-petition secured creditors and the inducement of new financing. The article next considers whether and to what extent financing orders are protected from modification or reversal on appeal or in collateral proceedings, and concludes that (1) the Code 2 ̆ 7 s statutory mootness doctrine applicable to financing orders should be construed to protect against reversal or modification on appeal all terms of a financing order that relate directly to the new post-petition financing, unless the effect of the order has been stayed pending the appeal, but not to protect any terms that relate directly to the lender 2 ̆ 7 s prepetition claims, {{even in the absence of}} a stay pending appeal and (2) principles of finality, res judicata and collateral estoppel should insulate all terms of a financing order from direct or collateral attack by any party who failed to preserve its challenge by filing a timely notice of appeal. This is followed by an attempt to project Saybrook 2 ̆ 7 s potential precedental effects and impact on DIP financing. Finally, the authors offer a summary of their conclusions and make certain recommendations designed to guide practitioners and courts in drafting and analyzing financing orders...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY 500 {{consecutive}} {{patients were}} evaluated for extracranial {{disease of the}} internal carotid arteries by an automated, air-Ailed, digital oculoplethysmographic system (OPG) of the Kartchner type (Zira) and by supraorbital (SO) and supratrochlear (ST) directional Doppler ultrasonography. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in 58 patients (110 vessels), and OPG timing criteria for detecting hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (60 % or greater diameter reduction) were ascertained. Optimal criteria were a delay of one ocular pulse, relative to the other, of greater than 12 msec; and a delay of an ocular pulse, relative to the earlier ear (external carotid) pulse, of greater than 36 msec. These criteria correctly identified 73 % of vessels with 0 to 59 % stenosis and 76 % of vessels with 60 to 100 % stenosis. However, in 26 % of the vessels, OPG was either inconclusive or inaccurate. Correct diagnosis of bilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenoses was made by OPG in 6 of 9 affected patients. SO Doppler was normal in 70 % of vessels with 0 - 59 % stenosis, and abnormal in 75 % of vessels with 60 - 100 % stenosis. Corresponding percentages for ST Doppler were 95 % and 44 %. Abnormal Doppler responses to compression of contralateral facial branches were predic-tive of intracranial <b>cross-collateralization</b> in only 25 % of patients. These results suggest that both quantitative OPG {{in its present form}} and directional Doppler studies have serious limitations as non-invasive diagnostic methods...|$|E
