25|$|In 2013 {{the first}} {{digitally}} controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam is introduced by Audi on the facelifted Audi A8, with 25 individual LED segments (Matrix LED). The system dims light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast its full {{light on the}} zones between and beside them. This works because the LED high beams are split into numerous individual light-emitting diodes. High-beam LEDs in both headlights are arranged in a matrix and adapt fully electronically to the surroundings in milliseconds. They are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually by a control unit. In addition, the headlights also function as a <b>cornering</b> <b>light.</b> Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, {{the focus of the}} beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel. In 2014: Mercedes-Benz introduced a similar technology on the facelifted CLS-Class in 2014, called MULTIBEAM LED, with 24 individual segments.|$|E

50|$|Matrix LED {{digitally}} controlled adaptive non-glare highbeam multi-LED headlamps. The highbeam comprises 25 individual {{light-emitting diodes}} per unit {{that can be}} switched on and off or dimmed individually depending on the situation.

Additional features of the new headlights are the intelligent <b>cornering</b> <b>light,</b> new-look daytime running lights and dynamic turn signals. The lighting system uses predictive route data from the navigation system to adjust the distribution of light in response to the current driving situation. In combination with the optional Navigation plus with MMI touch, the system recognizes route data contained in the navigation system, such as curves and road classifications.|$|E

40|$|Fatal and nonfatal {{pedestrian}} crashes spanning {{daylight saving}} time were analyzed to assess the relative magnitude of risk in darkness for crash scenarios related to each of three forms of adaptive headlighting—curve lighting, motorway lighting, and <b>cornering</b> <b>light.</b> For curve lighting, pedestrian crashes on curved roadways were examined; for motorway lighting, crashes with attributes associated with motorways were examined; and for <b>cornering</b> <b>light,</b> crashes involving turning vehicles at intersections were examined. Fatal crashes were sampled from FARS 1987 - 2004; fatal/nonfatal crashes were sampled from the North Carolina crash dataset, 1991 - 1999. In the curve analysis, lower dark/light crash ratios were observed for curved sections of roadway compared to straight roads. This pattern was observed in both the fatal and nonfatal crash data. In the analysis of motorway attributes, posted speed limit was the dominant predictor of crash risk in darkness for the fatal crash dataset; road function class was the dominant predictor for the fatal/nonfatal dataset. Finally, {{in the analysis of}} intersection crashes, dark/light ratios for turning vehicles were lower than for nonturning vehicles; and dark/light ratios at intersections were lower than at nonintersections. The risk for each crash scenario was paired with the corresponding annual rate of crashes in darkness for each scenario so that a relative safety need could be determined. While all three scenarios suggested a potential for safety improvement, scenarios related to the motorway environment showed the largest potential. The actual safety benefits from various forms of adaptive lighting can be expected to depend on both the relevant safety needs, for which this report provides estimates, and the visual effectiveness with which various forms of adaptive lighting can be implemented...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1978 model year, Chevrolet's 5.7 L (350-cubic-inch) V8 with a four-barrel carburetor, which {{produced}} [...] at 3,800 rpm, also was available.

50|$|The first-generation Celicas can {{be further}} broken down into two {{distinctive}} models. The first of these was the original with slant nose (trapezoid-like shape front <b>corner</b> <b>light).</b> This is for coupe model only, TA22, RA20, and RA21. These models were produced from 1970 to 1975 and came equipped with the 2T, 2T-G 1.6-liter, or 18R 2.0-liter motor. They had a 95 in wheelbase. The second series had a flat nose (square front <b>corner</b> <b>light)</b> and slightly longer wheelbase (98 in wheelbase). This facelift model appeared in Japan in 1974, but for export was the 1976 model year. The Japanese version had engines under 2.0 liters so as to conform to Japanese regulations concerning engine displacement size, thereby allowing buyers to avoid an additional tax for a larger engine. Japanese buyers did pay a higher annual road tax for engines over 1.5 litres while staying under the 2.0 litre threshold.|$|R

The GT-S was rated [...] more than the GT at [...] The 2.2-liter was designed for more low-end torque, which appealed to US buyers' preferences as opposed to the high revving engines of the past. This engine was similar to the Camry's engine except for the balance shafts. The All-Trac Turbo was available with the improved 2.0-liter 3S-GTE engine. It was rated at [...] and 200 lbft Nm torque. The GT-S and all export market GT-Four/All-Trac are wide-body liftbacks with flared fenders. The Japanese market GT-Four was also offered as narrow-body for the pre-facelift model.|$|R
