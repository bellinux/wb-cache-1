50|$|The {{second type}} of cold saw blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>inserts</b> brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and radial clearance and provide the proper cutting and clearance angles on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable chip load per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>inserts</b> are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS cold saw blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These cold saw blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|E

A TiN coated <b>carbide</b> <b>insert</b> is used as the milling tool. A thermocouple was embedded into the workpiece to record the workpiece temperature during the end-milling process. It can be clearly seen that the temperature keeps on increasing after each experimental pass for three sets of experiments. The experiment conducted using the ethylene-glycol-based TiO 2 nanocoolant exhibits a much lower workpiece temperature compared to the experiment conducted using a normal commercial coolant.

50|$|Carbide is more {{expensive}} per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking.

This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use <b>carbide</b> <b>inserts,</b> as well as many lathe tools and endmills.

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller cone bits can be either tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>inserts</b> (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|E
