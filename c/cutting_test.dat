In our single-grit cutting，the measured cutting forces with CBN and diamond grains were largely different. For further under- standing of the difference，friction behavior in cutting {{is most important}} characteristic to be solved. So, orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>test</b> has been performed to measure friction angle on a carbon steel wilh CBN，diamond compax，and grain tools. And, the <b>cutting</b> <b>test</b> in SEM was also performed to observe chip formation. There are no differences between friction angles of CBN and diamond lools in ordinary <b>cutting</b> <b>test.</b> However，there is great difference in slow and short distance <b>cutting</b> <b>test.</b> Diamond tools showed significantly small friction angle at about first cutting of lmm. In the cutting in SEM，the diamond compax and grain tool show a large shear angle and flow type chip，while CBN compax and grain tool show small shear angle with shear type chip. Therefore, diamond tool keeps a small friction coefficient during short cutting distance, and the phenomenon was shown in high speed single grit <b>cutting</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel methodology to characterize material plastic behavior within a practical range of stresses, strains, strain rates, and temperatures {{encountered in the}} metal cutting process. The methodology is based on integrating a newly developed analytical model with quasi-static <b>tests</b> and orthogonal <b>cutting</b> experiments that incorporate a laser heating system. Friction and heat transfer models are developed to describe the tribological and thermal interactions at the tool-chip interface. These models are implemented in a FEM package {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the simulation of the machining process. The new analytical model, which is developed to predict the distributions of the stress, the strain, the strain rate, and the temperature in the primary shear zone, is based on conceptual considerations, as well as characterization of the plastic deformation process through comprehensive FEM simulations. Orthogonal cutting experiments at room temperature and preheated conditions were carefully designed. While the <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> at room temperature provided the constitutive data encountered in the primary shear zone, the preheated <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> were designed to capture the material behavior at the high level of temperature and strain encountered in the secondary shear zone. In these preheated <b>cutting</b> <b>tests,</b> a laser beam was employed. Quasi-static tests were also utilized to identify some of the coefficients in the constitutive equations, in order to improve the convergence to a unique solution for the constitutive law. Evaluation criteria were developed to assess the performance of constitutive equations. Based on the developed methodology and the evaluation criteria, a new constitutive equation for Inconel 718 has been proposed. This constitutive equation was further validated by Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) <b>tests</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> in conjunction with FEM simulations. The SHPB test data show an excellent agreement with the proposed material model.

40|$|AbstractPrecise force {{measurements}} {{are often used}} {{for the development of}} machining processes. A key measure thereby is the specific cutting force, which comprises several factors such as cutting and work piece material as well as the cutting edge geometry. Therefore, it is vital for <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> to be as close to the real application as possible in order to guarantee a good alignment and transferability of the results.

In the Linear <b>Cutting</b> <b>test,</b> the digital photogrammetric technique was newly adopted to measure three-dimensional cutting volumes and to apply them to the derivation of design parameters of TBM cutterhead. In this study, a series of linear cutting tests by a TBM disc cutter with the diameter of 17 inches were carried out by varying cutter spacing as well as cutter penetration conditions.

In this simulation part, the heat flow and thermal deviations are calculated, and also chip removal is taken into account.
