5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth was at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotelian {{model was}} {{accepted}} in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, {{following the death of}} Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe),</b> the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since {{we know that the}} distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} theme across British science fiction to have Earth near <b>the</b> core, or <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fictional <b>universe,</b> common {{examples}} could be <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Peter F.

2500|$|In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos {{proposed}} an alternate cosmology (arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe): a heliocentric model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known <b>universe</b> (hence he is sometimes {{known as the}} [...] "Greek Copernicus").

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed to be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E

25|$|Al-Haytham {{eventually}} {{concludes that}} heavenly bodies {{follow the same}} laws of physics as earthly bodies.

25|$|Ptolemy {{argued that}} the Earth was a sphere in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> from the simple {{observation}} that half the stars were above the horizon and half were below the horizon at any time (stars on rotating stellar sphere), and {{the assumption that the}} stars were all at some modest distance from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> If the Earth was substantially displaced from the center, this division into visible and invisible stars would not be equal.|$|E
25|$|Copernican heliocentrism is {{the name}} given to the astronomical model {{developed}} by Nicolaus Copernicus and published in 1543. It positioned the Sun near the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> motionless, with Earth and the other planets orbiting around it in circular paths modified by epicycles and at uniform speeds. The Copernican model departed from the Ptolemaic system that had prevailed for centuries, placing Earth at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> and is often regarded as the launching point to modern astronomy and the Scientific Revolution.|$|E

25|$|Not all Greeks {{agreed with}} the geocentric model. The Pythagorean system has already been mentioned; some Pythagoreans {{believed}} the Earth {{to be one of}} several planets going around a central fire. Hicetas and Ecphantus, two Pythagoreans of the 5th century BC, and Heraclides Ponticus in the 4th century BC, believed that the Earth rotated on its axis but remained at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Such a system still qualifies as geocentric. It was revived in the Middle Ages by Jean Buridan. Heraclides Ponticus was once thought to have proposed that both Venus and Mercury went around the Sun rather than the Earth, but this is no longer accepted. Martianus Capella definitely put Mercury and Venus in orbit around the Sun. Aristarchus of Samos was the most radical. He wrote a work, which has not survived, on heliocentrism, saying that the Sun was at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> while the Earth and other planets revolved around it. His theory was not popular, and he had one named follower, Seleucus of Seleucia.|$|E
