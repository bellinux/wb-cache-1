40|$|This article {{presents}} the modelling and experimental verification of the <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> of a 120 Â W of mono-crystalline photovoltaic module using four- and five-parameter analytical models. The {{southern part of}} Turkey, where the experimental system is mounted, is particularly well suited to photovoltaic installations. The <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> of the photovoltaic module, calculated from the models, is validated based {{on a series of}} experimental measurements. As well as the current and voltage of the photovoltaic module, the environmental variables such as ambient temperature and solar irradiance were measured and used for validation of the <b>operating</b> <b>current.</b> The photovoltaic cell models considered in this article are drawn from the equivalent electrical circuit that includes light-generated current, diode reverse saturation current, and series and shunt resistances. The simplified four-parameter model assumes the shunt resistance as infinite and thus neglects it. After determining the model parameters, the <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> is calculated using both models and compared to the measured current produced by the photovoltaic module. It is shown that the complete five-parameter model predicts the <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> better than the simplified four-parameter model, especially around solar noon, when most of the power is produced.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} semantic-aware real-time (SeART), {{an extension}} to <b>conventional</b> <b>operating</b> systems, {{which deals with}} complex real-time robotics applications. SeART addresses the problem of selecting a subset of tasks to be scheduled depending on the <b>current</b> <b>operating</b> context: mission objectives, other tasks currently executed, the availability or unavailability of sensors and other resources, as well as temporal constraints. Toward this end, SeART is able to represent the semantics of tasks to be scheduled, i. e., what tasks are meant for, and to use this information in the scheduling process. This paper describes in detail the SeART architecture by focusing on representations and reasoning procedures, and presenting a case-study which is related to mobile robotics for autonomous objects transportation...|$|R

Analysis on non-melted surface gives the maximum depth of hardened layer of about 187 µm as well as hardness values of about 990 HV 50.
