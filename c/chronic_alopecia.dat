40|$|Alopecia areata, an {{autoimmune}} disease affecting anagen stage hair follicles, can be induced by grafting spontaneous alopecia areata affected skin to normal-haired C 3 H/HeJ mice. As {{the onset of}} alopecia areata can be significantly retarded by anti-CD 44 variant isoform 10 treatment, {{it was interesting to}} explore the underlying disease mechanism. Two weeks after transplanting alopecia areata affected skin, expression of CD 44 variant isoforms 3, 6, 7, and 10 was strikingly upregulated as compared with sham-grafted mice. By 6 [*]wk after grafting, CD 44 variant isoform levels had returned to normal, whereas in draining lymph nodes, CD 44 variant isoform expression was slightly decreased. Leukocytes in the skin of mice with <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata expressed a hematopoietic isoform of CD 44 and CD 44 variant isoform 6 at an elevated level, but CD 44 variant isoform 3 expression was reduced. Cytokine expression in leukocytes of <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata affected skin was higher than in normal-haired controls. Cytokine expression also increased postsurgery in sham and alopecia areata grafted mice, but remained elevated only in mice receiving alopecia areata affected skin. Finally, from the skin of mice with <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata and of mice transplanted with alopecia areata affected skin, an increased number of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, but a strongly decreased number of CD 4 +/CD 25 + regulatory T cells was recovered. Thus, expression of CD 44 variant isoforms is important for the migration of leukocytes during the initial period of alopecia areata. CD 44, however, is apparently not involved in the maintenance of the disease state, which is characterized by high cytokine expression levels, an increased number of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, but a low level of CD 4 +/CD 25 + suppressor cells...|$|E
40|$|Cytokines {{play a role}} in {{alopecia}} areata. We used immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization {{studies to}} demonstrate the persistence of pro-inflammatory as well as apoptotic mechanisms in skin biopsies from patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata. In situ hybridization allows the visualization of the distribution of immunocompetent cells in vivo. We studied skin biopsies from 11 untreated alopecia areata patients and two normal controls. In situ hybridization was performed on frozen sections using 35 S-radio-labeled riboprobes, specific for IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 6, INFγ, and granzyme B mRNA. Immunohistochemistry was carried out using an anti-IL- 1 β monoclonal antibody, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the human Fas protein. We demonstrated the presence of cells labeled with IL- 1 β, IL- 6, INFγ, and granzyme B antisense probes. Similarly, cells labeled with anti-IL- 1 β were found in 10 of 11 cases. The labeled cells were located in the mononuclear peri- and intrafollicular infiltrate. Cells expressing granzyme B were found in close contact with the follicle. Fas positivity was demonstrated in four of four cases {{at the level of the}} cytoplasmic membrane of the hair follicle keratinocytes. These results, based on visualizing the labeled cells, demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced by the mononuclear cell infiltrate in close contact with follicles in alopecia areata. Furthermore, they demonstrate for the first time that apoptotic mechanisms involving granzyme B and Fas-Fas ligand pathways may play a major role in the persistence of <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata (AA). Material and Methods: This is a prospective study that was conducted at Kamal Hospital, Kaushambi in which 20 patients who attended the outpatient department were enrolled for the study. All the patients had h/o patches and taken various line of treatments for a duration of 2 years. All the patients were biopsy-proven positive for AA disease. There was no randomisation done since all of them were healthy young adults. The patients′age ranged from 25 to 35 years, and none of them had any co-morbidities. Results: Of 20 patients, only one patient had a relapse. None of the patients had any side effects, and all of them tolerated the procedure well. Conclusion: We wish to conclude that PRP has a definite role in treating AA infections. However, still more long-term follow-up, studies are required for further validation of results and labelling it as a 100 % cure for people suffering from AA with recurrences which are so common...|$|E

40|$|Omenn Syndrome (OS) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} disorder presenting with early-onset generalized erythrodermia, <b>alopecia,</b> <b>chronic</b> diarrhea, lymphoadenopathy, {{failure to}} thrive, and recurrent infections. The immunological phenotype is characterized by eosinophilia, virtual absent circulating B cells but elevated IgE serum levels. T cells are normal or increased and display a highly restricted, oligoclonal TCR repertoire. Because of overwhelming infections and loss of proteins, the disease is fatal, unless treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which is variably successful. We have previously demonstrated that mutations in either RAG 1 and RAG 2, impairing, but not abolishing, the first steps of V(D) J recombination, are {{the main cause of}} this syndrome [1]. Nonetheless, a compelling explanation for the autoimmune features of OS has proven elusive. Th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is a <b>chronic</b> non-scarring <b>alopecia</b> that {{involves}} the scalp and/or body, and is characterized by patchy areas of hair loss without any signs of clinical inflammation. Various therapies have been proposed for their treatment. But none {{have been shown to}} alter the course of the disease. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a volume of autologous plasma that has a high platelet concentration. Growth factors released from platelets may act on stem cells in the bulge area of the follicles, stimulating the development of new follicles and promoting neovascularization. Aim: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of intralesional injection of autologous platelet rich plasma with intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml) in the treatment of alopecia areata. Methodology: 74 patients with alopecia areata were allocated into 2 groups and treated with triamcinolone and PRP injections. Treatment outcome was measured by taking into account extent and density of regrowth of hair and was expressed as a percentage of overall growth. Results: Forty eight patients were treated with triamcinolone injections and 26 patients were treated with PRP injections. Patients treated with PRP had an earlier response at the end of 6 weeks than patients treated with triamcinolone. However, this difference was statistically insignificant. The overall improvement at the end of 9 weeks was 100 % for all patients in both groups. Conclusion: PRP is a safe, simple, biocompatible and effective procedure for the treatment of alopecia areata with efficacy comparable with triamcinolone...|$|R
40|$|With {{our current}} view of {{alopecia}} areata as an autoimmune disease, {{it is probable}} that disease development in an individual is dependent on multiple genetic and environmental factors interacting in a complex system. Rodent models afford the opportunity to investigate alopecia areata development and to define the significance of the different factors involved. Recently, rodent model characterization has been conducted using flow cytometry, microarray analysis, and functional studies. From these a pattern of events in alopecia areata development has emerged. Although the preliminary activation events for the onset of alopecia areata remain unknown, the response of the immune system is characterized by antigen presentation and costimulation of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and skin, a deficiency of CD 4 +/CD 25 + regulatory cells, and an action of activated lymphocytes on hair follicles via Fas/FasL signaling and cytokines. Thus, onset of disease may require appropriate (or inappropriate) expression of stimulatory antigens within the hair follicle, the breakdown of the putative hair follicle immune privilege, the presentation of antigens to the immune system, a failure of immune system regulation, and the ability of the activated immune system to disrupt anagen-stage hair follicles. Once the sequence of events is initiated, it may become a self-perpetuating cycle, with epitope spreading leading to a wider range of targets in <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata. Rodent model studies have provided significant insight into alopecia areata, but much more remains to be explained about the mechanisms of disease development...|$|E
40|$|Alopecia areata is a {{suspected}} autoimmune hair loss disease. In a rodent model, alopecia areata can be induced in normal haired C 3 H/HeJ mice by transfer of skin grafts from mice with spontaneous alopecia areata. At weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10 after surgery, grafted mice were euthanized, skin collected and processed for histology, and RNA extracted. Age-matched sham-grafted mice, and mice {{with and without}} spontaneous alopecia areata, were similarly processed. For comparison, skin biopsies from alopecia areata and androgenetic alopecia affected humans were also collected. Skin mRNA processed to cDNA was analyzed using Affymetrix mouse 11 K and human 6800 gene chip® array technology. Microarray results indicated 42 known genes upregulated or downregulated during onset of mouse alopecia areata consistent with an inflammatory cell-mediated disease pathogenesis involving antigen presentation, costimulation, and a T helper 1 lymphocyte response. In contrast, 114 genes, many regulating immunoglobulin response, were altered late in disease development. In alopecia areata affected humans, 95 genes were significantly modulated. As confirmation of microarray analysis results, lymph node and spleen cells from alopecia areata affected mice injected into normal haired littermates transferred the alopecia areata phenotype. Alopecia areata onset could be inhibited in skin-grafted mice by modulation with B 7. 1 - and B 7. 2 -specific monoclonal antibodies. In addition, depletion of CD 4 + CD 8 + expressing cells in <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata affected mice using monoclonal antibodies permitted hair regrowth. The results consistently demonstrated the importance of an immune cell-mediated disease mechanism in alopecia areata pathogenesis and suggested targeting antigen-presenting cells and reactive lymphocytes may be effective in alopecia areata treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the early damage as measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SLICC/ACR DI) in Brazilian systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with disease duration of 2 and 3 years and to evaluate the possible association between SLICC/ACR DI score and sociodemographic and clinical data. the SLICC/ACR DI was measured in 54 patients with SLE according to the ACR criteria for SLE and a mean (SD) disease duration of 29 (3. 8) months. the patients were provided by outpatient clinics and hospitals of the public health network and private clinics in the city of Natal in Brazil. the SLICC/ACR DI scores for each type of organ damage, prevalence of damage within organ systems, and the association with sociodemographic variables were assessed. Disease duration was considered as the time from diagnosis until the study. Organ damage was present in 18 (33 %) of the 54 patients while 36 patients (67 %) had no damage. the skin (11 %), renal (9 %), and pulmonary (7. 4 %) systems were the most frequently involved, followed by the neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal systems, premature gonadal failure, and diabetes. the most frequent individual items on the SLICC/ACR DI were scarring <b>chronic</b> <b>alopecia</b> and pleural fibrosis. No association was demonstrated between organ damage (SLICC/ACR scores) and sociodemographic and clinical variables. Early organ damage demonstrated in Brazilian patients with SLE was similar to other populations studied in the world, despite a low socioeconomic status. in contrast to reports in other studies, a cutaneous lesion was the most frequent cause of damage in our patients.

40|$|Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) {{signaling}} pathways {{are involved}} in the stress response, and there is growing evidence supporting hair growth inhibition of murine hair follicle in vivo upon stress exposure. We investigated whether the blockade of CRF receptors influences the development of hair loss in CRF over-expressing (OE) -mice that display phenotypes of Cushing’s syndrome and <b>chronic</b> stress, including <b>alopecia.</b> The non-selective CRF receptors antagonist, astressin-B (5 mg/ mouse) injected peripherally once a day for 5 days in 4 – 9 months old CRF-OE alopecic mice induced pigmentation and hair re-growth that was largely retained for over 4 months. In young CRF-OE mice, astressin-B prevented the development of alopecia that occurred in saline-treated mice. Histological examination indicated that alopecic CRF-OE mice had hair follicle atrophy and that astressin-B revived the hair follicle from the telogen to anagen phase. However, astressin-B did not show any effect on the elevated plasma corticosterone levels and the increased weights of adrenal glands and visceral fat in CRF-OE mice. The selective CRF 2 receptor antagonist, astressin 2 -B had moderate effect on pigmentation, but not on hair re-growth. The commercial drug for alopecia, minoxidil only showed partial effect on hair re-growth. These data support the existence of a key molecular switching mechanism triggered by blocking peripheral CRF receptors with an antagonist t...|$|R
40|$|Sarcoptic mange is an emerging, {{cosmopolitan}} {{disease that}} is of substantial medical and veterinary importance. Caused by infestation of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, the disease affects ten orders of wild and domestic animals. Burrowing of the ectoparasite into the host’s epidermis causes intense itching, skin lesions, dermal inflammation, skin crusting and <b>alopecia.</b> <b>Chronic</b> infections can also affect host mass, reproduction and behaviour. Mortality is high, and {{this can lead to}} changes in both population abundances, and to wider ecosystem effects. Sarcoptic mange is the major infectious disease affecting Vombatidae, and is most widespread in common wombats (Vombatus ursinus), in which it causes significant mortality and substantial decreases in local abundance. Although there have been previous anecdotal reports of mange in individual southern hairy-nosed wombats (SHNW), it was unknown whether there had ever been a widespread and persistent population-wide outbreak. Consequently, the disease was previously considered to be insignificant in the species. However, in late 2001 /early 2002, a significant and ongoing mange outbreak occurred in SHNW in the Murraylands population of SA. Considering the paucity of data regarding mange in SHNW, the aims of this study were to determine the distribution and prevalence of this outbreak, the behavioural effects on individuals, and the treatment effectiveness of the drug Ivermectin.

40|$|The type I {{epidermal}} keratins K 14 and K 16 {{are remarkably}} similar {{at the primary}} sequence level. While a structural function has been clearly defined for K 14, we have proposed that a function of K 16 may be {{to play a role}} in the process of keratinocyte activation that occurs after acute injury to stratified epithelia. To compare directly the functions of the two keratins we have targeted the expression of the human K 16 cDNA to the progenitor basal layer of the epidermis of K 14 null mice. Mice null for K 14 blister extensively and die ∼ 2 d after birth (Lloyd, C., Q. C. Yu, J. Cheng, K. Turksen, L. Degenstein, E. Hutton, and E. Fuchs. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 129 : 1329 – 1344). The skin of mice expressing K 16 in the absence of K 14 developed normally without evidence of blistering. However, as the mice aged they featured extensive <b>alopecia,</b> <b>chronic</b> epidermal ulcers in areas of frequent physical contact, and alterations in other stratified epithelia. Mice expressing a control K 16 -C 14 cDNA also rescue the blistering phenotype of the K 14 null mice with only a small percentage exhibiting minor alopecia. While K 16 is capable of rescuing the blistering, phenotypic complementation in the resulting skin is incomplete due to the multiple age dependent anomalies. Despite their high sequence similarity, K 16 and K 14 are not functionally equivalent in the epidermis and other stratified epithelia and it is primarily the carboxy-terminal ∼ 105 amino acids of K 16 that define these differences...|$|R
