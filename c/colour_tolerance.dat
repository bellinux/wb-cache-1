40|$|In this study, a previously-developed {{numerical}} {{prediction model}} of colour sensitivity for disperse dye recipes {{was applied to}} predict the limit of accuracy in the control of dyeing processes according to a certain <b>colour</b> <b>tolerance</b> for individual recipes. The results confirmed that both concentration and temperature {{were the most important}} factors affecting dyeing results. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|CIEDE 2000 colour {{difference}} formula {{was recommended}} by CIE in 2000 for industrial colour difference evaluation. A {{new set of}} paint samples was prepared and was assessed {{by a panel of}} observers from two companies and one university. The results were used to reveal observer uncertainty, to test different colour difference formulae and to set each formula’s <b>colour</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The results show that CIEDE 2000 slightly outperformed the other formulae...|$|E
30|$|Settlement of diatoms was {{characterized}} using fluorescence microscopy on a Leica DM 2500 confocal fluorescence microscope coupled to a Leica DC 300 F camera. Images produces were 1300 x 1030 pixels. A 5 x magnification lens {{was used to}} give a field of view (FOV) roughly equal to 17.4 mm 2. A mercury arc lamp using a Leica I 3 filter cube (blue excitation 450 – 490 nm) enabled the chlorophyll in Amphora coffeaeformis to fluoresce a very strong shade red. Images were captured on 10 random FOVs per surface using Leica’s camera software, IM 50, with the bright field (BF) setting in place. Image analysis was conducted using Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0, 2002, with a <b>colour</b> <b>tolerance</b> figure of 200 to maximize the fluorescence intensity. This allowed for automatic quantification of red pixels against a dark background.|$|E
40|$|Many insect {{species have}} evolved {{different}} overwintering survival {{strategies such as}} cold tolerance or diapause. This study investigated the relationship between Aphidius rhopalosiphi mummy <b>colour</b> and cold <b>tolerance</b> and diapause. Mummy colour was insufficient to discriminate diapausing from non-diapausing individuals. This phenotypic character seems to reflect environmental conditions rather than direct developmental time and cocoon thickness (identification criteria of diapause). There is, however, a relationship between cold <b>tolerance</b> and mummy <b>colour.</b> Dark mummies exhibited significantly higher water content, survival at low temperature and lower supercooling point values than pale mummies. Mummy colour in Aphidius rhopalosiphi {{seems to be a}} phenotypic indicator of the cold tolerance...|$|R
40|$|A novel actinomycete, strain TVU 1 T, was {{isolated}} from {{leaves of the}} indigenous South African plant Tulbaghia violacea. Applying a polyphasic approach, the isolate {{was identified as a}} member of the genus Micromonospora. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain TVU 1 T was most closely related to Micromonospora echinospora DSM 43816 T. However, phylogenetic analysis based on gyrB gene sequences showed that strain TVU 1 T was most closely related to the type strains of Micromonospora aurantiaca and Micromonospora chalcea. DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain TVU 1 T and the type strains of M. echinospora, M. aurantiaca and M. chalcea were 7. 6 ± 4. 5, 45. 9 ± 2. 0 and 60. 9 ± 4. 5 %, respectively. Strain TVU 1 T could be distinguished from the type strains of all three of these species by several physiological characteristics, such as colony <b>colour,</b> NaCl <b>tolerance,</b> growth temperature range and sole carbon source utilization pattern. Strain TVU 1 T (5 DSM 45142 T 5 NRRL B- 24576 T) therefore represents a novel species for which the name Micromonospora tulbaghiae sp. nov. is proposed. The genus Micromonospora was proposed by Ørskov (1923) and is the type genus of the family Micromonosporacea...|$|R
40|$|EFI Colorproof XF {{was found}} to be more {{convenient}} from a user’s aspect, and had features which are covered in the ISO 12647 - 7 standard (e. g. the ability to simulate screening and print margin information), which Photoshop CS 3 lacked. None of the proofing systems distinguished itself in a clear way from the other; sometimes, on certain substrates, Photoshop CS 3 produced most accurate colours, sometimes EFI Colorproof XF did. Further investigations need to be carried out to tell more exactly which system produce most accurate colours. Only 6 out of 34 simulation-combinations had <b>colours</b> within the <b>tolerances</b> in the standard. The result also shows that the production substrates should not be used as proofing substrates. Instead the proofing papers especially made for ink jet should be used to obtain more colour-accurate prints...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] paper describes {{the development of a}} non-contact system for measuring the colour of printed material at web speeds, in addition to gravure-printed dot feature recognition. The system proposed uses a non-contact spectrophotometer based on a holographic grating, in conjunction with a conventional monochrome area scan camera, from which colour spectral data are extracted, while a xenon flash is used to illuminate colour samples. Dot features are captured by a magnification lens, in conjunction with a progressive scan camera. Software and hardware details of the system are given, together with the underlying mathematics for colour space conversion and measurement. Conversion equations from X, Y, Z chromaticity coordinates to the RGB system are presented, and also equations to convert from the L*a*b* colour space to X, Y, Z chromaticity coordinates. Experimental results are presented whereby the non-contact spectral system is shown to perform to a <b>colour</b> <b>tolerance</b> exceeding that of conventional colour video systems, and where performance of the dot feature system is comparable with traditional static examination methods using a microscope...|$|E
40|$|Quick {{response}} for product design, production, and product quality assessment {{has become a}} norm for textile and clothing industry. With this demand of quick response, the communication via electronic links and Internet, the adopt of e-commerce is wide spread. Many companies use computer controlled CRT display devices for product design, evaluation from fibre, yarn and fabric texture to complex 3 D visualization of garments. The screen colours are also used for colour quality control and communication. The digital archiving is also become popular, as digital samples can save storage space, reduce retrieval time, and eliminate the problem of fading and contamination. The demand of colour fidelity in multimedia, press, broadcasting, and cinema is also increasing. The accuracy for colour reproduction {{is even more important}} for textile and clothing industry with typical <b>colour</b> <b>tolerance</b> for accepting and rejecting a colour matching of 1. 0 CMC(2 : 1) unit. Preserving colour fidelity throughout design and production processes involves the use of a total colour management system with various media. The technology of calibration and characterisation of colour input and output devices, as well as colour space transformation between devices, is required. This paper reports the development of the framework for total colour management and the applications in the workflow of textile and clothing industries. The framework not only supports the accurate colorimetric data transformation between different input and output devices, but also utilising the recent development in gamma mapping, colour appearance model and image processing. Moreover, as visualization and simulation of textile samples on CRT monitor is an essential part in the system, the accuracy of a widely used CRT characterisation model - GOG model were also studied.

40|$|Open-pollination: {{originated}} as {{a chance}} seedling from Z 44 (maternal clonal parent), obtained from Beltsville MD in 1981, with an unknown pollen source from a zoysia grass germplasm field nursery at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Dallas. ‘Palisades’ was selected over the parent Z 44 {{on the basis of}} its lower tendency to produce thatch, its excellent lateral growth habit and its superior mowing qualities. ‘Palisades’ has been vegetatively propagated, and is uniform in growth expression. No seedling establishment from ‘Palisades’ has been noticed in either greenhouse or field studies. Selection criteria: rapid regrowth and spread by, and/or from, stolons and rhizomes; turf <b>colour</b> and density; <b>tolerance</b> to low mowing; winter hardiness; shade tolerance; low water use requirements.
