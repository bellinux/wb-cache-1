40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} the {{housings}} of the gear reducers is made, usually, using empirical equations based on the <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> (the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>shafts).</b> These equations can lead to inappropriate stresses distribution and inadequate material consumption at the final product. In the manufacturing of large series and in the manufacturing of the gear reducers / gearboxes with large dimensions it is necessary an optimization of the housing dimensions. The use of the finite element analysis in this process, combined with experimental researches, can generate significant improvements. The paper {{is focused on the}} analysis of stresses distribution and displacements on the housing of a two-stage helical gear reducer with parametric dimensions and loads. The housing is subjected to a static finite element study. The optimization process aimed to minimize the total weight of the housing. The next features were submitted to dimensional changes: the thickness of the housing walls and the thickness of the ribs. The results presented as diagrams of stresses and displacements distributions show real opportunities to reduce the total weight of the housing and the material consumption...|$|R

Solapur is the home of Handloom and Power loom industry which provides employment to a large number of workers (approximately 100000). The jacquard drive system in a power loom is obtained by a chain drive system. In the present system, frequent chain failure and jerky power transmission is observed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new working method of controllable Electro-Chemical Honing (ECH) of gears as follows. A gear shaped cathode which is meshing with a workpiece gear during machining is exposed as cathode pole {{only on a}} strip on the tooth dank. By varying the <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the cathode and the gear slowly, the electrolysis zone sweeps over the tooth flank from root to tip (slow scanning as we call it). Since the <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> is varied by a step motor, so the time of dwelling of the pole, and hence the amount of metal removal on different spots of the profile can be controlled by programming. An on-line profile error measuring device is provided. The computer calculates the required discharging time which has a relationship with dwelling time, and sends out the programming to control the metal. removing rate so as to cancel the error or to produce profile correction needed by silent transmission. A mathematical model is built for calculating the required discharging time. Several ground gears with typical profile errors are subjected to trial machining on this working principle. It cancels the profile errors very efficiently.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The <b>center</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure.
