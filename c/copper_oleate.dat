40|$|A {{clinical}} investigation with a pediculicide preparation containing tetralin + <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> as active ingredients was conducted and its therapeutic effect was {{compared with a}} preparation containing benzyl benzoate + DDT The study was conducted on 50 patients with pediculosis capitis/corporis/pubis; in a skin out patient department of public hospital in Bombay. They were grouped into two groups of 25 patients each. In each group, 21 hadpediculosisca pitis, 3 had pediculosis corporis and one had pediculosis publs. Preparation containing tetralin + <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> was effective in all the patients and one application was enough in majority of patients to kill both lice and nits. However 4 patients (i. e. 16 %) showed recurrence within 7 days of stopping treatment, which was probably due to reinfection as they {{were found to be}} cured on 7 th day′s examination. Medication containing benzyl benzoate + DDT was also effective in all cases but more than one application was necessary in majority of patients. Hence the duration of therapy was prolonged. Recurrence was noted in 8 patients within a week (i. e. 32 %) after stopping treatment. The chief advantage of preparation containing tetralin + <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> lies in its comparative effectiveness from a treatment of only 15 minutes duration. It was interesting enough to find this preparation effective in pediculosis with mild secondary infection without the use of antibiotics or chemodierapeutic agent like sulphonamides, in contrast to preparation containing benzyl benzoate + DDT which by itself had no beneficial effect in presence of secondary infection. However, a clinical trial on larger number of cases is necessary for confirmation...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy {{was used}} to investigate the adsorption of several surface active substances at the surface of copper sulfides {{and the influence of}} that adsorption on the reaction of exchange of copper ions between the crystal lattice of the sulfide and the solution of copper(II) ions. Simultaneously the influence of several possible inhibitors on the leaching rate of non-stoichiometric copper sulfide was investigated. Among all compounds investigated, sodium oleate showed the strongest inhibiting effect. However that compound does not adsorb at the surface of copper sulfide, and the inhibition is probably due to the precipitation of the insoluble <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> at the surface of the sulfide...|$|E
40|$|A patient {{ingested}} about 250 ml of Cuprex. an ectoparasiticide containing tetralin (1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene). <b>copper</b> <b>oleate.</b> paraffin oil, and acetone, in {{an episode}} of self-poisoning. This caused a mild degree of liver and kidney damage that subsided within two weeks. The main urinary metabolite of tetralin was 1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthol. The glucuronides of this naphthol and of 1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthol were also detected in the urine. Hydroxylation of tetralin only on the alicyclic ring and mainly at the benzylic car-bon suggests that tetralin metabolism may occur via a pathway involving the formation of free radicals. Tetralin (1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene) is widely used as a solvent and as a turpentine sub-stitute in polishes and paints. The metabolism of tetralin has been studied in rabbits (1) and rats (2, 3). Cuprex, an ectoparasiticide manufactured by the Quinton Company, contains the following: tetralin, 3 1. 5 %; <b>copper</b> <b>oleate,</b> 0. 03 %: paraffin oil, 52. 7 %; and acetone, 15. 7 %. A woman was ad-mitted to Temple University Hospital after in-gesting Cuprex in {{an episode of}} self-poisoning, thus affording {{us the opportunity to}} study its toxicity and the metabolism of tetralin in man. Case History A 26 -year-old woman was admitted to the hospital 48 hr after she drank / 2 - #{ 190 }pint of Cu-prex. During the 36 hr prior to admission, the patient vomited several times, had one episode of melena, and noticed her urine was green i...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized by {{thermal decomposition}} using <b>copper</b> chloride, sodium <b>oleate,</b> and phenyl ether as solvent agents. The formation of nanoparticles was {{evidenced by the}} X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The peaks in the XRD pattern correspond to the standard values of the face centered cubic (fcc) structure of metallic copper and no peaks of other impurity crystalline phases were detected. TEM analysis showed spherical nanoparticles with sizes {{in the range of}} 4 to 18 [*]nm. The antibacterial properties of copper nanoparticles were evaluated in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial activity of copper nanoparticles synthesized by thermal decomposition showed significant inhibitory effect against these highly multidrug-resistant bacterial strains...|$|R
40|$|Author abstract]In {{the present}} paper, {{the authors have}} {{published}} the results of investigation {{about the effects of}} various paints in order to prevent corrosions and fouling organisms on metal materials in the sea. The metal panels treated with various paints were set up at three marine zones, which were beneath the sea water surface at 1. 5 meters depth, the intertidal zone, and above the sea water surface. The composition, the preparation and the painting condition of anti-corrosive paints and anti-fouling paints were shown in Tables 1 - 7. The results of tests were given in Tables 8 - 10, Figs. 1 - 6, and Photos. 6, 7. The most effective anti-fouling paints were firstly AF 5, AF 4 and secondly AF 10, AF 9. Anti-corrosive paints which had much anti-corrosion effects were an epoxy resin anti-corrosive paint. The anti-fouling effect did not coincide with the anti-corrosion effect in these paints. The paint which had both effects was E 4 or E 5 and this was an epoxy resin anti-corrosive paint coated with a vinyl chloride resin paint which contains tributyl tin fumarate, <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> or pentachlorophenol cupric salt, and organoarsenic compound. [著者抄録]本試験は厳しい条件下での暴露にもかかわらず、すぐれた結果が得られた。とくに防汚効力では有機スズと有機ヒ素および有機銅化合物を配合した薬剤が効果的であり、ついで 50 %亜酸化銅配合のものであった。防食効果はこれらの防汚効果と一致せず、塗膜の劣化状態と密接な関係にあった。波浪、光、酸素をどの影響が強く、それらの耐候性を必要とする干満帯での防錆塗料はエポキシ樹脂防錆塗料が効果的であり、海中浸漬ではタールウレタン系がやや効果的であった。防汚効果、防食効果いずれにも効果的配合はE 4 であり、トリプチルチンフマレートに有機ヒ素 1 T- 67 、オレイン酸銅配合のもので、エポキシ樹脂防錆塗料である。大気暴露試験では 2 年間の経過では、ほとんどのものは異常をきたさず、耐候性、防食性がすぐれており、ひき続き試験中である。本試験ですぐれた結果が得られたのは、基材の調整(みがき軟鋼板) 、塗装回数(5 回) 、膜厚(150 ～ 500 μ) 、ほぼ均一な塗装 (ピンホールが少ない) 、腐食促進因子(亜硫酸ガス、窒素酸化物など) の欠除などの寄与も無視できない。このことは逆に基材調整と塗装が適正であれば、塗膜の防食耐久性は存分に発揮されることを意味し、長期防食性を期すには塗料やその仕様の選択と同時に基材の十分な調整と入念な塗装が必要である。とくに本実験の主目的である冷却水用海洋構造物の防食防汚対策としての塗装には、構造表面のある程度の乾燥が必要であり、水分の除去とその塗装技術が重要な問題となってくる。この問題の解決のためには一例として構造物の内面に陸上で完全に塗装された金網(ある一定の大きさの網目で一定量の薬剤が流出するように工夫される) を内張して取替えるなどがあり、今後その点の施工上の研究が必要であると考える...|$|E
40|$|Photoacoustic (PA) {{tomography}} enables multiscale, multicontrast and high-resolution imaging {{of biological}} structures. In particular, contrast-enhanced PA imaging offers high-sensitivity noninvasive imaging of neovessel sprout formation and nascent tubules, which are important biomarkers of malignant tumors and progressive atherosclerotic disease. While gold nanoparticles or nanorods {{have been used}} as PA contrast agents, we utilized high-density <b>copper</b> <b>oleate</b> small molecules encapsulated within a phospholipid surfactant (CuNPs) to generate a soft nanoparticle with PA contrast comparable to that from gold. Within the NIR window, the copper nanoparticles provided a 4 -fold higher signal than that of blood. 123 -integrin targeting of CuNPs in a Matrigel(TM) angiogenesis mouse model demonstrated prominent (p< 0. 05) PA contrast enhancement of the neovasculature compared with mice given nontargeted or competitively inhibited CuNPs. Furthermore, incorporation of a Sn 2 lipase-labile fumagillin prodrug into the CuNP outer lipid membrane produced marked antiangiogenesis in the same model when targeted to the 123 -integrin, providing proof of concept in vivo for the first targeted PA - drug delivery agent.
