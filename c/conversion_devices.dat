It would be ideal if an energy <b>conversion</b> <b>device</b> could directly extract energy from a sustainable energy resource such as biomass.

25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power <b>conversion</b> <b>devices</b> with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

2500|$|Using {{electricity}} {{produced by}} photovoltaic systems offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen. [...] Water is broken into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} by electrolysisâ€”a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) process which is also named artificial photosynthesis. William Ayers at Energy <b>Conversion</b> <b>Devices</b> demonstrated and patented the first multijunction high efficiency photoelectrochemical system for direct splitting of water in 1983. This group demonstrated direct water splitting now referred to as an [...] "artificial leaf" [...] or [...] "wireless solar water splitting" [...] with a low cost thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silcon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved off the back metal substrate. A Nafion membrane above the multijunction cell provided a path for ion transport. Their patent also lists {{a variety of other}} semiconductor multijunction materials for the direct water splitting in addition to amorphous silicon and silicon germanium [...] alloys. [...] Research continues towards developing high-efficiency multi-junction cell technology at universities and the photovoltaic industry. [...] If this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system, the reaction is in just one step, which can improve efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the program, reactions to the cancellation of the EV1 continued to be mixed. In GM's view, the EV1 was not a failure, but the program was doomed when the expected breakthroughs in battery technology did not take place within the anticipated timeline, citing the lack of availability of the NiMH-technology battery packs, developed by Energy <b>Conversion</b> <b>Devices</b> of Michigan, until late in the production cycle. The batteries improved the EV1's range, but not as dramatically as expected, and came with their own set of problems; a less-efficient charging algorithm had to be used (lengthening charge times), and the batteries heated up more quickly than the lead-acid packs (requiring use of the air conditioner to cool them down, wasting power). The automaker also cited the elimination of the CARB zero-emissions mandate as a factor in the program's cancellation, though the company was widely accused of lobbying against the mandate in an act of deliberate self-sabotage. The media perspective was far less favorable; in 2006, The Wall Street Journals Detroit Bureau Chief Joe White said, [...] "The EV1 was a failure, as were other electric vehicles launched in the 1990s to placate California clean-air regulators." [...] This opinion was echoed by TIME magazine, who in 2008 placed the EV1 on their list of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1963, the Ovshinskys had {{exhausted}} the savings with which they had initially funded ECL. [...] Before seeking public funding, Stan wanted validation {{of the importance of}} his work from a well-recognized scientist. [...] He telephoned Nobel Laureate John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor and co-discoverer of the BCS theory of superconductivity. [...] Bardeen immediately recognized the importance of Ovshinsky's work but his schedule did not permit him to visit ECL for five months. [...] Stan replied, [...] "We'll be broke by then." [...] In his place, Bardeen sent Hellmut Fritzsche, a University of Chicago physicist. Fritzsche became very positive in his support of Ovshinsky's work and helped attract other scientists to the Ovshinsky laboratory. As Fritzsche and Brian Schwartz later wrote, [...] "There is a mysterious quality in Ovshinsky's persona that attracts people into his sphere, builds life long friendships and awakens deep respect and devotion. [...] Meeting him leaves each person with a deep impression of his superior intellect, his self confidence, his compassion to improve society combined with his certainty that his vision can be realized. His enthusiasm is contagious. [...] In his presence, you feel how exciting it would be to join him in his endeavors." [...] Among the many famous scientists who came regularly to ECL as friends or collaborators over the next years, were David Adler, Bardeen, Arthur Bienenstock, Morrel Cohen, Kenichi Fukui, William Lipscomb, Sir Nevill Mott, Linus Pauling, Isadore I. Rabi, Edward Teller, David Turnbull, Victor Weisskopf, and Robert R. Wilson. [...] Some joined as consultants or as members of the Board of Directors. [...] Meanwhile, the ECL community developed a uniquely productive, non-hierarchical, multicultural, international environment, reflecting Stan and Iris' social values. [...] In 1964, Stan and Iris changed the laboratory's name to Energy <b>Conversion</b> <b>Devices</b> and moved the company to larger quarters in Troy, Michigan.|$|E
