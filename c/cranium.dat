5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long <b>cranium</b> with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the <b>cranium</b> to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short <b>cranium</b> compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the <b>cranium,</b> which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The <b>cranium</b> (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E

40|$|The Proceratophrys bigibbosa species {{group is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of postocular swellings and absence of hornlike palpebral appendages. A new member of this group was described recently from southern Brazil: Proceratophrys brauni. Its body size is between the smaller Proceratophrys avelinoi and the larger Proceratophrys bigibbosa species, both living in the same region. As the external appearance of these three members of the group is very similar to each other, it is interesting to discover a specific morphological categorization through internal characteristics, such as the <b>cranium’s</b> proportions. In this paper, we report the preliminary results for comparative <b>cranium’s</b> morphological characterization of Proceratophrys bigibbosa species from Brazil using the X-ray computed Microtomography technique through Skyscan 1174 system. Five samples of each three species, i. e., fifteen samples in total, were scanned. The tomographic slice images were reconstructed by SkyScan software. Then, these 2 D images were used to create the <b>cranium’s</b> models by 3 D DOCTOR software. The main result is that some visible differences in the <b>cranium’s</b> proportions of the species were observed...|$|R

5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} from two specimens: a damaged <b>cranium</b> (skull without mandibles, or lower jaws) lacking the back part (the parietal bones and further back) {{as well as}} the incisors, canines, and second premolars; and another damaged <b>cranium</b> lacking the same parts {{as well as the}} left toothrow. Both show no {{evidence}} of ongoing tooth replacement, indicating that the permanent dentition is complete. M.macpheei was larger in most measurements than M.brevicaudata, but because of small samples, some differences are not statistically significant. The length of the bony palate in the two specimens of M.macpheei is 9.4 and 9.7mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0mm in eight adult M.brevicaudata. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8mm in the sample of M.brevicaudata.|$|E
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad <b>cranium</b> define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation.

50|$|After {{his move}} to Wiltshire he gave special {{consideration}} to craniology. Thurnam with Dr. Joseph Barnard Davis published {{a work in}} two volumes under the title of Crania Britannica in 1865, important for craniometry. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of <b>craniums,</b> and had over 1700 specimens. Because of the racial differences of the <b>craniums,</b> Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were {{to be found in}} studying the skull types of different races. From different sizes and types of skull they deduced separate origins.|$|R

5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the <b>cranium.</b> However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the <b>cranium,</b> which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|While {{most other}} museums were using cast or sculpted Camarasaurus skulls on Apatosaurus mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull {{based on the}} lower jaw of a Camarasaurus, with the <b>cranium</b> based on Marsh's 1891 {{illustration}} of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the <b>cranium</b> and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the <b>cranium,</b> not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the <b>cranium.</b> Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the <b>cranium</b> or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated <b>cranium</b> under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E

The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the <b>cranium.</b>|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the <b>cranium.</b> Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the <b>cranium.</b> While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the <b>cranium.</b> The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{skull of}} the extinct Hadrocodium wui, which are {{considered}} reptiles that {{evolved into the}} first mammals, has unveiled significant implications of the reptilian olfactory transition. In comparison to their descendants, CT scans of these <b>craniums</b> revealed that the olfactory bulb had increased in size over large timescales. This sequence of events culminated the origin of mammalian olfaction, suggesting an OR gene shift from reptiles to mammals.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes.
