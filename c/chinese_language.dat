5|$|All Silkies {{have black}} or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism which {{extends beyond the}} skin into an animal's {{connective}} tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation.

5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} moved to a {{neighborhood}} on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E

Since the second largest population in the city is made up of Han Chinese, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> is also commonly used, particularly Hokkien, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese. Almost all residents are able to speak English. A number of special private schools that teach English for expatriates child can be found through the city.|$|E

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>language.</b> In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Scarborough-based {{news media}} have been either {{weekly or monthly}} publications. The {{earliest}} newspaper was the Scarborough News and Advertiser which was published weekly starting in September 1921. It lasted until the 1930s. Other short-lived papers and magazines included The Enterprise (1945–1966), Scarborough Mail (1946–1955) and The News (1952–1995) and 54east magazine (2005–2009). The only remaining English language local newspaper is the Scarborough Mirror, which started publication in 1962 and was later acquired by the Toronto Star's community news division, Metroland. A Scarborough edition of the Toronto-wide photography publication SNAP Scarborough was launched in 2009. Ming Pao Daily News is a <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> newspaper whose headquarters are in Scarborough. They started publication in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was {{far removed from the}} daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in <b>Chinese</b> <b>language,</b> including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E

5|$|The 'Peaks of Excellence' {{curriculum}} is continuous with the 'Broad-Base Curriculum', with more elaborate programmes {{that cater to}} students’ talent development. For instance, the Young Writers Programme, which is open to students {{who are interested in}} writing, has lessons conducted by various renowned <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> essayists in the region to expose and familiarise students to different forms of writing, and encourage them to appreciate different forms of written work. Students also have opportunities to attend cultural symposiums, national and international bi-cultural forums, research on contemporary issues, and embark on refined overseas immersions to strengthen their world and cultural views under the Global Classroom Programme.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci {{would be}} the first European invited into the Ming-era Forbidden City in Beijing (during the reign of the Wanli Emperor), where in 1602 he would publish his map of the world in Chinese that {{introduced}} the existence of the American continents to Chinese geographers. He arrived in Macau in 1582, when he began to learn the <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> and information about China's ancient culture, yet was unaware of the events that had transpired there {{since the end of the}} Franciscan missions in the mid 14th century and establishment of the Ming dynasty. Since that time the Islamic world presented an obstacle for the West in reaching East Asia and, barring the grand treasure voyages of the 15th-century admiral Zheng He, the Ming dynasty had largely pursued policies of isolationism that kept it from seeking far-flung diplomatic contacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century. However, it was used mainly as a {{teaching}} aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and {{seems not to have}} had any influence on the development of pe̍h-ōe-jī. In the early 19th century, China was closed to Christian missionaries, who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia. The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst, who went on to publish the Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Language,</b> According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms in 1832.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned most, if not all, movie theaters in cities {{throughout}} the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 {{with the arrival of}} the three Wong brothers from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s. These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined inter-ethnic relations as a main theme. The later ban on the public use of <b>Chinese</b> <b>language</b> meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with subtitles in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because of an agreement between importers and the film censor board.|$|E
5|$|Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire {{does not}} have a zoning boundary; before 2012 it drew excess {{students}} from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September of that year. In 2012 HISD opened the Mandarin <b>Chinese</b> <b>Language</b> Immersion Magnet School Chinese language-immersion magnet school, in the former Gordon Elementary building. It is HISD's first Chinese immersion school. The school was scheduled to move to the St. George Place area of Houston; it was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E
