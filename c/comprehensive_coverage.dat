5|$|The Sex Party was a {{political}} party based in British Columbia, Canada. The party was guided by {{the philosophy of the}} sex-positive movement. Among other points, the party advocated for reform of sex education in schools so that sexual issues are taught more gradually over time and included a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>coverage</b> of them. They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship. They also supported making Valentine's Day a statutory holiday and renaming Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>coverage</b> of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in <b>comprehensive</b> <b>coverage.</b> Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should provide health care as [...] "a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E
500|$|Historians of The New York Times—including Gay Talese, Susan Tifft and Alex S. Jones—have {{argued that}} the Times, faced with {{newsprint}} rationing during World War II, decided to increase its news coverage {{at the expense of}} its advertising, while the Herald Tribune chose to run more ads, trading short-term profit for long-term difficulties. [...] In The Kingdom and the Power, Talese's 1969 book about the Times, Talese wrote [...] "the additional space that The Times was able to devote to war coverage instead of advertising was, in the long run, a very profitable decision: The Times lured many readers away from the Tribune, and these readers stayed with The Times after the war into the Nineteen-fifties and Sixties". [...] Although The New York Times had the most <b>comprehensive</b> <b>coverage</b> of any American newspaper—the newspaper put 55 correspondents in the field, including drama critic Brooks Atkinson—its news budget fell from $3.8 million in 1940 to $3.7 million in 1944; the paper did not significantly expand its number of newsroom employees between 1937 and 1945 and its ad space, far from declining, actually increased during the conflict and was consistently ahead of the Herald Tribunes. [...] Between 1941 and 1945, advertising space in the Times increased from 42.58 percent of the paper to 49.68 percent, while the Tribune saw its ad space increase from 37.58 percent to 49.32 percent. [...] In 1943 and 1944, more than half the Times went to advertising, a percentage the Herald Tribune did not meet until after the war. [...] However, because the Tribune was generally a smaller paper than the Times and saw its ad space jump more, [...] "the proportionate increase in the Tribune seemed greater than it was in absolute terms. [...] The evidence that this disproportionate increase in the Tribunes advertising content left its readers feeling deprived of war news coverage and sent them in droves to the Times is, at best, highly ambiguous." ...|$|E
