50|$|By the {{standards}} of the time, a relatively large amount of data could be stored in a small installed volume of <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> memory: 72 kilobytes per cubic foot, or roughly 2.5 megabytes per cubic meter. This was about 18 times the amount of data per volume compared to standard read-write core memory: the Block II Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) used 36,864 sixteen-bit words of <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> memory (placed within one cubic foot) and 4,096 words of magnetic core memory (within two cubic feet).|$|E

25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead <b>cored</b> <b>rope,</b> which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|R
5000|$|The AGC was a 15-bit plus parity {{machine with}} a 1 MHz clock. It was about one cubic foot in volume and weighed about 80 pounds. It used {{integrated}} circuit NOR gates, two to a package, but integrated RAM and ROM devices {{had not been}} developed yet. It had 2,000 words of magnetic ferrite core read-write memory and maybe 24 thousand words of read-only memory {{in the form of}} magnetic <b>core</b> <b>ropes.</b> These <b>cores</b> used metal tape magnetic cores. With such limited computing resources, the software had to be extremely tightly written in assembly code. These computers were designed with extremely long mean times to failure. Fifty were built by Raytheon, and none failed during several years of life. The human interface was a keyboard with ten digit keys and a few auxiliary keys for such things as [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-" [...] and [...] "enter", and a display with three numbers of 5 decimal/octal digits, a two-digit program number, and a two-digit verb and a two-digit noun. The astronauts used it for all phases of command.|$|R
40|$|Novel {{chitosan}} (CS) -coated poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA) fibers (CS–PLA) {{were prepared}} by reaction of an alkali and CS under heat treatment without a chemical binder. These treatments induced hydrolysis on the PLA surface, formation of ionic bonds between the carboxyl {{groups of the}} PLA surface and the amino groups of CS, and dehydration between the carboxyls and amines. The prepared fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and mechanical strength tests. The presence of CS on the fiber surface was observed by the visual test of CS–PLA with amido black 10 B and confirmed by the amine ratio obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The coating thickness of CS {{on the surface of}} the PLA fibers was approximately 28 nm, as determined from calculations based on the results of Kjeldahl nitrogen analysis and elemental analysis. The degradation properties of CS–PLA were also investigated. These properties were apparently enhanced by hydrophilicity resulting from the CS-coating treatment. Furthermore, braided ropes prepared using CS–PLA became tight with increasing number of <b>core</b> <b>ropes.</b> Results indicate that the objective tensile strength and flexibility of the braided rope could be controlled by adjusting the number of core fibers...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{development}} of integrated read-only memory (ROM) circuits, permanent (or read-only) random-access memory was often constructed using diode matrices driven by address decoders, or specially wound <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> memory planes.|$|E
50|$|In old computers, {{magnetic}} storage {{was also used}} for primary storage in a form of magnetic drum, or core memory, <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> memory, thin film memory, twistor memory or bubble memory. Unlike modern computers, magnetic tape was also often used for secondary storage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Core</b> <b>rope</b> {{memory is}} a form of {{read-only}} memory (ROM) for computers, first used in the 1960s by early NASA Mars space probes and then in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) designed and programmed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Instrumentation Lab and built by Raytheon.|$|E
50|$|Shibori {{includes}} {{a form of}} tie-dye that originated in Japan and Indonesia. It has been practiced there {{since at least the}} 8th century. Shibori {{includes a}} number of labor-intensive resist techniques including stitching elaborate patterns and tightly gathering the stitching before dyeing, forming intricate designs for kimonos. Another shibori method is to wrap the fabric around a <b>core</b> of <b>rope,</b> wood or other material, and bind it tightly with string or thread. The areas of the fabric that are against the core or under the binding would remain undyed.|$|R
50|$|Rope is {{constructed}} in a linear fashion, {{and must be}} spliced together before carriers are affixed. Splicing involves unwinding long sections of {{either end of the}} rope, and then winding each strand from opposing ends around the <b>core.</b> Sections of <b>rope</b> must be removed, as the strands overlap during the splicing process.|$|R
50|$|Modern ropes {{are made}} from nylon and don't require {{a great deal of}} maintenance.

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] and Kraincanic recently developed two somewhat different theoretical models for analysing large-diameter wire ropes with either an independent wire <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> (IWRC) or a fibre core. Most importantly, unlike all of the previously available theories (with their often very lengthy mathematical formulations), very encouraging correlations have been found between Raoof and Kraincanic's theoretical predictions of wire rope axial stiffnesses and a fairly large body of experimental data from other sources, hence providing ample support for the reliability of both theoretical models. Raoof and Kraincanic's original models were, however, computer based and involved certain iterative procedures. This potential drawback for practical applications (in an area where, by tradition, {{the rule of thumb}} reigns supreme) is overcome in the present paper, which reports details of some simplified (but still accurate) procedures for predicting the no-slip and/or full-slip axial stiffnesses of wire ropes with either an independent wire <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> or a fibre core, with the proposed formulations being amenable to simple hand calculations using a pocket calculator, which is of value to busy practising engineers...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{manufacturer}} {{the basic}} principle of operation is the same. The cable has its outer layers {{wrapped around a}} metal cone, with the <b>rope's</b> <b>core</b> running {{through a hole in}} the middle of the cone. The assembly sits inside a conical outer body. When the cable is in tension, the action is such that the cone and wire are drawn further into the conical bore of the outer body resulting in a large reaction load. This load grips the wire and prevents further movement.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to {{ordinary}} coincident-current magnetic-core memory, {{which was used}} for RAM at the time, the ferrite cores in a <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> are just used as transformers. The signal from a word line wire passing through a given core is coupled to the bit line wire and interpreted as a binary [...] "one", while a word line wire that bypasses the core is not coupled to the bit line wire and is read as a [...] "zero". In the AGC, up to 64 wires could be passed through a single core.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{core memory}} called <b>core</b> <b>rope</b> memory {{provided}} read-only storage. In this case, the cores, which had more linear magnetic materials, were simply used as transformers; no information was actually stored magnetically within the individual cores. Each {{bit of the}} word had one core. Reading {{the contents of a}} given memory address generated a pulse of current in a wire corresponding to that address. Each address wire was threaded either through a core to signify a binary 1, or around the outside of that core, to signify a binary 0. As expected, the cores were much larger physically than those of read-write core memory. This type of memory was exceptionally reliable. An example was the Apollo Guidance Computer used for the moon landings.|$|E
50|$|The idea of TROS was {{to create}} a Read Only Storage method to contain {{computer}} microcode. There were several implementation methods used but one notable method used the same technology as core memory that was the primary method of computer memory used during the same period. The specific method was called <b>Core</b> <b>rope</b> memory which used a ferrite core with wires strung through the core like a standard core memory but in some cores one of the wires would be routed around the core itself. The routing of this wire determined the interpretation of a 1 or a 0 with 1 representing a wire that ran through the core and a zero representing a wire that looped around the core.|$|E
50|$|Apart from ropes, twines, {{and general}} cordage, sisal {{is used in}} {{low-cost}} and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire <b>rope</b> <b>cores,</b> and Macramé. Sisal has been utilized as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre {{is used in the}} cordage industry for making ropes, baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} for a cable puller to clarify the friction mechanism between a wire rope and steel grippers. In earlier works, some fundamental data such as friction coefficient, deformation and real contact area were obtained. This paper presents main factors affecting the friction based on the experiment varying apparent contact area and lubricants, and also observation of the deformation process. It is shown that the friction of the wire rope is hardly affected by the apparent contact area but significantly affected by the section shape of grippers. It is considered that high compressive load being mainly supported by 6 strands, rather than the <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> of a wire rope structure, is closely related to the friction mechanism...|$|R
40|$|A {{resolution}} {{to the question of}} whether coronal mass ejections are loops or bubbles is proposed and applied to the geometrical analysis of a solar wind event detected at 1 AU by ISEE 1 and 3. The discontinuity orientations, the size determined by time of passage, and the magnetic cloud signature are fit into the topology of a flux rope loop distorted by expansion into a thick rope with comparable dimensions in both the ecliptic and meridional planes. The looped rope fills a bubblelike cavity, thus preserving both types of proposed coronal mass ejection geometries. Other interesting features of the data include an apparent separation by the <b>rope</b> <b>core</b> of bidirectionally streaming protons in the leading section from electrons in the trailing section, possible vortical flow within the magnetic cloud, and a well-defined filamentary structure behind the shock...|$|R

Baseline testing at the laboratory was reported in an earlier publication.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of magnetic flux ropes observed by the four Cluster spacecraft during periods of magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a list of 21 Cluster encounters with the reconnection process in the period 2001 – 2006 identified in Borg et al. (2012), we present the distribution and characteristics of the flux ropes. We find 27 flux ropes embedded in the reconnection outflows of only 11 of the 21 reconnection encounters. Reconnection processes associated with no flux rope observations were not distinguishable from those where flux ropes were observed. Only 7 of the 27 flux ropes show evidence of enhanced energetic electron flux above 50 keV, {{and there was no}} clear signature of the flux rope in the thermal particle measurements.

40|$|This paper {{primarily}} {{examines the}} key factors {{being involved in}} precisely determining {{the sign of the}} core field in a magnetic flux rope (MFR) like structure embedded in the tailward plasma flow associated with the Earth's magnetotail. Magnetic flux ropes are frequently detected by satellites moving smoothly northwards (upwards) or southwards (downwards) and crossing almost the whole plasma sheet; the sign of the <b>rope's</b> <b>core</b> is associated with the local tail's motion: If the tail is bending to an upward or downward direction, then the sign of the <b>rope's</b> <b>core,</b> being essentially an intense By deviation, will be positive or negative correspondingly. On the basis of this observational finding, a major question concerns the mechanism by which the tail's motion is dictated. The reconnection process acting in the tail will obviously produce symmetric structures of MFRs (with respect to the neutral sheet plane); therefore, the detected organized asymmetry may be an additional indication in the whole magnetotail' s dynamics. Moreover, we discuss the issue of the core's sign in cases without any significant magnetotail's motion. A model interpreting the diagnosed behavior is introduced: Once a tailward ion jet is produced in a thinned plasma sheet, it might form clockwise or counterclockwise ion vortices (i. e., loop-like ion currents) providing the "magnetic core" with the appropriate sign. The crucial role of the interplanetary By deviation of the magnetic field (IMF) is scrutinized and taken into account. The whole model is tested under the condition of long-lasting extraordinary events characterized by a persistent-intense By deviation with a duration up to 34 min. This work, based on Geotail single-satellite measurements, is not a statistical one; it is a first approach allowing the reconstruction of measurements in the whole range of the magnetotail's deflections, from negligible up to stronger significant magnetotail movements, and should be therefore elucidated in more detail. The average duration for the studied ropes is 90 sec; they occur at distances greater than 25 RE from the Earth...|$|R

40|$|A {{rational}} analysis procedure {{consisting of a}} complete cycle of systematic calculations has been developed for the theoretical solutions of problems in describing the behavior of axially loaded complex ropes consisting of wires and strands, which were simulated as particle-motion models. In essence, axial and rotational strains of a rope were specified. Constitutive relations of the loaded wires and strands were obtained through compatibility of motion requirements. Material law was then imposed to determine the internal force of each wire.
