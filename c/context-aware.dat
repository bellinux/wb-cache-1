25|$|In the future, the Internet {{of things}} {{may be a}} {{non-deterministic}} and open network in which auto-organized or intelligent entities (Web services, SOA components), virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context information {{as well as the}} objects ability to detect changes in the environment, faults affecting sensors and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitute a major research trend, clearly needed to provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different technologies to support such <b>context-aware</b> automation but more sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor units to be deployed in real environments.|$|E
500|$|... iOS 6 {{features}} {{several new}} and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps. It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic. iOS 6 {{is able to}} retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has <b>context-aware</b> features such as notifications for relevant coupons when {{in the immediate vicinity}} of a given store.|$|E

50|$|A <b>context-aware</b> {{network is}} {{a network that}} tries to {{overcome}} {{the limitations of the}} dumb and intelligent network models and to create a synthesis which combines the best of both network models.

The Semantic Web is an example of a <b>context-aware</b> network.

50|$|In a <b>context-aware</b> network new {{applications}} may be composed from existing network applications. Techniques for modeling applications {{allow for the}} identification of applications that satisfy specific functional requirements as well as necessary nonfunctional requirements. This method allows applications to be {{described in terms of}} their overall purposes. So for example an application may describe a business process (see BPEL). The process can be linked to its larger objectives in the organization including its priority and consequences of failure. The <b>context-aware</b> network can use these descriptions in its function to handle conflict between incompatible applications in the accessing of resources or in the violation of higher level constraints. The <b>context-aware</b> network monitors application operation to ensure that they are compatible with higher level requirements and constraints and that conflicts are resolved in their light as well.|$|E

50|$|<b>Context-aware</b> {{services}} is a computing technology which incorporates {{information about the}} current location of a mobile user to provide more relevant services to the user. An example of a <b>context-aware</b> service could be a real-time traffic update or even a live video feed of a planned route for a motor vehicle user. Context can refer to real-world characteristics, such as temperature, time or location. This information can be updated by the user (manually) or from communication with other devices and applications or sensors on the mobile device.|$|E
50|$|<b>Context-aware</b> {{systems are}} a {{component}} of a ubiquitous computing or pervasive computing environment. Three important aspects of context are: where you are; who you are with; and what resources are nearby. Although location is a primary capability, location-aware does not necessarily capture things of interest that are mobile or changing. <b>Context-aware</b> in contrast is used more generally to include nearby people, devices, lighting, noise level, network availability, and even the social situation, e.g., whether you are with your family or a friend from school.|$|E
