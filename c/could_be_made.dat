5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E

5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script.

5|$|In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and {{captured}} Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. Æthelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He {{also managed to}} secure professions of obedience {{from a number of}} southern bishops, including Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in disputes in Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> on the dispute.|$|E

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1691, {{and a more}} refined one in 1716, he proposed that more accurate calculations <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> using measurements of a transit of Venus, although the next such event was not due until 1761. Halley died in 1742, but in 1761 numerous expeditions were made to {{various parts of the}} world so that precise observations of the transit <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{in order to make the}} calculations as described by Halley—an early example of international scientific collaboration. This collaboration was, however, underpinned by competition, the British, for example, being spurred to action only after they heard of French plans from Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. In an attempt to observe the first transit of the pair, astronomers from Britain, Austria and France traveled to destinations around the world, including Siberia, Newfoundland and Madagascar. Most managed to observe at least part of the transit, but successful observations were made in particular by Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason at the Cape of Good Hope. Less successful, at Saint Helena, were Nevil Maskelyne and Robert Waddington, although they put the voyage to good use by trialling the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.|$|E
5|$|In other articles, more {{focus was}} placed on the fact that Sun Bowl {{officials}} reached out to other schools of interest upon receiving Lafayette College’s original rejection of the bid. As seen in the article by Amarillo Daily News on November 24, 1948, rather than calling out Lafayette's claim as a fallacy, the paper focused on the fact that no further arrangements <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> with Lafayette College once Texas Miners officials had already reached out to the other schools.|$|E

During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed {{into the harbor}} of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941, landed reinforcements, and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. In early January 1942, she was severely damaged by German dive bombers. She made it to Novorossiysk, escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi, where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> These took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum.
