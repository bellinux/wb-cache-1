The first objective was to find commodities that are traded on the board that could potentially be used to <b>cross-hedge</b> cash purchased or grown alfalfa. Three commodities that are similar to alfalfa were selected. The commodities were soybeans, soybean meal, and No. 2 yellow corn. The fourth commodity used was crude oil because fuel is a large cost in the farming of alfalfa. Monthly average futures contract prices and monthly average cash prices of all of the commodities were found from 2005 to 2013. The monthly average cash prices paid to farmers in California and the U. S., the monthly average cash prices paid for alfalfa in the U.

40|$|When hedging in futures markets, {{the hedge}} {{instruments}} typically fail {{to match the}} exposed asset or portfolio by expiration date and/or underlying asset. The theoretical variance-minimizing hedge is given by the slope coefficient of the conditional (forward-looking) regression of the spot-price that one is exposed to on the futures price used as a hedge. We explore the hedging performance of simple rules of thumb and of unconditional regressions on past data, focusing {{on the effect of}} the choice of observation frequency, sample period, percentage vs. dollar returns, and lead/lag effects. Our findings are the following : (a) the effects of varying the observation frequency, sample period, etc., are much larger than the effects of using GARCH instead of OLS. (b) Regardless of sample size and estimation technique, the exposure is best estimated using percentage returns rather than (dollar) first differences. © In the case of delta hedges, and also a <b>cross-hedges</b> among closely related currencies, regressions are systematically beaten by naïve rules of thumb.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{proposes a}} {{multi-currency}} <b>cross-hedging</b> strategy that minimizes the exchange risk. The use of derivatives in {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) is not common but, despite its complexity, can be interesting for those with international activities. In particular, the reduction in the exchange risk borne through the use of natural multi-currency <b>cross-hedging</b> is measured, considering Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for measuring market risk instead of the variance. CVaR is minimized using linear programmes, while a multiobjective genetic algorithm is designed for minimizing VaR, considering two scenarios for each currency. The results obtained show that the optimal hedge strategy that minimizes VaR is different from the minimum CVaR hedge strategy. A very interesting point is that, just by investing in other currencies, a significant risk reduction in VaR and CVaR can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} an exporting firm that sells its output to two foreign countries, only one of which has futures and options available for its currency. The firm possesses smooth ambiguity preferences and faces multiple sources of ambiguous exchange rate risk. We show that the separation theorem fails to hold in that the firm's production and export decisions depend on the firm's attitude towards ambiguity and on the incident to the underlying ambiguity. Given that the random spot exchange rates are first-order independent with respect to each plausible subjective distribution, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the full-hedging theorem applies to the firm's <b>cross-hedging</b> decisions. When these conditions are violated, we show that the firm includes options in its optimal hedge position.

Minimum-VaR hedge ratios are found to be significantly lower than minimum-variance hedge ratios.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} dynamic hedging model for Government National Association Mortgage-Backed Securities (GNMA MBSs) that {{is free of}} the {{drawbacks}} associated with the static hedging strategies currently used. The simultaneity bias of the regression approach is dealt with by modeling the joint distribution of price changes of GNMA MBSs and 10 -year Treasury-note futures. Error correction (EC) terms from cointegrating relationships {{are included in the}} conditional mean equations to preserve the long-term equilibrium relationship of the two markets. The time-varying variance-covariance structure of the two markets is modeled via a version of the bivariate generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic model (bivariate GARCH), which assures that the time-varying variance-covariance matrix is positive semidefinite for all time periods. This dynamic error-correction GARCH model is estimated using daily data on six different coupon GNMA MBSs. Dynamic <b>cross-hedge</b> ratios are obtained from the time-varying variance-covariance matrix using the 10 -year Treasury-note futures contract as the hedging instrument. These ratios are evaluated in terms of both overall risk reduction and expected utility maximization. There is overwhelming evidence that dynamic hedge ratios are superior to static ones even when transaction costs are incorporated into the analysis.
