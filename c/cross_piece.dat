5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a single axle, {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage longerons by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> centre to the longerons. There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, fairly out. You {{will be more}} {{comfortable}} when we have lashed these <b>cross</b> <b>pieces.</b> You will not be lying, then, {{at the bottom of}} a bag; as you are now." ...|$|R
50|$|The entry {{stairs and}} front and side verandahs contain timber balustrades of {{diagonal}} <b>crossed</b> <b>pieces</b> and circular brackets below the eaves. The verandah roof drops {{in a shallow}} curve from below the eaves brackets of the main roof to its gutter line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Help if you can," [...] groaned Martin, as well he might, {{for with}} his naked {{shoulder}} wedged {{against one of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> of the door he was striving to press it to so that the bolt could be shot into its socket.|$|R
25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the churchyard}} {{is an ancient}} preaching cross, the base {{consisting}} of two large square blocks which are probably medieval. [...] The tall octagonal shaft and <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> were possibly added when the cross was repaired in the late 18thor early 19thcentury. [...] The cross is listed at GradeII, and is a scheduled monument.|$|E
2500|$|The sign is a [...] classic {{roadside}} pole design, mounted offset on two flat poles {{which are}} joined by a <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> at the top. The poles extend above {{the top of the}} sign. The sign is a horizontally stretched diamond shape, with the top and bottom angles pointed while the side angles are rounded. It is double-backed, internally lit, with a border of flashing and chasing yellow incandescent bulbs outside around the perimeter. In a nod to Nevada's nickname as [...] "the Silver State," [...] {{across the top of the}} sign are white neon circles, designed to represent silver dollars. The circles each contain a red painted letter, outlined in neon, which together form the word [...] "Welcome." [...] Crowning the sign, located between the two poles and just under the crosspiece is an eight-pointed, red-painted metal star outlined with yellow neon.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The south porch {{doors are}} by the {{architect}} Henry Wilson. A complex work in bronze, the door contains 10 panels with New Testament scenes, and two door handles with cherubic heads. A further eight heads {{are on the}} <b>cross</b> <b>pieces.</b> Above, Christ and angel with doves.|$|R
50|$|Noguchi's three-legged {{balsa wood}} set {{consisted}} of stylized weapon-like elements, two <b>crossed</b> <b>pieces</b> resembling spears and an arrow-shaped member, supporting a fourth horizontal component evocative of an open-mouthed viper. The thick coil {{that makes up}} Judith's bracelet is also serpentine in nature, while the headpiece suggests rams' horns.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} clearance for {{vehicles on the}} bridge deck originally was between 14 ft and 15 ft, but after multiple instances of tall trucks striking the bridge, work was undertaken in 2006-07 to move certain <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> {{in order to increase}} the vertical clearance on the roadway by about 2 feet.|$|R
2500|$|The Mussel II {{also spent}} time as both landplane and seaplane. [...] Until March 1930 both Mussels had used {{what was in}} the UK at least the {{standard}} two float configuration. In that month a single long central float arrangement, similar to one built by Shorts for a de Havilland Gipsy Moth the previous summer. The single float required wing tip stabilising floats, and these were strutted to the outer wing and braced with another pair of struts inboard, meeting the underside of the wing at the same point as the wing compression struts above, so running almost co-linearly with them and giving a shallow cross like look to the aircraft from the front. [...] In its original form this undercarriage was amphibious, with main wheels mounted on a streamlined <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> on the float, as on the Moth. [...] The main axle could be rotated from the cockpit by turning a handwheel and hence raising or lowering the mainwheels. [...] The water rudder on the float was reinforced to act as a small tailskid for use on land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{intersecting}} {{vertical and}} horizontal lines of the star extend over and wrap around the frame that is created by the two poles and the <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> which give the star a dynamic, explosive appearance. The cabinet is faced with translucent white plastic and covered with blue and red painted text. The {{south side of the}} sign reads [...] "Welcome" [...] inside the silver dollars, with [...] "to Fabulous" [...] in blue, in a 1950s-style cursive, underneath. The words [...] "Las Vegas" [...] are on the next line in red, all capitalized, and large, almost filling the width of the sign. Under [...] "Las Vegas" [...] is the word [...] "Nevada" [...] in blue, all capitalized, in a much smaller font. On the back or north side, which is less frequently photographed and thus is lesser known, the sign reads [...] "Drive" [...] on the top line and [...] "Carefully" [...] on the second in red capital letters, with [...] "Come Back" [...] in blue on the third line, in script, and [...] "Soon" [...] all capitalized in blue on the fourth line. The design is characteristic of the Googie architecture movement.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole house}} was built upon the plan of a T, but a T with a very long <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> and a very short tail piece. The long <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> was the {{frontage}} that ran along in face of the street, with the front door in the middle; it was two stories high, and contained nearly all the important rooms. The short tail piece, which ran out at the back immediately opposite the front door, was one story high, and consisted only of two long rooms, the one leading into the other. The first of these two rooms was the study in which the celebrated Mr. Quinton wrote his wild Oriental poems and romances. The farther room was a glass conservatory full of tropical blossoms of quite unique and almost monstrous beauty, and on such afternoons as these glowing with gorgeous sunlight. Thus when the hall door was open, many a passer-by literally stopped to stare and gasp; for he looked down a perspective of rich apartments to something really like a transformation scene in a fairy play: purple clouds and golden suns and crimson stars that were at once scorchingly vivid and yet transparent and far away.|$|E
60|$|They had, indeed, before {{beginning}} to saw up the bamboos, fastened the blanket {{to one of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> of the stretcher and, cutting this to the width of the passage, had jammed it close up to the roof; so that the curtain, hanging down, effectually shut off the light.|$|R
50|$|The {{key feature}} of the qamutiik {{is that it does}} not use nails or pins to hold the runners and <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> in place. Each piece is drilled and lashed {{providing}} a flexibility of movement that can endure the pounding of travel on open sea ice, frozen land, ice floes and across the heavy ice of tidal zones.|$|R
50|$|Toggles are {{horizontal}} <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> {{that run}} between the stiles or studs. The number and placement of toggles {{depends on the}} type of flat. The length of the toggles is the total width of the flat minus the combined width of the stiles (3 ft, for a 4 x 8 ft, soft-cover flat constructed of 2+1/2 in, stiles).|$|R
60|$|Rafts.--Rafts of Wood.--Rafts {{are made}} of logs of wood, held {{together}} by pairs of cross-bars, one of each pair lying above the raft and the other below; then, the whole may be made quite firm by a little judicious notching wherethe logs cross, and a few pegs and lashings. Briers, woodbines, etc., will do for these. If the logs are large, they should be separately launched into the river, and towed into their proper places. Outriggers vastly increase the stability of a raft. The raft-fastening in common use is shown in f. 1: it is a stout, little wand, bent over the <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> and wedged into holes in the framework.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{put up by}} men {{who make}} a {{business}} of it. There is one boat of them sails backwards and forwards where the river begins to narrow above Sheerness, and every ship that goes up or down pays them something according to her size. Others cruise about with long poles, putting them in the sands wherever one gets washed away. They have got different marks on them. A single <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> or two cross pieces, or a circle, or a diamond; so that each sand has got its own particular mark. These are known to the masters of all ships that {{go up and down}} the river, and so they can tell exactly where they are, and what course to take. At night they anchor, for there would be no possibility of finding the way up or down in the dark. I have heard tell from mariners who have sailed abroad that there ain't a place anywhere with such dangerous sands as those we have got here {{at the mouth of the}} Thames." ...|$|E
60|$|Lathes may be wanted by a traveller, {{because the}} pulleys {{necessary}} for a large sailing-boat, and the screw of a carpenter's bench, cannot be made without one. The sketch will recall to mind the original machine, now almost forgotten in England, but still in common use on the Continent. It is obvious that makeshift contrivances {{can be set up}} on this principle, two steady points being the main things wanted. A forked bough suffices for a treadle. A very common Indian lathe consists of two tent-pegs, two nails for the points; a leather thong, and some makeshift hand-rest; neither pole nor treadle is used, but an assistant takes one end of the thong in one hand, and the other end in the other hand, and hauls away in a see-saw fashion. For turning hollows, a long spike is used instead of a short point: then, a hole is bored into the wood to the depth of the intended hollow, and the spike is pushed forward until it abuts against the bottom of the hole. One form of lathe is simplicity itself: two thick stakes are driven in the ground, so far apart as to include the object to be turned; a <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> is lashed to them (by a creeper cut out of the jungle), for the double purpose of holding them together, and of serving as a rest for the gouge. The object is turned with a thong, as already described.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{arranging}} a rigid {{structure is}} to make the <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> solid enough to act in compression and then to connect their ends with an outer diamond acting in tension. This method was once common on monoplanes, where the wing and a central cabane or a pylon form the cross members while wire bracing forms the outer diamond.|$|R
50|$|The {{new church}} {{was built in}} 1891 on {{the place where the}} old church tower once stood. The {{architect}} was Andreas Clemmensen who was involved in the design of Christiansborg Palace. Built in the Romanesque style, it consists of a tower, nave, chancel and apse together with two <b>cross</b> <b>pieces.</b> The outer wall is granite from the nearby Paradis quarry.|$|R
60|$|The men set cheerfully to work, {{under his}} directions. In his chest was a hatchet, saw, and chisels. With these, young trees of {{flexible}} wood were cut down and split. A keel was laid, 25 feet in length. <b>Cross</b> <b>pieces,</b> 12 feet long, were pegged to this by trenails--nails formed of tough and hard wood. The <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> were then bent upwards, and {{fastened to the}} strips which were to form the gunwale. Strengthening pieces were placed along, at distances of 7 or 8 inches apart, and firmly lashed. When the whole was finished, after three days' labor, {{the framework of a}} boat 25 feet long, 3 feet deep, and 7 feet in beam stood upon the beach. A barrel of oil had been thrown ashore and, with this, the mate intended thoroughly to soak the canvas with which the frame was to be covered. The boat would, he calculated, carry the whole of the men, with an ample store of food and water for the voyage.|$|R
50|$|Standing between 7m and 9m high, it {{comprises}} two upright timber poles supporting a horizontal <b>cross</b> <b>piece.</b> The <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> comprises double wooden beams fastened {{either side of}} the top of each upright. Diagonal wooden braces are fixed to each end of the <b>cross</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pulley {{wheels are}} {{fixed to the}} top of the <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> so that the wheels turn between the two beams. Two wheels are fitted to the centre of the <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> and a single wheel at the {{southern}} end. Steel cable runs through the pulley wheels. A hook is suspended at the end of the cable.|$|E
50|$|The Hammer of Thor {{consists}} of three rocks stacked {{on top of each}} other—a vertical shaft, a <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> and a capstone. The vertical column, or shaft, measures about 8 ft tall; the <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> is about 4.5 ft long; and the capstone is 14 in in height. The entire monument stands about 3.3 m high; and has been estimated to weigh about 4000 lb.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is L-shaped, with a service wing to the rear, and has verandahs {{on three sides}} to two levels. It has a hipped roof linking to a gabled roof running over the service wing. The street-facing gable projects and is decorated with a finial and <b>cross</b> <b>pieces.</b> Chimneys with double clay pots rise above the roof line. The verandah has a skillion roof.|$|R
60|$|Not the {{slightest}} sound was made, as the eight men crossed the short {{distance to the}} palisade and passed through the opening where the others, spear in hand, were awaiting them; ready to rush in and {{take part in the}} fray, should an alarm be given. Stanley breathed a great sigh of relief, as they passed out. A few paces further they halted, and the <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> were lashed to the poles.|$|R
5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|R
50|$|Sword: Twofold twists {{form the}} <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> with one short and one long bubble forming {{the handle and}} blade.|$|E
5000|$|Two locomotives, rigidly {{connected}} {{together by a}} <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> which spans the channel, with the locomotives travelling on the channel's banks.|$|E
50|$|A punt pole {{differs from}} the Fenland quant in {{that it does not}} have a <b>cross</b> <b>piece</b> at the top, and from the more {{generally}} used setting pole in that it only has a metal shoe on one end.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{materials}} are cut, he and the family prepare it though a process of selection and cleaning, generally splitting the reeds and bamboo in two or more lengths. Then they are soaked for over twelve hours and left covered to maintain moisture. Standing at his worktable, he pulls the needed pieces. Thicker ones are used for support, sometimes with <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> for larger works. He usually leaves the finished product unpainted but sometimes adds brown blotches by lightly burning certain areas.|$|R
50|$|Weeks and his Marines of the 4th Platoon disembarked from Kane; twenty men and two {{officers}} loaded onto one Higgins landing craft while the remaining ten loaded onto two rubber boats, which were towed in line astern to the Higgins boat. During the first 2000 yards, due to heavy seas, the towing rings were {{pulled out of}} both rubber boats and the Marines attempted to maintain the movement by grasping the towline and bracing their feet against the rubber <b>cross</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
