The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods,</b> your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E

Interviews were conducted with two teachers who chose to use a specific method, Writing to Read (WTR), for teaching pupils to read, and with two teachers who had not chosen a specific <b>method.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{the study was to}} compare how the teachers worked, their motives for their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method,</b> and the ideas the teachers have about early literacy learning. To see whether the teachers’ <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> was related to the individualization of the teaching and their views of pupils’ learning in interaction, Vygotsky’s theories about children’s learning have been used. The result shows that there are both similarities and differences in the teachers’ reasons for their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method.</b> Those who use WTR say that they do so to be able to individualize the teaching, while the teachers who do not use a specific method use the same arguments. There is a difference in whether the teachers aim for structured or unstructured teaching, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method.</b> Several parallels to Vygotsky’s theories were found, in that all four teachers, irrespective <b>of</b> <b>method,</b> think that their teaching should be characterized by interaction and individualization...|$|R

Theoretically, it should have been the easiest of tasks, but in practice there were plenty of obstacles to success. He tried the lower windows, but they were firmly fixed. There had been a time when one of them would yield to a hard kick and fly bodily out of its frame, but somebody had been caught playing that game not long before, and Jim remembered with a pang that not only had the window been securely fastened up, but the culprit had had a spell of extra tuition and other punishments which had turned him for the time into a hater of his species. His own fate, he knew, would be even worse, for a prefect is supposed to have something better to do in his spare time than breaking into pavilions. It would mean expulsion perhaps, or, at the least, the loss of his prefect's cap, and Jim did not want to lose that. Still the thing had to be done if he meant to score any marks at all in the forthcoming exam. He wavered a while between a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods,</b> and finally fixed on the crudest of all. No one was likely to be within earshot, thought he, so he picked up the largest stone he could find, took as careful aim as the dim light would allow, and hove it. There was a sickening crash, loud enough, he thought, to bring the whole School down on him, followed by a prolonged rattle as the broken pieces of glass fell to the ground.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} and descriptive essay discusses pharmaceutical companies’ financial reporting {{of research and}} development expenditures, if separate acquisitions and development expenditure for internally generated intangible assets are expensed or capitalized, and the reason for this. The problem statements are: How do pharmaceutical companies report their development and research expenditures? Why do pharmaceutical companies choose to expense or capitalize their separate acquisitions and development expenditures for internally generated intangible assets? Interviews have been conducted with pharmaceutical companies that comply with IFRS in their consolidated reporting and which conduct research and development. It is internally generated intangible assets and separate acquisitions that are in focus of this study. Since 2005 it is mandatory for publicly listed companies in the EU to apply to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) in their consolidated reporting. Since IFRS rules are principle based this allows for a more flexible application of accounting standards, which contributes to a subjective interpretation. Expenditures for research and development should be reported either by direct expensing in the income statement or capitalization as an intangible asset in the balance sheet if certain criteria according to IAS 38 are met. <b>Choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> affects the company´s key ratios along with the balance and income statements and it is the companies themselves which are to determine whether these conditions are met or not. Institutional theory has been used to establish whether companies’ <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> expensing or capitalizing can be explained through different forms of isomorphism, habits and practices, or if <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> is based on the organization and its environment´s mutual dependency and how the stake holders will perceive the company. Evidence shows that it is mainly coercive isomorphism through laws and regulations that govern the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method,</b> but also habits and practices as well as mimetic isomorphism to achieve legitimacy affect <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R
