40|$|ABSTRACT-The endoskeletal {{structure}} of tumor cells with a characteristic <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormality</b> Initiated In rat liver by the In vivo {{administration of the}} carcinogen dlethylnltrosamlne was studied In clonal cell lines established and propagated In vitro. The bulk of the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane protein was removed by extraction with Trlton X- 100, and subsequently the Juxtanuclear detergent-Insoluble fraction containing filaments of 100 - 150 A was released Into cltrate buffer at pH 2. 8. Analysis of this fraction by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamlde gel electropho-resis revealed the presence of five major proteins that banded with apparent molecular weights of about 66, 57, 52, 48, and 43 x 103, the last of which comlgrated with actin. The proteins thus resembled those from Intermediate-sized filaments of both the vlmentln (57 X 1 OS) and the prekeratln types obtained from various vertebrate cells. They also appeared {{to be related to}} the poly...|$|E

Abnormalities {{appeared to be the}} cause of {{male sterility}} in plants, we carried out this research in an attempt to make clear the characteristics and inheritance of this male sterility. In Plantago ovata germplasm <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormality</b> was found to be the cause of abnormality. cytomixis varied from 2 % to 48 % in plants. Maximum numbers of PMCs carrying B-chromosomes were recorded in male sterile plants of line JI- 214 (62 %). No B-chromosomes were observed in fertile, sterile and partial male sterile line of JI- 107 and maximum abnormal chromosomal segregation was recorded in JI- 206. These cytological abnormality parameters can be used for hetrosis breeding and hybrid seed production to improve quality of psyllium.

40|$|Background: Abnormal oocyte {{morphology}} {{has been}} associated with the hormonal environment to which the gametes are exposed. Objective: In this study, we evaluated the oocytes morphology, fertilization rate, embryos quality, and implantation rate resulted of retrieved oocytes in different times after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Materials and Methods: A total of 985 metaphase II oocytes were retrieved 35, 36, 37 and 38 h after the injection of HCG as groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Oocyte morphology was divided into (I) normal morphology, (II) extracytoplasmic <b>abnormalities,</b> (III) <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and (IV) intracytoplasmic vacuoles and in each group, oocytes were evaluated according to this classification. Results: Extracytoplasmic abnormalities were encountered in 17. 76 % and 31. 1 % of these oocytes (groups 3 and 4 respectively, p= 0. 007) in comparison with 12. 23 % group 2. <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in group 4 were higher than other groups. 23. 88 % (p= 0. 039) and 43. 25 % (p= 0. 089) of resulted 2 PN (two pronucleus) from groups 3 and 4 showed grade Z 3 respectively in comparison to group 2 (16. 44 %). Normal and various categories of abnormal oocytes did not differ regarding fertilization and cleavage rates (p= 0. 061). However, group 4 showed significant difference in the rate of embryos fragmentation (grade III and IV embryo) in comparison with group 2 (40. 96 % vs. 24. 93 %, p= 0. 078). The pregnancy rate was higher in G 2 and G 3 groups (28. 5 and 24. 13 % respectively). Conclusion: Oocyte retrieval time following HCG priming affected on oocyte morphology, 2 PN pattern and embryos qualities subsequently. Both good quality embryo formation and pregnancy outcomes were noticeably higher when oocytes were retrieved 36 h after HCG priming in ART program...|$|R
40|$|Over 40 {{years have}} elapsed since the {{large-scale}} {{introduction of the}} cervical-cancer smear as a cancer detection tool. The smear, which consists of a sample of cells from the epithelial surfaces of the uterine cervix, is colloquially known as the "Pap test, " after its discoverer, George N. Papanicolaou.

However, the test is prone to disturbing failures (5). Theoretically, at least, the test is quite simple: the cell samples, placed on microscope slides and appropriately stained, are stud-ied under the microscope by trained cytotechnologists.

40|$|Established 72 / 22 rat hepatic tumor cells, which bear well-characterized <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of {{intermediate}} filament (IF) network organization, form monolayer "sheets" of tightly juxtaposed {{epithelial cells}} at high culture population densities.

" 72 / 22 cells formed desmosomal junctions throughout the length of the cellular perimeter. Compared with low population density cultures, fully confluent sheets of 72 / 22 cells exhibited a down-regulated cytoskeletal actin content and increased level of cytokeratin synthesis. Despite gross IF cytoarchitectural abnormalities, 72 / 22 cells normally modulated the content of specific structural elements within both the IF and microfilament networks in response to increasing cell-cell contact. Furthermore, these data support the concept that neither the structural integrity nor the topographic distribution of the desmosome array are dependent on tonofilament anchorage or IF scaffold organization...|$|R

Gliomas represent the most frequently diagnosed tumours of the central nervous system in adults. Warburg hypothesized the importance of glycolysis in cancer cells, and implicated additional roles of mitochondria in neoplasia. Recent data have shown the importance of mitochondria in the tumourigenic phenotype, in particular, within the apoptotic process. There have been a variety of studies conducted on brain tumours revealing significant alterations of mitochondria within the tumourigenic phenotype. This review describes some of the more recent findings of mitochondria and gliomas, correlating findings to those observed in other cancers. Alterations in mitochondrial DNA copy number and location, as well as dependence of the cancer cell phenotype on mitochondria are emphasised. In addition to its role in apoptosis, the mitochondrion serves as an important element in the tumourigenic phenotype, and clinical approaches targeting this organelle have potential for the development of effective treatment regimens for patients with glioma and other neoplastic diseases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEvaluation of {{megakaryocyte}} morphology {{is difficult}} {{but can be}} essential for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other myeloid neoplasms. We agreed upon descriptions and provided images of megakaryoblasts and of normal and dysplastic megakaryocytes, which were used {{as a basis for}} assessing the concordance of expert morphologists in their recognition. We showed a high rate of concordance for the recognition of micromegakaryocytes and confirmed their strong association with hematologic neoplasia, including MDS. Concordance was also found to be good for the recognition of multinucleated megakaryocytes, which showed a significant association with MDS. However <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were found not to be useful in MDS recognition. The occurrence of appreciable numbers of nonlobulated and hypolobulated megakaryocytes in individuals without a myeloid neoplasm was confirmed. We demonstrated that subjects without a myeloid neoplasm can have some megakaryocytes that are assessed as ‘dysplastic’ or ‘possibly dysplastic’ and that to avoid over diagnosis of dysplasia, ‘possibly dysplastic’ forms should be excluded from the count of dysplastic cells. Our results demonstrate that the nature as well as the presence of megakaryocyte dysplasia is important in the diagnosis of MDS; although evaluation of 30 megakaryocytes is strongly recommended, {{it may be possible to}} recognize diagnostically important dysplasia when fewer megakaryocytes are present but highly diagnostic forms are seen...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{elevated}} {{body mass index}} (BMI) on the oocyte quality was investigated in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. A total of 268 patients classified {{on the basis of}} BMI subject to the first reproductive treatment were included in this study: the normal weight (NW) group consisted of 160 patients with BMI 19 - 24. 9 kg/m(2) and the overweight (OW) group consisted of 108 patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2). All women were treated with a standard long luteal protocol. The oocyte features were classified as extracytoplasmic or <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Outcomes were oocyte morphology, embryo quality, fertilization and implantation rates, and the ovarian response to stimulation. A higher percentage of oocytes with granular cytoplasm was found in women with BMI ≥ 25 (p = 0. 04). However, percentages of mature, immature oocytes and germinal vesicle were similar in both groups. No differences were found in fertilization and cleavage rates and percentages of embryo quality. The implantation rate (p < 0. 001) was significantly lower in the OW group than in the NW group. The amount of gonadotrophins was significantly higher in OW group (p = 0. 003). These findings suggest that the poor reproductive outcome of obese women is influenced by the release of ova with reduced fertilization potential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{clinical}} outcomes of ovarian stimulation with either GnRH-agonist or GnRH-antagonist analogues for {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) being well analysed, the effect of analogues on oocyte/embryo quality and embryo development is still not known in detail. The aim of this case-control study was to compare the efficacy of a multiple-dose GnRH antagonist protocol {{with that of the}} GnRH agonist long protocol with a view to oocyte and embryo quality, embryo development and IVF treatment outcome. Methods Between October 2001 and December 2008, 100 patients were stimulated with human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) and GnRH antagonist in their first treatment cycle for IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). One hundred combined GnRH agonist + HMG (long protocol) cycles were matched to the GnRH antagonist + HMG cycles by age, BMI, baseline FSH levels and by cause of infertility. We determined the number and quality of retrieved oocytes, the rate of early-cleavage embryos, the morphology and development of embryos, as well as clinical pregnancy rates. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's matched pairs rank sum test and McNemar's chi-square test. P Results The rate of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in retrieved oocytes was significantly higher with the use of GnRH antagonist than in GnRH agonist cycles (62. 1 % vs. 49. 9 %; P Conclusion Antagonist seemed to influence favourably some parameters of early embryo development dynamics, while other morphological parameters seemed not to be altered according to GnRH analogue used for ovarian stimulation in IVF cycles. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{accompanying}} paper {{describes the}} effects of applied electric fields on the morphogenesis and patterns of wall deposition of growing cells of Micrasterias denticulata. This paper details {{the effects of}} electric fields (~ 14 V cm" 1) on the subcellular components of Micrasterias, including {{a description of the}} plasma membrane of growing semi-cells as visualized by freeze-fracturing. There are no gross <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> or asymmetries in the distributions of cyto-plasmic organelles caused by the fields. In particular, neither the Large Vesicles nor Dark Vesicles are concentrated in the cathode-facing (CF) halves of lobes oriented perpendicular to the fields, where extra deposition of wall material has been shown to occur. In freeze-fracture replicas, there are about twice as many plasma membrane particles near the tips of growing lobes as there are in proximal regions of the lobes. Additionally, rosettes, consisting of 6 membrane particles, are seen predominantly in the distal parts of the lobes, and these rosettes are believed to be important in the synthesis of cell wall microfibrils. The applied fields cause a large asymmetry in the distributions of membrane particles, with larger numbers being found on the CF sides of lobes oriented perpendicular to the fields. We were not able to detect a specific effect on any class of particles. Taken all together, the data support the hypothesis that some of the factors responsible for growth localization in Micrasterias reside in the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cytochalasin B on three {{different}} biological {{systems have been}} studied with cytological methods. Cytochalasin B stops immediately the cleavage of Tunicate eggs, without preventing nuclear multiplication; however, the mitotic apparatuses are disorganized, {{as indicated by the}} presence of cytasters and anastral mitoses. Cytochalasin B produces fusion of the nucleoli and strong condensation of the chromosomes in amphibian oocytes. It does not prevent progesterone induced maturation; but the latter is always abnormal and abortive. Cytochalasin is much more toxic for anucleate than for nucleate fragments of Acetabularia.

40|$|Ischemia-reperfusion {{injury is}} {{a major cause of}} early graft {{dysfunction}} after liver transplantation. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a natural amidated hydrophilic bile salt, protects from cholestasis and hepatocellular damage in a variety of experimental models, as well as from ischemia-reperfusion injury. We investigated in the human liver transplantation setting the effect of the addition of TUDCA at time of liver harvesting and cold storage on the intra- and postoperative enzyme release and liver histopathology at the end of cold storage, at reperfusion, and 7 days after transplantation. METHODS: Eighteen patients undergoing elective liver transplantation were studied, including 6 serving as controls. In six patients, TUDCA was added to the University of Wisconsin solution used during harvesting and cold storage, to reach final concentrations of 2 mM. In three of these patients, TUDCA (3 g) was infused in the portal vein of the donor before organ explantation; in the other three cases, TUDCA was given through both routes. RESULTS: The use of TUDCA did not cause adverse events. The release of aspartate aminotransferase in the inferior vena cava blood during liver flushing was significantly lower (P= 0. 05) in TUDCA-treated than in control grafts, as were cytolytic enzyme levels in peripheral blood during the first postoperative week (P< 0. 02). At electron microscopy, an overt endothelial damage (cytoplasmic vacuolization, cell leakage, and destruction with exposure of hepatocytes to the sinusoidal lumen) was invariably found in control grafts, both at reperfusion and at day 7 after transplant. These features were significantly ameliorated by TUDCA (P< 0. 001). Several ultrastructural <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of hepatocytes were seen. Among these, damage to mitochondria matrix and crystae was significantly reduced in TUDCA-treated versus control grafts (P< 0. 01). Mild to severe damage of bile canaliculi was a constant feature in control biopsies, with dilatation of canalicular lumen and loss of microvilli. Both these abnormalities were markedly ameliorated (P< 0. 001 by TUDCA). The best preservation was observed when TUDCA was given through both routes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of TUDCA during harvesting and cold storage of human liver is associated with significant protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The clinical significance of this findings must be studied...|$|R

Quality of collected sperm including concentration, motility, live sperm, <b>abnormality,</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> droplet, intact acrosomal cap (IAC), and intact plasma membrane (IPM) were evaluated. Results showed that mean of sperm concentration, percentages of motility, live sperm, <b>abnormality,</b> <b>cytoplasmic</b> droplet, IAC, and IPM of fresh epididymal sperm were 13, 993. 33 million/ml, 70. 83, 82. 83, 10. 83, 8. 5, 85. 83, and 81. 33 %, respectively. Sperm quality after equilibration for LS and GL were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than KT. Mean percentages of post thawing sperm motility, live sperm, IAC, and IPM for GL (45, 54. 5, 47. 83, and 48. 83 %) were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than LS (40, 49. 17, 43. 83, and 44. 5 %), and KT (35, 42. 5, 39. 17, and 41. 5 %). Mean percentages of post thawing sperm motility, live sperm, IAC, and IPM for LS were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than those of KT.

40|$|Continuous {{regeneration}} of {{digestive enzyme}} (zymogen) -secreting chief cells {{is a normal}} aspect of stomach function that is disrupted in precancerous lesions (e. g. metaplasias, chronic atrophy). The cellular and genetic pathways that underlie zymogenic cell (ZC) differentiation are poorly understood. Here, we describe a gene expression analysis of laser capture microdissection purified gastric cell populations that identified the bHLH transcription factor Mist 1 as a potential ZC regulatory factor. Our molecular and ultrastructural analysis of proliferation, migration and differentiation of the gastric unit in Mist 1 (-/-) and control mice supports a model whereby wild-type ZC progenitors arise as neck cells in the proliferative (isthmal) zone of the gastric unit and become transitional cells (TCs) with molecular and ultrastructural characteristics of both enzyme-secreting ZCs and mucus-secreting neck cells as they migrate to the neck-base zone interface. Thereafter, they rapidly differentiate into mature ZCs {{as they enter the}} base. By contrast, Mist 1 (-/-) neck cells differentiate normally, but ZCs in the mature, basal portion of the gastric unit uniformly exhibit multiple apical <b>cytoplasmic</b> structural <b>abnormalities.</b> This defect in terminal ZC differentiation is also associated with markedly increased abundance of TCs, especially in late-stage TCs that predominantly have features of immature ZCs. Thus, we present an in vivo system for analysis of ZC differentiation, present molecular evidence that ZCs differentiate from neck cell progenitors and identify Mist 1 as the first gene with a role in this clinically important process...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) as a {{signaling}} molecule plays crucial {{roles in}} many abiotic stresses in plant development processes, including pollen tube growth. Here, the signaling networks dominated by NO during cold stress that inhibited Camellia sinensis pollen tube growth are investigated in vitro. Cytological analysis show that cold-induced NO {{is involved in}} the inhibition of pollen tube growth along with disruption of the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + gradient, increase in ROS content, acidification of <b>cytoplasmic</b> pH and <b>abnormalities</b> in organelle ultrastructure and cell wall component distribution in the pollen tube tip. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) -related to signaling pathway, such as NO synthesis, cGMP, Ca 2 +, ROS, pH, actin, cell wall and MAPK cascade signal pathways, are identified and quantified using transcriptomic analyses and qRT-PCR, which indicate a potential molecular mechanism for the above cytological results. Taken together, these findings suggest that a complex signaling network dominated by NO, including Ca 2 +, ROS, pH, RACs signaling and the crosstalk among them, is stimulated in the C. sinensis pollen tube in response to cold stress, which further causes secondary and tertiary alterations, such as ultrastructural abnormalities in organelles and cell wall construction, ultimately resulting in perturbed pollen tube extension...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To study {{morphological}} {{findings in}} the tracheal epithelium of dogs exposed to the inhalation of poorly conditioned gases under use of an endotracheal tube (ET) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). METHODS: Twelve dogs randomly were allocated to two groups: ET group (n- 6) and LMA group (n- 6), anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated, without CO 2 reabsorption. Haemodynamic and ventilatory parameters, tympanic temperature, temperature, relative and absolute humidity of the ambient and inhaled gases were analyzed during three hours. The animals were submitted to euthanasia and biopsies were carried out along the tracheal segment to morphological study. Three healthy dogs were used to morphological control.

40|$|Malignant {{lymphoma}} is {{the general}} term applied to any neoplastic disorder of lymphoid tissue, including Hodgkin's disease and reticulum cell sarcoma. This group of neoplasms {{are among the most}} commonly occurring spontaneous neoplasms of sheep in New Zealand, being exceeded in frequency only by carcinomas of the small intestine and primary neoplasms of the liver. It has not been established whether malignant lymphoma is of sporadic or enzootic occurrence in this country, but from limited epidemiological observations in which on two occasions the disease was seen in two animals from the same property, {{it is possible that the}} latter distribution occurs. This and most other series indicate that mature sheep are most frequently affected but the disease does occur in younger sheep and lambs. A study has been made of the pathology of ovine malignant lymphoma, based on 22 cases, most of which were collected from slaughter-houses and histological material from a further 18 cases filed previously at this laboratory. In nearly all cases nodular or diffuse lesions, consisting of accumulations of invasive neoplastic cells of lymphoid origin, were distributed widely throughout the body. Gross evidence of tumour in the lymph nodes was present in all except three cases of the disease. This involvement was usually multiple, with many of the carcass and visceral lymph nodes containing tumours. The spleen contained neoplastic lesions in 73 per cent. of the cases examined. Of the non-lymphoid organs affected by malignant lymphoma, the liver, kidney, bone marrow, heart, small intestine and abomasum predominated. Of the 40 cases examined, 37 were classified as lymphosarcomas and three as reticulum cell sarcomas. The degree of cellular differentiation in the lymphosarcomas varied from primitive lymphoblastoid to well differentiated lymphocytic cell types, with the less differentiated forms being more common. Some nuclear and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> which have previously been described as being non-specific in other types of neoplasms were seen in specimens from 10 cases which were examined with an electron microscope. Support for the hypothesis that "malignant lymphoma of sheep is transmissible" was sought by attempts to experimentally transmit this disease to lambs using intraperitoneal injections of cell-free tumour extracts during gestation or within 12 hr of birth. To date none of these sheep, which are only three years old, have developed overt neoplasia but 20 of them have developed elevated numbers of circulating lymphocytes. This has persisted for periods of two years or more and there is evidence to indicate that this should be interpreted as a preclinical phase of malignant lymphoma. To investigate an hypothesis that malignant lymphoma of sheep is due to infection by an oncorna virus, electron microscopic examinations were made on specimens from fresh tumour as well as on preparations from tissue cultures which had been inoculated with various ovine lymphoid tumour homogenates. These studies were inconclusive and it was not until cultures of phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes derived from the sheep with experimentally transmitted lymphocytosis were examined that virus-like particles, consistent with the morphology of "type-A" oncorna viruses could be demonstrated. They were present in membrane-limited vacuoles and cytoplasm of these cells and less frequently extra-cellularly in the five experimentally inoculated sheep examined but were not present in any of the lymphocytes from an equal number of control sheep. Lymphocyte cultures from 15 of the experimentally inoculated sheep showed sensitization to antigens in ovine malignant lymphoma homogenates when tested by a macrophage migration inhibition test. This test also demonstrated the presence of common tumour specific antigens in five of the six tumour extracts used either for sheep inoculations or in testing for macrophage inhibitory factor production. In an attempt to accelerate the development of overt neoplasia in three of the experimentally inoculated animals showing a persistent lymphocytosis, they were given a combined course of the immunosuppressive agents azathioprine and horse anti-sheep lymphocyte globulin. This resulted in a profound fall in circulating lymphocytes and while the cell mediated immunity was suppressed, as judged by the survival of skin allografts, macrophage migration inhibition in response to tumour antigens was not significantly altered in two of the three animals under treatment. A close relationship was demonstrated in the experimentally inoculated sheep between the occurrence of lymphocytosis, the development of tumour specific cell mediated immunity and the presence of virus-like particles in phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. This evidence combined with the demonstration of common apparently tumour specific antigens in malignant lymphoma extracts used in these studies provides strong support for the hypothesis"that this disease of sheep is transmissible and is most probably due to an infection with an oncogenic virus". The exploitation of the sheep model described is of potential value for the comparative study of preneoplastic events in the general field of cancer research...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid dysgenesis is a {{condition}} found in certain interstrain hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster caused by the interaction of chromosomal and <b>cytoplasmic</b> factors. Germ-line <b>abnormalities,</b> including sterility, high mutability and male recombination, appear in the affected individuals. There {{are at least two}} distinct systems of hybrid dysgenesis. We examined a Wisconsin wild population in two consecutive years to determine the distribution of the chromosomal P factor and the extrachromosomal M cytotype that together cause one kind of hybrid dysgenic sterility. The P factor was found to be very common in the population, with all three major chromosomes being polymorphic for it. This polymorphism was strongly correlated with variability for male recombination elements, suggesting that these two traits are part of the same system of hybrid dysgenesis. There was a slight tendency for the P factor to be lost in lines taken from this population and inbred in the laboratory for many generations. A large-scale search for the M cytotype, which causes susceptibility to the P factor, showed that it is present in the population at only very low frequencies. Further evidence that the population is mostly immune to the action of the P factor was our finding of a general lack of dysgenic sterility in the wild flies themselves. However, we were able to isolate several wild strains that consistently showed the M cytotype. In some cases, the frequency of the M cytotype could be maintained in these lines, but it could not usually be increased by artificial selection. Some possible consequences of hybrid dysgenesis for the evolutionary biology of Drosophila are suggested...|$|R
