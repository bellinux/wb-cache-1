50|$|Molex {{connector}} is {{the vernacular}} {{term for a}} two-piece pin and socket interconnection, most frequently disk drive connectors. Pioneered by Molex Connector Company, the two-piece design became an early electronic standard. Molex developed and patented the first examples of this <b>connector</b> <b>style</b> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. First used in home appliances, other industries soon began designing it into their products from automobiles to vending machines to mini-computers.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{generations of}} SCSI hard drive {{assemblies}} generally had two connectors (power and communication) for 8-bit units, and either {{two or three}} connectors for 16-bit units. The power connector was typically the same 4-pin female Molex connector used in many other internal computer devices. The communication connectors on the drives were usually a 50 (for 8-bit SCSI) or 68 pin male (for 16-bit SCSI) [...] "IDC header" [...] which has two rows of pins, 0.1 inches apart. This connector has no retaining screws to secure the connectors together, and ribbon cables are both inconveniently wide and somewhat delicate, so this <b>connector</b> <b>style</b> was primarily used for connections inside of a computer or peripheral enclosure (as opposed to connecting two enclosures to each other). Thus it is often called an [...] "internal SCSI connector." [...] It {{is worth noting that}} this type of header was used for most internal connections in a typical desktop PC until recent times, including the 40-pin (two rows of 20) version used for ATA disk drives.|$|E

40|$|CL is a {{composition}} language for predictable assembly from certifiable components. An application assembly process is predictable if the runtime behavior of an assembly of components can be predicted from known properties of components and their patterns of interaction. CL {{is similar to}} other composition languages that combine a component and <b>connector</b> <b>style</b> of description with a core compositional semantics specified in a process algebra. CL differs from these in its explicit treatment of details that are usually abstracted or ignored. For example, CL makes explicit the allocation of execution threads to component behavior; this distinguishes concurrent from sequential behavior, and leads to potentially smaller state spaces {{as well as more}} accurate behavioral descriptions. This report describes the main concepts of CL and its rudimentary graphical syntax. This report also defines and illustrates the compositional semantics for CL using Hoare 2 ̆ 7 s CSP. The twin objectives of this report are to consolidate our current thinking about an ideal CL and to provide a starting point for the design of a practical and implementable CL. This report closes with a discussion of several open issues that must be resolved before this second objective can be satisfied...|$|E
40|$|Building {{a system}} at the {{architectural}} level {{can be thought of}} as decomposition into components followed by a series of exercises in matching. Components must be composed with each other via matching mechanisms; matching signatures within those mechanisms ensure that data and control will flow through the system; and matching semantics among the components ensures that the system will meet its behavioral requirements. Although efforts in signature and semantic matching enjoy formal bases from which to proceed, mechanism matching starts from no such foundation. The standard concepts of software architecture (components, <b>connectors,</b> <b>styles)</b> have been widely used with little more than intuitive understanding of their meaning. Mechanism matching is currently an ad hoc exercise that relies on the peculiarities of programming language facilities.

40|$|The {{interactive}} and ubiquitous {{nature of}} future distributed services (e. g. digital libraries, learning systems, etc.) {{will make them}} more architectural and resource demanding. Consequently, next generation middleware frameworks should support both shorter and longer-term adaptation (i. e. a priori and a posteriori reconfiguration). In fact, current component standards [18] leverage software reusability and diminish development costs. Nevertheless, {{it is also a}} fact that existing middleware, which succeeded in meeting the goals of heterogeneity and interoperability, is not open enough for tackling the problem of dynamic evolution. This paper presents FORMAware, a framework that combines a novel component-based programming model enhanced by a reflective design, the former capturing the knowledge about software architecture abstractions (e. g. components, <b>connectors,</b> <b>style</b> managers, style rules) while the latter offering architecture awareness by explicitly opening the content and structure of both atomic and composite components (via introspection and adaptation meta-objects). In addition, FORMAware provides a set of tools and services for automating software development and adaptation (i. e. support for the generation, assembly, deployment and dynamic reconfiguration processes) ...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} of Luer taper connections: locking and slipping. Their trade names are confusingly {{similar to the}} nonproprietary names.

50|$|In stage lighting, a multicable (otherwise {{known as}} {{multi-core}} cable or mult) {{is a type}} of heavy-duty electrical cable used in theaters to power lights. The basic construction involves a bundle of individual conductors surrounded by a single outer jacket. Whereas single cables only have three conductors, multicable has ten or more. They are configured to run in six or eight-circuit varieties. Typically, both ends of multicable have a specific connector known as a Socapex Connector.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} semantics {{is proposed}} for the notion of architectural <b>connector,</b> in the <b>style</b> defined by Allen and Garlan, that builds on Goguen’s categorical approach to General Systems Theory and other algebraic approaches to specification, concurrency, and parallel program design. This semantics is, essentially, ADL-independent, setting up criteria against which formalisms can be evaluated according to the support that they provide for architectural design. In particular, it clarifies {{the role that the}} separation between computation and coordination plays in supporting architecture-driven approaches to software construction and evolution. It also leads to useful generalisations of the notion of connector, namely through the use of multiple formalisms in the definition of the glue and the roles, and their instantiations with programs or system components that can be implemented in different languages or correspond to "real-world" components...|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} {{enhancements}} are collected {{as part of}} the IEEE 1284 standard. The first release in 1994 included original Centronics mode ("compatibility mode"), nibble and byte modes, as well as a change to the handshaking that was already widely used; the original Centronics implementation called for the BUSY lead to toggle with each change on any line of data (busy-by-line), whereas IEEE 1284 calls for BUSY to toggle with each received character (busy-by-character). This reduces the number of BUSY toggles and the resulting interruptions on both sides. A 1997 update standardized the printer status codes. In 2000, the EPP and ECP modes were moved into the standard, as well as several <b>connector</b> and cable <b>styles,</b> and a method for daisy chaining up to eight devices from a single port.|$|R

This can be done underwater with very little water ingress to the mask, and is closely equivalent to switching demand valves with a half mask, but a little slower and more complex.|$|R
40|$|Adaptive systems {{should be}} able to adapt to changes that occur in their {{operating}} environment without any external human intervention. Software architectures for such systems should be flexible enough to allow components to change their pattern of collaboration depending on the environmental changes and goals of the system, without changing the actual components themselves. This paper describes a co-operative object-oriented style that is able to represent software architectures for adaptive systems. The <b>connectors</b> in this <b>style,</b> described as co-operations, embody the description of complex interacting behaviour between the architectural components. Depending on the environmental changes, the behavioural adaptability in a co-operative object-oriented architecture is achieved by replacing the connectors.
