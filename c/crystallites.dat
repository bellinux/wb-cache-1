5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate <b>crystallites,</b> spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} features of mechanochemical treatment is <b>crystallite</b> size reduction. The <b>crystallite</b> {{size of the}} powder subjected to milling decreases to some minimal value characteristic for the given material. Two processes occur concurrently during milling: reduction of the <b>crystallite</b> size and grain growth, whereby the steady-state <b>crystallite</b> size is attained when the rates of these processes are in equilibrium. This study deals with the kinetics of <b>crystallite</b> size evolution by milling. Published experimental {{data were analyzed using}} three kinetic models: dr / dt=-k 1 r 2 + k 2 r- 1; dr / dt=-k 1 r 3 + k 2 r and dr / dt=-nktn- 1 (r - rs), where r and rs are the <b>crystallite</b> radius and steady-state <b>crystallite</b> radius respectively, t time, k 1 and k 2 the rate constants of <b>crystallite</b> reduction and grain growth, respectively, k the rate constant and n the Avrami exponent.

40|$|The <b>crystallite</b> size {{of copper}} electrodeposits was {{determined}} by X-Ray powder diffraction analysis using a General Area Detector Diffraction Solution (GADDS) diffractometer. <b>Crystallite</b> size was calculated for copper thin films which were deposited on a 316 stainless steel rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) in the presence and absence of additive "A". The <b>crystallite</b> size was calculated from a corrected full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the [110] peak profile using the Scherrer equation. The test of significant difference on <b>crystallite</b> size was derived using Kruskal-Wallis method. It was found that {{in the absence of}} the additive the median <b>crystallite</b> size was 426 Å, which decreased to 364 Å in the presence of the additive.

The effect of the deposition rate, thickness and substrate temperature was investigated and the film quality was discussed. It was found that as the deposition rate was increased finer <b>crystallite</b> size was obtained, {{while at the same}} time the micro-strain decreased. The decrease in <b>crystallite</b> size at higher deposition rate can be interpreted according to the increased velocity and intensity of the vapour atoms during rapid film formation. The <b>crystallite</b> size increased as the substrate temperature was increased up to 200 oC, above which the <b>crystallite</b> size decreased again.

25|$|When {{allowed to}} cool slowly, the molten polymer forms a more {{crystalline}} material. This material has spherulites containing many small <b>crystallites</b> when crystallized from an amorphous solid, rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses {{the boundaries between}} <b>crystallites</b> and the amorphous regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. Fiber drawing is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.|$|E
25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, <b>crystallites</b> are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small <b>crystallites,</b> as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{thermal history}} and film {{thickness}} PE can vary between almost clear (transparent), milky-opaque (translucent) or opaque. LDPE thereby owns the greatest, LLDPE slightly less and HDPE the least transparency. Transparency {{is reduced by}} <b>crystallites</b> if they are larger than the wavelength of visible light.|$|E
30|$|The average <b>crystallite</b> size {{is found}} to be 24.7  nm for the {{synthesized}} nano ZnO. The Scherrer equation [21, 22] is commonly used to determine the <b>crystallite</b> size of the nanoparticle.|$|R

The average <b>crystallite</b> sizes of the monoclinic phase, {{calculated from the}} (111) diffraction peak {{was found to be}} 34 nm. Similarly, the average <b>crystallite</b> sizes, calculated from the (111) diffraction peak of the tetragonal and cubic phases, were found to be 17 and 20 nm for the t-ZrO 2 and c-ZrO 2 samples, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Crystal phases {{are defined}} as regions with the same crystal structure, {{irrespective}} of orientation or twinning. Single and twinned crystalline specimens therefore constitute individual crystal phases. Polycrystalline or crystal powder samples may consist {{of more than one}} crystal phase. Such a phase comprises all the <b>crystallites</b> in the sample with the same crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structures}} of nanometer sized crystalline samples {{can be determined}} via structure factor amplitude information from single-crystal electron diffraction data or structure factor amplitude and phase angle information from Fourier transforms of HRTEM images of <b>crystallites.</b> They are stored in crystal structure databases specializing in nanocrystals and can be identified by comparing zone axis subsets in lattice-fringe fingerprint plots with entries in a lattice-fringe fingerprinting database.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} {{chains of}} stretched rubber {{are susceptible to}} crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have {{to move out of}} the way of the growing <b>crystallites.</b> Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>crystallite</b> {{size and}} {{clustering}} in influencing {{the stability of}} the structures of a large tetragonality ferroelectric system 0. 6 BiFeO(3) - 0. 4 PbTiO(3) was investigated. The system exhibits cubic phase for a <b>crystallite</b> size similar to 25 nm, three times larger than the critical size reported for one of its end member PbTiO 3. With increased degree of clustering for the same average <b>crystallite</b> size, partial stabilization of the ferroelectric tetragonal phase takes place. The results suggest that clustering helps in reducing the depolarization energy without the need for increasing the <b>crystallite</b> size of free particles...|$|R
30|$|X-ray peak profile {{analysis}} (XPPA) {{was used to}} estimate the micro-structural quantities and correlate them to the observed material properties. Although XPPA is an averaging method, it still holds a dominant position in <b>crystallite</b> size determination. XPPA is a simple and powerful tool to estimate the <b>crystallite</b> size and lattice strain [11]. The <b>crystallite</b> size and lattice strain affect the Bragg peak in different ways and both these effects increase the peak width, peak intensity and shift the 2 θ peak position accordingly. There are other methods {{reported in the literature}} to estimate the <b>crystallite</b> size and lattice strain, which are the pseudo-Voigt function, Rietveld refinement, and Warren-Averbach analysis [12, 13, 14]. However, the Williamson–Hall (W–H) analysis is a simplified integral breadth method employed for estimating <b>crystallite</b> size and lattice strain, considering the peak width as a function of 2 θ [15]. The size–strain parameters can be also obtained by considering an average ‘size–strain plot’ (SSP) method. The XPPA is an average method and is important for the determination of <b>crystallite</b> size apart from TEM analysis.|$|R
25|$|This first {{very basic}} model of silk was {{introduced}} by Termonia in 1994 who suggested <b>crystallites</b> embedded in an amorphous matrix interlinked with hydrogen bonds. This model has refined over the years: semi-crystalline regions were found {{as well as a}} fibrillar skin core model suggested for spider silk, later visualised by AFM and TEM. Sizes of the nanofibrillar structure and the crystalline and semi-crystalline regions were revealed by neutron scattering.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{consider}} {{them to be}} of no clinical significance. However, they have been noted {{to be an important}} potential source of enamel fractures that arise after extended use or overloading. It appears that, although enamel easily starts to form the fracture defects of enamel tufts, they then enable enamel to resist the further progress of these fractures, ultimately preventing mechanical failure. This fracture resistance is why tooth enamel is three times stronger than its constituent hydroxyapatite <b>crystallites</b> that make up its enamel rods.|$|E
25|$|The diverse {{material}} behavior {{of different types}} of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. Molecular weight and crystallinity are having the biggest impact, the crystallinity in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. The crystallinity is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within <b>crystallites</b> polyethylene has a density of 1.0nbsp&g·cm−3, in the amorphous regions of 0.86nbsp&g·cm−3. Thus, an almost linear relationship exists between density and crystallinity.|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline NiFe 2 O 4 powder {{has been}} {{prepared}} by an oxidative precipitation process at room-temperature and the <b>crystallite</b> size dependent magnetic properties have been studied. The NiFe 2 O 4 powders prepared at room-temperature {{had an average}} <b>crystallite</b> size of 6 nm and showed a reduced saturation magnetisation (M-s) of 3 emu g(- 1). The <b>crystallite</b> size was increased by heating the samples to increasingly higher temperatures. The M-s value increased from 3 to 40 emu (.) g(- 1) as the <b>crystallite</b> size was increased from 6 to 120 nm. The samples having <b>crystallite</b> sizes from 6 to 20 nm were superparamagnetic at room-temperature. The Mossbauer spectrum of the 6 nm sized sample showed a broad quadruple doublet, whereas, the 40 nm sized sample showed a clear sextet pattern, with a hyperfine field Values of 466 and 504 kOe for A(tetraheral) and B(octahedral) sublattices, respectively It is shown that the saturation magnetisation and magnetic hyperfine field values are significantly reduced in nanocrystalline NiFe 2 O 4 {{as a function of}} <b>crystallite</b> size...|$|R
40|$|Nickel adsorbed on porous {{vycor glass}} was reduced by {{hydrogen}} {{in order to}} prepare a supported nickel catalvst. The effect of hydrogen reduction on dispersion was investigated by the measurement of hydrogen uptake and by the measurement of BET surface area, and by the observation of TEM micrographs. TEM observation showed that mean <b>crystallite</b> size was about 5 nm below 773 K, over 8 nm above 873 K after 20 hours. The mechanisms of sintering appeared to be <b>crystallite</b> migration below 773 K, atomic migration above 873 K. <b>Crystallite</b> sintering was fast enough to affect dispersion above 873 K. The dispersion and BET surface area decreased simultaneously during hydrogen reduction. This effect was notable at a higher temperature. It is believed that the viscous support flow is peculiar to glass buried <b>crystallite</b> at an elevated temperature. The mean <b>crystallite</b> size by the chemisorption method did not always agree with that employed by the TEM method, because {{the results of the}} chemisorption method included a few unestablished factors, such as the extent of reduction, the degree of burial and the shape of the <b>crystallite.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between <b>crystallites,</b> thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallinity}} of the produced tungsten layers can {{be controlled}} by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten <b>crystallites</b> whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which the main passivation material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.|$|E
25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual <b>crystallites</b> may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E
