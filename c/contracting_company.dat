The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000. The stadium's design allows possible expansion of a further tier; completed expansion of the whole upper tier would produce a capacity of 63,000, although it is believed by some that the stadium can expand to a maximum capacity of 84,000, this would seem unlikely ever to be exercised. During construction, the stadium had not adopted an official name, and had been known colloquially as the [...] "Wearside Stadium" [...] and [...] "New Roker Park".

To emphasise the fact, a Davy lamp is located in front of the stadium's ticket office, adjacent to the stadium.
