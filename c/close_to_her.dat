5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him. As Olga grew <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother's family, {{her relationship with her}} other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael {{and the rest of the}} family was essentially cut off.|$|E
