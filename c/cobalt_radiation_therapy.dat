The improved rates are such that patients are now living long enough to experience some negative long-term side effects of the initial therapy.

The patient underwent resection of this benign, yet progressively growing and painful tumor. A cosmetically satisfying result was achieved by reconstruction of the thoracic wall with a polypropylene mesh and a latissimus dorsi muscle flap.

In the future, improving toxicity-free survival will be as important as achieving disease-free survival or local tumor control. </p...|$|E
40|$|Investigar a incidência da toxicidade aguda da radioterapia, avaliar a qualidade de vida (QV) e identificar os preditores da QV em uma coorte de mulheres com câncer ginecológico. Métodos: Conduziu-se um estudo de coorte prospectivo em que foram incluídas 107 mulheres com câncer {{cervical}} ou endometrial e idade entre 18 e 75 anos. Foram inelegíveis mulheres com história de irradiação pélvica prévia. A radioterapia foi realizada no aparelho de megavoltagem acelerador linear 10 MV ou no aparelho de cobaltotererapia utilizando a técnica de quatro campos. Para pacientes com diâmetro pélvico antero-posterior menor que 17 cm foi usada a técnica de campos paralelos e opostos (anterior e posterior). A dose total média em pelve foi de 44, 9 Gy, em frações diárias 1, 8 - 2, 0 Gy, cinco vezes por semana. Pacientes em estádio IIB-IV receberam reforço de dose em paramétrios de 7, 20 - 14, 40 Gy e aquelas com comprometimento em linfonodos paraórticos e inguinais receberam dose de 25, 20 - 45 Gy nessa região. Para a braquiterapia, foram realizadas de 4 a 5 inserções no aparelho de alta taxa de dose Nucletron-microselectron, com intervalo semanal entre as inserções e dose de 4 - 8 Gy. Dezenove pacientes foram tratadas com radioterapia e quimioterapia concomitante e 40 com cirurgia (Wertheim-Meigs, histerectomia total abdominal com salpingooforectomia bilateral, histerectomia total abdominal+linfadenectomia, histerectomia) seguida de radioterapia. A toxicidade aguda foi avaliada de acordo com a escala Common Toxicity Criteria and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Toxicity Criteria. A QV foi mensurada através do questionário da World Health Organization?s Quality of Life instrument-abbreviated-version (WHOQOL-BREF) em três períodos de tempo: antes e no final da radioterapia e na primeira visita clínica de seguimento trinta dias após a radioterapia. Os escores de QV foram avaliados através de ANOVA para medidas repetidas. A variação percentual dos escores de QV obtidos antes da radioterapia e na primeira visita clínica foi comparada com as variáveis de controle através do teste Wilcoxon. Utilizou-se a regressão linear múltipla para identificar os preditores da QV. Resultados: A mediana de idade das participantes foi de 60 anos. Oitenta e nove pacientes (83, 2 %) foram tratadas com teleterapia e braquiterapia, oito pacientes só com teleterapia e 10 só com braquiterapia. A incidência total de toxicidade aguda foi de 93, 5 % e as mais freqüentes foram gastrintestinal baixa (79, 6 %), geniturinária (74, 5 %) e gastrintestinal alta (70, 4 %). Noventa e cinco mulheres completaram as três avaliações de QV. Observou-se aumento significativo dos escores de QV nos domínios físico e psicológico e para a questão relacionada à saúde e à QV geral. Toxicidade gastrointestinal alta (p= 0, 043) e cirurgia prévia (p= 0, 027) afetaram negativamente a saúde, enquanto a melhora do sangramento vaginal (p= 0, 047) influenciou positivamente a saúde. Conclusões: Observou-se alta incidência de toxicidade aguda da radioterapia e melhora da QV das pacientes com câncer ginecológico após o tratamento. Mulheres com toxicidade gastrintestinal alta e antecedente de cirurgia são de risco para pior QVTo {{investigate the}} incidence of acute toxicity in radiotherapy, evaluate quality of life (QOL) and identify predicting factors of QOL in a cohort of women with gynecologic cancer. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted including 107 women with cervical or endometrial cancer and aged between 18 and 75 years. Women {{with a history of}} previous pelvic irradiation were ineligible. Radiotherapy was performed with a 10 MV linear accelerator or <b>cobalt</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> machine using the four-field technique. For patients with anteroposterior pelvic diameter below 17 cm, the parallel and opposite field technique was used (anterior and posterior). Total mean pelvic dose was 44. 9 Gy, in daily fractions of 1. 8 - 2. 0 Gy, five times a week. Patients in stage IIB-IV received a booster dose of 7. 20 - 14. 40 Gy in parametria and those with para-aortic and inguinal lymph node involvement received a 25. 20 - 45 Gy dose to this area. For brachytherapy, 4 to 5 insertions in the Nucletron-microSelectron High Dose Rate device were performed, with weekly intervals between insertions and a 4 - 8 Gy dose. Nineteen patients were treated with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy and 40 with surgery (Wertheim-Meigs, total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy+lymphadenectomy, hysterectomy) followed by radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Toxicity Criteria. QOL was measured with the World Health Organization?s Quality of Life instrument-abbreviated-version (WHOQOL-BREF) in three points in time: before and at completion of radiotherapy and at the first follow-up clinical visit thirty days after radiotherapy. QOL scores were assessed by ANOVA for repeat measures. Percentage variation of QOL scores obtained before radiotherapy and in the first clinical visit was compared to control variables using Wilcoxon?s test. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of QOL. Results: Median age of the participants was 60 years. Eighty-nine patients (83. 2 %) were treated with teletherapy and brachytherapy, eight patients only with teletherapy and 10 with only brachytherapy. Total incidence of acute toxicity was 93. 5 % and the most frequent toxicities were: lower gastrintestinal (79. 6 %), genitourinary (74. 5 %) and upper gastrintestinal (70. 4 %). Ninety-five women completed the three QOL assessments. A significant increase in QOL scores was observed in the physical and psychological domains, as well as in general health and overall QOL. Upper gastrointestinal toxicity (p= 0. 043) and previous surgery (p= 0. 027) negatively affected health, while improvement in vaginal bleeding (p= 0. 047) positively influenced health. Conclusions: A high incidence of acute toxicity of radiotherapy and improvement in the QOL of gynecologic cancer patients were observed after treatment. Women with upper gastrintestinal toxicity and a history of surgery are at risk for a worse QO...|$|E

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six patients with localized prostate cancer were distributed as follows: 57 underwent intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> 35 underwent three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> 37 underwent I- 125 implant, and 27 underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The prescribed doses were 70 - 74 Gy/ 35 - 37 fractions, 70 Gy/ 35 fractions, 145 Gy, and 45. 5 Gy/ 7 fraction/ 4 days for intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> I- 125 implant, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy, respectively. Toxicities (≤ 6 months) were retrospectively evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 03. RESULTS: The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (33 / 35, 94 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (18 / 27, 67 %) or intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (37 / 57, 65 %) (P < 0. 05). The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using I- 125 implant was 31 / 37, 84 %. The frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities using three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (17 / 35, 49 %) was significantly higher than that using I- 125 implant (4 / 37, 11 %) or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0 / 27, 0 %) (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> for {{unresectable}} biliary tract cancer is to prolong survival or prolong stent patency, {{and to provide}} palliation of pain. For unresectable bile duct cancer, {{there are a number}} of studies showing that <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is superior to the best supportive care. Although <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is used in many institutions, no large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to date and the evidence level supporting the superiority of this treatment is low. Because long-term relief of jaundice is difficult without using biliary stenting, a combination of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> and stent placement is commonly used. As <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> external-beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is usually performed, but combined use of intraluminal brachytherapy with external beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is more useful for making the treatment more effective. There are many reports demonstrating improved response rates as well as extended survival and time to recurrence achieved by this combination therapy. Despite the low level of the evidence, this combination therapy is performed at many institutions. It is expected that multiinstitutional RCTs will be carried out. Unresectable gallbladder cancer with a large focus is usually extensive, and normal organs with high radio sensitivity exist contiguously with it. Therefore, only limited anticancer effects are to be expected from external beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> for this type of cancer. The number of reports on ampullary cancer is small and the role of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> in this cancer has not been established. Combination treatment for ampullary cancer consists of either a single use of intraoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> postoperative external beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> or intraluminal brachytherapy, or a combination of two or three of these <b>therapies.</b> Intraoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is superior in that it enables precise irradiation to the target site, thereby protecting adjacent highly radiosensitive normal tissues from irradiation. There are reports showing extended survival, although not significant, in groups undergoing intraoperative or postoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> compared with groups without <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> To date, there are no reports of large RCTs focusing on the significance of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> as a postoperative adjuvant treatment, so its usefulness as a postoperative adjuvant treatment is not proven.

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: Current <b>Radiation</b> <b>Therapy</b> Oncology Group (RTOG) {{guidelines}} for pelvic <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> {{are based on}} general anatomic boundaries. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging can identify potential sites of lymph node involvement. We sought to determine how tailored <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> fields for prostate cancer would compare to standard RTOG-based fields. Such individualized <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> could prioritize the most important areas to irradiate while potentially avoiding coverage in areas where critical structures would be overdosed. Individualized <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> could therefore increase the therapeutic index of pelvic <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Methods and materials: Ten intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer patients received androgen deprivation <b>therapy</b> with definitive <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> including an SLN imaging–tailored elective nodal volume (ENV). For dosimetric analyses, the ENV was recontoured using RTOG guidelines (RTOG_ENV) and on SLNs alone (SLN_ENV). Separate intensity modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (IMRT) plans were optimized using RTOG_ENV and SLN_ENV for each patient. Dosimetric comparisons for these IMRT plans were performed for each patient. Dose differences to targets and critical structures among the different IMRT plans were calculated. Distributions of dose parameters were analyzed using non-parametric methods. Results: Sixty percent of patients had SLNs outside of the RTOG_ENV. The larger volume IMRT plans covering SLN imaging–tailored elective nodal volume exhibited no significant dose differences versus plans covering RTOG_ENV. IMRT plans covering only the SLNs had significantly lower doses to bowel and femoral heads.

50|$|The {{three main}} {{divisions}} of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> are external beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences {{relate to the}} position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> or IORT is a special type of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|R

25|$|The {{response}} of a tumor to <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is {{also related to}} its size. Due to complex radiobiology, very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> This is most commonly seen {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: Cisplatin, Nimorazole, and Cetuximab.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{protocol for}} the disease; however, recent journals and {{studies have reported}} that some patients respond to high-dose (P6 Protocol) chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, debulking operation, cytoreductive surgery, and <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Other treatment options include: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>Therapy,</b> radiofrequency ablation, stereotactic body <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion, and clinical trials.|$|R
30|$|A {{retrospective}} chart review {{with the}} medical records, operation notes, and radiographic data was conducted by the authors treated for patients received postoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> in our department from 2003 to 2013. The initial subjects consists of 86 patients (59 males and 27 females) {{with an average age}} of 57.8  years (14 ~ 82  years) who received postoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> The causes of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> were SCC, ACC, osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma. We selected pathologic fracture patients who had received postoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> after cancer surgery in our department. We examined factors including the operation process, <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> dose, fracture site, period between the end of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> and fracture occurrence, treatment method for the fracture (OR/IF or CR), plating method if the patient received OR/IF, complications during healing, and the period from fracture to bone union. Data collected included age, gender, primary disease, site, stage.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} timing of salvage and adjuvant <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> on outcomes after prostatectomy for prostate cancer. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we identified prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1995 - 2007 who had one or more adverse pathological features after prostatectomy. The final cohort of 6, 137 eligible patients included men who received prostatectomy alone (n = 4, 509) or with adjuvant (n = 894) or salvage (n = 734) <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Primary outcomes were genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and erectile dysfunction events and survival after treatment(s). RESULTS: <b>Radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> after prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal and genitourinary events, but not erectile dysfunction. In adjusted models, earlier treatment with adjuvant <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> {{was not associated with}} increased rates of genitourinary or erectile dysfunction events compared to delayed salvage <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Early adjuvant <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> was associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal events that salvage <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> with hazard ratios of 0. 80 (95 % CI, 0. 67 - 0. 95) for procedure-defined and 0. 70 (95 % CI, 0. 59, 0. 83) for diagnosis-defined events. There {{was no significant difference between}} ART and non-ART groups (SRT or RP alone) for overall survival (HR = 1. 13 95 % CI = (0. 96, 1. 34) p = 0. 148). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> after prostatectomy is associated with increased rates of gastrointestinal and genitourinary events.

25|$|Following <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> of {{any type}} for {{prostate}} cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This {{makes it more difficult}} to interpret the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> The lowest level {{is referred to as the}} PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0nbsp&ng/dL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|R
