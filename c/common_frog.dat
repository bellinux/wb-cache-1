5|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the <b>common</b> <b>frog,</b> common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates, and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> or common toad, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) and the <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana temporaria) {{are the only}} {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} ponds and a wet meadow, with smooth and great crested newts. Other fauna include <b>common</b> <b>frogs,</b> damselflies and dragonflies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Common</b> <b>frogs,</b> lizards, snakes (including adders, grass-snakes), sea-turtles, Common toads, Tennessee cave salamander, Texas blind salamanders, Fire salamanders, Northern crested newts, Purussaurus ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1963 to 2008, 305 {{species of}} beetle have been recorded. <b>Common</b> <b>Frogs</b> and Great Crested, Smooth and Palmate newts breed in the ponds.|$|R
5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals {{can be seen at}} the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The <b>common</b> <b>frog,</b> common toad and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a huge decline in numbers of 70–90%, mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. They are still common at Cley, {{which is one of}} a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen, with spraints regularly found at the southern end of East Bank. The <b>common</b> <b>frog,</b> common toad and common lizard all occur on the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Ponds {{located in}} {{suburban}} {{and rural areas}} often attract amphibians such as <b>Common</b> <b>Frogs</b> and Fire Salamanders and reptiles such as turtles, lizards, and snakes.|$|R

5|$|Amphibians {{are common}} in the capital, {{including}} smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and <b>common</b> <b>frogs,</b> <b>common</b> toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.|$|R
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the <b>common</b> <b>frog.</b> Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one small}} pond in Sydenham Hill Wood {{which has been}} {{enhanced}} {{over the years and}} is surveyed by volunteers. <b>Common</b> <b>frog</b> and smooth newt are resident, as well as southern hawker dragonfly, common blue and red-tailed damselflies.|$|E
25|$|Four {{out of five}} of Britain's {{amphibian}} species currently reside {{within the}} park including the smooth and great crested newt. The only native species not recorded is the palmate newt. Amongst these newts the <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> and toad are also present.|$|E
40|$|During {{investigations}} of epidemic frog mortality in Britain, a novel fatal systemic haemorrhagic disease of common toads was discovered. This disease resembles a systemic haemorrhagic disease of <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> in Britain, {{which is one}} of a range of fatal disease syndromes, characterized by systemic haemorrhages, skin ulceration or a combination of these lesions, caused by ranavirus infection. Ranavirus previously isolated from diseased toads was inoculated into <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> to evaluate if this virus could infect and cause disease in <b>common</b> <b>frogs.</b> All virus-inoculated frogs died with systemic haemorrhages between 6 and 8 days post-inoculation, giving similar results to those produced by the inoculation of frogs with ranavirus cultured from naturally diseased frogs. These results indicate that the same, or similar, viruses are affecting both frogs and toads in the field and confirm that ranavirus has emerged as an important cause of amphibian mortality in Britain...|$|R
50|$|The pond is {{shaded by}} willow trees and sycamores, {{and it is}} covered by common duckweed. It has many amphibians, {{including}} great crested newts and <b>common</b> <b>frogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} is also {{a habitat}} to 15 species of reptiles and amphibians, which include Tokay gecko, house gecko, Stejneger's hemidactylid gecko, Mabuya mutifascia, cane toad, <b>common</b> green <b>frog,</b> giant Visayan frog, Chinese edible <b>frog,</b> <b>common</b> tree <b>frog</b> and <b>common</b> puddle <b>frog.</b> In addition, the arboretum is home to several small mammals, such as the lesser short-nosed fruit bat, greater musky fruit bat, Geoffroy's rousette, cave nectar bat, Asian house shrew, brown rat and Polynesian rat.|$|R
25|$|In {{common with}} Ireland, no snakes inhabit Lewis, only the slowworm which is merely {{mistaken for a}} snake. Actually a legless lizard, it is the sole member of its order present. The <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> {{may be found in}} the centre of the island though it, along with any newts or toads present are {{introduced}} species.|$|E
25|$|On the 21 July 2011 {{a further}} eight designs were added {{featuring}} the beadlet anemone, the squat lobster, the cuckoo wrasse, the <b>common</b> <b>frog,</b> the green huntsman, the elephant hawk-moth, the goldfinch {{and the red}} deer. A third phase is scheduled for 9 August 2012 featuring green crab, raft spider, pike and the kestrel.|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} all major Swedish species of amphibians. Among these species, one can number the common toad, the <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> and the moor frog, {{as well as}} the {{northern}} crested newt and the smooth newt. Among the reptiles, the most common species are two snakes, the common European adder and the grass snake, {{as well as the}} viviparous lizard and the slowworm.|$|E
50|$|In the {{surroundings}} {{of the stream}} avenue are <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> and toads, water snakes, common turtle, terrapin, foxes, rabbits, hares, ferrets, badgers and other species common in the Mediterranean area.|$|R
5|$|Common toads {{winter in}} various {{holes in the}} ground, {{sometimes}} in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> and green frogs.|$|R
5000|$|The park is home {{to number}} of British birds, mammals, amphibians, fish and invertebrates, along with {{occasional}} visiting reptiles. Some common species include mallards, black-headed gulls, water voles, <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> and <b>common</b> gulls.|$|R
25|$|The {{heathland}} is {{a significant}} local habitat for the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) dominate the mats in the grassland in spring-time. The common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common toad (Bufo bufo) and <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana temporaria) all inhabit the ponds, and the high insect numbers associated with the water attract bats, such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus).|$|E
25|$|Only {{two types}} of seal are found on County Wexford's coast—Atlantic grey seals are very {{plentiful}} in coastal areas, but the slightly smaller common (or harbour) seal is less common, yet plentiful. The small tortoiseshell butterfly (reddish-orange colour, with black markings) {{is the most common}} species of butterfly in the county. Various types of moth are also common. The <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> is plentiful, and is the only type of frog found.|$|E
25|$|Pasvik {{is at the}} {{intersection}} between western and eastern species, and between the forest tundra and Arctic tundra. <b>Common</b> <b>frog</b> is the only amphibian and the viviparous lizard is the only reptile. There are 34 species of mammals in the national park. The only non-wild animals are reindeer. Mice are the most commons, especially the Eurasian pygmy shrew. The only true Arctic species is the Norway lemming. Larger species include the brown bear, a declining number of wolverines, and moose, {{in addition to other}} common, smaller mammals. The American mink is an introduced species which has become quite common.|$|E
50|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> live a solitary life in damp places near ponds or marshes or in long grass. They are normally active {{for much of}} the year, only hibernating in the coldest months. In the most northern extremities of their range they may be trapped under ice for up to nine months of the year, but recent studies have shown that in these conditions they may be relatively active at temperatures close to freezing. In the British Isles, <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> typically hibernate from late October to January. They will re-emerge as early as February if conditions are favourable, and migrate to bodies of water such as garden ponds to spawn. Where conditions are harsher, such as in the Alps, they emerge as late as early June. <b>Common</b> <b>frogs</b> hibernate in running waters, muddy burrows, or in layers of decaying leaves and mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes primarily with a current. The oxygen uptake through the skin suffices to sustain the needs of the cold and motionless frogs during hibernation.|$|R
50|$|Two {{species of}} {{tortoises}} found are {{black pond turtle}} and three-striped pond turtle in around village and the <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> found in the village are Indian bull frog, Indian cricket frog, Indian burrowing <b>frog</b> and <b>common</b> toad.|$|R
50|$|Proceratophrys boiei is {{a species}} of frog in the Odontophrynidae family. It is endemic to eastern and southeastern Brazil. This <b>common</b> <b>frogs</b> is found in primary and {{secondary}} forest, on the forest edge, and in degraded areas near forest.|$|R
25|$|There are 12 reptile species, not {{counting}} the spur-thighed tortoise which breeds just outside the park's limits {{near the village of}} Pastra. The largest diversity is found in the lower zones— 10 species. Rila Monastery Forest Reserve is home to 5 reptile species. The population of the Aesculapian snake is of European importance. Of national importance are the populations of the slowworm, viviparous lizard, smooth snake and common European viper. The amphibians are represented with 11 species, with highest diversity in the wet deciduous forests and the forest streams. Rila Monastery Forest Reserve is the most important area for amphibians conservation. Three species have a population of national importance: the Alpine newt, yellow-bellied toad and <b>common</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), <b>Common</b> <b>Frog</b> (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath—primarily the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, but locally dominant are the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Other local heathland species at Ferndown Common include the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) and European stonechat. In the south-east of the site there are several small ponds, which support at least 14 species of dragonflies, most of which are heathland species. Also resident in the ponds are large populations of the widespread, although in decline, <b>common</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana temporaria) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
5000|$|The {{edible frog}} (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) [...] {{is a name}} for a <b>common</b> European <b>frog,</b> {{also known as the}} <b>common</b> water <b>frog</b> or green frog (however, this latter term is also used for the North American species Rana clamitans).|$|R
50|$|Boldon Flats {{is another}} site {{important}} for nature conservation, which contains {{an area of}} damp pasture. The flats are flooded from each October to March and attract {{a wide array of}} bird life and a large population of <b>common</b> <b>frogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>frogs</b> {{metamorphose}} {{through three}} distinct developmental life stages — aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile, and adult. They have corpulent bodies with a rounded snout, webbed feet and long hind legs adapted for swimming {{in water and}} hopping on land. <b>Common</b> <b>frogs</b> are often confused with the common toad Bufo bufo, but frogs can easily be distinguished as they have longer legs, hop, and have a moist skin, whereas toads crawl and have a dry 'warty' skin. The spawn of the two species also differs in that frogspawn is laid in clumps and toadspawn is laid in long strings. The frog's skin also secretes temporin, a tarlike mixture of various peptides, for which {{the latter part of}} its scientific name is denoted translated in Latin.|$|R
