40|$|Research {{has found}} that {{generally}} Australians hold negative attitudes towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> These negative attitudes appear {{to be influenced by}} perceptions of threat and false beliefs. The current study explored the attitudes of Anglo-Australians towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and how attitudes are related to the concept of Australian egalitarianism and fair go. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted for this study. Three main themes were identified through thematic content analysis: characterising <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> responses to <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia, and constructing fairness. 2 ̆ 7 Characterising <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> represented the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> as being genuine <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> or boat people and illegal immigrants. The latter two are stereotypes commonly used by the media and political figures which appear to influence most of the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Responses to <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 discussions of intercultural racist attitudes, competition for resources, and perceptions of threat. These appeared to be guided by in-group and out-group relations. Constructing fairness reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 definitions of fairness and how it is applied to <b>asylums</b> <b>seekers.</b> It appears the allocation of fairness is distinguished by in-group favouritism. This study adds to the prior knowledge of attitudes towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> within an Australian context...|$|R

Methods: A qualitative multimethod data collection tool comprised semistructured interviewing of East Timorese women <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> questionnaires to professional workers assisting East Timorese <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> at the community level, and an analysis of secondary source material. Results: Insecurity of tenure and living with the fear of forced removal from Australia was found to have significantly affected and dangerously compromised the wellbeing of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> The findings further revealed a flaw in current social policy with respect to the length of time <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> could reside in the community without adequate supports, services and avenues for social inclusion. Conclusions: The research illustrated the necessity for faster processing of claims for <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> status, recognition of the effects of torture and trauma on <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in policy, and consequently immediate access for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to essential and gender specific supports and services.

40|$|Drawing on {{fieldwork}} {{carried out}} in 2002 – 2003, this paper reveals the complexity of interactions between <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in East Anglia as they negotiate the shared experience of place, the British immigration system and a common and competitive goal of attaining refugee status. There is tension and a distrust generated {{by people who are}} forced to live in an inter-ethnic community and share the competitive goal of obtaining immigration status. Yet, this forced coexistence forges strong friendships, alliances and collaboration amongst <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> It is in taking into account these seemingly contradictory interactions that marks the concern of this paper; the more that <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> attempt to distance and differentiate themselves from the collective and shared identity of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> the more entangled they become within a collective <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> identity. This struggle tells us that the very contestation of an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> identity is a form of resistance put forth by <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to address an identity that is largely imposed by the state and host society. This has broader implications {{on the extent to which}} an imposed identity and its resistance impact on the successful integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees into larger society...|$|R
40|$|The {{refugee crisis}} in Europe {{has created a}} {{significant}} challenge for European policy makers, {{both in terms of}} receiving <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and integrating them into their new communities. Among other methods of refugee integration, the ability of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to find work soon after arrival is particularly important to the future welfare of refugees and of their host countries. On this issue, the European response has been mixed: for example, France has historically taken a restrictive stance to prevent <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> from working to make the country less attractive to “fake refugees,” while Sweden allows <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to work near instantly upon arrival in the hope they can find work quickly and sustain themselves as their claim is being evaluated. This paper evaluates best practices for the labor market integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, before reviewing the historical development of labor market integration policies for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in France since WWII.

30|$|The {{data on the}} {{destination}} countries of PRS in Europe is limited.

40|$|To map the {{prevalence}} and incidence of recorded diabetes among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> according to demographic factors {{and length of}} stay in the host country.

Case allocation was based on International Classification of Primary Care codes. A general practice registry was used to obtain reference data. Standardized prevalence and incidence ratios were calculated and their association with length of stay was explored with Cox regression. The study included 59 380 <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> among whom there were 1227 recorded cases of diabetes. The prevalence of recorded diabetes was higher among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> compared with the reference population for both men (standardized prevalence ratio= 1. 85, 95 % CI 1. 71 - 1. 91) and women (standardized prevalence ratio= 2. 26, 95 % CI 2. 08 - 2. 45).

In this regard then, refugee and <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> identity documents are critical and the study sought to investigate the extent to which this policy intent of using identity documents to facilitate integration had become a reality.
