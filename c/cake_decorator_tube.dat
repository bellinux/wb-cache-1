5000|$|Jamieson Cox from Entertainment Time said; [...] "There’s a {{remarkable}} density and confidence to “Heartbreak Dream”: Who applies layers and layers of hooks like a <b>cake</b> <b>decorator</b> {{with a heavy}} fondant hand, but trusts in her voice to soar above the fray. In {{a remarkable}} show of personality, it does: she’s tender and tough in equal measure, balancing defiance and reflection on a relationship that’s souring. It’s tough to draw complex situations with nuance and depth {{over the course of}} a four-minute pop song, but Who makes it look easy with “Heartbreak Dream” — this is another strong effort from a star in the making." ...|$|R

In November 1990, an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred among attendees at a conference of <b>cake</b> <b>decorators</b> held in Michigan. All 42 conference attendees were surveyed. Thirty-two of 42 (76 %) attendees reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The median incubation period was 6. 5 hours (range, 1. 5 - 15 hours). Ill persons were almost five {{times more likely to}} have consumed minestrone soup than were those who were not ill (relative risk = 4. 92, 95 % confidence interval 1. 23 -oo). Bacteriotogic analysis identified C. perfringens in the soup and in 11 of 12 stool specimens from ill persons. The soup was cooked 2 days prior to serving and was slowly cooled before refrigeration; it was briefly reheated on the day served. Failure to monitor time and temperature controls during the cooling and reheating of the soup probably allowed for C. perfringens proliferation in the minestrone soup. This investi-gation demonstrated that nonanimal protein sources, such as legumes, can support substantial C. perfringens growth and should be regarded as potential vehicles in C. perfringens outbreaks. Am J Epidemiol 1992; 136 : 1288 - 91. Clostridium perfringens; disease outbreaks; food poisoning; food poisoning, prevention & control Clostridium perfringens is a common cause of foodborne illness. Associated food poisoning usually occurs after consumption of high-protein foods such as meat or poul-try. C. perfringens outbreaks are often con-nected with banquets and settings where large quantities of food are prepared in ad-vance (1). Investigations of C. perfringens associated outbreaks have implicated meat (1), poultry Received for publication November 14, 1992, and in final form July 24, 1992...|$|R
