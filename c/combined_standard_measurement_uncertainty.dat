40|$|Atmospheric CO in situ {{measurements}} {{are carried out}} at the Izaña (Tenerife) global GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch Programme of the World Meteorological Organization – WMO) mountain station using a Reduction Gas Analyser (RGA). In situ measurements at Izaña {{are representative of the}} subtropical Northeast Atlantic free troposphere, especially during nighttime. We present the measurement system configuration, the response function, the calibration scheme, the data processing, the Izaña 2008 – 2011 CO nocturnal time series, and the mean diurnal cycle by months. We have developed a rigorous uncertainty analysis for carbon monoxide measurements carried out at the Izaña station, which could be applied to other GAW stations. We determine the <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> taking into consideration four contributing components: uncertainty of the WMO standard gases interpolated over the range of measurement, the uncertainty that takes into account the agreement between the standard gases and the response function used, the uncertainty due to the repeatability of the injections, and the propagated uncertainty related to the temporal consistency of the response function parameters (which also takes into account the covariance between the parameters). The mean value of the combined standard uncertainty decreased significantly after March 2009, from 2. 37 nmol mol − 1 to 1. 66 nmol mol − 1, due to improvements in the measurement system. A fifth type of uncertainty we call representation uncertainty is considered when some of the data necessary to compute the temporal mean are absent. Any computed mean has also a propagated uncertainty arising from the uncertainties of the data used to compute the mean. The law of propagation depends on the type of uncertainty component (random or systematic). In situ hourly means are compared with simultaneous and collocated NOAA flask samples. The uncertainty of the differences is computed and used to determine whether the differences are significant. For 2009 – 2011, only 24. 5 % of the differences are significant, and 68 % of the differences are between − 2. 39 and 2. 5 nmol mol − 1. Total and annual mean differences are computed using conventional expressions but also expressions with weights based on the minimum variance method. The annual mean differences for 2009 – 2011 are well within the ± 2 nmol mol − 1 compatibility goal of GAW...|$|E

It is unclear how these artefacts influence dimensional measurements evaluated from CT data. Understanding and quantifying the influence of these artefacts on dimensional measurements is required to evaluate the uncertainty of CT-based dimensional measurements. In this work the influence of scatter and beam hardening on dimensional measurements is investigated using the beam stop array scatter correction method and spectrum pre-filtration for the measurement of an object with internal and external cylindrical dimensional features. Scatter and beam hardening are found to influence dimensional measurements when evaluated using the ISO 50 surface determination method.

30|$|In this paper, the {{improvement}} of the measurement setup for the detection efficiency calibration of Si-SPAD detectors was described. These improvements are based on the optimization of the Si-SPAD detector positioning, which is now performed in a completely automated way. Furthermore, the uncertainty contribution due to the filter transmission measurement is practically negligible by using an integrating sphere, which diminishes the back reflection into the measurement setup. The overall relative <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for the estimation of the Si-SPAD detection efficiency is now 0.16 % instead of 0.3 % as in López et al. (2015). However, this value has to be validated by independent measurements and comparisons with other national metrology institutes.

Binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures of several common binding media and pigments were quantified, with <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in most cases below 3 g/ 100 g. Classes of components - aromatic anhydrides and alcohols - used in alkyd resin synthesis were also successfully quantified, with standard uncertainties {{in the range of}} 2 - 3 g/ 100 g. This is a more demanding application because in alkyd resins aromatic anhydrides and alcohols have reacted to form a polyester, and are not present in their original forms. Once a PLS method has been calibrated, analysis time and cost are significantly reduced from typical quantitative methods such as GC/MS. This is beneficial in the case of routine analysis where the components are known...|$|R

The current level of permitted emissions is typically between 50 µmol/mol and 100 µmol/mol, but lower values are expected in the future. Currently, ambient air quality monitoring regulations also require the measurement of NOx mole fractions as low as 0. 2 µmol/mol. The production of accurate standards at these levels of mole fractions requires either dilution of a stable higher concentration gas standard or production by a dynamic technique, for example one based on permeation tubes.

Numeric single-phase sludge models mainly include settling and viscoplastic behavior. Even though many investigators {{emphasize the importance}} of modeling the rheology of sludge for good simulation results, it is difficult to measure, because of settling and the viscoplastic behavior. In this thesis, a new method is developed that combines rheological measurements with a process-viscometer and numeric simulations, in order to produce flow curves that most probably display the real viscoplastic behavior of sludge below a concentration of 10 g/l. The settling velocity is determined with a hybrid approach <b>combining</b> <b>standard</b> <b>measurements</b> and numeric simulations of the measurements.

Finally, <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> uncertainty and the extended {{uncertainty of}} detection results were calculated. Results The extended uncertainty was 0. 10 % (K= 2). Conclusion Relative standard uncertainty caused by standard solution and uncertainty caused by titration analysis of zinc sulfate were the main factors for the determination of calcium dihydrogen phosphate using back titration analysis of zinc sulfate...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a method for}} the primary calibration of phase noise and amplitude noise measurement systems. In the field of metrology, the term "primary" refers to a standard whose quantity value and <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are established without relation to another <b>measurement</b> <b>standard</b> for {{a quantity of the}} same kind; or to a procedure used to realize the definition of a measurement unit and obtain the quantity value and <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of a primary <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> Accordingly, a phase and a normalized amplitude have to rely on ratio measurements.

40|$|International audienceStereo {{digital image}} {{correlation}} (also called 3 D DIC) {{is a common}} measurement technique in experimental mechanics for measuring 3 D shapes or 3 D displacement/strain fields, in research laboratories {{as well as in}} industry. Nevertheless, like most of the optical full-field measurement techniques, 3 D DIC suffers from a lack of information about its metrological performances. For the 3 D DIC technique to be fully accepted as a <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> technique it is of key importance to assess its <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The formal {{definition}} of calibration by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is the following: [...] "Operation that, under specified conditions, {{in a first}} step, establishes a relation between the quantity values with <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> provided by <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> and corresponding indications with associated <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> (of the calibrated instrument or secondary standard) and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication." [...] This definition states that the calibration process is purely a comparison, but introduces the concept of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in relating the accuracies of the device under test and the standard.|$|R
