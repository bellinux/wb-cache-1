40|$|Multiple systems {{coupling}} incurs {{performance degradation}} due to inter-system (global) lock conlention and database buffer invali-dation. At high transaction rates, {{the level of}} inter-syslem interference can have a severe hnpact on performance. In this paper, we propose a scheme for transaction routing lhat reduces inter-system interference while keeping load nearly balanced. The routing decision is based on affinity relations defined between transactions and databases. A methodology, employing an integer linear programming technique, is developed to classify incoming transactions into affinity groups based on their dotuba & <b>call</b> <b>reference</b> puffem. Based on traces from two of IBM’s high volume single system customers, we find that. at high lransaction rates, the proposed aflinily based routing significantly re-duces the lock contention probability and leads to a substantial re-duction in transaction response time.

This approach avoids any kind of 3 D reconstruction, thus allowing us to deal with real and complex images. We also successfully experimented on outdoor scenes, taken with a home video camera. The algorithm consists in two steps : it starts with a dense matching between the reference views; each matched couple is then reprojected using the trilinear relations. This technique has numerous applications, among which virtual realities, or high rate video compression.

40|$|Abstract: We adapt a {{combinatorial}} optimization algorithm, extremal optimization (EO), for the search problem in computational protein design. This algorithm {{takes advantage of}} the knowledge of local energy information and system-atically improves on the residues that have high local energies. Power-law probability distributions are used to select the backbone sites to be improved on and the rotamer choices to be changed to. We compare this method with simulated annealing (SA) and motivate and present an improved method, which we <b>call</b> <b>reference</b> energy extremal optimization (REEO). REEO uses reference energies to convert a problem with a structured local-energy profile to one with more random profile, and extremal optimization proves to be extremely efficient for the latter problem. We show in detail the large improvement we have achieved using REEO as compared to simulated annealing and discuss a number of other heuristics we have attempted to date. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Citation indexes are {{valuable}} tools for research, {{in part because}} they provide a means with which to measure the relative impact of articles in a collection of scientific literature. In retrieval systems for citation indexes, recent work has demonstrated the benefit of using ranking metrics based on measures of impact. While this approach is e#ective in identifying a few of the most important contributions to an area, many documents ranked highly in response to queries are irrelevant to the topic of interest. The problem here is that with such techniques Boolean methods are used to identify candidates for retrieval, even though such methods are poor determiners of relevance. As a solution to this problem, we present an indexing technique that pulls together measures of relevance and significance in a single retrieval metric. This approach, which we <b>call</b> <b>Reference</b> Directed Indexing (RDI) is based on a comparison of the terms authors use in reference to documents. Initial retrieval experiments with RDI indicate that it retrieves documents on par with significance-based techniques in terms of impact, and comparable to traditional vector-space approaches with regard to relevance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a boundary integral formulation {{in conjunction with}} optimization techniques for the solution of an Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (IHCP) governed by the Laplace's equation.

The geometric configuration of the internal channel is such that specific boundary conditions in terms of temperature or heat flux (<b>called</b> <b>reference</b> data) are satisfied at specific boundary points (<b>called</b> <b>reference</b> points). The solution procedure for this inverse problem starts with an initial guess of the internal channel configuration described by geometric variables. In the proposed formulation, the initial guess configuration reaches the final solution through the minimization of an objective function which is the difference between the reference data and the respective calculated response. The final solution corresponds to an internal heating/cooling channel confi [...] ...|$|R
