This positive reaction may be attributable to the expectation of greater availability of information on each targeted stock segment, {{as well as the}} monitoring and motivational advantages of linking a stock directly with an industry segment. We find a lower incidence of tax loss <b>carry-forwards</b> among firms that have issued targeted stock compared to those that have spun off segments, suggesting that tax reasons may be partially responsible for the choice of this organizational structure.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} inter-temporal loss usage of tax units in Germany. Tax units that {{experience}} {{a loss in}} a year can offset that loss with positive income from adjacent year to receive a tax refund. Similar to companies, tax units can employ losses as carry-back {{in the year before}} the loss or as <b>carry-forward</b> in the year following the loss. The tax code does not force a particular loss usage but provides tax units with freedom to allocate the losses between carry-back and <b>carry-forward.</b> Choosing an individual appropriate allocation of carry-back and <b>carry-forward</b> creates a maximal tax refund. Intertemporal loss usage is a special case of tax avoidance: tax units receive a tax refund from loss usage as <b>carry-forward</b> (carry-back) but forfeit the alternative refund from carry-back (<b>carry-forward).</b> Estimations show that the probability of maximizing the tax refund highly depends on the difference of the tax rates from the loss adjacent years.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} conceptual interaction between section 23 M and section 31 of the Income Tax Act, 1962. Both sections limit tax deductible interest expenditure paid to non-resident related persons based on specific requirements. The dissertation establishes the ambit of each section {{by relying on}} an interpretive guide, which takes into account three aspects of interpretation. These three aspects are: the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words comprising each section; the contextual understanding of each section; {{and the purpose of}} each section. The dissertation determines that there is an overlap in the ambit of section 23 M and section 31 in respect of the taxpayer to which each section applies, interest as determined for purposes of the common law and the purpose of each section, being to prevent tax base erosion through excessive interest rate deductions. Despite the presence of an overlap, a taxpayer falling within the ambit of both sections is always limited to a deduction equal to the smaller answer yielded by section 23 M or section 31. However, in respect of the <b>carry-forward</b> in section 23 M(4) there is uncertainty as to the calculation of the <b>carry-forward.</b> The dissertation recommends an amendment to section 23 M(4) to clarify the calculation of the <b>carry-forward</b> amount.

These firms are rarely studied in capital structure contexts and differ from large listed firms in terms of agency and asymmetric information problems and funding sources.

30|$|Corporate {{taxable income}} {{is based on}} the income {{disclosed}} in the financial statements and accounting records, adjusted in accordance with tax principles. The 2007 Spanish General Accounting Plan approved by Royal Decree 1514 / 2007, of November 16 th differentiates between the current income tax expense (income) and the deferred income tax expense (income). The total tax expense or income is the sum of these two items, which should nonetheless be quantified separately. On the one hand, the current income tax expense is the amount payable by the company as a result of income tax settlements for a given year. Conversely, the deferred income tax expense reflects in essence the recognition and settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. A deferred tax asset or liability represents the increase or decrease in taxes payable or refundable in future years as a result of temporary differences and any net operating loss or tax credit <b>carry-forwards</b> that exist at the reporting date. Its value is computed with reference to financial reporting standards for book income and tax rules for taxable income. For instance, deferred tax assets can be created by the tax authority recognizing revenues and/or expenses outside of the times set out in the accounting standards. In Spain “tax effect accounting”, which includes the concept of net tax deferred assets, was first introduced in fiscal year 2007.|$|R

We consider three different imputation methods: <b>carry-forward,</b> which just assumes that the missing price is the same as in the previous period; cell-mean, which imputes the missing price using either the short-term or long-term index for related commodities; and linear interpolation, which uses the last and next observations for the item to linearly interpolate. Certain hybrid techniques, combining either <b>carry-forward</b> or cell-mean with linear interpolation, are also considered. Our conclusions are: (1) Some imputation is better than no imputation; (2) the short term cell-mean introduces some "noise" into the price index: (3) linear interpolation results in less fluctuation of prices than the true series: (4) combining either <b>carry-forward</b> or cell-mean with linear interpolation gives similar results. ...|$|E

Specifically, we consider whether changes {{in the amount of}} unrecognised deferred tax assets from <b>carry-forward</b> losses, reflect managers' incentives to opportunistically manage earnings, or communicate private information about future profitability (i. e., signalling). Using data from firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange during the period 1999 to 2005, we find evidence consistent with income-increasing earnings management when pre-tax earnings are below the median analyst forecast. Interestingly, we find that the potential existence of earnings management does not reduce the capacity of changes in unrecognised deferred tax assets from <b>carry-forward</b> losses to predict one-year-ahead performance, and to a much lesser extent, three-year ahead performance. This result highlights the complexity of managers' incentives in trading-off between managing earnings toward a desired target and communicating useful information to market participants.

The company, founded in 1962, is a large heavy machinery manufacturer. Packer’s balance sheet at December 31, 1997 includes a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 22 million related to net future deductible temporary differences. However, realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the U. S. and abroad, and future reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, Packer management {{in the past has}} been pretty sure that such benefits will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income. Management has carefully considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax benefits. Brett recalls the complexity surrounding the judgmental nature of accounting for deferred taxes under generally accepted accounting principles.

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{minimum tax}} (AMT) is often regarded as desirable. We analyze a wealth tax at corporate and personal level that is designed as an AMT as proposed by the German Green Party. This wealth tax is imputable to profit taxes and is hence intended to prevent multiple (multistage) taxation. Referring to data from annual reports and the German Central Bank we model enterprises of different structure, industry, size and legal status. We show that companies {{in the service sector}} which generally maintain rather high gearing rates are more frequently subjected to the wealth tax than capital intensive industries. This result runs counter to well-known effects of a common wealth tax. Capital intensive firms, e. g. in the metal industry, are levied with definitive wealth tax only if they have large loss <b>carry-forwards</b> or extremely volatile profits. Furthermore, partnerships often enjoy wealth tax privileges due to uniform taxation at individual level whereas corporations may suffer from the wealth tax at corporate and personal level caused by imputation backlogs. Obviously, the underlying AMT influences corporate dividend policy evoking a push-out effect. We prove that this kind of wealth taxation usually favors financial rather than real investment and encourages outbound investment. Consequently, introducing an AMT discriminates against many firms and investment projects, especially if economic income is lower than taxable income. This proves that whenever income is taxed correctly, AMT is dispensable. [...] {{alternative minimum tax}},business strategy,investment decisions,wealth tax...|$|R
40|$|The {{internationalisation}} {{of financial}} accounting and the European Commission's ambition to harmonise corporate taxation {{have raised the}} question whether IFRS accounts {{could be used for}} tax purposes. In order to quantify the effect of an IFRS-based taxation on corporate tax burdens in different EU member states, we estimate firms' tax equity using notes on income taxes in IFRS financial statements of companies listed in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. The difference between estimated tax equity and IFRS-equity, adjusted for the effect resulting from the recognition of deferred taxes, indicates the effect of using IFRS as a tax base on corporate tax burden. We find that estimated tax equity is mostly lower than IFRSequity, indicating that an IFRS-based taxation would often increase the corporate tax burden. The median of estimated tax equity is 5. 6 % (Austria), 6. 4 % (Germany) and 9. 0 % (the Netherlands) below IFRS-equity. Our results suggest that using IFRS for the determination of taxable income would often increase corporate tax burden. However, an IFRS-based taxation does not always induce higher equity as often argued in the literature. In 307 of 1. 113 totally analysed firm-years, estimated tax equity exceeds IFRS-equity. Analysing IFRS-tax differences on a balance sheet caption level, we find that the most important differences can be observed for intangibles and provisions. We find for all three analysed countries that IFRS-tax differences relating to inventories, receivables, and liabilities are typically small. We also approximate the total stock of unused tax losses and the amount of useable tax losses which can provide additional information about the management's estimates of future earnings. We find that deferred tax assets for unused tax losses are depreciated to a substantial extent, indicating that companies often assume insufficient future taxable income to utilise the total stock of tax loss <b>carry-forwards.</b> [...] ...|$|R

While the US corporate income tax rate has remained relatively stable over the decades since most US income tax rates were last slashed as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, across the rest of the world, non-US corporate income tax rates have continued to fall. Even though the US statutory rate was among the lowest corporate income tax rates of any industrialized nation in 1988, by 2008, due to continuing rate decreases around the globe the US rate had become one of the highest corporate income tax rates amongst the G- 8. In April of 2012, the US statutory rate as applied to corporate income became the highest among all the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) countries. This study will examine the behavior of option intensive corporations during the late 19902 ̆ 7 s. Coinciding with the longest recorded economic expansion in the history of the United States and coupled with the so-called 2 ̆ 2 internet bubble 2 ̆ 2 during the second half of the decade, this period of rapid stock price appreciation was also a time when many highly profitable companies faced substantially lower current US tax liabilities due to the large tax deductions resulting from the employee exercise of increasing quantities of non-qualified stock options at substantial gains. Enormous tax losses reported by employee stock option granting firms were sufficient to eliminate not only current US corporate income tax liabilities but also several years of future tax liabilities for some firms. Previous research has documented an increasing proportion of US multinational corporate income recognized in foreign jurisdictions, thereby escaping the relatively high US corporate tax rates until the foreign profits are repatriated back into the US. Perhaps US corporate income tax rates are so high in comparison to equally suitable substitute foreign locations that many firms have relocated their income producing activities to lower taxed jurisdictions abroad. Or it may be that US multinational firms engage in various cross border income shifting techniques to avoid high US corporate income tax rates and reduce their overall global tax burden. Profitable option intensive firms in the late 19902 ̆ 7 s faced in effect lower US corporate income tax rates due to their extensive employee stock option deductions and resulting net operating loss <b>carry-forwards.</b> It is possible that these firms had more incentive to recognize income domestically than their non-option intensive corporate peers.
