This {{is the first}} report of S- 33 NMR signals of the latter two species from a solid. Good quality spectra, which have distinct, well separated shift ranges can be identified for all these groupings, except for <b>sulphites</b> and, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphites</b> whose resonances are very broad. Nonetheless the presence of <b>sulphites</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphites</b> can be confirmed from their characteristic sharp, intense time domain echoes. S- 33 MAS NMR is also applied {{to a range of}} dry and hydrous silicate glasses with similar to 1 wt% 99 at% S- 33 -enriched sulphur. It is clear that in all these glasses sulphate is present, and in mixed cation systems there is some evidence of preferential association of sulphate with a specific cation. In a dry potassium silicate glass sample two resolved S- 33 resonances are observed, a sulphate, and the second from thiosulphate. Hence solid state S- 33 NMR is shown to be a feasible probe that can be applied to this problem that can readily distinguish different sulphur species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|SUMMARY Despite {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} control the spread of malaria, this infectious disease is still a major global health problem as chemotherapy of malaria parasites is limited by established drug resistance and lack of novel affordable treatment options. To combat malaria, identification and characterization of essential genes are needed. Although the calcium metabolism {{is very important in}} the life of P. falciparum, {{little is known about the}} genes which regulate the transport of calcium. With the release of the P. falciparum genome, a putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter has been identified. To understand the role of this gene in the calcium metabolism of P. falciparum and to evaluate it as a drug target, we describe here the functional characterization by the heterologuous expression of this putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter in Xenopus oocytes and in a S. cerevisiae strain which is deficient for the yeast vacuolar <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter VCX 1. The putative 441 -residue protein, which we designate PfCHA, is predicted to contain 11 membrane-spanning segments and is related to the calcium exchanger family. Expression of pfcha in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a higher and pHdependent uptake of pfcha expressing oocytes, in comparison with control oocytes. External pH estimation showed that the calcium uptake was coupled to extrusion of protons out of the oocytes. In other experiments, we found that PfCHA has an antiport activity which is linear with time, unidirectional and electrogenic. Moreover PfCHA was inhibitable by La 3 +, a calcium transporter competitor, and was moderately inhibited by a sodium calcium exchanger inhibitor KB-R 7943. This inhibitor showed also a moderate inhibition on parasite growth in culture. In contrast to the Xenopus oocytes, expression of pfcha in yeasts mutants defective in the Ca 2 + transport resulted in a weakly complementat ion of the calcium tolerance. Our subcellular experiments suggested that PfCHA was localized to the yeast vacuole. These results confirm that PfCHA is a <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter and we speculate that PfCHA could be a potential drug target. Further studies are needed to localize it in the parasite and to evaluate it as a drug target...|$|R

Residual die-wall pressure (RDP) and maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) were measured. Various tablet physical properties were correlated to radial die-wall pressure.; With increasing compaction pressure, RDP and MDP (P > 0. 0001) increased for all materials, with increasing precompaction RDP decreased for plastic materials (P > 0. 05), whereas with increasing speed MDP decreased for all materials (P > 0. 05).
