And herein the unconsciousness of the Ogre Grompus was pleasantly conspicuous; for, that complacent monster, believing that he was giving Miss Podsnap a treat, prolonged to the utmost stretch of possibility a peripatetic account of an archery meeting; while his victim, heading the procession of sixteen as it slowly circled about, like a revolving funeral, never raised her eyes except once to steal a glance at Mrs Lammle, expressive of intense despair.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of a Norse building or settlement near the hotel in the forms of drystone walling, pottery, and traces of midden. According to St Olaf's Saga, Hlodvir Thorfinnsson, the Earl of Orkney, was buried at Huna about 980. The sites are described as a Norse settlement site, enclosure, Norse building, Norse midden and structure, and a Norse burial site. In 1935, a Norse boat burial about 200 m west of Huna House was documented by Curle. The burial {{was found in a}} mound, about 120 ft above the waterline. By 1980, the site where the remnants of the boat—timber, <b>chain,</b> <b>rivets,</b> and metal objects—were found showed no evidence of the former burial. It is now covered by a building and landscaping.|$|R

50|$|It was {{the policy}} of Cornwallis, whom Sir Henry Clinton, on his {{departure}} to New York, had left {{in command of the}} royal army, to compel submission by the severest measures. The bloody slaughter under Tarleton at Waxhaw Creek was an earnest of what those who ventured resistance might expect. This course was pursued with unscrupulous cruelty, and the unfortunate patriots were made to feel the vengeance of exasperated tyranny. He hoped thus eventually to crush and extinguish the spirit still struggling and flashing forth, like hidden fire, among the people whom the arm of power had for a season brought under subjection. But the oppressor, though he might overawe, could not subdue the spirit of a gallant and outraged people. The murmur of suffering throughout the land rose ere long into a mighty cry for deliverance. The royal standard became an object of execration. And while brave leaders were at hand - while the fearless and determined Sumter could draw about him the hardy sons of the upper and middle country - while the patriotic Marion, ever fertile in resource, could harass the foe from his impenetrable retreat in the recess of forests and swamps; while the resolute and daring Pickens could bring his bold associates to join in the noble determination to burst the <b>chains</b> <b>riveted</b> on a prostrate land - and others of the same mould, familiar with difficulties, accustomed to toil and danger, and devoted to the cause of their suffering country, were ready for prompt and energetic action, hope could be entertained that all was not yet lost. The outrages committed by the profligate and abandoned, whose loyalty was the cover for deeds of rapine and blood, served but to bind in closer union the patriots who watched their opportunity for annoying the enemy, and opening a way for successful resistance.|$|R
60|$|As {{this part}} of Lake Champlain is narrow, a {{connection}} was kept up between the two forts by a floating bridge, supported on twenty-two sunken piers in caissons, formed of very strong timber. Between the piers were separate floats, fifty feet long and twelve feet wide, strongly connected by iron <b>chains</b> and <b>rivets.</b> On {{the north side of}} the bridge was a boom, composed of large pieces of timber, secured by riveted bolts, and beside this was a double iron chain with links an inch and a half square. The bridge, boom, and chain were four hundred yards in length. This immense work, the labor of months, on which no expense had been spared, was intended, while it afforded a communication between the two forts, to protect the upper part of the lake, presenting, under cover of their guns, a barrier which it was presumed no hostile ship would be able to break through.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the original Meijer supermarkets and hypermarkets, Meijer opened several concept stores in the 1970s and 1980s. The first were specialty clothing store <b>chains</b> called Copper <b>Rivet,</b> Sagebrush and Tansy. Each store focused on a different form of brand-name clothing: Copper Rivet sold Levi's jeans, Sagebrush sold casual wear, and Tansy sold women's clothing. All three chains usually operated in front of existing Meijer stores, or in nearby shopping centers. These clothing chains were dissolved in the 1980s as brand-name clothing became more readily available at competing retailers. Sagebrush, which at its peak comprised 71 stores, was sold off in 1988, while Copper Rivet and Tansy stores were closed as their leases expired.|$|R

Two highly classified testbed aircraft (originally serial no. 64-0506 and -0507, but with all numbers [...] "sanitized" [...] from the aircraft), were assigned to Project Thin Slice to develop a low-level clandestine penetration aircraft for Special Forces operations in Southeast Asia. In 1964, Lockheed was ordered to adapt the C-130Es after six C-123B Providers modified for [...] "unconventional warfare" [...] under Project Duck Hook proved inadequate for the new MACV-SOG. The modifications under Thin Slice and its August 1966 successor Heavy <b>Chain</b> were code-named <b>Rivet</b> Yard, and the four C-130Es came to be known as [...] "Yards". Discrete modification tests were conducted by the 1198th Operational Evaluation and Training Squadron, out of Area II of Norton AFB at San Bernardino, California, 30 miles east of Ontario.|$|R
40|$|To {{manufacture}} multi-material hybrid {{parts for}} the automotive industry, mechanical joiningprocesses like riveting are well established. However, adhesive bonding is increasingly beingused {{in the car}} body. The combination of the specific advantages of both joining techniques inform of hybrid joints yields in synergies of manufacturing, crash and durability performance. Critical issues are the formation of adhesive bags {{in the region of}} the mechanical junctionsand global deformations of the metal blanks between the mechanical joints. Bags in the regionof the mechanical junctions decrease the strength of the mechanical joints [1]. Globaldeformations caused by the formation of adhesives bags while the multi-point mechanicalfixation process takes place, influence the smoothness of the bonded part’s surface [2]. Thisproject focuses the numerical simulation of the time dependent formation process of bothtypes of bags. The subject of the work presented is focussed on self-pierce-riveting in combination withadhesive bonding. In the industrial process <b>chain</b> the <b>rivets</b> are set before the adhesive iscured. A FEA reference model is developed for the elementary riveting processes. The modelmust be expanded with the displacement of the liquid adhesive. Coupled fluid-structuresimulations, which include the interaction of the solid matter influenced in the mechanicaljoining process and the fluid adhesive, are presented. In a last step a surrogate model for themulti-point hybrid joint is developed. Simulations are compared with the results ofexperiments carried out in [1], [2]. Based on the increased process knowledge due to simulation the hybrid joining processes canbe optimized for industrial use by improved selection of materials and process parameters...|$|R

6000|$|These gifted Latin monks {{never do}} any thing by halves. If {{they were to}} show you the Brazen Serpent that was {{elevated}} in the wilderness, you could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on also, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the [...] "Grotto" [...] of the Annunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to his mouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her sitting-room, where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with Hebrew toys eighteen hundred years ago. All under one roof, and all clean, spacious, comfortable [...] "grottoes." [...] It seems curious that personages intimately connected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes--in Nazareth, in Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus--and yet nobody else in their day and generation thought of doing any thing of the kind. If they ever did, their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of. When the Virgin fled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the same is there to this day. The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem was done in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a grotto--both are shown to pilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events all happened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because the strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the living rock will last forever. It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it is one that all men ought to thank the Catholics for. Wherever they ferret out a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightway build a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve the memory of that locality for the gratification of future generations. If it had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would not even know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put his finger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world. The world owes the Catholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these bogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory to look at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuries that the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place for her somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this town of Nazareth. There is too large a scope of country. The imagination can not work. There is no one particular spot to <b>chain</b> your eye, <b>rivet</b> your interest, and make you think. The memory of the Pilgrims can not perish while Plymouth Rock remains to us. The old monks are wise. They know how to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it to its place forever.|$|R
