5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky. However the x-ray emission is due to stable <b>coronal</b> structures and not eruptive flaring activity. <b>Coronal</b> loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely to be responsible {{for the majority of the}} x-rays.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coronals</b> {{are very}} special sound segments. There is {{abundant}} evidence from various fields of phonetics which clearly establishes <b>coronals</b> {{as a class}} of consonants appropriate for phonological analysis. The set of <b>coronals</b> is stable across varieties of English unlike other consonant types, e. g. labials and dorsals, which are subject {{to a greater or}} lesser degree of variation. <b>Coronals</b> exhibit stability in inventories crosslinguistically, but they simultaneously display flexibility in alternations, i. e. assimilation, deletion, epenthesis, and dissimilation, when it is required by the contradictory forces of perception and production. The two main, opposing types of alternation that <b>coronals</b> in SAE participate in are examined. These are weakening phenomena, i. e. assimilation and deletion, and strengthening phenomena, i. e. epenthesis and dissimilation. <b>Coronals</b> are notorious for their contradictory behavior, especially in alternations. This type of behavior can be accounted for within a phonetically grounded OT framework that unites both phonetic and phonological aspects of alternations. Various sets of inherently conflicting FAITHFULNESS and MARKEDNESS constraints that are needed for an OT analysis of SAE alternations are intoduced...|$|R

5|$|The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) {{mission was}} {{launched}} in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as <b>coronal</b> mass ejections.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy flux}} from Vega has been {{precisely}} measured against standard light sources. At 5480Å, the flux is 3,650Jy with an error margin of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega {{is dominated by}} absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar <b>coronal</b> hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any <b>coronal</b> X-rays would not be emitted {{along the line of}} sight.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. <b>Coronal</b> loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The <b>coronal</b> loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. <b>Coronal</b> mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from <b>coronal</b> holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power. Solar activity {{is thought to have}} played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to <b>coronal</b> temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} <b>coronal</b> mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain <b>coronal</b> heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
5|$|Satellite {{measurements}} made in 1999 {{with the}} Wide Field Infrared Explorer {{showed that the}} brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours. It is a weak source of <b>coronal</b> X-ray emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity {{may be due to}} convection cells forming at the cooler equator.|$|E

5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. <b>Coronal</b> morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E

Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these <b>coronal</b> loop regions, <b>coronal</b> loops can often be the precursor to solar flares and <b>coronal</b> mass ejections (CMEs).|$|E

25|$|<b>Coronal</b> {{seismology}} {{is a new}} way {{of studying}} the plasma of the solar corona with the use of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids—in this case the fluid is the <b>coronal</b> plasma. Philosophically, <b>coronal</b> seismology is similar to the Earth's seismology, the Sun's helioseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of <b>coronal</b> seismology in the estimation of the <b>coronal</b> magnetic field, density scale height, fine structure and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or <b>coronal</b> plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a <b>coronal</b> plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a <b>coronal</b> plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A longitudinal plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The <b>coronal</b> plane and the sagittal plane are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coronal</b> stars, or stars {{within a}} <b>coronal</b> cloud, are {{ubiquitous}} {{among the stars}} in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Experiments with instruments aboard Skylab and Copernicus have been used to search for soft X-ray emission in the energy range ~0.14–0.284 keV from stellar coronae. The experiments aboard ANS succeeded in finding X-ray signals from Capella and Sirius (α CMa). X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first <b>coronal</b> X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing <b>coronal</b> wind.|$|E
