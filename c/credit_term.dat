40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal trade <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> {{decision}} in an extended economic ordering quantity (EOQ) framework that incorporates a default risk component. A principal-agent bilevel programming model with costs minimization objectives {{is set up}} to derive the incentive-compatible <b>credit</b> <b>term.</b> The supplier determines the <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> as the leader in the first level programming, by balancing her/his financing capacity with the retailer's default risk, order behavior and cost shifting. At the second level, the retailer makes decisions on ordering and payment time by reacting on the term offered by the supplier. A first order condition solution procedure is derived for the bilevel programming when <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> is confined within the practically feasible interval. Two key results are obtained - the condition to derive incentive-compatible <b>credit</b> <b>term,</b> and an equation system to derive threshold default risk criterion filtering retailers suitable for credit granting. Numerical experiments show that the capital cost of the supplier {{is the most important}} factor determining the <b>credit</b> <b>term.</b> Default risk acts like a filtering criterion for selecting retailers suitable for credit granting.

40|$|We compare Longstaff and Schwartz (1995) (the LS model) and Merton (1974) using Eurodollar data.

The Merton model, on the other hand, does have some advantages over the LS model. For a currently solvent firm, the Merton model can generate a hump-shaped <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure that converges to a positive constant as time to maturity goes to infinity. In contrast, the LS model generates a hump-shaped credit structure that converges to zero. We estimate and test both models using observed Eurodollar <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures in 1992.

40|$|We give a {{comprehensive}} review of <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure modeling methodologies. The conventional approach to modeling <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure is summarized and shown to be equivalent to a particular type of the reduced form credit risk model, the fractional recovery of market value approach. We argue that the corporate practice and market observations do not support this approach. The more appropriate assumption is the fractional recovery of par, which explicitly violates the strippable cash flow valuation assumption that is necessary for the conventional <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure definitions to hold. We formulate the survival-based valuation methodology and give alternative specifications for various <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures that are consistent with market observations, and show how they can be empirically estimated from the observable prices. We rederive the credit triangle relationship by considering the replication of recovery swaps. We complete the exposition by presenting a consistent measure of CDS-Bond basis and demonstrate its relation to a static hedging strategy, which remains valid for non-par bonds and non-flat term structures of interest rates and credit risk. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} {{relation}} between asset reliability and security prices. Concerns about asset reliability are increasing with the move to fair value accounting in general purpose financial reports. We provide pertinent evidence from credit markets. A key benefit of using credit market data to explore the capital market implications of asset reliability is the theoretical basis of Duffie and Lando (Econometrica 69 (3) : 633 â 664, 2001). They show that asset reliability (measurement) concerns should be concentrated in short-term credit spreads. Thus a focus on <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure can facilitate a cleaner identification {{of the impact of}} asset reliability on security prices. We find that asset reliability issues, attributable to SFAS 157 disclosures of Level 2 and, especially, Level 3 financial assets for a set of US financial institutions over the period of August 2007 to March 2009, are a significant determinant of short-term credit spreads and the shape of the general <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure.

40|$|In {{the current}} literature, {{the focus of}} credit risk {{analysis}} has been either on the valuation of risky corporate bond and credit spread, or on the valuation of vulnerable options, but never both in the same context. There are two main concerns with existing studies. First, corporate bonds and credit spreads are generally analyzed in a context where corporate debt is the only liability of the firm and firm's value follows a continuous stochastic process. This set-up implies a zero short term spread, which is strongly rejected by empirical observations. The failure of generating non-zero short term credit spreads {{may be attributed to}} the simplified assumption on corporate liabilities. Since a corporation generally has more than one type of liabilities, modelling multiple liabilities may help to incorporate discontinuity in firm's value and hence lead to realistic <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures.

The empirical model improves on previous models by addressing the bias from omitted debt portfolio variable, and recognizing that <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> variables included in existing models are not econometrically exogenous in explaining default and possible foreclosure. We â¦nd that high bankruptcy homestead exemptions, judicial foreclosure, and prohibition of deâ¦ciency judgments are associated with greater default and foreclosure rates and have a small negative eÂ¤ect on the fraction of serious delinquencies that lead to foreclosure. Higher personal property exemptions are generally inversely related to serious delinquencies and foreclosures. And for prime mortgages higher personal property exemptions are associated with lower share of foreclosure starts as a fraction of serious delinquencies. These results suggest that lenders in default friendly states may seek to resolve default outside of foreclosure and avoid pushing borrowers to seek relief by â¦ling for bankruptcy...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the sustainable trade credit and inventory policies with demand related to credit {{period and the}} environmental sensitivity of consumers under the carbon cap-and-trade and carbon tax regulations. First, the decision models are constructed under three cases: without regulation, carbon cap-and-trade regulation, and carbon tax regulation. The optimal solutions of the retailer in the three cases are then discussed under the exogenous and endogenous credit periods. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to obtain conclusions. The retailer shortens the trade credit period as the environmental sensitivity of the consumer is enhanced. The cap has no effects on the credit period decisions under the carbon cap-and-trade regulation. Carbon trade price and carbon tax have negative effects on the credit period. The retailer under carbon cap-and-trade regulation is more motivated to obey regulations than that under carbon tax regulation when carbon trade price equals carbon tax.

40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how decoupled direct payments, paid to farm operators based on historical yields and base acreage, may lead to production distortions by altering a farmer's access to credit or enabling the farmer to receive more favorable <b>credit</b> <b>terms.</b> The authors estimate the impact of decoupled direct payments under the 2002 Farm Bill on the <b>credit</b> <b>terms</b> of farm operators, specifically the interest rate on short-term operating loans. If farm operators are able to obtain more favorable <b>credit</b> <b>terms</b> and reduce their operating cost, then this offers an additional mechanism through which decoupled payments may distort current production. Design/methodology/approach â The authors estimate the impact of decoupled direct payments on the interest rate on short-term operating loans. In the analysis, the authors control for farm financial characteristics, farm operator characteristics, and other factors. Data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey for the years 2005 - 2007, are used in the weighted regression analysis. Jackknifed standard errors are also computed. Findings â As the proportion of base acres to total operated acres increases it is found that interest rates decline by a small but statistically significant amount. This implies that direct payments lead to lower operating costs through better <b>credit</b> <b>terms.</b> Research limitations/implications â Lower operating costs may in turn allow some farmers to expand production or produce on land that would otherwise be unprofitable to operate and hence left idle. Ultimately, this distorts current production. However, the small magnitude of the authors' results suggests that the reduction in interest rates, though positive, may have limited distortionary impacts. Originality/value â The paper provides evidence that decoupled payments alter a farm operator's <b>credit</b> <b>terms</b> and hence could lead to current production distortions. The paper contributes to the growing body of research investigating the mechanisms by which decoupled payments have the potential to distort current production.
