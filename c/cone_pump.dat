The stator rubber bushing {{is not only a}} damageable element, but also the key component deciding the service life and efficiency of the pump. Up to date, none effective method has been found for testing the deformation and enforced state of the stator’s rubber under the real working condition. For the general conventional screw stator with uniform internal pressure {{at both ends of the}} stator bushing enforced and deformed almost the same, as to other case when the <b>cone</b> screw <b>pump</b> stator has rubbers with different cross-sectional size and thickness at its different end, the enforcing and deforming state at different end varies differently. The stator of the opposed biconinal <b>cone</b> screw hydraulic <b>pump</b> is studied in this paper for the case when the stator is uniformly enforced, using finite element analyzing software ANSYS-Workbench, this study concluded the stress, the strain and inner-figure deformation of the screw hydraulic pump stator, the stator rubber and the stator steel thimble. Besides, the characteristics and rules of opposed biconinal <b>cone</b> screw hydraulic <b>pump</b> deformation are summarized as well...|$|R
40|$|Orbital angular {{momentum}} entanglement {{is one of}} the most intriguing topics in quantum physics. A broad range of research have been dedicated either to unravel its underlying physics or to expand the entanglement dimensions and degrees. In this paper, we present a theoretical study on the orbital {{angular momentum}} entanglement by employing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to quantum position correlation within the azimuthal region. In this study, we decompose the pump light into a set of <b>pump</b> <b>cone</b> states characterized by their radii. The OAM entanglement can be manipulated by controlling the radius of the <b>pump</b> <b>cone</b> state, the length of the nonlinear crystal and the OAM carried by the pump field,which is followed by a detailed discussion. We expect that our research will bring us a deeper understanding of the OAM entanglement, and will do help to the high-dimensional quantum information tasks based on OAM entanglement.

40|$|A quasi-steady-state single pit pumping and {{recovery}} test to measure in situ the transmissivity {{of the highly}} permeable upper layer of raised bogs, the acrotelm, is described and discussed. The basic concept is the expanding depression <b>cone</b> during both <b>pumping</b> {{and recovery}}. It is shown that applying this concept yields comparable results from pumping test and recovery, although {{the flexibility of the}} acrotelm matrix may cause considerable differences during individual tests.

40|$|This study investigates whether fine-scale clay drapes {{can cause}} an {{anisotropic}} pumping test response {{at a much}} larger scale. A pumping test was performed in a sandbar deposit consisting of cross-bedded units composed of materials with different grain sizes and hydraulic conductivities. The measured drawdown values in the different observation wells reveal an anisotropic or elliptically-shaped <b>pumping</b> <b>cone.</b> The major axis of the pumping ellipse is parallel with the strike of cm to m-scale clay drapes that are observed in several outcrops. To determine (1) whether this large-scale anisotropy can {{be the result of}} fine-scale clay drapes and (2) whether application of multiple-point geostatistics can improve interpretation of pumping tests, this pumping test is analyzed with a local 3 D groundwater model in which fine-scale sedimentary heterogeneity is modelled using multiple-point geostatistics. To reduce CPU and RAM demand of the multiple-point geostatistical simulation step, edge properties indicating the presence of irregularly-shaped surfaces are directly simulated. Results show that the anisotropic <b>pumping</b> <b>cone</b> {{can be attributed to the}} presence of the clay drapes. Incorporating fine-scale clay drapes results in a better fit between observed and calculated drawdowns. These results thus show that fine-scale clay drapes can cause an anisotropic pumping test response at a much larger scale and that the combined approach of multiple-point geostatistics and cell edge properties is an efficient method for integrating fine-scale features in larger scale models.

Subject categories and indexing terms: Lasers (Fibre lasers), Optics (Optical pumping) Introduction: Double-clad rare-earth-doped fibres (DCREDFs) combined with multimode pump diodes make excellent high-power laser sources. In this scheme, while the multimode pump beam propagates in the large inner cladding, the laser signal is generated in a much smaller doped core. Thus, a high-brightness or even diffraction-limited laser output beam is readily achievable. However, the pump absorption rate in a cladding-pumped scheme is muc...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comIn the wine district of Clare Valley in South Australia, the natural-voltage SP signal generated by fluid flow in fractured rock during a pumping test was carefully monitored by time-continuous measurements. From ten electrode locations surrounding the pumping well, the drawdown <b>cone</b> produced by <b>pumping</b> was determined {{on the basis of the}} SP measurements together with laboratory measurements of the grain-boundary + (zeta) -potential. Such measurements allowed calculation of the fractured-rock aquifer's transmissivity and average permeability. Results were confirmed by piezometer measurements to the extent that data were available. The study has revealed that SP signals generated during pumping tests are of a complex nature. However, if the pumping test is sufficiently long to allow the signal to stabilise, and careful field procedures are in place, then SP measurements have the potential to add significant hydrogeological information. SP measurements are relatively easy and cheap, and are, contrary to traditional methods, not restricted to the locations of existing piezometers, which is particularly useful in fractured-rock aquifers.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} made of veneer failure by {{cracking}} in all-ceramic crown-like layer structures. Model trilayers consisting of a 1 mm thick external glass layer (veneer) joined to a 0. 5 mm thick inner stiff and hard ceramic support layer (core) by epoxy bonding or by fusion are fabricated for testing. The resulting bilayers are then glued to a thick compliant polycarbonate slab to simulate a dentin base. The specimens are subjected to cyclic contact (occlusal) loading with spherical indenters in an aqueous environment. Video cameras are used to record the fracture evolution in the transparent glass layer in situ during testing. The dominant failure mode is cone cracking in the glass veneer by traditional outer (Hertzian) cone cracks at higher contact loads and by inner (hydraulically <b>pumped)</b> <b>cone</b> cracks at lower loads. Failure is deemed to occur when one of these cracks reaches the veneer/core interface. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the alumina and zirconia core materials are discussed in terms of mechanical properties—strength and toughness, as well as stiffness. Consideration is also given to the roles of interface strength and residual thermal expansion mismatch stresse...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the ca-pability of axisymmetric swirling flow models to correctly reproduce the flow features in the draft tube <b>cone</b> of a <b>pump</b> turbine. Time averaged PIV velocity measurements for three operating points (part load, best efficiency, over load) are used to assess the accuracy of the numerical results. It is shown that the axisymmetric swirling flow model can capture both flow detachment from the cone wall, at low swirl levels, {{and the development of a}} large quasi-stagnant region in the center, at high swirl levels. A brief analysis of the accuracy of turbine flow simu-lations reveals the difficulties in accurately estimate the swirl level downstream the turbine runner, particu-larly for low specific speed machines. The numerical simulations favorably compare with experimental data at part load and best efficiency operating points. However, it is shown that the inlet boundary condi-tions used at the over load point significantly under-estimate the swirl level. As a result, we conclude that accurate swirling flow numerical results heavily rely on the draft tube cone inlet boundary conditions corresponding to the swirling flow downstream the turbine runner blades...|$|R
40|$|The Northeast Groundwater Management Area of Wisconsin, USA {{contains}} two major cones {{of depression in}} a confined sandstone aquifer. Each cone is centered near cities that have used groundwater for over 100 years. Near one of these cities (Green Bay), episodic changes {{in the development of}} groundwater and surface water resources during this period have resulted in major changes to the potentiometric surface. On two occasions, roughly 50 years apart, reductions in groundwater withdrawals have resulted from the construction of pipelines drawing surface water from Lake Michigan. In each case, rapid recovery of the potentiometric surface by as much as 70 m has occurred in the northern of the two <b>pumping</b> <b>cones.</b> The most recent switch occurred during 2006 and 2007 when eight communities stopped pumping groundwater, reducing daily withdrawals by approximately 46. 37 million liters. The rate of water level recovery has diminished in some areas, with a return to a flowing artesian state for some municipal and residential wells. Although the northern portion of the groundwater management area has returned to a sustainable condition in the confined aquifer, the portion with the southern cone of depression remains in a state of prolonged drawdown...|$|R
40|$|Las localidades de Cariló y Villa Gesell se han edificado sobre una barrera medanosa de no más de 1400 años de antigüedad. Con el fin de analizar la estratigrafía y sedimentología del subsuelo de la zona, se recurrió a 15 perforaciones, {{realizadas}} en el predio del proyecto de Ciudad Marina de Port Dorá, donde pudieron identificarse tres estratos arenosos asignables a acuíferos, sobre la base de la descripción granulométrica de las muestras recolectadas, y conocidas como Fm Punta Médanos, Fm Pozo N° 8, y Fm Canal 5. Para confirmar la información, se realizaron ocho ensayos de bombeo. La infiltración está distribuida uniformemente sobre toda el área y el flujo del agua subterránea es hacia el mar, con zonas intermedanosas donde aflora el nivel freático. Durante los meses transcurridos entre los controles de la calidad de las aguas subterráneas, los parámetros medidos (temperatura, pH, salinidad, oxígeno disuelto, turbidez) resultaron normales para los ambientes en que se practicaron las mediciones. Dada la baja densidad ocupacional de Cariló, los volúmenes aportados por precipitaciones en el área son suficientes para abastecer la demanda durante los días de verano. La transmisividad promedio obtenida es de 206, 2 m²/día para los acuíferos libres y de 130, 97 m²/día para los semiconfinados. La permeabilidad promedio estimada es de 18, 23 m/día y 4, 19 m/día, respectivamente. Cariló and Villa Gesell localities {{were constructed}} on a barrier younger than 1, 400 years BP. Dealing with the stratigraphic and textural characteritics of this area, 15 holes were drilled {{to a depth}} of 40 m at the property projected as "Ciudad Marina de Port Dora". Three sandy strata were assigned to aquifers and test by pumping essays. These aquifers considered of hydrogeologic interest comprise the stratigraphical units called Punta Medanos, Pozo N° 8 and Canal 5. The dune field is composed of transverse bodies oriented toward the north-northeast. Infiltration is uniformly distributed although at interdune ponds the water table is above the land surface. Water quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity) at the testing wells located close to the beach retrieves freshwater. In the sandy barrier from Villa Gesell and Cariló the sandy silts of hydrogeologic interest continue to depths below 40 m. The sedimentary record of the Eastern Barrier of Buenos Aires Province consists on a complex barrier (overlapping of barrier deposits of Quaternary age), modified during the Holocene transgressive-regressive cycle and where these transgressive and regressive processes are still being recorded at some locations (progradation of Punta Médanos, scarps of foredunes in Mar Chiquita). Considering the low density population of the area, precipitation is estimated as able to provide the volume of water needed during the summer season for the resort villages. Average trasmissivity is about 206 m²/day for the free aquifer and 130 m²/day for the semiconfined aquifers. Average permeability is 18. 23 and 4. 19 m/day at each type of aquifers. It is recommended to avoid the on-exploitation of the free aquifer in order to preserve their volumes, to prevent <b>pumping</b> <b>cones</b> and to avoid saline intrusions at the coast. The hydrogeologic reserves exceed the water volume supplied from the pampian silts (Buenos Aires formation) located {{to the west of the}} Route 11. The evaluation of these inputs of groundwater is recommended in order to better manage the semiconfined levels. Even though, recycling and reusing should be considered for the urban growth planing. At the coastal barrier, below the phreatic aquifer, a semiconfined horizontal level of variable thickness was recognised, and superimposed to a second semiconfined aquifer. This second semiconfined level with plane base and irregular top, is superimposed to a third semiconfined aquifer whose base was not drilled...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of geologic factors in controlling flow patterns in hydraulic systems is evaluated by hydraulic models which are constructed as a porous consolidated media that simulates the interstitial geometry of consolidated rocks. Colored inks are {{injected into the}} flow system and are observed through the transparent sides of the model case. Visual analysis of the flow system, leads to salient conclusions concerning fundamental aspects of complex flow systems. Empirical experiments were conducted on the following aspects: Refraction of flow lines across lithologic interfaces: The law of streamline refraction, as described by King Hubbert, {{was found to be}} correct where boundary conditions do not interfere. Continuity of flow around and through highly permeable and impermeable lenses of different lithologies: The flow system around impermeable lenses indicates the nonexistence of stagnant areas where a hydraulic gradient is imposed on a saturated ground water system. Flow net system caused by a single pumping well: Transient changes of individual flow vectors, within the immediate area of influence, were analyzed at the moment pumping began. The absence of a transition phase indicates a rapid adjustment of the flow system to the pumping condition. Flow net system of mutual interference of depression <b>cones</b> caused by <b>pumping</b> multiple wells: This permitted an analysis of the ground water divide. Flow bands divided into flow paths which moved in opposite directions. Effects of emplacing pumping wells in highly permeable media: The increased area of {{influence of}} water movement to wells was clearly illustrated. This analysis demonstrates the capture of partially confined flow from great dths. The relation of the shape of artificial recharge pits to infiltration rate: Variations of flow net systems of rectangular and wedge-shaped pits were analyzed. When all other factors were held constant, the shape of the recharge pit was found to have no important effect upon recharge rate. Flow toward an effluent stream: The potential head of ground water beneath the stream was found to increase with depth. The relationship between hydraulic gradient and flow net configuration: The hydraulic gradient was found to have no effect on the flow net of a confined system, but a definite effect upon unconfined flow systems, in as much as it alters the water table which is the upper flow boundary. Flow pattern through tilted and faulted sedimentary structures: The geometric convergence of the aquifer boundaries caused the convergence of flow lines through a brecciated fault zone. A possible genesis of a hydrothermal vein ore was suggested by this flow pattern. Formation of perched water tables: The mechanisms by which saturated ground water mounds can be formed on a low permeability lens was demonstrated. Evidence was found which indicates that perched ground water probably escapes through the perching body as well as around its extremities. Confluence of gravity water and saturated flow: Unsaturated flow arriving at the water table of the saturated ground water body becomes an integral part of that body which acts as a single hydrodynamic system. Artesian ground water systems: A model illustrating the classic artesian aquifer situation was constructed, andflowing and non-flowing artesian wells were studied. A ground water mound was formed in the water table aquifer by water discharging naturally from the artesian aquifer through a fault in the confining layer. Subsidence around a pumping well: Water was pumped from a simulated artesian well, the piezometric surface {{in the vicinity of the}} well was lowered and the overburden was observed to subside while compressing the artesian aquifer. Cone of depression formed around single and multiple well systems: The drawdown at any point within the area of influence of a multiple well system was shown to be equal to the sum of the individual drawdowns of each well in the multiple well system, provided recharge and evaporation are neglected. Information resulting from these studies will provide guides for scientific development and exploitation of ground water supplies. Contributions were made that will advance the use of hydraulic models as exploratory tools in scientific hydrology. Further, this work brought into focus the importance of hydraulic models as couinunication media for interpreting cause-effect relationships in highly complex flow systems, of the type that so often are involved in regional problems of water resource development and management...|$|R
