500|$|Scalia {{calls the}} Court's {{conclusion}} {{to hear the}} case [...] "patently erroneous". His first argument relies {{on the part of the}} Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) (effective December 30, 2005) that states [...] "o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or <b>consider</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." [...] §1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742. Scalia's opinion is that this clause suffices to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case, calling the majority's reading [...] of the effectiveness provisions of §1005(h), a [...] "mess". He cites Bruner v. United States and other cases granting [...] "immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation". He wrote that in interpreting the language in the DTA, the majority ignored Supreme Court precedents which established that a statute excluding jurisdiction applies to pending cases unless it has clear language saying it does not. Scalia claimed that the majority had made this interpretation [...] "for the flimsiest of reasons". He was referring to the majority's use of Senate floor debate records to bolster their interpretation, writing that it [...] "makes no difference" [...] that the language in support of his position was inserted into the Congressional Record after the law was voted upon. He also accuses the majority of ignoring the President's Signing Statement.|$|E

2500|$|Mr Justice Devlin {{received}} a phone call from Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, at the time defence and prosecution were making their closing speeches. In the event of Adams being acquitted, Lord Goddard suggested that Devlin might <b>consider</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> to release Adams on bail before the Hullett trial, which was due to start afterwards. Devlin was surprised because no one accused of murder had ever been granted bail in British legal history, but he was willing to entertain the idea. During the committal hearing prior to the trial, Goddard had been seen dining with Sir Roland Gwynne at The White Hart Hotel in Lewes. Goddard, as Lord Chief Justice, [...] appointed Devlin to try the Adams case shortly after the end of the committal hearing and, in a meeting of 19th February 1957, Goddard gave Devlin his views on the case.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} between the ICJ and the Security Council, and the separation of their powers, was considered by the Court in 1992, in the Pan Am case. The Court had to <b>consider</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> from Libya for the order of provisional measures to protect its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed {{by the threat of}} economic sanctions by the UK and United States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorised by the Security Council, which resulted with a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the Court. The Court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the Montreal Convention, could no longer be upheld since the action was justified by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations.|$|E
