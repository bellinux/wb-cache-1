5|$|Bolesław's expansionist {{policies}} were <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> the Polish state {{and were not}} always successful. He lost, for example, the economically crucial Farther Pomerania in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Kołobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.|$|E
5|$|Taxes and tariffs {{are high}} for private {{enterprises}}, while state enterprises are strongly subsidised. State regulation is <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> companies; starting or closing a business {{is slow and}} costly. Government spending was predicted to reach 67% of GDP in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The cost of free {{allocation}} of units to emitters {{is a highly}} contentious subject. The Sustainability Council argued that the {{allocation of}} units to industry is highly <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> taxpayers.|$|E
50|$|Iron Ore became {{harder and}} <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> {{win in the}} mines beyond Rowrah. The RKFR last paid a {{dividend}} in 1910, with Limestone being the biggest contributor. Most mines were worked out by 1914.|$|R
50|$|It was {{realised}} {{from its}} inception that the institution would be a <b>costly</b> one <b>to</b> set up and still <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> maintain. The Church of South India placed some of its land and buildings at Nettur, Tellicherry {{at the disposal of}} the institute. Some buildings were reconditioned and a few new ones were constructed by NTTF. The donor agencies assured the necessary funds, supply of adequate machine tools and accessories and deputation of technical experts from abroad.|$|R
50|$|Sepsis was {{the most}} {{expensive}} condition treated in United States' hospital stays in 2013, at an aggregate cost of $23.6 billion for nearly 1.3 million hospitalizations. Costs for sepsis hospital stays more than quadrupled since 1997 with an 11.5 percent annual increase. By payer, it {{was the most}} <b>costly</b> condition billed <b>to</b> Medicare and the uninsured, the second-most <b>costly</b> billed <b>to</b> Medicaid, and the fourth-most <b>costly</b> billed <b>to</b> private insurance.|$|R
5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to be quite <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is currently used as storage {{and was used}} for the district alternative education program for students with discipline problems prior to mid-2008. Cleveland said that because Alamo was the district's oldest elementary school, and the <b>costliest</b> <b>to</b> maintain, it was the best choice for closure.|$|R

30|$|The cost of {{operating}} the adaptive lighting in 2010 – 2014 to grow lettuce for 20  h per day {{is estimated to}} be USD 194.78 per light per year or for a one hectare greenhouse USD 233, 738 per year. As expected, the lights are <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> operate in winter than in summer (Fig. 3).|$|R
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows is <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|Written by Philip Hinchcliffe, {{this story}} {{involved}} the Doctor and Romana encountering an alien Luron called Godrin who crash {{landed in a}} South American jungle in 1870. Adams wrote to Hinchcliffe on 3 January 1979, explaining that the proposed script would be too <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> produce. It was later adapted as The Valley of Death by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in January 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>costly</b> pipes <b>to</b> bring condensing {{cold water}} to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed, thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs.|$|R
5000|$|Beam seals are <b>costly</b> metal <b>to</b> metal seals used {{primarily}} in aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason was}} that its fleet {{contained}} too many different, incompatible aircraft types. Some of these aircraft were older and less efficient than those operated by competitors such as Air Europe. Consequently, the Dan-Air fleet was <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> operate and maintain. The Boeing 727s, which Dan-Air continued to acquire throughout the 1980s, including some on unfavourable leases, proved a financial millstone.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|After the disbandment of No. 50 Squadron, two Vulcans {{continued}} {{flying with}} the RAF in air displays {{as part of}} the Vulcan Display Flight, based at Waddington but administered through No. 55 Squadron, based at RAF Marham. Initially displaying using XL426, in 1986 that aircraft was sold, having been replaced by XH558, which began displays in 1985. The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Another {{institution}} key to unifying the German states, the Zollverein, {{helped to}} create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans, Count von Bülow, as a Prussian customs union in 1818, the Zollverein linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers among the German states, especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods, making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> buy, transport, and sell raw materials. This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers, {{most of which were}} located in the Rhineland, the Saar, and the Ruhr valleys.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the problem}} was variety shows {{becoming}} <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> produce, compared to the Texaco days when, among other factors, name guest stars didn't mind the low appearance fees they got for appearing, because they could bank the exposure they got from even one appearance on the Berle show; or, with Fred Allen and Ed Wynn in its earlier radio incarnations.|$|R

Than is Mrs. Shelley's emendation (1839) for That, the word in the editio princeps (1819) printed in Italy, and in the (standard) edition of 1821. The sense is: 'The crime he witnessed {{could not have}} proved <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> redeem than his murder has proved to me.' ...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E
5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo – {{a bedroom}} community of Caracas – are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted {{from a lack of}} land for large scale office construction, making it <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrival of}} sound {{technology}} made it <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> produce serials, {{so that they}} were no longer as profitable on a flat rental basis. Further, the Great Depression made it impossible for many of the smaller companies that produced serials to upgrade to sound, and they went out of business. Only one serial specialty company, Mascot Pictures, transitioned from silent to sound filmmaking. Universal Pictures also kept its serial unit alive through the transition.|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of this case stems its conclusion that employers' actions or policies that appear reasonable and neutral but nevertheless have a disparate impact on older workers are discriminatory in practice. In the majority opinion, Justice Souter wrote, “There is no denying that putting employers {{to the work of}} persuading fact-finders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> defend,” but that was an issue that Congress should address.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved very <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> UBS.|$|E
5|$|James of Saint George, {{a famous}} {{architect}} and engineer from Savoy, was probably {{responsible for the}} bulk of the construction work across the region. The castles were extremely <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> build and required labourers, masons, carpenters, diggers, and building resources to be gathered by local sheriffs from across England, mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved placed a significant drain on the country's national labour force. The total financial cost cannot be calculated with certainty, but estimates suggest that Edward's castle building programme cost at least £80,000 – four times the total royal expenditure on castles between 1154 and 1189.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land {{around the tree}} was {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too <b>costly</b> <b>to</b> undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|Shaw had {{prepared}} preliminary designs of Woodland House by August 1875, and building began early in 1876, with construction being undertaken by W. H. Lascelles. The initial {{cost of building}} the house was £4,500. Fildes and his family moved into {{the house in the}} Autumn of 1877. Fildes house was larger than Marcus Stone's, and <b>costlier</b> <b>to</b> build. Shortly after Fildes had commissioned Shaw to design his house, Fildes' grandmother, Mary, had died, leaving him her property.|$|R
