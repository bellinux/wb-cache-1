It has great differences with professional art. Many professional artists believe that it is an unreasonable design, however, in the eye of Qingyang artists, it is quite usual. Such as the sachet of “cats eat rats”, there are several rat embroidered on the stomach of the <b>cat</b> <b>shape</b> sachet. They imagine that the rats were still alive after eaten by cat. Or the sachet of “Janus (double-dealer)” with nose, eyes, and mouth on both side of the face, it is the ideal imagination of the human facial features.|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of quantum}} open systems, and their output response, when driven by quantum input noise in a nonclassical state is of key importance to quantum technology. Here we give explicit constructions of quantum modulating filters which generate desired nonclassical states (coherent states, <b>cat</b> states, <b>shaped</b> single and multi-photon states) of quantum optical fields from vacuum noise input. The nonclassical state features (coherence, entanglement, Fock state, etc.) of the modulating filter, itself a linear passive open system, are {{transferred to the}} continuous variable output field state. The filter dynamics may additionally shape the output to obtain specific target states. It is shown that the open dynamics of a general quantum Markov system driven by these nonclassical inputs {{is equivalent to the}} cascaded filter-plus-system model with vacuum field inputs.

50|$|One {{method for}} tying the bottle sling {{is similar to}} the loop-and-weave method used to tie the jury mast knot and the trumpet knot. The knot is begun by making a bight in a piece of rope and folding the bight back on itself to make two {{separated}} loops that are mirror images of each other. Lay one loop {{on top of the other}} so that they overlap slightly and create a <b>cat's</b> eye <b>shaped</b> hole above a triangular shaped hole between the two loops. Make a bird's beak with your index and thumb and weave them down through the loop, up through the cat's eye and down through the bottom loop, bunching the coils of rope against your fingers. Pinch the section of rope that was the bottom of the triangle and flip the coils over the pinched section. The flip may take a little practice, but the pinched section should become a short bight hanging off a circular shaped knot.|$|R

Two cats, Mr. Dolly and Che own Dolly’s Bookstore and they don’t {{appreciate}} his visit on this evening. Stetson tries to disguise himself, {{hiding in a}} pile of stuffed animals, but Mr. Dolly really does not want Stetson in his store today. Stetson finds another place to hide in a cowboy hat <b>shaped</b> <b>cat</b> bed. Because he is small, Stetson can just fit into the bed and he falls asleep. At children’s story time, the bookstore gets busy and very noisy, Stetson heads into the evening looking for food and warmth.As the night grows colder, icicles form on the buildings and on Stetson’s beard. Wandering up Main Street looking for food, Stetson meets a nice lady (Kristina Skarstedt) and a little girl, Stetson also meets a not so nice person (Vicky Bushnell), who chases him away.|$|R
5000|$|Witches {{reportedly}} {{were able}} to create them from [...] "human hair, nails, wood shavings, and the like", and they were said to suck milk from cows and steal cream from households. [...] Troll cats would then spit out the stolen milk into troughs next to the house. The Norwegian names trollnøste and trollnøa indicate their shapes: those troll cats looked like balls of yarn. Another type of troll <b>cat</b> had the <b>shape</b> of a regular cat; {{a difference between the}} two was that injury done to the cat-shaped troll cat would cause the same injury in the witch, whereas damaging the ball-shaped troll cat had no effect on her. [...] In addition, it was thought that shooting a troll cat would cause milk to spray from its wound. The troll cat is easily confused with the witch's hug, which could also assume the <b>shape</b> of a <b>cat.</b> The troll cat would have to be buried with the witch, or the witch would have to leave her grave to retrieve it.|$|R
40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in American Journal of Otology 1993. This version is reproduced with permission of Lippincott Wilkins & Williams. The development of cochlear implants for use in very young children (1 - 2 years old) will require techniques designed to accommodate temporal bone growth. Previous anatomic {{studies have shown that the}} leadwire of a cochlear implant must be capable of expanding up to 20 mm between the round window and the implanted receiver-stimulator in response to skull growth. In the present study morphologic and biomechanical evaluation of five expandable leadwire designs was conducted following their implantation in young <b>cats.</b> Two helical <b>shaped</b> leadwire designs frequently exhibited extensive fibrous tissue adhesions and broke during long-term implantation. In contrast, thin, flexible Silastic envelopes were effective in minimizing tissue adhesions. Residual V- and Z-shaped leadwires, placed in these envelopes, showed little evidence of fibrous tissue adhesions following implantation periods of up to 2 years. Moreover, these leadwires readily expanded both during the growth of the animal and when biomechanical expansion studies performed at the completion of the implant period. These expandable leadwire designs appear to be appropriate candidates for use in pediatric cochlear implants. Open Acces...|$|R

The station's studios were in such bad <b>shape,</b> <b>cats</b> {{were needed to}} control the rodents. Stan and Sis Kaplan of Boston bought WAYS in 1965 for $550,000. Beginning in June of that year, [...] "61 Big WAYS" [...] aired an {{energetic}} Top 40 format which was considered [...] "an alien sound in the Carolinas", knocking conservative WBT out of first place and eventually becoming the highest-rated Top 40 station {{in the country and}} the 15th most popular station overall. One reason was the Treasure Hunt, where people had to listen to clues from [...] "Mr. Treasure" [...] (Jack Gale) telling them how to find a $1,000 coupon. News director C. Michael Blackwell would interview winners. Personalities included John Kilgo, Jack Pride, Tom Kinard, Jack Armstrong, Pete Ray of [...] "The Pete Ray-D-O Show", Dick Blanchard, and Long John Silver. WAYS jocks who went on to greater fame included Morton Downey Jr., actor Jay Thomas, and Robert Murphy (who had success in Chicago). Eventually, the morning show was simulcast on both WAYS and sister FM WROQ. Larry Sprinkle, now a WCNC-TV morning weather personality, also worked at the stations.

40|$|Hopkins University. In {{front of}} them lay an anesthetized cat. In the cat’s skull, just above its visual cortex (an area {{in the back of}} the brain), there was a 3 mm-wide hole through which {{electrodes}} recorded the response of several neurons. Hubble and Wiesel had conjectured that these neurons would fire when shown the right stimulus on the retina. If only they had any idea what that stimulus could be. For days they had shown the poor <b>cat</b> different <b>shapes</b> and shiny spots of light, testing different areas of the retina, but nothing elicited a response. In their book, Brain and the Visual Perception, Hubble and Wiesel give a personal account of this experience: The break came one long day in which we held onto one cell for hour after hour. To find a region of retina from which our spots gave any hint of responses took many hours, but we finally found a place that gave vague hints of responses. We worked away, in shifts. Suddenly, just as we inserted one of our glass slides into the ophthalmoscope, the cell seemed to come to life and began to fire impulses like a machine gun. It took a while to discover that the firing had nothing to do with the small opaque spot—the cell was responding to the fine moving shadow cast by the edge of the glass slide as we inserted it into the slot. It took still more time and groping around to discover that the cell gave responses only when this faint line was swept slowly forward in a certain range of orientations [1]. That cell became the first discovered example of what is now known as “orientation selective cells, ” a type of cell which is actually prevalent in the visual cortex. These cells fire when they detect an edge oriented at a particular angle, in a specific area of the retina. Why orientations? Many researchers agreed that this type of pattern was reoccurring frequently in natural visual scenes, which might justify why the brain would have an explicit representation of such patterns, but for many years no one was able to show that oriented lines are more important than other representations like circles, blobs of light or stripes...|$|R
