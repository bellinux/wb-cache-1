40|$|The {{thesis is}} a review paper that gives an {{introduction}} to the new mobile platform Android as well as a comparative evaluation with regard to other mobile operating systems. The key topic of this thesis is the categorization of Android. Therefore it first gives a historical introduction to cell phones and mobile operating systems. Then it describes the main features of Android for a better understanding of this platform. In the following theoretical part Android will be compared to the mobile operating systems Symbian OS and Windows Mobile. Features and criteria defined in this part will be considered and included in the comparison of these systems. The practical part contains a comparison of the Software Development Kits (SDK) from Android and Symbian OS. In this context a simple application implementation on both systems is realized to support this comparison.

Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing {{members of the same}} society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people are aware). He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural [...] "table of elements," [...] and once <b>completed,</b> <b>this</b> <b>table</b> of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.
