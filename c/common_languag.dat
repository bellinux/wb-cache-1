40|$|This {{comparative}} study intends {{to understand the}} change and variation in the actual terminology of sugar cane in different Brazilian States (Paraíba, Pernambuco, Baía, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). This study, besides the terminological variation, allows us to observe some historic, geographic and social variation. We can find old and new terms, respectively in conservative and innovative regions, explained by historic and geographic factors. At the same time, there {{is the use of}} popular words and technical terms (social variation). But the main variation is the terminological one: synonymous and polysemic forms that show us a change in course, like it happens in <b>common</b> <b>languag...</b>|$|E
40|$|For decades, secure {{operating}} systems have incorporated {{mandatory access control}} (MAC) techniques. Surprisingly, mobile-code platforms such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the. NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) have largely ignored these advances and have implemented a far weaker security that does not reliably track ownership and access permissions for individual data items. We have implemented a system that adds MAC to an existing JVM at the granularity of objects. Our system maintains a strict separation between mechanism and policy, thereby allowing {{a wide range of}} policies to be enforced. In preliminary benchmarks, we find that the run-time overhead of tracking MAC tags for every object is around 30 %. Three important trends have been recently emerging in the field of trustworthy computing. At the application level, more and more code is now being targeted at high-level language runtimes and virtual machines that execute some form of safe, platform-independent bytecode. The most prevalent examples of this are the Java virtual machine[1], and the more recent. NET <b>common</b> <b>languag...</b>|$|E
