5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

25|$|Fluids {{probably}} percolated {{through a}} huge mass (hundreds of square kilometers) of sediments. The {{nature of the}} fluids caused them to absorb and concentrate trace amounts of zinc and lead contained in the rocks the fluids were passing through. These metals were then caused to precipitate, by <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> or physical agents, from the fluid onto or into the seafloor to form the Red Dog deposits.|$|E
25|$|According to {{professor}} Sayyid Dāmād, no explicit injunctions against use of <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> warfare {{were developed by}} medieval Islamic jurists as these threats were not existent then. However, Khalil al-Maliki's Book on jihad states that combatants are forbidden to employ weapons that cause unnecessary injury to the enemy, except under dire circumstances. The book, as an example, forbids the use of poisonous spears, since it inflicts unnecessary pain.|$|E

Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of gas phase ion chemistry (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, <b>chemical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> properties of a great variety of compounds.|$|E
25|$|White pepper {{consists}} solely of {{the seed}} of the pepper plant, with the darker-coloured skin of the pepper fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by {{a process known as}} retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week, during which the flesh of the pepper softens and decomposes. Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, <b>chemical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{pesticide}} is a <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, {{or otherwise}} discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species. According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides.|$|E

25|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 {{and much}} of the world responded by {{amassing}} military assets in the region, the United States Army faced the possibility of experiencing <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> (CB) attack. The possibility of CB attack forced the army to respond with NBC defense crash courses in theater. Troops deployed to the Gulf with protective masks at the ready, protective clothing was made available to those troops whose vicinity to the enemy or mission required it. Large scale drills were conducted in the desert to better acclimatize troops to wearing the bulky protective clothing (called MOPP gear) in hot weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{defense in}} Israel {{deals with a}} variety of {{military}} and terrorist threats to the civilian population, which have included concealed bombs such as suicide bombings and car bombs, projectiles such as missiles, rockets and mortars, and hijacking of aircraft, buses and buildings. Threats have originated in all countries and territories bordering Israel (the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt), as well as Iraq, and an Israeli civil airliner was attacked with missiles in Kenya. Perceived threats that have not materialized to date include sustained interruption of the economy, nuclear attack from Iran, and <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> attack from Iraq or elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} term in the Senate, Hagel {{voted in favor of}} the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, {{establishing}} criminal penalties for possession of <b>Chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>Biological</b> weapons, and he cosponsored the American Missile Protection Act, deploying an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the U.S. against limited ballistic missile attacks. Hagel voted to establish the United States Department of Homeland Security, and supported increasing Defense Department spending, voting in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act every year he served in the Senate. Hagel voted for spending increases in preventing HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria funding, and voting against caps on the U.S.'s Foreign aid budget.|$|E

25|$|Gulf War I {{was fought}} without the Iraqi Army unleashing <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> munitions; Eric R. Taylor, of the CATO Institute, {{maintained}} that the effective, U.S. threat of nuclear retaliation halted Hussein from employing his chemical weapons. The locations of many of Iraq's chemical stockpiles were never uncovered and there is widespread speculation that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical munitions while destroying weapons caches, particularly near the Khamisiyah storage site. After the war, analysis suggested the chemical defense capabilities of U.S. forces were woefully inadequate {{during and after the}} conflict. In addition, some experts, such as Jonathan B. Tucker, suggest that the Iraqis did indeed employ chemical weapons during the war.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{spectrum}} {{can be used}} to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10−2 to 1.33 * 10−6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, <b>chemical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadropole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} {{of social and}} religious transition ceremonies {{that can be found}} in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are Confirmation, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceañeras, sweet sixteens, cotillions, and débutante balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification. Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> physical changes.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of the scaffold material {{is perhaps the most}} important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, <b>chemical,</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It {{is important to note that}} the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.|$|E
25|$|Intelligence {{indicated}} that {{chemical and biological}} weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> weapons at the Objective Beaver.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates {{claimed that}} the Hezbollah has far more {{missiles}} and rockets than the majority of countries, and said that Syria and Iran are providing weapons to the organization. Israel also claims that Syria is providing the organization with these weapons. Syria has denied supplying these weapons and views these claims as an Israeli excuse for an attack. Leaked cables from American diplomats suggest that the United States has been trying unsuccessfully to prevent Syria from [...] "supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon", and that Hezbollah has [...] "amassed a huge stockpile (of arms) since its 2006 war with Israel"; the arms were described as [...] "increasingly sophisticated."
