40|$|Using bank-specific data on U.

S. banks engaging in foreign lending, and 2) econometrically explores the determinants of fluctuations in U. S. bank <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> a broad set of countries. U. S. bank <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> Latin American and Asian emerging markets, and on industrialized countries, are sensitive to U. S. macroeconomic conditions. When the United States grows rapidly, there is substitution between <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> industrialized countries and <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> the United States. The pattern of response of <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> emerging markets to U. S. conditions differs across banks of different sizes and across emerging market regions. Moreover, we find that, unlike U. S. bank <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> industrialized countries, <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> emerging markets are not highly sensitive to local country GDP and interest rates.

The ratio of the <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> the public sector to the <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> the non-public sector was 17.2% in September 2014, 15.6% one year before, and 13.4% two years before.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the dynamic effects of {{domestic}} credit measured by <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> non financial public enterprises and <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector {{on the real}} GDP in Jordan for the period 1970 - 2002. The stationarity properties and the order of integration of the data employed were empirically examined using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. The cointegration test proposed by Johansen was also employed to test {{for the existence of}} long-run relationship among the non stationary time series data. The result of the cointegration test suggests that there exists a cointegrating relationship between real GDP and <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector. The short-run and long-run relationships between real GDP and <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector were examined using the VEC technique. In the short run, real GDP turns out to have an impact which is statistically significant <b>on</b> the <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector, while in the long run, the <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector turn out to affect real GDP at the 1 % significance level. 1...|$|R
5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's {{joint pain}} (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of Cologne, damp and cold, made his condition worse, so he relinquished his <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year.

5|$|By Spring 1588, Gebhard {{had run out}} of options. In 1583, he {{had refused}} the {{settlement}} offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part of the Electorate in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories of the Electorate he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as Gelenkenschmerz, or joint pain) prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> the Electorate to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg. Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at Nijmegen that summer. Without them to defend his <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> the Electorate, Rheinberg, Gebhard's last outpost in the northern Electorate, fell to Parma's force in 1589.|$|E

But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after.

5|$|As {{the first}} groups of his partisans fleeing the capital arrived at Demotika, Kantakouzenos, {{by his own}} account, tried to {{negotiate}} with the new regency, but his approach was rebuffed. Finally forced to take decisive action, on 26 October 1341, the army (2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, according to Gregoras) and his supporters, largely drawn from the land-holding aristocracy, proclaimed Kantakouzenos Emperor. Although he still presented himself officially as a junior colleague to John V, and claimed to be only acting in the boy's name, having staked his <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> the throne, he had effectively started a civil war. Kantakouzenos still hoped that negotiation might resolve the situation, but all his envoys were imprisoned and he and his supporters excommunicated by Patriarch John XIV. On 19 November 1341, the regency responded to Kantakouzenos' proclamation as Emperor with the formal coronation of John V.|$|E
5|$|At one time, some dynasties adhered {{strictly}} {{to the concept}} of royal intermarriage. The Bernadottes, Habsburgs, Sicilian and Spanish Bourbons and Romanovs, among others, introduced house laws which governed dynastic marriages; it was considered important that dynasts marry social equals (i.e., other royalty), thereby ruling out even the highest-born non-royal nobles. Those dynasts who contracted undesirable marriages often did so morganatically. Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner). Usually, neither the bride nor any children of the marriage has a <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> the bridegroom's succession rights, titles, precedence, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against bigamy applies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> direction of the festival's future.|$|E
