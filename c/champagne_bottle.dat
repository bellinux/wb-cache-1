25|$|The {{ship was}} christened on 27 April 2000, by HRH Princess Anne. The <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> did not shatter {{when it hit}} the ship's side and fell unopened into the sea. This type of {{occurrence}} is considered a bad omen among seafarers, and this incident has been blamed for the numerous setbacks that Aurora has encountered throughout her career.|$|E
25|$|The era of jumbo jets {{began on}} January 15, 1970, when First Lady Pat Nixon christened a Pan Am Boeing 747 at Dulles in the {{presence}} of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby. Rather than a traditional <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle,</b> red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. Pan Am's first Boeing 747 flight was from New York JFK to London Heathrow Airport.|$|E

25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{spilling}} or spraying any Champagne, open the <b>Champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> by holding the cork and rotating the bottle at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out of the bottle at speed. Also, holding the bottle at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out of the bottle.|$|E
25|$|The crowd {{stayed in}} front of the police station hours longer than they {{originally}} planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. Rumours that a 16-year-old girl had sustained injuries after attacking police with a <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> began circulating on social media. To date, the girl remains unidentified and the report unconfirmed. However the rumour alone was sufficient to further fuel tensions in the area.|$|E

The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all {{night at the}} hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds {{to the spirit of}} the festivities.|$|E

25|$|At the hospital, Rappe's {{companion}} at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, told Rappe's {{doctor that}} Arbuckle had raped her friend. The doctor examined Rappe but {{found no evidence}} of rape. Rappe died one day after her hospitalization of peritonitis, caused by a ruptured bladder. Delmont then told police that Arbuckle raped Rappe, and the police concluded that the impact Arbuckle's overweight body had on Rappe eventually caused her bladder to rupture. Rappe's manager Al Semnacker (at a later press conference) accused Arbuckle of using a piece of ice to simulate sex with her, which led to the injuries. By the time the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into being a Coca-Cola or <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle,</b> instead of a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle rubbed the ice on Rappe's stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later made a statement incriminating Arbuckle to the police in an attempt to extort money from Arbuckle's attorneys.|$|E
500|$|London's Mall Galleries {{opened an}} {{exhibition}} in May 2008 {{that included a}} sculpture of Winehouse, titled Excess. The piece, created by Guy Portelli, had a miniature of the singer lying {{on top of a}} [...] <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle,</b> with a pool of spilled liquid underneath. The body was covered with what appeared to be tiny pills, while one outstretched hand held a glass. Another piece, a print titled Celebrity 1 by artist Charlotte Suckling, was shown in the same exhibition.|$|E
500|$|After {{the banquet}} and the toasts, {{he left for}} the naming ceremony. It had already been decided that the christening would be {{performed}} by Clarissa (1790–1868), wife of Philip John Miles (1773–1845) and mother of Bristol's MP, Philip William Skinner Miles (1816–1881), {{a director of the}} company. She stepped forward, grasped the <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> and swung it towards the bows. Unfortunately the steam packet Avon had started to tow the ship into the harbour and the bottle fell about [...] short of its target and dropped unbroken into the water. A second bottle was rapidly obtained and the Prince hurled it against the iron hull.|$|E

They appeared on The Cafe on 16 October 2008. The Prodigy personally invited the band to support them on their sold-out arena tour of the UK; all of the members are fans of Fight Like Apes and Liam Howlett entered their dressing room to give his regards. Sony Music Entertainment Japan signed the band for the Asian release of Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion. They headlined the Levi's One to Watch Tour in November 2008. In December 2008, a video of students of the Tisch School of the Arts in New York, featuring several females miming to [...] "Digifuckers", was released.|$|E
500|$|Northwestern {{named the}} ship after its {{president}} {{and chairman of}} the board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's own grandfather had himself been a lake captain, and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships. More than 15,000 people attended Fitzgeralds christening and launch ceremony on June 7, 1958. But the event was plagued by misfortunes: When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the ship by smashing a <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the ship created a large wave that [...] "doused" [...] the spectators and then crashed into a pier before righting herself. [...] One man watching the launching had a heart attack and later died. Other witnesses later said they swore the ship was [...] "trying to climb right out of the water". [...] On September 22, 1958, Fitzgerald completed nine days of sea trials.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, in a psychoanalytical {{review of}} The Crab with the Golden Claws, commented that this book {{witnessed}} Tintin's [...] "real {{entrance into the}} community of human beings" [...] as he gains an [...] "older brother" [...] in Haddock. He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed {{that there was a}} strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> frothing at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However, Apostolidès notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred with Apostolidès on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes. He also noted that in this Adventure, the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of [...] "Tintin the detective" [...] found throughout the series.|$|E

500|$|In {{his music}} hall acts, Leno created {{characters}} based on observations mostly {{about life in}} London, including , grocer's assistants, beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a fireman and a hairdresser. [...] For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers, including Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes, Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, George Le Brunn composed the music to many of Leno's songs and sketches, including [...] "The Detective", [...] "My Old Man", [...] "Chimney on Fire", [...] "The Fasting Man", [...] "The Jap", [...] "All Through a Little Piece of Bacon" [...] and [...] "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also wrote the music for three of Leno's best known sketches that depicted life in everyday occupations: [...] "The Railway Guard" [...] (1890), [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] and The Waiter" [...] (both from 1891). Leno made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, most as himself, and four as an actor. [...] He generally portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle. In An Obstinate Cork (1902), one of Leno's few surviving films, he struggles to pull a cork out of a <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> while on a picnic with his wife Lydia.|$|E
500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar, took a swig from a <b>champagne</b> <b>bottle</b> and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna paused for a moment to thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E
