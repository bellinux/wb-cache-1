5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the inside cylinders and the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The outside cranks were set at 120Â°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E
25|$|To this end, the H {{class had}} a {{significantly}} different arrangement for its third cylinder. A German Henschel & Son conjugated valve gear mechanism, driven from the combination levers of the Walschaert valve gear for the outside cylinders, was utilised in favour of the Gresley mechanism. The inside cylinder was also positioned further forward of the outside cylinders and drove the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>axle,</b> with the outside cylinders driving the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E

25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited adhesive weight (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|E

2500|$|In France, the duplex type {{was made}} famous by the ten 2-4-6-2 (151A) {{compound}} locomotives built in 1932 for the Paris-Lyons-Marseilles company (P.L.M.) to haul heavy freight trains on the 0.8% grade between Les Laumes and Dijon. The performance was so good, the company wanted to order more engines, but the nationalization of the railways in 1938 stopped all projects. These duplex engines were fitted with Lenz-Dabeg rotary cam valve motion and soon thereafter with double exhaust. The low-pressure cylinders drove the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle,</b> and the high pressure cylinders {{the second set of}} axles. Both groups of drivers where linked with inside connecting rods through inside cranks on the 2nd and 3rd drivers, making this locomotive a true 2-10-2, The driving wheels had a diameter of [...] The highest permissible speed was [...] In a test on December 19, 1933, the engine developed slightly more than [...] at the drawbar over a distance of [...] and a speed of at least , without being overworked. In ordinary service these engines could haul , sustaining [...] at the summit of the 0.8% Blaisy grade. After electrification of the line, the 151A were sent for service in northeastern France. They were withdrawn from service in 1956 and scrapped.|$|E

5000|$|Class T 5 of the Palatinate Railway was a German, goods train, tank {{locomotive}} {{class with}} five <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> and no carrying axles.|$|R
50|$|The C V had a four-cylinder de Glehn {{compound}} engine. Its low-pressure cylinders were external, {{operating on}} the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle,</b> and were located between the bogie and the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The high-pressure cylinders were internal and worked the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The engines still lacked a superheater. In terms of its power (160 tons at top speed), the C V could only {{be used for a}} few years in heavy express train services. As early as 1903 the locomotives were relegated to secondary duties, but even there they did not stay long.|$|E
50|$|The {{saturated}} steam drive {{was on the}} outside and had slide valves.

5000|$|The Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt II bogie is {{a further}} {{refinement}} of the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, whereby two coupled axles and the carrying axle are combined within the bogie. The carrying axle steers the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> via a long shaft and this also moves the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> via a Beugniot lever. This bogie is used on the DRG Class 84. Whether DR Class 99.23-24 locomotives were also fitted with this arrangement is not entirely clear.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> were sprung {{underneath}} with leaf springs. Weight balancing {{was achieved}} using an equalising beam between the springs. The front carrying wheels had leaf springs above the axles.|$|R

50|$|The DRB Class 50 is a German {{class of}} 2-10-0 locomotive, built from 1939 as a {{standard}} locomotive (Einheitsdampflokomotive) for hauling goods trains.

50|$|The {{braking system}} {{consisted}} of a hand-powered spindle brake operating on the tender axles, and a Hardy-type vacuum brake operating on {{the first and third}} <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> and both tender axles. For service on the inclined sections, a supplementary counter-pressure brake of Riggenbach type was fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} itself {{comprised}} a two-cylinder engine with simple steam expansion and Heusinger valve gear. The engine drove the second (middle) <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three 18 in {{diameter}} cylinders drove the centre <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.|$|E
50|$|Divided drive {{could also}} be used on simple {{expansion}} locomotives with coupled driving wheels.The NER Class X (LNER Class T1) 4-8-0T shunting engines designed by Wilson Worsdell for the North Eastern Railway had three cylinders with divided drive. Similarly Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway (Great Britain) designed the SR Lord Nelson class with divided drive between the front <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the inside cylinders and the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders 'to give better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow'.|$|E
50|$|Nineteen {{were built}} as the Pm class with plain {{bearings}} on the <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> and roller bearings on the carrying axles. The other sixteen were built as the Pmr class with roller bearings on all axles. One Pm was later {{converted to a}} Pmr at Midland Railway Workshops.|$|R
50|$|The <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> had {{overhung}} springing using leaf springs. An equalising beam, {{level with}} the axle boxes, linked the two springs. On the final batch of 1869 the springs were located underneath the axle boxes of the coupled wheels. On the carrying axle the springs were above the frame.|$|R
