500|$|Most of the city's {{major roads}} were damaged. The only route {{out of the}} city was east to the east bank of New Orleans on the Crescent City <b>Connection</b> <b>bridge.</b> The I-10 Twin Span Bridge {{traveling}} east towards Slidell, suffered severe damage; 473 spans were separated from their supports and 64 spans dropped into the lake. [...] The [...] long Lake Pontchartrain Causeway escaped unscathed but was only carrying emergency traffic. On August 29, at 7:40a.m. CDT, it was reported that most of the windows {{on the north side of}} the Hyatt Regency New Orleans had been blown out, and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage. The Hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city, with beds reported to be flying out of the windows. Insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides an}} exchangeable cup <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> system. The exchangeable cup <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> system comprises two cups, steel rings positioned at {{the bottoms of}} the cups respectively and a <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> part positioned between the two cups, wherein the <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> part comprises a dispatching component (1) for adjusting the bending degree of the steel rings, a distance-adjusting component (2) for adjusting {{the distance between the}} cups and fixing components (3) for stably fixing the dispatching component (1) and the distance-adjusting component (2) at the outer edges of the cups. According to the <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> system, sets of dispatching components (1) and distance-adjusting components (2) with different sizes can be used, and any one set of the dispatching component (1) and distance-adjusting component (2) can be matched with one fixing component (3). Moreover, the distance between the cups and the shapes of the cups can be adjusted according to self conditions and preference without influencing the comfort, the cups with different types, sizes or designs can also be matched for use, and the <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> parts with different sizes are repeatedly used, so that the bra utilization rate is improved. 一种可调换的罩杯桥接系统，包括两个罩杯、分别位于罩杯底部的钢圈以及位于两个罩杯之间的桥接部分，所述桥接部分包括用于调节钢圈弯曲程度的调度部件（ 1 ）、用于调节罩杯间距的调距部件（ 2 ）以及用于将调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ）稳固在罩杯外边缘的固定部件（ 3 ），本发明的桥接系统可以使用多套尺寸不同的调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ），其中任何一套的调度部件（ 1 ）和调距部件（ 2 ），与一个所述固定部件（ 3 ）搭配。实施本发明的桥接系统，在不影响舒适性前提下，可根据自身条件和喜好调整罩杯间距和罩杯的形状，也可将不同型号、尺寸或设计的罩杯搭配使用，通过重复使用不同尺寸的桥接部分提高胸罩的使用率。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 陆仕祺Inventor name used in this publication: 余咏文Inventor name used in this publication: 刘丽丽Inventor name used in this publication: 徐民英Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種可調換的罩杯橋接系統Chin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the heat-insulating {{capability}} of the refuge chamber’s shell and reduce energy consumption of the cooling system, the horizontal cylindrical mobile refuge chamber for coal mine was taken as the research object. By selecting two connection types between the inner shell and the outer shell for calculation, which were direct connection type and indirect connection type, and comparing these with the connectionless heat transfer, the heat transfer process in the refuge chamber subjected to thermal loadings of constant temperature was respectively discussed with numerical analysis method. Effect of heat bridges to heat transfer of the refuge chamber’s shell was analyzed. The analysis {{results showed that the}} average heat flux through direct <b>connection</b> heat <b>bridge</b> and indirect <b>connection</b> heat <b>bridge</b> had respectively increased by 668 % and 30 % than that of the connectionless heat transfer. The influencing scope of the former was larger than the latter’s. And more heat entered the refuge chamber through the direct <b>connection</b> heat <b>bridge.</b> Therefore, the indirect connection type should be used {{in the design of the}} refuge chamber’s shell...|$|R
50|$|While {{the areas}} of the Keihan and Kintetsu {{stations}} are limited by Tanbabashi Street to the north and Shimo-Itabashi Street to the south, before the integration of the stations in 1945, the gate of Horiuchi Station was on Shimo-Itabashi Street and the gate of Tambabashi Station was on Tanbabashi Street. Therefore, transferring passengers were recommended to change trains at Momoyamagoryō-mae Station and Fushimi-Momoyama Station, both of which were facing the same Ōtesuji Street, rather than transferring at Horiuchi and Tambabashi. When the integrated station was separated in 1960s, the stations were rebuilt with a <b>connection</b> <b>bridge</b> that provides easy access between Tambabashi and Kintetsu-Tambabashi stations.|$|E

50|$|A {{bridge is}} named after the region (Xizhimen Bridge). The bridge has a {{northern}} <b>connection</b> <b>bridge</b> built in the late 1970s. It will be removed and be replaced soon. The main Xizhimen Bridge, built also in the 1970s, once stood a rather frightening 5.5 m (it was then, and still is now, for the record, the tallest bridge on the 2nd Ring Road) and had three layers, with the top layer acting as a roundabout. Demolition of the old central bridge took place in 1999 by means of structural removal instead of a major bridge explosion. It was replaced {{with a series of}} new bridges which bear no resemblance to the old bridge.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of the Web has allowed individuals to communicate and {{interact with each other}} on a global scale: people connect both to close friends and acquaintances, creating ties that can bridge otherwise separated groups of people. Recent evidence suggests that spatial distance is still affecting social links established on online platforms, with online ties preferentially connecting closer people. In this work we study the relationships between interaction strength, spatial distance and structural position of ties between members of a large-scale online social networking platform, Tuenti. We discover that ties in highly connected social groups tend to span shorter distances than <b>connections</b> <b>bridging</b> together otherwise separated portions of the network. We also find that such <b>bridging</b> <b>connections</b> have lower social interaction levels than ties within the inner core of the network and ties connecting to its periphery. Our results suggest that spatial constraints on online social networks are intimately connected to structural network properties, with important consequences for information diffusion...|$|R
