The characters of Victor and Margaret returned in a short sketch for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day telethon on 16 March 2001.|$|E
5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America.

5|$|Football is Croatia's {{most popular}} team sport, and the {{national}} team has developed an extensive fan-base since its official formation in 1991. Following Croatia's successful 1998 World Cup campaign, {{three years after the}} Croatian war of independence, there was a rapid rise in domestic and global attention for the national side. English journalist Marcus Tanner of Balkan Insight <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> national team became a symbol of Croatian independence from Yugoslavia.

5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> significance of the attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that}} the initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E
5|$|James Gunn, a {{historian}} of science fiction, regarded the magazine {{as the best}} of the fantasy magazines launched in the early 1950s, and science fiction encyclopedist Donald H.

5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} {{in any other}} nation in the world.

Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E

The Moscow Times <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's premiere in Russia was likely a result of Putin's intervention.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some critics}} were {{extremely}} negative regarding the album.

5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
