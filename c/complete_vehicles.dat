25|$|Six {{additional}} cars (2660–2665) {{were ordered}} in August 1954. Delivered in 1956, they were mechanically {{identical to the}} earlier vehicles—although the engines were now designated as BUT, rather than AEC, products. However, the cars' bodywork was constructed at CIÉ's Inchicore Works to a distinctive design by the company's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid. (It may be noted that CIÉ had faced political pressure to build the bodywork of the original cars itself, rather than importing <b>complete</b> <b>vehicles.)</b> Although the cars' length and width were identical to those of their predecessors, they were distinguished by flat sides and a high, flat front end. Even-numbered cars had the standard composite (two-class) seating arrangement, whereas odd-numbered ones had a single-class layout. The Bulleid cars had a short career in their original form, soon being rebuilt as powered intermediates (see below).|$|E
