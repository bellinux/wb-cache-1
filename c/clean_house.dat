25|$|The ILA {{strove to}} <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> and rid itself {{of the few}} members who had in fact been proven corrupt or criminal. In August 1953, the ILA was {{suspended}} from the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a devastating blow. The AFL created the International Brotherhood of Longshoremen (IBL-AFL) to replace the besmirched ILA and scheduled representational elections.|$|E

25|$|The ILGWU began {{reducing}} {{its support for}} the CIO and, {{after a few years}} in which it attempted to be allies with both sides, reaffiliated with the AFL in 1940. Dubinsky regained his former positions as a vice president and member of the executive council of the AFL in 1945. He was the most visible supporter within the AFL of demands to <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> by ousting corrupt union leaders; the AFL-CIO ultimately adopted many of his demands when it established codes of conduct for its affiliates in 1957.|$|E

25|$|Evarts {{served as}} counsel for President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes before the Electoral Commission that {{resolved}} the disputed presidential election of 1876. During President Hayes' administration, {{he served as}} Secretary of State. Initially, Evarts did not act upon reports of corruption in the foreign service and supported actions against internal whistleblowers John Myers, Wiley Wells and later John Mosby. However, when President Grant continued to hear such complaints during his post-presidential around-the-world tour, and such were confirmed by internal troubleshooters DeB. Randolph Keim and former General turned consul to Japan Julius Stahel, Evarts began to <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> before the 1880 election. He ultimately secured the resignation of a favorite subordinate, Frederick W. Seward, for shielding rascals, and then several consuls in the Far East, including George Seward, David Bailey and David Sickels. In 1881, Evarts was a delegate to the International Monetary Conference at Paris.|$|E
25|$|The late 1960s brought {{big changes}} in the {{programming}} practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC {{began to realize that}} much of their existing programming had not only been running for years, but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, Steven netted a pair {{of goals}} against Tampa Bay’s rivals, the Florida Panthers, which made him reach the mark of 50 goals. Stamkos ended the season with 51 goals, tied for most in the NHL with Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins; the two shared the Rocket Richard Trophy as League goal-scoring champions. He tied Crosby {{in the final minute}} of the last game of the season with an empty-net goal. Stamkos became the third-youngest player to score 50 goals in a season, after Wayne Gretzky and Jimmy Carson. His number of goals, 51, was five more than his total points amount in the {{previous}} season. Additionally, Stamkos' 44 assists gave him 95 points for the season, good for fifth place in the NHL behind Henrik Sedin, Alexander Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby and Nicklas Bäckström. Tampa Bay, however, finished the year with 34 wins and 80 points. After the season, the team's poor record prompted Lightning Owner Jeffrey Vinik to <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> — General Manager Brian Lawton and Head Coach Rick Tocchet were both fired.|$|E

500|$|At {{the state}} Republican {{convention}} in Lexington on June 15, 1915, Morrow {{was chosen as}} the Republican candidate for governor over Latt F. McLaughlin. His Democratic opponent was his close friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Morrow charged previous Democratic administrations with corruption and called for the election of a Republican because [...] "You cannot <b>clean</b> <b>house</b> with a dirty broom." [...] Both men ran on progressive platforms, and the election went in Stanley's favor by only 471 votes. Although it was the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history, Morrow refused to challenge the results, which greatly increased his popularity. His decision was influenced by the fact that a challenge would be decided by the General Assembly, which had a Democratic majority in both houses.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod.

I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly <b>clean</b> <b>house,</b> I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots.

Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb of X-Play stated that, while Necrid {{did not seem to}} fit the aesthetic, the character did have some appeal. UGO's Doug Trueman stated Necrid's weapon had to be [...] "seen to be believed", and described him among other new characters as [...] " [...] something spectacular to the Soul Calibur pantheon". Tim Rogers of website Insert Credit called Necrid [...] "a work of digital art both in form and function" [...] and added that [...] "as far as console-only characters go—everybody wins with Necrid". Despite their negative remarks, an editor for IGN listed Necrid as eighth on their list of the top ten characters contributed to the Soulcalibur games by designers outside Namco and wrote that while they felt the character's gameplay was unbalanced, it added to Necrid's appeal; the editor wrote [...] "what do you expect from a man who shares a symbiotic relationship with the very energy that powers Soul Edge?
