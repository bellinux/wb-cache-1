25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a <b>crossmember</b> isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount <b>crossmember</b> at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
25|$|The Pacer became {{only the}} second American car after the Ford Pinto in {{production}} cars in the U.S. to feature rack-and-pinion steering. The system was mounted low {{at the front of}} the <b>crossmember.</b> The body was designed with the aim that structural lines protected it from hit damage, and AMC engineers claimed that they succeeded in more than 50% of the car surface.|$|E
500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Interstate Commerce Commission discovered a design flaw on a style of passenger car used by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in which the handle of an angle cock, a valve used to close the brake pipe when the car is the last one in the train, {{came into contact with}} a bottom <b>crossmember</b> of the coupler pocket. The angle cock would become closed, rendering the brakes on all the trailing cars inoperable. The third car behind 4876, New Haven 8665, was of this design, but the fourth car had a slightly different style of coupler. The difference between the two cars increased the frequency and the intensity of which the angle cock at the rear of 8655 would hit the <b>crossmember.</b> Earlier in the morning, the train was stopped outside of Kingston, Rhode Island, because the brakes on the final two cars were [...] "sticking" [...] and could not be released from the locomotive. Upon inspection, the angle cock on 8655 was found to be closed and was reopened by the engineer, but, after a locomotive and shift change, the matter was forgotten.|$|E

2500|$|The Corvette Grand Sports were raced {{with several}} {{different}} engines, {{but the most}} serious factory engine actually used was a 377 cubic inch displacement, all-aluminum, small block with four Weber side-draft carburetors and a cross-ram intake, rated [...] at 6400rpm. Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure 'birdcage' was aluminum rather than steel. The ladder-type frame utilized large seamless steel tubular side members connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes. Another <b>crossmember</b> was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick-up anchored the integral roll cage. The frame was slightly stiffer than the 1963 Corvette production frame and was 94 pounds lighter. A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about 800 pounds less than the production coupe. Initially the Grand Sport project was known simply as [...] "The Lightweight".|$|E
2500|$|Toyota took {{measures}} {{to reduce the}} weight of this new model. Aluminium {{was used for the}} hood, targa top (when fitted), front <b>crossmember,</b> oil and transmission pans, and the suspension upper A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbo, the car was at least [...] lighter than its predecessor.

2500|$|In 1980, both {{front and}} rear bumper covers were restyled with brand new {{integrated}} aerodynamic spoilers {{that resulted in a}} significant reduction in drag and increased radiator air flow. The hood was also restyled as well. The crossed-flag emblems disappeared from the front fenders and were revised to a more elongated style on the nose and fuel door. L-82 emblems moved from the hood to the front fenders on cars ordered with the optional high performance engine. This was the finale for the L-82 corvette emblem, now producing [...] but it could not be mated to a 4-speed, as the manual gearbox was offered only with the small block engine. The speedometer in all cars read to a maximum of , mandated by a new and controversial federal law. Air conditioning became standard, as did the tilt-telescopic steering column, power windows, exterior sport mirrors, and the convenience group. New was an optional roof panel carrier that would mount to the rear fastback deck. Many weight-saving components were introduced including thinner body panels and an aluminum Dana 44 IRS (Independent Rear Suspension) differential and <b>crossmember.</b> The new lighter unit replaced the arguably stronger cast iron GM 10 bolt IRS differential. In line with further weight savings, the aluminum intake manifold associated with L-82 engines since 1978 was now installed in all cars. For the first time, due to California emission considerations, a unique engine application was installed in cars delivered to that state and was mandatory. This motor was a [...] V8 engine rated at , fitted with new tubular stainless steel exhaust manifolds, and mated to an automatic transmission, also mandatory.

50|$|The 1.5-litre G-Type raced in the 1952 World Championship, {{the first}} season to be run under Formula Two rules. The {{fundamental}} design was laid down by Robert Eberan-Eberhorst, one of the world's leading theorists of racing car design, who had replaced Ferdinand Porsche at Auto Union and designed the Auto Union Type D Grand Prix car. His protégé and successor David Hodkin completed the G-Type design. The frame was constructed of two longitudinal magnesium tubes with four <b>crossmembers.</b> Suspension was by double wishbone with coil springs at the front and de Dion tube at the rear.

50|$|BMW {{needed to}} expand its model range, {{but they did not}} have the {{resources}} to develop an all-new car with an all-new engine. Therefore, it used the Isetta as starting point for a new four seat economy car.As a result, the 600 used the front suspension and front door of the Isetta. The need to carry four people required a longer frame, a different rear suspension, and a larger engine. A new perimeter frame was designed, using box section side members and straight tube <b>crossmembers.</b> The rear suspension was an independent semi trailing arm design; {{this was the first time}} BMW had used this system. The chassis had a wheelbase of 1700 mm, a front track of 1220 mm, and a rear track of 1160 mm.|$|R

The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied {{to the top of the}} frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.|$|R

After seeing the prototype, BMW's management commissioned Pininfarina to build an alternative. The Pininfarina prototype was thought to be too similar to his design for the Alfa Romeo 1900 saloon, so BMW stayed with Schimanowski's design. The steel body was far heavier than Schimanowski had calculated it to be, resulting in the completed car having a dry weight of 1430 kg. [...] Performance suffered as a result, with a top speed of 135 km/h and acceleration to 100 km/h taking 27 seconds, both of which compared unfavourably with the six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz 220.|$|R
