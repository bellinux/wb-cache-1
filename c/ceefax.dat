25|$|Station KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah premiered a {{teletext}} service using <b>Ceefax.</b> They {{were followed by}} television network CBS, which carried out preliminary tests on both the British Teletext and the rival French Antiope system.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{teletext}} services have been syndicated to web viewers, which mimic {{the look and}} feel of broadcast teletext. RSS feeds of news and information from the BBC are presented in <b>Ceefax</b> format in the web viewer at PagesFromCeefax.net.|$|E
25|$|The BBC {{announced}} in May 2008 {{that it had}} achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties. These {{are available on the}} BBC Red Button, and until 23 October 2012, via the <b>Ceefax</b> teletext service.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ceefax</b> and Teletext {{can have}} {{a larger number of}} {{captions}} for other languages due to the use of multiple VBI lines. However, only European countries used a second subtitle page for second language audio tracks where either the NICAM dual mono or Zweikanalton were used.|$|E
25|$|The Acorn BBC Micro's default {{graphics}} mode (mode 7) {{was based on}} Teletext display, and the computer {{could be used to}} create and serve Teletext-style pages over a modem connection. With a suitable adapter, the computer could receive and display teletext pages, as well as software over the BBC's <b>Ceefax</b> service, for a time. The Philips P2000 homecomputer's video logic was also based on a chip designed to provide teletext services in TVs.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1974, a {{teletext}} system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing {{such a system}} to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The <b>Ceefax</b> service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>Ceefax</b> and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the {{teletext}} signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary analogue TV signal but concealed from view in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) television lines which do not carry picture information. The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).|$|E
25|$|United Kingdom: {{the founder}} of the world's first {{teletext}} service, the BBC which closed its <b>Ceefax</b> service in 2012 when Britain adopted a fully digital television broadcast system. Elsewhere in the country the full service is no longer carried on any digital television services, although many channels on Sky still broadcast teletext subtitles and may still have a small number of active pages. Teletext ended in each region after analogue broadcasts finished. See Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|BBC News is {{responsible}} for the news programmes and some documentary content on the BBC's general television channels, as well as the news coverage on the BBC News Channel in the UK and 22 hours of programming for the corporation's BBC World News channel internationally. Coverage for BBC Parliament is carried out on behalf on the BBC at Millbank Studios though BBC News provides editorial and journalistic content. BBC News content is also output onto the BBC's digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the <b>Ceefax</b> teletext system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{teletext}} test transmissions {{were made}} by <b>Ceefax</b> in 1973. After proliferation of the BBC system in the UK, it was adopted in Europe and standardised as World System Teletext (WST). The World Wide Web began to take {{over some of the}} functions of teletext from the late 1990s and many broadcasters have ceased broadcast of teletext—CNN in 2006 and the BBC in 2012. In the UK the decline of teletext has been hastened by the introduction of digital television, though an aspect of teletext continues in closed captioning. In other countries the system is still widely used on standard-definition DVB broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} standard {{provides a}} mono spaced 40×24 character grid. Characters are sent using a 7-bit codec, with an 8th bit employed for error detection. The standard was improved in 1976 {{to allow for}} improved appearance {{and the ability to}} individually select the color of each character from a palette of 8. The proposed higher resolution Level 2 (1981) was not adopted in Britain (in-vision services from <b>Ceefax</b> & ORACLE did use it at various times however, though even this was ceased by the BBC in 1996), although transmission rates were doubled from two to four lines a frame.|$|E
25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (<b>Ceefax).</b> It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The teletext characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and TV sets without a Teletext receiver. Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E
25|$|Following test {{transmissions}} in 1973–74, {{towards the}} end of 1974 the BBC news department put together an editorial team of nine, including and led by Editor Colin McIntyre, to develop a news and information service. Initially limited to 30 pages, the <b>Ceefax</b> service was later expanded to 100 pages and was launched formally in 1976. It was followed quickly by ORACLE and Prestel. Wireless World magazine ran a series of articles between November 1975 and June 1976 describing the design and construction of a teletext decoder using mainly TTL devices; however, development was limited until the first TV sets with built-in decoders started appearing in 1977.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on <b>Ceefax</b> (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely to need a new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E
25|$|The World at One, a lunchtime news programme, {{began on}} 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, {{and the year}} before News Review had started on television. News Review was {{a summary of the}} week's news, first {{broadcast}} on Sunday, 26 April 1964 on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor to be superseded by <b>Ceefax</b> subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981).|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the <b>Ceefax</b> teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972 the BBC {{demonstrated}} their system, {{now known as}} <b>Ceefax</b> ("see facts", the departmental stationery used the [...] "Cx" [...] logo), on various news shows. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) announced their own service in 1973, known as ORACLE (Optional Reception of Announcements by Coded Line Electronics). Not to be outdone, the GPO immediately announced a 1200/75 baud videotext service under the name Prestel.|$|E
2500|$|By 1982 {{there were}} two million such sets, and by the mid-1980s they were {{available}} as an option for almost every European TV set, typically {{by means of a}} plug in circuit board. It took another decade before the decoders became a standard feature on almost all sets with a screen size above 15inches (teletext is still usually only an option for smaller [...] "portable" [...] sets). From the mid-1980s both <b>Ceefax</b> and ORACLE were broadcasting several hundred pages on every channel, slowly changing them throughout the day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systems were}} {{originally}} incompatible; <b>Ceefax</b> displayed pages of 24 lines with 32 characters each, while ORACLE offered pages of 22 lines with 40 characters each. In other ways the standards overlapped; for instance, both used 7-bit ASCII characters and other basic details. In 1974 all the services agreed {{a standard for}} displaying the information. The display would be a simple [...] grid of text, with some graphics characters for constructing simple graphics. The standard did not define the delivery system, so both Viewdata-like and Teledata-like services could at least share the TV-side hardware (which {{at that point in}} time was quite expensive).|$|E
2500|$|DVD extras {{include a}} quiz, mock pages from <b>Ceefax,</b> an {{alternative}} [...] "Birds of Britain" [...] feature, the Scary Picture, {{which features a}} comically large succession of screens making sure the viewer actually wants to view it, then suddenly showing {{it at the same}} time as hearing a male scream, which is shown without the scream in 2 episodes of Series 2, and the Test Card (a music video). Watching this to the end, including the credits, triggers an Easter egg featuring Jack Morgan's more realistic reaction to his plastic surgery, in which the Look Around You team are shocked at the modifications to Jack's face when Dr. Fu reveals him to them. When handed a mirror, Jack turns to Dr. Fu and starts shouting expletives at him, but then calms down after stating that it was the initial reaction to the surgery.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's <b>Ceefax</b> teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
50|$|Pages from <b>Ceefax</b> was a {{selection}} of content from the <b>Ceefax</b> service and normally only shown {{in the absence of}} any other programming. It consisted of selected <b>Ceefax</b> pages (typically news) transmitted as an ordinary TV picture. As a result, although Pages from <b>Ceefax</b> could be viewed on any receiver, the interactive nature of the service was lost. Audio accompaniment typically consisted of stock music or sometimes a discontinuous tone.|$|E
50|$|The {{first test}} {{transmissions}} {{were made by}} the BBC in 1972-74, with the name <b>Ceefax</b> ("see facts").The <b>Ceefax</b> system went live on 23 September 1974 with thirty pages of information.Due to the adoption of a common teletext standard (WST), the <b>Ceefax</b> system ceased in 1976.The name was retained for the service itself, that continued after that year using the WST standard.|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} that <b>Ceefax</b> would not be replaced when the analogue signal was switched off in October 2012. The BBC Red Button service {{is seen as an}} alternative to <b>Ceefax</b> and since 2007 the number of regions with a <b>Ceefax</b> supported analogue signal had declined as digital switchover progressed across the UK. As of the end of 2011, three quarters of the UK TV regions had completed or {{were in the process of}} being switched over.|$|E

The music chosen for the final minutes was [...] "BART" [...] by Ruby, which had been frequently used for [...] "Pages from Ceefax" [...] and for other continuity. Since then, overnight downtime has been filled with a rolling loop of previews of forthcoming BBC Two programmes (and for a brief period in September 2016, BBC Parliament highlights [...] ). The limited set of rolling pages shown on Pages from <b>Ceefax</b> (referred to as a [...] "newsreel") had been accessible at any time of day via <b>Ceefax</b> page 152 (BBC Two only) on any traditional Teletext television.|$|E
50|$|Electra was America's {{answer to}} the British <b>Ceefax</b> or ORACLE systems, {{providing}} news headlines, weather, entertainment/lifestyle info, and other information.

50|$|The {{analogue}} switch-off in the UK saw {{the closure of}} <b>Ceefax</b> in October 2012. Its replacement, BBC Red Button, is available on most digital services including Freeview, Virgin Media, Sky and Freesat. BBC Red Button is accessed by pressing the red button or the text button on any BBC channel. As well as being able to display plain text, BBC Red Button offers richer graphics than <b>Ceefax</b> {{and a number of}} interactive video streams. Pages can be navigated to by scrolling with the remote or entering the correct page number; most of the page numbers previously used on <b>Ceefax</b> are the same on BBC Red Button, such as sports being on page number 301 with football on 302 and football results on 316. The new BBC Red Button Service is used as much as <b>Ceefax</b> and is especially popular among football fans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceefax,</b> {{the first}} {{teletext}} service, launched on 23 September 1974.
