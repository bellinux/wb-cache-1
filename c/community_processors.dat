Stakeholders in fisheries policy include fishermen {{and their families and}} <b>communities,</b> <b>processors,</b> scientists, environmentalists, fish product consumers, other (non-fishing) marine, coastal and land users, government fisheries departments, and taxpayers. These play different roles, with different weights, in policy discussions, as shown in the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) of the European Union in the North Sea, where a Regional Advisory Committee has been recently set up. Conclusions suggest that successful governance of capture fisheries requires state intervention via a multi-level hierarchy, and probably stronger monitoring or control of technology and fishing behaviour...|$|R

Ecotrust, and its finance subsidiary the North Pacific Fisheries Trust, have been monitoring and evaluating several {{issues related to the}} patterns emerging from the quota fisheries that are in place in Alaska and British Columbia. History in these fisheries shows that groundfish are an important economic development asset that provides the broadest set of benefits when access is tied to the traditional pattern of fishing communities on our coast. The IQ program needs the flexibility to meet the multiple goals it has defined either explicitly or implicitly such as bycatch avoidance, rebuilding of stocks, community stability, and economic “effectiveness ” (not necessarily always efficiency) via different incentives. In changing resource, policy, and business environments, stability and flexibility can foster innovation and adaptation in new markets, fishery methods, and adaptive organizations such as Community Fisheries Associations...|$|R

Key Words: Checkpointing, distributed systems, fault-tolerance, performance. 1 Introduction The possibility of tackling very large, computationally intensive problems by coupling large <b>communities</b> of distributed <b>processors</b> through a high-speed network is fast becoming a reality [7]. The computing sites may consist of computational resources from several vendors, and communication between sites may require message transmission over long distances (thousands of miles) through several intermediate hops. Clearly, computing in this environment is much more precarious and we can expect higher resource failure rates than in a standard multiprocessor. Thus, a fundamental [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEstimating the Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) of {{real-time}} {{embedded software}} {{is an important}} problem. WCET {{is defined as the}} upper bound b on the execution time of a program P on a processor X such that for any input the execution time of P on X is guaranteed to not exceed b.

40|$|Design of {{flexible}} multimedia accelerators that can cater to multiple algorithms is being aggressively pursued {{in the media}} <b>processors</b> <b>community.</b> Such an approach is justified {{in the era of}} sub- 45 &#x 2009;nm technology where an increasingly dominating leakage power component is forcing designers to make the best possible use of on-chip resources. In this paper we present an analysis of two commonly used window-based operations (sum of absolute differences and mean squared error) across a variety of search patterns and block sizes (2 &#x 00 D 7; 3, 5 &#x 00 D 7; 5, etc.). We propose a context adaptable architecture that has (i) configurable 2 D systolic array and (ii) 2 D Configurable Register Array (CRA). CRA can cater to variable pixel access patterns while reusing fetched pixels across search windows. Benefits of proposed architecture when compared to 15 other published architectures are adaptability, high throughput, and low latency at a cost of increased footprint, when ported on a Xilinx FPGA...|$|R

40|$|To improve rice {{parboiling}} in Benin, {{an improved}} parboiling process with new equipment is being released. Farmer-to-farmer video (initiated by Africa Rice Center) {{was used by}} four local NGOs in the Department of Collines to disseminate the technology. In order to explore changes {{that have been made}} in this rural area following the use of this learning approach, 160 women and 17 women’s associations were surveyed in 16 villages where the video was shown. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus groups, semi-structured interviews, participant observations, questionnaires and photographs. The video had not only improved women’s creative spirit, but also their motivation and awareness about the importance of parboiling as a revenue-generating activity. Women have become organized around rice parboiling leading to the creation of associations, more appeals to NGOs for additional training in rice parboiling, improved service delivery and improved packaging and marketing of parboiled rice. Improving women’s entrepreneurial spirit contributed to improving the quality of parboiled rice and therefore to an increase in its price, which increased women’s revenues and strengthened social cohesion. The video favored not only the improvement of extension methods used by facilitators, but also the strengthening of relationships among facilitators, rural <b>communities,</b> women <b>processors,</b> microfinance institutions, and input and output markets. Women had more access to formal credit because of their improved organization. Rice producers who attended the open-air video shows {{at the same time as}} the women rice processors became more willing to sell rice on credit to the women. The results of this study have allowed us to understand how video can favor the development of institutional innovations and reinforce relationships between facilitators and rural entrepreneurs...|$|R
40|$|The use of sensor based {{applications}} is in {{expansion in}} many contexts. Sensors are involved at several scales {{ranging from the}} individual (e. g. personal monitoring, smart homes) to regional and even world wide contexts (i. e. logistics, natural resource monitoring and forecast). Easy and efficient management of data streams produced by {{a large number of}} heterogeneous sensors is a key issue to support such applications. Numerous solutions for query processing on data streams have been proposed by the scientific <b>community.</b> Several query <b>processors</b> have been implemented and offer heterogeneous querying capabilities and semantics. Our work is a contribution on the formalization of queries on data streams in general, and on sensor data in particular. This paper proposes the Astral algebra; defining operators on temporal relations and streams which allow the expression of a large variety of queries. This proposal extends several aspects of existing results: it presents precise formal definitions of operators which are (or may be) semantically ambiguous and it demonstrates several properties of such operators. Such properties are an important result for query optimization as they are helpful in query rewriting and operator sharing. This formalization deepens the understanding of the queries and facilitates the comparison of the semantics implemented by existing systems. This is an essential step in building mediation solutions involving heterogeneous data stream processing systems. Cross system data exchange and application coupling would be facilitated. This paper discusses existing proposals, presents the Astral algebra, several properties of the operators...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The West Coast {{groundfish}} individual {{fishing quota}} program divided fishing rights among commercial trawl fishermen into transferable quota shares in 2011. Instead of allocating {{the full 100}} % of shares to fishermen, the Pacific Fishery Management Council made a bold decision to hold 10 % of the quota shares for each of 28 species aside in an adaptive management program. These shares were an insurance policy for the substantial changes occurring under the new management regime; by holding something aside, the Council could later direct these shares toward {{one or more of}} the five adaptive management program objectives: stabilizing fishing <b>communities,</b> stabilizing fish <b>processors,</b> facilitating new entrants, addressing conservation concerns, or responding to other unintended outcomes of the individual fishing quota program. But after almost five years, the Council has not yet developed the adaptive management program and the shares have not been assigned to meet their intended objectives. Instead current quota share owners receive adaptive management program quota pounds in addition to what they already own. Here, I suggest six policy options for the adaptive management program to meet the Council’s stated objectives, and consider each option in terms of effectiveness, politically viability and implementation feasibility. While no policy can clearly be seen as superior to others using the dimensions analyzed, the strengths and weaknesses of the various options become more transparent. This assessment can contribute to continued discussion in the Council process...|$|R

The technical realization of all three modules is guided by the maximum usage of field programmable logic. The actual demand of computing-and I/O-power can be satisified by the number of modules plugged into the crate. Enhanced features of Enable++ comprise the configurable processor topology provided by programmable crossbar switches. In combination with the 4 x 4 FPGA array and 12 MByte distributed RAM the Enable++ computing core offers a strongly increased and scalable computing power. For building new applications the system offers a comfortable programming and debugging environment consisting of a compiler for the C-like hardware description language spC, a simulator and a source level debugger for hardware design. The goal in planning the hardware design environment for Enable++ from scratch is to transfer established methodologies in software design to the design of digital logic. Concerning pattern recognition tasks, we estimate that Enable++ surpasses modern RISC processors by a factor of 100 to 1000...|$|R
