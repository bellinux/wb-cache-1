5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance. The courts threatened with closure in Wales were Aberdare, Llangefni, Pontypool and Rhyl. In addition, it was proposed that Newport <b>County</b> <b>Court</b> would no longer hold hearings at Chepstow every fortnight (as had been done since the <b>county</b> <b>court</b> there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni <b>County</b> <b>Court</b> open, but the other closures were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{although}} new {{courts have}} been opened in various locations, {{there has been}} a {{reduction in the number of}} locations where a <b>county</b> <b>court</b> is held. In all, 80 towns and cities in Wales have held county courts since 1847; 60 have closed and, as of 2012, 20 county courts in Wales are still open. The most recent opening of a <b>county</b> <b>court</b> took place in Caerphilly in 1965, although this closed in 2000. The first <b>county</b> <b>court</b> to close was Fishguard, in 1856. The latest county courts to close in Wales were Aberdare and Pontypool in 2011. Newbridge was the location of a <b>county</b> <b>court</b> for the shortest period– for only five months in 1856. Blaenavon is the only town in Wales to have a <b>county</b> <b>court</b> close and then reopen, both events taking place in 1938.|$|E

25|$|Section 3 of the Courts and Legal Services Act amends the <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> Act 1984 {{to allow}} the <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> to award any remedy used by the High Court. There were several {{exceptions}} because {{the status of the}} <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> made it illogical {{to allow the}}m to write orders of mandamus or certiorari. The new section also allows the Lord Chancellor to prohibit the <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> from making certain other types of order, with these types to be introduced by Statutory Instrument. Again, these are orders which it would be illogical to allow the <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> to write, such as Anton Piller orders or Mareva injunctions.|$|R

500|$|Sixty <b>county</b> <b>courts</b> in Wales {{have closed}} since the modern system of <b>county</b> <b>courts</b> in England and Wales was {{established}} by the <b>County</b> <b>Courts</b> Act 1846. The Act created 491 courts on 60 circuits; of these, 53 courts were in Wales and Monmouthshire, a Welsh county that had ambiguous status {{at the time and}} was sometimes treated as being in England. Since then, new courts have been opened in various locations, and 80 towns and cities in Wales have, or have had, <b>county</b> <b>courts.</b> As of 2012, there are 20 <b>county</b> <b>courts</b> in Wales. Reasons for closure have included a decision that it was [...] "inexpedient" [...] to continue to provide a court, the volume of business no longer justifying a court, or the state of the building housing the court. The first closure was Fishguard in 1856. The most recent closures are the <b>county</b> <b>courts</b> in Aberdare and Pontypool, which closed on 1 August 2011.|$|R

5|$|When Missouri {{became a}} state in 1821, St. Louis County was created from the {{boundaries}} of the former St. Louis subdistrict of the Missouri Territory; St. Louis city existed within the county but was not coterminous with it. Starting in the 1850s, rural county voters began to exert political influence over questions of taxation in the St. Louis <b>County</b> <b>court.</b> In 1867, the <b>county</b> <b>court</b> was given power to assess and collect property tax revenue from St. Louis city property, providing a financial boon to the county government while depriving city government of revenues. After this power transfer, St. Louisans in the city began to favor one of three options: greater representation on the <b>county</b> <b>court</b> via charter changes, citycounty consolidation, or urban secession to form an independent city.|$|E

5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of <b>county</b> <b>court</b> {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb <b>County</b> <b>court</b> intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
