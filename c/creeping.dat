5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a <b>creeping</b> effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by <b>creeping</b> along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} <b>creeping</b> behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E

5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a <b>creeping</b> barrage was planned. This {{required}} gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used <b>creeping</b> barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the <b>creeping</b> barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that all <b>creep</b> data in metals {{ascribed}} to the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional <b>creep</b> mechanism cannot in fact be definitively described by the N-H <b>creep</b> theory. Rather, the <b>creep</b> mechanism is associated with either Harper-Dorn (H-D) dislocation <b>creep</b> or grain boundary sliding (GBS).

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that the <b>creep</b> characteristics at high temperatures are mainly evaluated by a minimum <b>creep</b> rate. Although, {{the shape of a}} <b>creep</b> curve may vary depending on deformation conditions, the apparent steady state or minimum <b>creep</b> rates can be the same. Thus, for detailed analysis and prediction of <b>creep</b> behavior, other values, which reflect the shape of each <b>creep</b> curve, should be considered. For this purpose, the authors have proposed Sato’s strain-acceleration-parameter (Strain Acceleration and Transition Objective index, SATO-index) which reflects strain rate change during <b>creep</b> deformation. Based on the concept of the SATO-index, the entire <b>creep</b> curve can be represented by a small number of numerical parameters, and can be extrapolated from a part of the <b>creep</b> curve. In this paper, application of the SATO-index to <b>creep</b> curves of aluminum-magnesium solid solutions which show both the Alloy-type and Metal-type <b>creep</b> behavior is discussed. The <b>creep</b> curve can be extrapolated by the concept from the transient part of the <b>creep</b> curve, and the stress dependence of the extrapolated <b>creep</b> rates at the minimum <b>creep</b> rate agrees well with experiments. Efficiency of the concept of the SATO-index to <b>creep</b> experiments is presented...|$|R

TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} <b>creep</b> feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and <b>creep</b> feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), <b>creep</b> feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), <b>creep</b> feeder design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the <b>creep</b> feed (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and <b>creep</b> diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, <b>creep</b> feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. <b>Creep</b> feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, <b>creep</b> feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. <b>Creep</b> feed consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of <b>creep</b> feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed <b>creep</b> feed (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume <b>creep</b> feed) and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the <b>creep</b> diet, and the duration of <b>creep</b> feeding. The proportion of eaters of <b>creep</b> feed in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of <b>creep</b> feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary <b>creep</b> feeder with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest <b>creep</b> feed disappearance. <b>Creep</b> diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the <b>creep</b> feed did not affect <b>creep</b> feed consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> feed. Therefore, <b>creep</b> feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|R

2500|$|Coble <b>creep</b> is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled <b>creep.</b> In Coble <b>creep</b> the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble <b>creep</b> to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring <b>creep,</b> thus, Coble <b>creep</b> will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble <b>creep</b> k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the grain boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble <b>creep</b> occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> Coble <b>creep</b> is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring <b>creep.</b> Generally, the diffusional <b>creep</b> rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring <b>creep</b> rate and Coble <b>creep</b> rate. Diffusional <b>creep</b> leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional <b>creep</b> rate and the grain boundary sliding rate must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of <b>creep</b> fracture.|$|R
