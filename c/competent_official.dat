2500|$|The {{following}} week, Owens {{received a}} rematch, where Styles retained after the referee {{did not see}} Owens' shoulder up due to being accidentally struck by Owens earlier in the match. After the match, Owens demanded a rematch with a <b>competent</b> <b>official.</b> SmackDown Live GM Daniel Bryan then made a match between Owens and Styles for the United States Championship at SummerSlam with Commissioner Shane McMahon as the special guest referee which he lost. During that time, Owens dropped the Face of America gimmick and reverted to the Prizefighter persona, shedding both the suits, America-orientated promo's and his pursuit of the United States Championship. Two nights later on SmackDown Live, Owens demanded another rematch which McMahon allowed, with Baron Corbin as the special guest referee, but was once again unsuccessful after Corbin walked out on the match and Shane took over, distracting Owens enough for Styles to capitalize and win. This also meant {{that as long as}} Styles held the title, Owens could not challenge Styles for the title again, ending his feud with Styles. On the September 5 episode of SmackDown Live, Owens demanded another shot at the United States Championship; when Shane refused, Owens insulted Shane's kids ,which caused Shane to attack Owens afterwards. Shane was suspended and Bryan announced that Vince McMahon would be on Smackdown the following week. As a result of provoking Shane, Vince announced Owens would face Shane in a Hell in a Cell match at the Hell in a Cell (2017) pay-per-view, after which Owens attacked McMahon. Owens renewed tension with long time rival Sami Zayn on the September 26th episode and proceeded to defeat him by referee stoppage in the main event, attacking him after the match until he fled from Shane. At the Hell in a Cell event, Shane attempted a Leap of Faith off the cell through an announce table on Owens but his ex-rival Zayn appeared and pulled him away before Shane landed, causing Shane to fall through the table, and placed Owens atop Shane, giving Owens the win. Zayn then referred to Owens as his [...] "brother" [...] on SmackDown Live, after revealing why he helped Owens rather than allow Shane to win.Owens was defeated by Shinsuke Nakamura on the October 31 edition of “SmackDown”, thus failing to earn a spot in the Team SmackDown, facing up against Team Raw at Survivor Series after Randy Orton attacked Zayn who was there to assist Owens.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{organizational}} theories {{suggest that}} there is a tradeoff between loyalty and competence. This paper tests several such theories in the context of public agencies. Prime ministers, chancellors, and kings alike need to secure the (efficient or inefficient) loyalty of their agencies, such as support in important policy proposals or low corruption. They are also interested in agencies’ levels of competence. I find that governments have highly <b>competent</b> <b>officials</b> in their agencies (1) where officials have few private sector contacts, (2) where officials can extract few bribes, (3) where careers in agencies are expected to be long-lasting, and (4) where the agencies are powerful, i. e., where their loyalty is important. This set of findings fits best with a theory of loyalty as a noncontractible behavior, implying that too competent staff cannot be induced to loyalty unless loyalty is highly valued by the government. Other theories are either rejected or are less plausible because they cannot explain the complete set of observed regularities. Loyalty, self-enforcing contracts, public agencies, corporate finance...|$|R

He believed that, with more <b>competent</b> <b>officials</b> in charge of the negotiations, there could have been a settlement between the government and the sailors.
