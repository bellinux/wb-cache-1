50|$|Ammunition was of {{separate}} loading <b>bagged</b> <b>charge</b> and projectile. The <b>bagged</b> <b>charges</b> weighed 22 kg, while the projectiles weighed 45.4 kg.|$|R
50|$|The gun {{design was}} further {{modified}} {{in the late}} 1990s. The gun, called 155 GH 52 APU (or 155 K 98 in Finnish Army service), was given a longer, 52 calibre barrel and an auxiliary power unit, enabling it to move by its own power. The chamber was also changed to support modern NATO-standard <b>charge</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 4.5-inch {{ammunition}} was separate loading, {{the shell}} and cartridge were loaded separately, with <b>charge</b> <b>bags</b> being {{removed from the}} cartridge as necessary. [...] The full charge was charge five, i.e. the cartridge case had an irremovable charge (one) and four incremental bags. [...] Shells were delivered fuzed. [...] In 1914 the ammunition scale for 4.5-inch howitzers was 70% shrapnel and 30% HE.|$|R

25|$|During {{the last}} few days of June and {{the first few days of}} July 2015, JetBlue began <b>charging</b> for <b>bags</b> in certain booking classes, leaving Southwest Airlines the only major U.S. carrier to not <b>charge</b> for <b>bags.</b> For the classes in which bag check fees are charged (generally the lowest class of fares offered; JetBlue offers 3 classes of fares), the cost is $20 for the first bag and $35 for the second, which is the lowest in the United States besides Frontier Airlines with similar prices.|$|R

5000|$|The range tables {{specified}} {{the barrel}} angle and propellant charges required. The additional cordite propelling <b>charge</b> <b>bags</b> were dropped {{down the barrel}} if necessary, or necessary number of propellant charges removed from the bomb, and the bomb's fuze was set. The gunners stood back, the bomb was dropped down the barrel, the detonator {{in the base of}} the [...]303 cartridge in the base of the bomb struck a pin {{in the bottom of the}} barrel and fired, igniting the guncotton charges in the base of the bomb, which in turn ignited the cordite charges if present. The resulting rapid gas expansion propelled the bomb up the barrel and to its target.|$|R

In 1914 the ammunition scale for 4.5-inch howitzers was 70% shrapnel and 30% HE.New types of shell were introduced during the First World War. These were chemical {{at the end of}} 1915, incendiary shells in 1916 and smoke shells in 1917. Smoke shells were phosphorus filled with both steel and cast iron bodies.A new streamlined shell (HE Mk 1D) was also introduced to increase maximum range from 6600 yards of the older three CRH (calibres radius head) models to 7300 yards.|$|R

5000|$|Elswick Ordnance Company (Armstrong's {{ordnance}} arm) {{developed a}} coned {{version of the}} interrupted-thread screw, with a decreasing rather than constant diameter towards the front. This eliminated the second [...] "withdrawal" [...] motion, with just two motions now necessary, rotate and swing aside. This proved short-lived, with Britain adopting <b>charges</b> in <b>bags</b> using the Welin stepped interrupted screw for all guns 5 inches and up within several years of it becoming available.|$|R
40|$|Wales is {{the first}} country in the United Kingdom to have {{introduced}} a charge for single-use carrier bags. A 2 x 2 quasi-experimental field study {{was set up to}} evaluate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the charge. Independent nationally representative quota samples were interviewed before and after the introduction of the carrier <b>bag</b> <b>charge</b> in Wales and at the same times in England (n= 500 each). England, where no carrier <b>bag</b> <b>charge</b> was introduced, served as the comparator for the study. The study found increases in own bag use in both countries. However, the increase was much greater in Wales than in England. The study also found evidence for the policy becoming more popular after its implementation in Wales. While support for the carrier <b>bag</b> <b>charge</b> was already high before its introduction, the Welsh population became even more supportive afterwards. Although no support was found for positive behavioural spillover, the study found changes in self-reported environmental identity that could produce positive spillover effects in the longer term. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{this was}} not a popular policy. Food Basics {{eventually}} stopped <b>charging</b> for shopping <b>bags</b> and started using the typical cheaply made plastic bags used by its competitors and its fellow A&P banner stores.|$|R
