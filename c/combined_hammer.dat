50|$|During {{the early}} stage of Napoleon's {{incursion}} into Russia, Bagration commanded the 2nd Russian Army deployed close to Vileyka, Belarus. The French march on Vilnius intended to split Bagration's forces from Barclay de Tolly's, who assumed overall command. Napoleon would then destroy Bagration's 2nd army with a <b>combined</b> <b>hammer</b> and anvil operation conducted by the Marshals Jerome, Davout and Eugene after he falsely assumed they ran into Bagration's army when it were only elements of General Dokturov's cavalry. Confusion, false assumptions and lack of information prevented the French from having {{a clear picture of}} the situation. On the other side it was not much better. Conflicting orders and lack of information had almost placed Bagration in a blind march straight into Davout's forces. Mud tracks, supply problems, weather and command dispute among the French gave Bagration enough time to join with Docturov and assume command over a 45.000 men strong force. With already losing a large portion of his troops to skirmishes, bad weather condition and diseases, Marshal Davout didn't want to fight Bagration without Jerome reinforcing him. The French cavalry was defeated twice by General Platov so that they were kept in the dark. Bagration wasn't better informed with both sides overestimating the other's strength. Davout thought Bagration had some 60,000 men and Bagration thought Davout had 70,000. Bagration was getting orders from both Alexander's staff and Barclay (which Barclay didn't know) and left Bagration without a clear picture of what was expected of him and the general situation. This stream of confused orders to Bagration had him upset with Barclay which would have repercussions later. Even though Barclay de Tolly was given overall command as minister of war, Bagration was not subordinate under him since he was the older general. This is a reason why he constantly received orders from Tsar Alexander and Barclay at the same time.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the advance}} press release, the book dissects the Satanic sources that have {{influenced}} and informed Cradle of Filth, with a roadmap to every significant landmark in {{the domains of}} darkness, including the arcane secrets of black magic, via the sex rites of vampirism. Artfully <b>combining</b> <b>Hammer</b> horror style schlock, dripping with eroticism, backed by authentic black arts info and a wicked sense of humour, this will dazzle devoted disciples of darkness.

50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1970s, Hammer made fewer films, and {{attempts}} were made to break from the then-unfashionable Gothic horror films on which the studio had built its reputation. Neither The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), a co-production with Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers which attempted to <b>combine</b> <b>Hammer's</b> Gothic horror with the martial arts film, nor To the Devil a Daughter (1976), an adaptation of the Dennis Wheatley novel, were successful. Hammer's last production, in 1979, was a remake of Hitchcock's 1938 thriller The Lady Vanishes, starring Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd.|$|R
50|$|A {{jackhammer}} (pneumatic drill or {{demolition hammer}} in British English) is a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that <b>combines</b> a <b>hammer</b> directly with a chisel. It {{was invented by}} William Mcreavy, who then sold the patent to Charles Brady King. Hand-held jackhammers are generally powered by compressed air, but some are also powered by electric motors. Larger jackhammers, such as rig mounted hammers used on construction machinery, are usually hydraulically powered. They are typically used to break up rock, pavement, and concrete.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility {{study to determine}} if the health condition of Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) can be assessed by examining their dynamic response to impact excitation. First, a reference dynamic behavior is defined in the frequency domain of 50 - 1200 Hz based on field hammer test measurements performed on a IRJ baseline (i. e., a set of IRJ without visible damage). Then, measurements on IRJs with different damage states are compared to the IRJ baseline response via the frequency response function (FRF) based statistical method. Three cases of IRJs are analyzed: a IRJ with a broken fastening, a IRJ with a damaged insulation layer and a IRJ with a rail top with plastic deformation. <b>Combining</b> <b>hammer</b> test measurements, hardness measurements and pictures of the IRJs, two frequency bands were identified as characteristic for damaged IRJs. In the identified high frequency band (1000 - 1150 Hz), the measured dynamic response with both a vehicle-borne health monitoring system and hammer tests shows a clear difference between the damaged IRJs and the IRJ baseline. Furthermore, different damage types may be able to be identified by examining the dynamic responses in the identified mid-frequency band (420 - 600 Hz). Further analysis over a larger number of IRJs may complete and support the promising results so that the information can be employed for the condition assessment and monitoring of IRJs.

50|$|The above was {{reflected}} in the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic's flag, as designed upon its foundation, <b>combining</b> the Communist <b>Hammer</b> and Sickle with the traditional Crescent, which had appeared in the flag of the Emirate of Bukhara as well as in those of the Ottoman Empire and various other Islamic states. Conversely, the flags of the Soviet Republics among which the Bukharan territory was divided in 1925 featured the Hammer and Sickle alone, omitting the Crescent.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sleeve {{structure}} {{is used to}} joint component parts of aerocraft or other product design and manufacture. It is an incompletely rigid joint. The contact stiffness of sleeve {{structure is}} non-linear {{and it must be}} taken into account for static or dynamic analysis. The assembling technology of sleeve structure is influenceable on the natural attributes of the structure. In this paper, nonlinear finite element method with the gap element of MSN/NASTRAN is <b>combined</b> with <b>hammering</b> test to simulate the nonlinear contact problem of sleeve structure design and manufacture. A novel method is used to define the close stiffness of gap element. Effect of assembling technologic parameters on inherent characteristic of sleeve structure are studied, such as diameter, quantity, arrangement mode of joint bolts and the prestressing force on bolts. Processes of sleeve structure assembling are proposed through theoretically analysis and simulating calculation...|$|R
5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a <b>combined</b> crucifix and <b>hammer</b> has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|R
50|$|This game {{contains}} a new feature called solar forging, available after the player has completed the cathedral stage and rescued Smith. With Solar Forging, any two weapon {{can be combined}} into one. Two weapons {{of the same name}} will produce another of the same name, which is useful for creating SP weapons later on in the game. (i.e. blood sword and blood sword = blood sword SP (when done properly), long sword and long sword = long sword SP). A combination of two weapons of the same type will give another weapon of that type, while weapons of two different types will yield one of the third types (for example, a sword with a sword will always give combined into a sword and a sword with a spear will always be <b>combined</b> into a <b>hammer).</b>|$|R
25|$|With his description, it is {{seen that}} the {{out-of-date}} Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer (Chinese: 水碓 Pinyin: shui dui; Wade–Giles: shui tui). The Han Dynasty scholar and poet Ma Rong (79–166 AD) mentioned {{in one of his}} poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'. As described in the Hou Han Shu, in 129 AD the official Yu Xu gave a report to Emperor Shun of Han that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western Qiang people by way of canals through the Qilian Mountains. In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of <b>combined</b> trip <b>hammer</b> batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel. In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.|$|R
50|$|The MAG-95 pistol relies to a {{large extent}} on design {{features}} from the later Browning designs, and others, combining features from several weapons into one pistol. The locking system is the widely used dropping barrel and cam action of the Browning series. This is combined with a double-action trigger mechanism <b>combined</b> with a <b>hammer</b> decocking lever which allows the external hammer to be lowered in safety when a round is chambered. Only a positive 50 N pull on the trigger will allow the hammer to recock for firing the round. The barrel is chrome plated to prolong its life and to permit easier cleaning. The MAG-95 is suitable for use by both right and left-handed users and is designed for two-handed operation. It is claimed that the pistols are well balanced to produce greater accuracy when rapid firing. The box magazine contains 15 rounds; optional 20 and 10-round magazines are available. Other options include a laser target indicator to be mounted in front of the trigger guard. The standard finish is a matte black lacquer coating but a bright or matte chrome finish is optional. The MAG-98 incorporates a buffer while the MAG-98c, also with a buffer, is primarily a sporting pistol.|$|R
40|$|As {{there are}} no {{scientific}} insights concerning sheet metal forming by hammering using an industrial robot, the main objective of this research work is to develop such a process and to gain a scientific basis for this forming method. By providing all technical components such as equipment and software, its technical practicability is proven. Chapter 2 systematically describes {{the state of the}} art of conventional and incremental sheet metal forming processes. In chapter 3 today's sheet metal production is analyzed based on published literature. In chapter 4, the concept of the system and the process cycle are presented. In addition, several alternatives of sub-systems and systems, which <b>combine</b> the <b>hammering</b> forming process with other forming, cutting and joining methods, are shown. Chapter 5 describes the realization of the first test facility for the hammering forming process according to the selected variants of the sub-systems. A first fundamental research is described in compliance with the first main point of examination defined in chapter 3. The acquired scientific knowledge was applied to increase the application area of the hammering forming process by deriving new forming strategies for the product of sheet metal parts with more complex geometries and improved geometrical accuracy. In chapter 6 a one-dimensional mechanical model of the robot cell for hammering sheet metal forming is presented based on well-chosen assumptions and simplifications. After the derivation and verification of the mechanical model, the model is used for a theoretical examination of vibrations to formulate qualitative and quantitative statements concerning the dimensioning of the hammering tool and the industrial robot. In chapter 7 a prototypical pilot installation is presented, consisting of the sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal, the hammering tool and the software for path generation. The combined sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal and the hammering tool are realized in accordance with the solution variants in chapter 4. The pilot installation is used for testing the hammering sheet metal forming process and the developed components by producing several demonstration sheet metal parts and one sheet metal prototype for the automobile industry...|$|R
