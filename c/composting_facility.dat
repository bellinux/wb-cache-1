40|$|The role of {{sustainable}} and natural waste management {{processes such as}} composting are increasingly becoming more important in tackling the current environmental challenge {{of the amount of}} waste that is being produced. However a potential risk of <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> is the release and dispersal of bioaerosols that might result in adverse health effects in sensitive receptors. Therefore, environmental regulators request regulatory risk assessments from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> that are within 250 m of sensitive receptors to assess the risk posed by bioaerosols. The prior art in compost related bioaerosol release and dispersal assessment is not extensive and gaps in the understanding of bioaerosols at source, on release from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> and at receptor remain. Therefore, this research was undertaken to address some of these gaps in the current knowledge and to improve the understanding of the characterisation and dispersal of bioaerosols emitted from compost. Therefore firstly two studies were completed in regards to the characterisation of bioaerosols emitted from compost, in particular in improving the understanding of their aggregation and size distribution. In this context, a novel methodology (the compost tumbler) was developed to release and measure bioaerosols in experimental conditions. Data was generated using a combination of culturing and scanning electron microscopy methods to characterise the aggregation and size distribution of bioaerosols emitted from compost. Secondly, site work was conducted to validate the results of these controlled experiments and characterise the aggregation and size distribution of bioaerosols emitted from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities.</b> These controlled experiments and site work showed evidence of aggregation in bioaerosols released from compost. However, the majority of these bioaerosols were in single cell units hence {{they are more likely to}} be dispersed for longer distances. Following this, other studies were conducted in regards to the dispersal of bioaerosols emitted from compost, in particular in improving the understanding of bioaerosol concentration prediction by air dispersion modelling. Firstly preliminary air dispersion modelling was completed to assess the ability of a commercial air dispersion model,ADMS 3. 3, to predict bioaerosol emissions from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> compared to bioaerosol concentrations measured by on-site downwind bioaerosol sampling. Folowing this, the sensitivities of ADMS 3. 3 were analysed and the effect of different modelling parameters on predicted bioaerosol concentrations were assessed. Finally, a final assessment of the potential of ADMS 3. 3 to predict bioaerosol emissions from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> was conducted. The overall results from the modelling studies indicated that ADMS 3. 3 was not able to consistently predict absolute downwind bioaerosol concentrations at <b>composting</b> <b>facilities.</b> However it was also concluded that ADMS 3. 3 can be a useful tool for the initial screening and assessing relative changes of bioaerosols at a <b>compost</b> <b>facility,</b> provided that the detailed assessment of absolute bioaerosol emissions are made in conjunction with measurement of downwind bioaerosol concentrations. The research presented in this thesis makes a significant contribution to knowledge in terms of improving the understanding of the characterisation and dispersal of bioaerosols emitted from <b>composting</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Actinobacteria are widely distributed in many environments {{and represent the}} most important trigger to the occupant respiratory health. Health complaints, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis of the workers, were recorded in a mushroom <b>compost</b> <b>facility</b> (MCF). The studies on the airborne bacteria were carried out to find a possible microbiological source of these symptoms. Culture analysis of compost bioaerosols collected in different location of the MCF was performed. An assessment of the indoor microbial exposure revealed bacterial flora of bioaerosol in the mushroom <b>compost</b> <b>facility</b> represented by Bacillus, Geobacillus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylo-coccus spp., and actinobacterial strain with white aerial mycelium. The thermotolerant actinobacterial strain of the same morphology was repeatedly isolated from many locations in MCF: air, compost sample, and solid surface in production hall. On the base of complex morphological, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic characteristics, the isolate has been classified as Nocardiopsis alba. Dominant position of N. alba in microbial environment of the mushroom <b>compost</b> <b>facility</b> may represent an indicator microorganism in compost bioaerosol.

A meta-dataset enumerating cultivable microorganism emission and downwind concentrations is not yet available. A dataset derived from repeated and replicated field studies {{over a period of}} two years at two commercial <b>composting</b> <b>facilities</b> is presented. The data characterises patterns in Aspergillus fumigatus, actinomycetes, Gram-negative bacteria and endotoxin emission and downwind concentrations. For all bioaerosols, compost agitation activities {{had a significant impact on}} concentrations; levels were variable up to 600 m downwind from site. Bioaerosols declined rapidly from source and exhibited a secondary peak 100 – 150 m from site boundary. All bioaerosols were found downwind from site in elevated concentrations. Compared to those found 100 m upwind, levels were significantly higher at 180 m downwind for A. fumigatus; at 300 – 400 m for actinomycetes and Gram negative bacteria, and at 100 m for endotoxins.

There are primarily {{two different types}} of composting systems operating in Korean farms, namely mechanical aerated pile composting (MAPC) and aerated static pile composting (SAPC). In this study, we analyzed various particulate matters (PM 10, PM 7, PM 2. 5, PM 1, and total suspended particles), volatile organic compounds and ammonia, and correlated these airborne contaminants with microclimatic parameters, i. e., temperature and relative humidity. Most of the analyzed airborne particulates (PM 7, PM 2. 5, and PM 1) were detected in high concentration at SAPC facilities compered to MAPC; however these differences were statistically non-significant. Similarly, most of the odorants did not vary significantly between MAPC and SAPC facilities, except for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and skatole. DMS concentrations were significantly higher in MAPC facilities, whereas skatole concentrations were significantly higher in SAPC facilities. The microclimate variables also did not vary significantly between MAPC and SAPC facilities, and did not correlate significantly with most of the airborne particles and odorous compounds, suggesting that microclimate variables did not influence their emission from <b>compost</b> <b>facilities.</b> These findings provide insight into the airborne contaminants that are emitted from <b>compost</b> <b>facilities</b> and the {{two different types of}} composting agitation systems...|$|R
