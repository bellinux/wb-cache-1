30|$|At {{the end of}} the experiment, five {{fish from}} each {{aquarium}} were randomly sampled using hand net and quickly anesthetized with 2 -phenoxyethanol. Approximately, 2  ml of blood was collected by <b>cardiopuncture</b> using a heparin-coated needle and syringe into EDTA-coated tubes. The blood samples were held on ice until all samples were collected. All samplings were completed within 5  min of fish removal from the aquarium. Blood glucose levels and erythrocyte count were determined from whole blood. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 5  min to obtain plasma, which was then stored at − 20  °C until assayed according to the method of Barreto and Volpato (2006). Part of the supernatant was used to quantify protein concentration by BCA assay.|$|E
40|$|Two lots of 20 {{young male}} guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously in the tarsi with 10 (elevated to fourth potency) amastigotes of Leishmania braziliensis or L. b. guyanensis {{to study the}} {{susceptibility}} of this Neotropical hystricomorph rodent the autochthonous parasites. Almost 50 % of the animals showed lesions in the inoculation site and had parazitations that were infective to hamsters, as shown by inoculating homogenates of the dermal lesion, of the spleen, of the liver, and of the nasal mucosa into hamsters at 20, 40, 60 and 120 days after inoculation of the guinea pig. Smears of the above organs showed the presence of amastigotes. Parasites inoculated into the tarsi were detected early in the skin, spleen, and liver of the guinea pig host. Blood cultures made by <b>cardiopuncture</b> on sacrifice of the guinea pigs were uniformly negative. The nasal mucosa of nearly all animals positive in the skin or viscera was invaded early by the parasites, although with grater frequency between 60 and 120 days post-inoculation. The use of this model {{for the study of}} mucocutaneous parasitism by L. brasiliensis is discussed, together with the phenomena of parasitism at a distance from the inoculation site, the temperature of the body regions affected, and the possible genetic influence on susceptibility of the guinea pig to L. brasiliensis...|$|E
40|$|Tacrolimus, an {{immunosuppressant}} {{with narrow}} therapeutic window, {{has been used}} widely in transplant patients. Grapefruit juice and pomelo {{have been reported to}} increase the blood levels of tacrolimus. Zhi Ke and Zhi Shi, the ripe peels and unripe fruits of Citrus aurantium which is chemotaxonomically related to grapefruit and pomelo, are in wide use in clinical Chinese medicine. To investigate the possible interaction of these two Citrus herbs with tacrolimus, male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally given tacrolimus (1. 5 [*]mg/kg) with and without Zhi Ke and Zhi Shi decoctions in a cross-over design. Blood samples were withdrawn via <b>cardiopuncture</b> at specific time and quantitated by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. In addition, to explore the mechanism of interaction, LS 180 cell line was used for the transport study of rhodamine 123, a typical substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The results showed that Zhi Shi significantly decreased the Cmax⁡ and AUC 0 -t of tacrolimus by 72. 4 % and 72. 0 %, respectively, whereas Zhi Ke did not affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. LS 180 cell line study indicated that Zhi Shi increased the efflux activity of P-gp, enabling us to explain the decreased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by Zhi Shi. Hence, we suggest that Zhi Shi be contraindicated for transplant patients treated with tacrolimus {{to reduce the risk of}} allograft rejection...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} study was to compare the susceptibility of gelatin-sealed Dacron and PTFE prostheses to infection by MRSA. DesignProspective, randomized, controlled animal study. Materials and MethodsGraft infections were established in the subcutaneous tissues of 60 female Spraque-Dawley rats by the implantation of gelatin-sealed Dacron or PTFE prostheses followed by topical inoculation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The study groups were as follows: (1 A) uncontaminated gelatin-sealed Dacron group, (1 B) untreated contaminated gelatin-sealed Dacron group, (1 C) contaminated gelatin-sealed Dacron group with intraperitoneal teicoplanin treatment, (2 A) uncontaminated PTFE group, (2 B) untreated contaminated PTFE group, and (2 C) contaminated PTFE group with intraperitoneal teicoplanin treatment. The grafts were removed after 7 days and evaluated for infection by {{counting the number of}} adherent bacteria on the graft material after rinsing and sonication. The perigraft tissue was harvested for histopathological study. To investigate the existence of any infection, blood samples were collected by <b>cardiopuncture</b> for a culture analysis. ResultsNo significant difference in bacteria counts was observed between gelatin-sealed Dacron and PTFE grafts. In groups 1 A and 2 A, there was no infection detected. The bacterial counts for MRSA were 7. 4 × 105 in group 1 B and 8. 6 × 105 in group 2 B. There was also no infection in groups 1 C and 2 C. While the difference between group 1 B and 2 B was not significant (p>. 05), bacterial counts in group 1 B or 2 B were significantly higher than those in other groups. Blood cultures were only positive in four rats in group 1 B and in two rats in group 2 B. The severities of the inflammation of the perigraft tissues was low in groups 1 A and 2 A, high in groups 1 C and 2 C, and between the range from low to moderate in groups 1 B and 2 B. ConclusionThe susceptibility of gelatin-sealed Dacron to bacterial infection was not higher than that of PTFE...|$|E
