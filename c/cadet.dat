5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A <b>cadet</b> starts as a <b>cadet</b> airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP <b>cadet</b> must be promoted through every CAP <b>cadet</b> enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP <b>cadet</b> second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a <b>cadet</b> must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to <b>cadet</b> airman and <b>cadet</b> staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP <b>cadet</b> enlisted grades.|$|E
5|$|Cadets that {{transfer}} to the senior member side {{between the ages of}} 18 and 20 receive the grade of flight officer (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award earned was the Mitchell), technical flight officer (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award earned was the Earhart) or senior flight officer (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award earned was the Spaatz). If the <b>cadet</b> waits until their 21st birthday, at which point they are required to {{transfer to}} the senior member program, they are eligible for the grade of second lieutenant (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award was the Mitchell), first lieutenant (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award was the Earhart), or captain (if the highest <b>cadet</b> award was the Spaatz).|$|E
5|$|Each {{milestone}} {{award in}} the Civil Air Patrol confers upon a <b>cadet</b> various benefits. Upon earning the Mitchell Award and the grade of <b>cadet</b> second lieutenant, a <b>cadet</b> {{is eligible for}} promotion the rank of airman first class (E-3) upon enlistment in the United States Air Force. A <b>cadet</b> earning the Earhart Award and being promoted to C/Capt and, if age 17 or older, may be selected to attend the International Air <b>Cadet</b> Exchange.|$|E
5000|$|As {{often as}} the uniforms changed {{so did the}} {{designation}} of the <b>Cadets.</b> Between 1801 and 1861 the <b>Cadets</b> alternately designated themselves the Boston Independent <b>Cadets,</b> Company of Independent <b>Cadets,</b> Divisionary Company of <b>Cadets</b> and Independent Company of <b>Cadets</b> and some six other variations of these designations.|$|R

5|$|The Canadian <b>Cadet</b> Movement is {{sponsored}} by the CF/DND and the civilian Air <b>Cadet</b> League, along with the Navy League and Army <b>Cadet</b> League. Each <b>cadet</b> unit is supported by a local Squadron Sponsoring Committee responsible to the National League through each of the Provincial Committees. The basic Air <b>Cadet</b> program is provided at no cost, including uniforms and activities. Most Air <b>Cadet</b> squadrons are sponsored by a local service organization or club such as a Royal Canadian Legion Branch, Royal Canadian Air Force Association Wing, Rotary Club, Lions Club, or a locally established committee. The local civilian sponsors must raise money to provide for accommodation, utilities, liability insurance, local awards, and additional training resources or special activities, such as mess dinners, band instruments or squadron excursions and trips, not funded by the CF/DND. Cadets and their parents are encouraged to participate in fund-raising activities.|$|E
5|$|The Region <b>Cadet</b> Leadership Schools (RCLS) provide {{training}} to increase knowledge, skills, and attitudes as they pertain to leadership and management. To {{be eligible to}} attend, cadets must be serving in, or preparing to enter, <b>cadet</b> leadership positions within their squadron. RCLSs are conducted at region level, or at wing level with region approval. The RCLS programs {{are more or less}} modeled on USAFA upper classmen programs, the college Air Force ROTC Professional Officer Course (POC) and latter stages of OTS. One variation on this theme are CAP <b>Cadet</b> Non-Commissioned Officer Schools and Academies, which are <b>cadet</b> NCO schools designed to teach basic leadership and principles to <b>cadet</b> leaders during their earlier duty positions in the <b>cadet</b> program.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Cadets</b> Drum and Bugle Corps (formerly the Holy Name <b>Cadets,</b> <b>Cadets</b> of Garfield, Garfield <b>Cadets,</b> and <b>Cadets</b> of Bergen County) are a World Class {{competitive}} junior {{drum and}} bugle corps.

5|$|The {{majority}} of <b>cadet</b> training {{takes place at}} the local squadron during the regular school year, with a percentage of cadets selected for summer training courses at various <b>cadet</b> summer training centres located across Canada. Central to the air <b>cadet</b> program are the gliding and flying scholarships offered to air cadets who qualify. One in five private pilots in Canada is an ex-air <b>cadet,</b> and 67% of commercial and airline pilots began as air cadets. There are 456 squadrons located across the country with an approximate enrolment of 23,000 Air Cadets.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} phrasing for {{the ranks}} {{uses the word}} <b>cadet</b> as a preface — as an example, <b>cadet</b> corporal. However, custom omits <b>cadet</b> in casual reference. Thus, corporal is the usual wording. Generally, {{where there is a}} need to distinguish between cadets and Canadian Forces members, ranks will be written or spoken as <b>cadet</b> corporal and abbreviated as C/Cpl.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a <b>cadet</b> is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The <b>cadet</b> visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the <b>cadet</b> runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the <b>cadet</b> will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air <b>Cadet</b> League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area <b>Cadet</b> Instructor Cadre officer, regional <b>cadet</b> advisor, area <b>cadet</b> officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) of the community (to include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking <b>cadet.</b>|$|E

Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track <b>cadets</b> or Military-Leader Track <b>cadets</b> not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track <b>cadets</b> participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior <b>cadets</b> learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore <b>cadets</b> apply to those jobs, the upperclass <b>cadets</b> review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass <b>cadets,</b> so they can learn from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass <b>cadets</b> learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations like Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets <b>cadets</b> need to develop to be more employable after graduation.|$|R
