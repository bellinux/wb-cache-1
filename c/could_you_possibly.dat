500|$|In 1929, the {{building}} became vacant, {{and was given}} to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, by his father, King George V. The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: [...] "He's just super bland. Like, how <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> be a fan of Patrick Duffy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rathbun's 1992 arrest {{caught the}} {{attention}} of her friend Donald Abrams, clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and a physician at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The results of that study were extremely promising and I think very surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams found is that marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Cooke of Drowned in Sound {{was also}} {{impressed}} and awarded {{a score of}} eight out of ten, despite stating it [...] "falls short of the dizzying intensity of its masterpiece of a predecessor." [...] He praised frontman Scott Hutchison in particular, describing his performance as still having the [...] "same tremble in the voice, the same elegance in the guitar tone, the same march of the Military Tattoo in the rhythm – but a renewed purpose". Free music magazine, The Fly, awarded the album four ½ out of five stars. Iain Moffat claimed that Scott Hutchison {{has one of the}} [...] "most underrated voices in rock" [...] as well as praising the [...] "lyrical sharpness" [...] of the album. He summarised his review by adding, [...] "what more <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> want from Frightened Rabbit’s third album? They’re hurling themselves fearlessly at the bright lights, and coming back all the stronger for it." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian praised the album's [...] "sharp" [...] songwriting, stating, [...] "most of their songs – with themes of escape, freedom and reinvention – have huge impassioned choruses that are made to be shouted from the nearest available mountain". Awarding four stars, he also added, [...] "The Rabbit are a band overdue a breakthrough, and fans of everyone from Arcade Fire to the similarly revamped Maccabees will find much to love here." ...|$|E

'Ah! my father,' said Philammon, glad in {{his heart}} of any excuse to turn the conversation, and yet half uneasy and {{suspicious}} at Arsenius's evident determination to avoid the very object of his visit.

6000|$|... "But {{where could}} you hear it?" [...] cried Miss Bates. [...] "Where <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> hear it, Mr. Knightley?

So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh! my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note.
