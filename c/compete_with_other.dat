5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{depend on}} certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their {{environment}} but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> organisms in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours {{at a variety of}} spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E

5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore City College began {{competing}} against other secondary schools in 1919 {{when it was}} {{invited to join the}} Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) as a founding member. After 75 years of governing Baltimore-metro area boys' high school athletics, the Maryland Scholastic Association dissolved in 1993 when its 15 public school members, including City College, withdrew from the league to join the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA). The Knights currently <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> public secondary schools in the MPSSAA (Class 3A, North Region, District 9), more commonly referred to as the Baltimore City League (Division 1), but routinely schedule contests against area private schools in various sports.|$|E
5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} {{interaction with the}} neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E

5|$|Hiring is {{done through}} a civil service examination, {{including}} a written test, a teaching examination, academic history analysis and other additional criteria. The same process {{is required for}} professors changing tiers: an associate professor pursuing a tenure position must {{go through the same}} examination process <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> external candidates for the position. The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and professors are promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} plans for a free consumer security product, codenamed Morro. This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product {{with a host of}} other tools, such as backup and a personal firewall, Morro would offer free AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of Morro was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> large silver trade coins {{that were already}} popular in East Asia. The idea first came about in the 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse and reverse created by William Barber were selected.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} shows {{a variety of}} adaptations {{suitable}} to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish, particularly characins and catfish, but may also eat crabs, turtles, snakes and small caiman. It has no serious natural predators other than humans, although it must <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> species, including the neotropical otter and caiman species, for food resources.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's storm petrel have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|While {{conducting}} {{an investigation of}} the Mint at San Francisco, deputy comptroller of the currency John Jay Knox began discussing the monetary situation with Louis A. Garnett, a man who had worked as both the treasurer and assayer of the San Francisco Mint. Garnett recommended that the United States mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to the Orient to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> countries' silver trade coins that were already popular in that region. Garnett's rationale was {{that the majority of the}} coins would be hoarded or melted in Asia and would never be presented for redemption, allowing the government to make a profit from the seigniorage. During his time in San Francisco, Knox also discussed the proposed commercial dollar with Henry Linderman, who was working as a special agent for the Treasury Department at that time. In 1870, Knox wrote a report to the Treasury and wrote the draft for a bill on coinage. Knox's bill was approved by George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury. After modification and review from current and former government officials, the bill was put before Congress.|$|E
