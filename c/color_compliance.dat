40|$|This paper aims {{to enable}} the study of water reuse in the seat belt webbing dyeing process, {{achieving}} larger economy in water consumption since textile operations use {{a great amount of}} water. In order to reach this goal, various products were tested during the treatment of such effluents which met the following characteristics: biodegradability, greater efficiency in removing <b>color,</b> <b>compliance</b> with legislation, and low cost. Using these new products, approximately 59 % of water consumption and 30 % of effluent treatment were reduced on a monthly basis. Taking into account these initial results, payback is expected in approximately five months...|$|E

Vance at sea {{northeast}} of Wilmington, North Carolina attempting {{to carry a}} cargo of cotton to Europe. On 2 November 1864, blockade runner steamer, Lucy, struck her <b>colors</b> in <b>compliance</b> with a demand from Santiago de Cuba.|$|R
2500|$|As no MTO was nationally {{selected}} by the UK in [...] "structural balance terms" [...] - throughout the entire period covered by the table, the <b>compliance</b> <b>colors</b> for the UK indicate whether or not its structural balance each year respected its [...] "Minimum MTO" [...] as calculated in structural balance terms by the Commission.|$|R

By her shoulder is a small inset box featuring a graphic image of a hand carrying a food basket, with the slogan, "Food Fights for Freedom". Additional captions contained in this inset are "Produce and Conserve" and "Share and Play Square"...|$|R
2500|$|Note A: Setting {{country-specific}} MTOs only became mandatory {{starting from}} the 2006 fiscal year. However, Denmark and Sweden by own initiative already did so for 2005. For states without a country-specific MTO in 2005, the green/red <b>compliance</b> <b>color</b> in this specific year indicate, if the structural balance of the state complied with both the common [...] "close to balance or surplus" [...] (min. 0.0%) target and the country-specific [...] "minimum benchmark". The latter only being stricter for two states in 2005, effectively setting a +0.8% target for Finland, +0.1% target for Luxembourg, and a 0.0% target {{for the rest of}} the states to respect.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Fletcher, a Michigan alumnus and {{chairman}} of the State Highway Commission with a [...] "sly sense of humor", ordered the inclusion the fake towns of [...] "Goblu" [...] (near the real town of Bono, Ohio, off State Route 2) and [...] "Beatosu" [...] (near Archbold, Ohio, just south of Interstate 80/Interstate 90/Ohio Turnpike at exit 25). In a 2008 interview, Fletcher explained that a fellow Michigan alumnus had been teasing him about the Mackinac Bridge colors: green and white, the colors of Michigan State University. Fletcher noted that the bridge <b>colors</b> were in <b>compliance</b> with federal highway regulations, so he had no choice in that matter; he did, however, have more control over the state highway map. Fletcher said that he thus ordered a cartographer to insert the two fictitious towns.|$|R
