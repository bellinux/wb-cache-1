We have examined two different supercapacitors, one is a <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> {{and the other is}} a supercapacitor of our own design. Four different testing methods including Impedance Spectroscopy, Constant Current Charging, Cyclic Voltammetry and Power Cycling were applied to each supercapacitor and the results are reviewed. Parameter values obtained from Impedance Spectroscopy are excellent for comparing supercapacitors under equilibrium conditions but correlate poorly with data obtained from the more useful Power Cycling Charts (PCC). The choice of the current step size in Constant Current Charging and the scan rate in Cyclic Voltammetry has a large bearing on the results obtained from these techniques. The strong voltage dependence of the parameters for the <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> prevented analysis using Cyclic Voltammetry.

A recently introduced ionic-liquid-based capillary column for GC was used to separate trifluoroacetylated fatty amines focusing on the analysis of a <b>commercial</b> <b>sample.</b> Using the ionic liquid column (isothermal mode at 200 °C) {{it was possible to}} separate linear primary fatty amines from C 12 to C 22 chain length in less 25 min with MS identification. The log of the amine retention factors are linearly related to the alkyl chain length with a methylene selectivity of 0. 117 kcal/mol for the saturated amines and 0. 128 kcal/mol for the mono-unsaturated amines. The sp(2) selectivity for unsaturated fatty amines also could be calculated as 0. 107 kcal/mol for the ionic liquid column.

40|$|Traditional use of American {{skullcap}} (Scutellaria lateriflora) for {{anxiety and}} related conditions is well documented. There {{is evidence of}} flavonoid instability in S. lateriflora and {{a high rate of}} substitution with other skullcap species or adulteration with potentially hepatotoxic germanders (Teucrium spp.). It is therefore essential for the identity, quality and safety of a commercial S. lateriflora product to be verified prior to clinical use. The objective was to review the literature relating to substitution and adulteration of S. lateriflora and to present a simple, optimised high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to verify the absence of adulterants in a <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> of S. lateriflora, by comparing its chromatographic profile with that of authenticated S. lateriflora. S. lateriflora reference material and a freeze-dried <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> were extracted with methanol and water (80 : 20, v/v) and compared by HPLC analysis. The <b>commercial</b> <b>sample</b> showed reproducible retention times (RTs) of the flavonoid biomarkers baicalin (RT = 14. 8 min; mean ± SD = 11. 71 ± 1. 16 mg/g); baicalein (RT = 20. 4 min; 7. 67 ± 0. 89 mg/g); wogonin (RT = 23. 7 min; 0. 65 ± 0. 06 mg/g).

40|$|Abstract Background The use of growth-promoters in beef cattle, {{despite the}} EU ban, remains a {{frequent}} practice. The use of transcriptomic markers has already proposed to identify indirect evidence of anabolic hormone treatment. So far, such {{approach has been}} tested in experimentally treated animals. Here, {{for the first time}} <b>commercial</b> <b>samples</b> were analyzed. Results Quantitative determination of Dexamethasone (DEX) residues in the urine collected at the slaughterhouse was performed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). DNA-microarray technology was used to obtain transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle in <b>commercial</b> <b>samples</b> and negative controls. LC-MS confirmed the presence of low level of DEX residues in the urine of the <b>commercial</b> <b>samples</b> suspect for histological classification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on microarray data identified two clusters of samples. One cluster included negative controls and a subset of <b>commercial</b> <b>samples,</b> while a second cluster included part of the specimens collected at the slaughterhouse together with positives for corticosteroid treatment based on thymus histology and LC-MS. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes (3961) between the two groups provided further evidence that animals clustering with positive samples might have been treated with corticosteroids. These suspect samples could be reliably classified with a specific classification tool (Prediction Analysis of Microarray) using just two genes. Conclusions Despite broad variation observed in gene expression profiles, the present study showed that DNA-microarrays can be used to find transcriptomic signatures of putative anabolic treatments and that gene expression markers could represent a useful screening tool. </p...|$|R
