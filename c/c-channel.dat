5000|$|Leonard Cohen had {{the idea}} for the film based upon his {{personal}} experiences and his song [...] "The Guests". It was originally intended for the Canadian pay TV network <b>C-Channel,</b> but when the network collapsed, the production was completed by Citytv with financial assistance from Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the Canadian Film Development Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|C-shapeBy far {{the most}} common, the <b>C-channel</b> rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle {{at one time or}} another. It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in {{thickness}} from 1/8" [...] to 3/16") and rolling both sides over to form a c-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle.|$|E
30|$|Mode 2, shear {{connectors}} {{and concrete}} block {{between the two}} <b>C-Channels</b> slip with <b>C-Channels</b> together no fracture of shear connectors.|$|R
5000|$|The serious flaws of {{the revised}} design were {{compounded}} by the fact that both designs placed the bolts directly through a welded joint connecting two <b>C-channels,</b> the weakest structural point in the box beams. Photographs of the wreckage show excessive deformations of the cross-section. During the failure, the box beams split along the weld and the nut supporting them slipped through the resulting gap between the two <b>C-channels</b> which had been welded together.|$|R
30|$|Shear {{connectors}} did {{not have}} any residual effect in this segment. There was only frictional resistance between the <b>C-Channels</b> and the foam concrete.|$|R
50|$|The JDM-8 wing is {{constructed}} with an aluminum D-cell leading edge incorporating a 9 in high <b>C-channel</b> main spar made from 6061-T6 grade aluminum. The rear spar {{is a similar}} <b>C-channel</b> that is 5 in high {{and there is a}} third nose spar that is 3 in in height. The wing aft of the D-cell is covered in aircraft fabric and has a modified NACA 4415 airfoil with a drooped trailing edge. The 11 nose ribs and nine aft wing ribs are made from hydroformed aluminum. The ailerons were adapted from the Murphy Rebel design and are 69 in long with a 15 in chord. The ultralight version has a 4 ft greater wingspan to lower its stall speed to below the US ultralight category limit of 28 mph. With the wings folded the homebuilt version is 8.75 ft high and the ultralight version with its longer wings is 10.9 ft high.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 Videon had two {{channels}} {{left for}} pay-TV. It used {{just one of}} them, choosing to offer the national First Choice service on channel 22. Videon claimed {{at the time that}} {{they might be able to}} make channel 23 (J) available for another pay-TV service, having to choose between <b>C-Channel</b> or Superchannel. But they did not follow through on this, possibly because of co-channel interference.|$|E
50|$|PanAmbio {{combines}} a stereo dipole and crosstalk cancellation {{in front and}} a second set behind the listener (total of four speakers) for 360Â° 2D surround reproduction. Four channel recordings, especially those containing binaural cues, create speaker-binaural surround sound. 5.1 channel recordings, including movie DVDs, are compatible by mixing <b>C-channel</b> content to the front speaker pair. 6.1 can be played by mixing SC to the back pair.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{longitudinal}} shear resistance between foam concrete and <b>C-Channels,</b> an investigation is carried out on the shear connectors in foam concrete with cold-formed steel double <b>C-Channels</b> embedment. Twenty-four tests {{have been carried out}} in two groups. Two types of connectors: flange connectors and web connectors are installed using self-drilling screws for a rapid construction. The experimental results show that they can effectively improve the longitudinal shear-resist capacity of the concrete. After the experiment, the specimens are dismantled for an interior observation. Based on the observation, the form of damage, the failure mechanism was discovered, and the equation of longitudinal shear capacity was developed. It is concluded that the failure involves independent slippage between two <b>C-Channels</b> and the shear connection fractures. Since the composite structure requires sufficient slip between the two materials, these types of shear connectors will have good enhancement for this type of composite structures subjected to dynamic loads.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} observations, Modes 2 and 3 {{have not been}} observed for a large range of densities and strengths of the foam concrete that were tested due to the small strength of the screws used in this experiment. But it can be speculated that when the shear connectors are strong, the connections will not fail. Therefore, the connectors will split the foam concrete which will cause Mode 2 (shear connectors and concrete block between the two <b>C-Channels</b> slip with <b>C-Channels</b> together) and Mode 3 (foam concrete occurs large area brittle failure). The rational inference of Mode 2 is verified in another experiment of authors.|$|R
30|$|Shear {{connectors}} exhibited same {{property in}} these two segments. When the end slip between the <b>C-Channels</b> and the foam concrete are noticeable, the joints were shearing the concrete block that provided a huge mechanical interlocking to prevent the relative slip between <b>C-Channels</b> and foam concrete. This force was transferred to steel by self-drilling screws, which effectively increased the shear resistance of the components. The increased slope of AB segment shows that the bearing force of connectors was increasing gradually. And the peak force is also increased. When the shear stresses of the self-drilling screws reached their ultimate shear strength, screws fail make the connectors stop moving.|$|R
5000|$|Tile {{drainage}} got {{its name}} from tiles made from fired clay (ceramic), similar to terracotta pipes but not necessarily in a pipe shape. In the 19th century a <b>C-channel</b> tile atop a flat tile (mug and sole, respectively) were often used. Today, however, tile drainage can be any system operating on the same principle, often with plastic tubing called [...] "tile line". Precast concrete and ceramic are still used as well.|$|E
50|$|The two {{walkways}} {{were suspended}} from {{a set of}} 1.25 in diameter steel tie rods, with the second floor walkway hanging directly under the fourth floor walkway. The fourth floor walkway platform was supported on three cross-beams suspended by steel rods retained by nuts. The cross-beams were box girders made from <b>C-channel</b> strips welded together lengthwise, with a hollow space between them. The original design by Jack D. Gillum and Associates specified three pairs of rods running from the second floor to the ceiling. Investigators determined eventually that this design supported only 60% of the minimum load required by Kansas City building codes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a switch}} to an aluminum-intensive body {{similar to the}} F-150, Ford created a {{potential}} 700 lbs of weight savings; {{in spite of the}} addition of heavier-duty frame and driveline components, the 2017 Super Duty weighs in at up to 350 lbs less than comparable 2016 models. Ford strengthened the frame and drivetrain with fortified drive shafts, axles, brakes and the 4WD transfer case. [...] F-250 and F-350 pickups are built on a fully boxed frame; chassis-cab models are produced on a frame boxed up {{to the rear of the}} cab and of <b>C-channel</b> design rearward.|$|E
30|$|The {{method to}} {{calculate}} the peak force for all 3 modes is developed here; {{it was assumed that}} the mobilized shear stress between <b>C-Channels</b> and foam concrete was uniformly distributed along the failure surfaces, plus the increased shear resistance by connectors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a four point bending test on cold-formed steel (CFS) beams with intermediate stiffeners. Researches {{have shown that}} the load-carrying capacity and the buckling behaviour of compression components of beams and columns can be improved considerably by the use of intermediate stiffeners. However, when the size of the actual intermediate stiffener did not satisfy the required minimum moment of inertia, the load-carrying capacity of the member had to be determined either {{on the basis of a}} flat element disregarding the intermediate stiffener or through tests. In this study, G 550 lipped <b>C-channels</b> with intermediate web stiffeners were tested to determine the additional capacity provided by the stiffeners as compared to lipped <b>C-channels</b> without intermediate web stiffeners. The sections were tested in the minor bending axis with the stiffened web element in compression using four-point bending test. The experimental ultimate moment (...|$|R
30|$|As we know, web {{holes of}} the <b>C-Channels</b> {{can not only}} reduce the weight, but also {{increase}} the interlocking mechanism between steel and foam concrete. In addition, adding perforated rebars between double <b>C-Channels</b> can further improve the shear bearing capacity (Flores-Johnson and Li 2012). For instance, in studying the bond-slip characteristics between steel and foam concrete, Ramezani et al. (2013) carried out pull-out testing of galvanized steel strips in foam concrete. The bond slip curve shows typical hardening and softening behaviour. In order to improve the anchorage of the steel strips, holes were punched into the steel. The pull-out resistance {{was found to be}} directly proportional to the area of the holes which represents more bonding between the steel and the concrete. However, their analysis showed that the steel strip experiences non-uniform strain distribution which results in a larger displacement at the peak force when the bonding increases (by increasing the diameter and circumference of the holes). Furthermore, a series of studies have been done by Moen et al. (2008 â 2014) also showed that the holes in the column or beam decrease the global buckling load or bending moment. Local buckling is also likely to occur in a member at a hole or between holes. Therefore, taking into account the low strength of foam concrete, if the hole is due to damage the stiffness of <b>C-Channels,</b> it will seriously reduce structural capacity of the composite components.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminium and covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage {{is made from}} square aluminum tubing that is TIG welded and weighs 24 lb when completed. Its 19 ft span wings are of a straight planform and both of equal span. The wings have seven foam wing ribs per wing panel and incorporate a D-cell front spar and a <b>C-channel</b> rear spar. The landing gear is conventional, with suspended main wheels and a steerable tailwheel. The H-2 has an open cockpit, with a small windshield. Controls are conventional three-axis, with ailerons, rudder and elevator. The standard design has two ailerons, with four optional.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{cargo bed}} lengths were used; {{one for the}} seven-foot long-bed model, which {{appeared}} first in 1986, and a second, shorter version for the six-foot cargo bed, which debuted for the 1987 model year. Unlike other pickups {{of the time that}} used <b>C-channel</b> frames, the Comanche's frame design (called a [...] "Uniframe" [...] by Jeep) under the cargo bed was fully boxed, with a large X structure centered over the rear axle. For strength, the rails were over eight inches deep (top to bottom), much deeper than conventional midsize truck frames (1983 Jeep J-10 full-size truck frame is 6.75 inches at the deepest point). This structure was pioneered by AMC for the 1971 [...] "Cowboy" [...] compact pickup prototype.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 for the 1998 model year, the Ranger got a major {{update to}} the same body design, by giving it a longer {{wheelbase}} and a 3 in longer cab for the regular cab models (part of which provided more room in the interior). The automatic transmissions on extended cab models returned {{for the first time}} since 1989. The 1995 to 1997 model year interior look was retained. The Twin I-Beam front suspension was replaced by the wishbone-style system found on the Explorer and the front half of the frame was of [...] "boxed", rather than <b>C-channel</b> construction. Rack and pinion steering was also added. The four-cylinder engine was increased to a 2.5-liter SOHC I4, giving it a 6% increase in power over the old 2.3-liter. It produced [...] and 149 lbft Nm of torque. Also, for the 2000 model year, amber rear turn signals were discontinued. 4x4 models were equipped with a PVH lockout system for the front axles. This system proved to be rather unreliable and was changed to a live axle setup in mid-2000.|$|E

30|$|It is {{observed}} that the shear connectors damaged {{in the mode of}} both Group E and Group F specimens were all pure shear failure of self-drilling screws, the fracture of screws occurred on contact surfaces between <b>C-Channels</b> and shear connectors. This means very little end slip between shear connectors and the foam concrete while they stayed in the position when the failure occurred.|$|R
30|$|After the {{self-drilling}} screws fractures, the shear connectors failed. However, {{screw caps}} of Group E and screw stems of Group F were still {{embedded in the}} concrete and they kept sliding along with the <b>C-Channels.</b> The parts of these screws were like minor shear connectors until they were secondly cut. This is why the data of specimens with shear connectors is more irregular than it of Group C during this process.|$|R

30|$|Mode 1 A is {{the most}} typical failure mode of foam {{concrete}} with <b>C-Channel</b> embedment, such as the specimens of Group C. This involves bond failure at the interface between the steel and foam concrete on the outside perimeter, {{but not on the}} inside perimeter of the <b>C-Channel.</b> In developing a mechanism of failure in Mode 1 A, failure occurs in the foam concrete between the steel flanges because of the brittleness and low strength of foam concrete. Meanwhile, the shear connectors of Group E and F have been completely destroyed in the process of loading. From above analysis, the shear capacity is provided by connector changes at each stage during the loading. But the maximum shear force that a shear connector can bear is reached before the moment that failure of the shear connectors is occurring.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCold-formed <b>C-channel</b> steel purlins {{are widely}} used in {{construction}} industry. Since {{the cost of the}} steel is the main consideration in design, the concept of introducing web opening has been applied in the construction. A numerical study was undertaken to investigate the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of cold-formed <b>C-channel</b> purlin with web opening. For this purpose a finite element model was developed using LUSAS software. It was then used in a detailed parametric study to simulate the lateral-torsional buckling and capacity of cold-formed steel purlins under varying perforated conditions. Five different shapes of opening were established to investigate the shape that gives the least reduction in buckling moment. Opening in the form of C-hexagon opening shape was used to develop models with different edge distance, different numbers of openings, different opening spacing and also different size of openings. For 3 m span, 0. 5 D opening size, where D is 175 mm, 750 mm edge distance with a total number of 13 openings with spacing 125 mm is found to reduce buckling moment by 3. 56 % {{but at the same time}} reducing the volume of the section by 5. 16 %. For the same span, edge distance, number of openings and spacing with 0. 75 D opening size, buckling moment reduced significantly by 9. 16 % while volume reduction by 11. 61 %. For all different size of openings, spacing and edge distance, the deformation pattern are similar. In conclusion, perforation do affects the buckling moment capacity of the <b>C-channel</b> purlin...|$|E

30|$|The {{applied load}} was {{primarily}} resisted by the chemical bonding {{force and the}} shear connectors were not damaged, the full shear interaction between the foam concrete {{and they could be}} the <b>C-Channels</b> can be presumed. The presence of the connectors increased the shear interaction between the steel and the foam concrete. Thus, the specimens with connectors can resist more load than those of Group C in this process. Its specific performance is that the ordinates of the A points in Group E and F are slightly larger than that in Group C.|$|R
