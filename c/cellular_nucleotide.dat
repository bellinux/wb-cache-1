50|$|NDPK usually consumes ATP, {{the most}} {{abundant}} <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide,</b> and stores the nucleotides. However, consumption of ATP would definitely influence the cellular energy balance, which brings upon the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as the energy sensor and regulates ATP pathways by turning the generating pathways or not. Because of such activity, AMPK could directly inhibit NDPK through phosphorylation. To be more specific, NDPK supports the production of nucleotides in high-energy and low-stress cellular states. However, this can only happen when AMPK is inactivated because low-stress cellular states of ATP triggers the activation of AMPK, which eventually decreases NDPK activity by phosphorylating serine residues.|$|E

Three compounds (strep-tovadienal C, prestreptovarone, and streptoval Fc) preferentially inhibited TdT and HSV-DP over the other enzymes. These compounds inhibited HSV-DP more potently than they inhibited TdT. Evidence indicated that the mode of inhibition of TdT and HSV-DP by streptovadienal C and prestreptovarone was by interaction with the enzymes and not with template-primer, initiator, substrates, or divalent cations required for enzyme activity. Furthermore, data suggested that these compounds bind with greater affinity to HSV-DP than to TdT. Streptovadienal C and prestreptovarone were examined for their effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 in African green monkey kidney (CV 1) cells. These compounds produced 2 - and 3 -log drops in virus titer, respectively, at concentrations not significantly affecting cell viability. This correlated with evidence indicating a greater binding affinity of these compounds for HSV-DP over <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymerases...|$|E

40|$|AppppA and the DnaK protein {{have both}} been {{hypothesized}} to function in regulating the heat shock response of Escherichia coli. The proposals are that AppppA serves as a signal (alarmone) {{to turn on the}} heat shock response, whereas the DnaK protein is necessary to turn off the heat shock response. A simple model would be that the DnaK protein turns off the response by degrading AppppA. We disproved this model by demonstrating that the DnaK protein possesses a 5 '-nucleotidase activity capable of degrading many <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotides</b> but not AppppA. Although AppppA was not a substrate, it did inhibit the 5 '-nucleotidase activity of the DnaK protein. This inhibition may be specific and have biological function since the mutant DnaK 756 protein, which is defective in turning off the heat shock response, is partially desensitized to AppppA inhibition. These findings led us to consider other possible mechanisms for AppppA and the DnaK protein in heat shock regulation...|$|R

40|$|Cells use {{strategic}} metabolites {{to sense}} the metabolome and accordingly modulate gene expression. Here, we show that the purine and phosphate pathways are positively regulated by the metabolic intermediate AICAR (5 ′-phosphoribosyl- 5 -amino- 4 -imidazole carboxamide). The transcription factor Pho 2 p is required for up-regulation of all AICAR-responsive genes. Accordingly, the binding of Pho 2 p to purine and phosphate pathway gene promoters is enhanced upon AICAR accumulation. In vitro, AICAR binds both Pho 2 p and Pho 4 p transcription factors and stimulates the interaction between Pho 2 p and either Bas 1 p or Pho 4 p in vivo. In contrast, SAICAR (succinyl-AICAR) only affects Pho 2 p–Bas 1 p interaction and specifically up-regulates purine regulon genes. Together, our data show that Bas 1 p and Pho 4 p compete for Pho 2 p binding, hence leading to the concerted regulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> synthesis and phosphate consumption...|$|E

Under the reaction conditions specified in this report, the initial rate of hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate was directly proportional to the activity of APase in the sample extracts and consequently {{can be used as}} a sensitive measure of APase activity. A method was devised for obtaining reliable nucleotide measurements in naturally occurring microbial populations containing elevated levels of APase activity. The metabolic significance of APase activity in microbial cells is discussed, and it is concluded that the occurrence and regulation of APase in nature is dependent upon microscale inorganic phosphate limitation of the autochthonous microbial communities...|$|R

40|$|Changes of {{intracellular}} nucleotide {{levels and}} their stimulatory effects on curdlan synthesis in Agrobacterium species were investigated under different culture conditions. Under nitrogen-limited conditions where curdlan synthesis was stimulated, intracellular levels of UMP were {{as high as}} 87 and those of AMP were 78 nmol/mg of cellular protein, while those under nitrogen- sufficient conditions were lower than 45 nmol/mg-protein. The levels of other nucleotides such as UDP, UTP, UDP-glucose, ADP, ATP, and ADP-glucose were lower than 30 nmol/mg-protein under both nitrogen-limited and sufficient conditions. The time profiles of curdlan synthesis and <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> levels showed that curdlan synthesis had a positive relationship with intracellular levels of UMP and AMP. After the ammonium concentration in the medium fell below 0. 1 g/L, intracellular levels of UMP and AMP increased, followed by curdlan synthesis. However, no {{significant changes in the}} specific activities of UMP kinase, UDP kinase, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase were observed during cultivation. In vitro enzyme reactions for the synthesis of UDP-glucose, which serve as a precursor for curdlan synthesis, demonstrated that the synthesis of UDP-glucose increased with the increase of UMP concentration. In contrast, AMP had no effect on UDP-glucose synthesis at all. Addition of UMP in the medium increased the curdlan synthesis, whereas curdlan synthesis was inhibited in the presence of AMP. From these results, we concluded that only the higher intracellular UMP levels caused by nitrogen limitation in the medium enhance the metabolic flux of curdlan synthesis by promoting cellular UDP-glucose synthesis. The changes of intracellular nucleotide levels and their stimulating effects on curdlan synthesis in Agrobacterium species were investigated under different culture conditions. Under N-limited conditions, the intracellular levels of UMP and AMP were as high as 87 nmol/mg and 78 nmol/mg of the cellular protein, respectively.

40|$|Chloroplasts are {{the central}} nodes of the {{metabolic}} network in leaf cells of higher plants, and {{the conversion of}} proplastids into chloroplasts is tightly coupled to leaf development. During early leaf development, the structure and function of the chloroplasts differ greatly from those in a mature leaf, suggesting {{the existence of a}} stage-specific mechanism regulating chloroplast development during this period. Here, we discuss the identification of the genes affected in low temperature-conditional mutants of rice (Oryza sativa). These genes encode factors involved in chloroplast rRNA regulation (NUS 1), and nucleotide metabolism in mitochondria, chloroplasts and cytosol (V 2, V 3, ST 1). These genes are all preferentially expressed in the early leaf developmental stage P 4, and depleting them causes altered chloroplast transcription and translation, and ultimately leaf chlorosis. Therefore, it is suggested that regulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> pools and nucleotide metabolism is indispensable for chloroplast development under low temperatures at this stage.

Evidence is presented here for a tonoplast localization of ENT 1 based on proteome data and Western blot analyses. Increased export of adenosine from reconstituted tonoplast preparations from 35 S:ENT 1 mutants compared with those from the wild type and ENT 1 -RNAi mutants support this view. Furthermore, increased vacuolar adenosine and vacuolar 2 ′ 3 ′-cAMP (an intermediate of RNA catabolism) contents in ENT 1 -RNAi mutants, but decreased contents of these metabolites in 35 S:ENT 1 over-expresser mutants, were observed. An up-regulation of the salvage pathway was detected in the latter mutants, leading to the conclusion that draining the vacuolar adenosine storage by ENT 1 over-expression interferes with <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> metabolism. As a consequence of the observed metabolic alterations 35 S:ENT 1 over-expresser mutants exhibited a smaller phenotypic appearance compared with wild-type plants.

The genetic information is also safeguarded by DNA damage recognition and repair processes. Uracil {{is one of the}} most frequently occurring erroneous base in DNA; it can arise from cytosine deamination or thymine-replacing incorporation. Two enzyme families are primarily involved in keeping DNA uracil-free: dUTPases that prevent thymine-replacing incorporation and uracil-DNA glycosylases that excise uracil from DNA and initiate uracil-excision repair. Both dUTPase and the most efficient uracil-DNA glycosylase UNG is thought to be ubiquitous in free-living organisms. In the present work, we have systematically investigated the genotype of deposited fully sequenced bacterial and Archaeal genomes. Surprisingly, we have found that in contrast to the generally held opinion, a wide number of bacterial and Archaeal species lack the dUTPase gene(s). The dut- genotype is present in diverse bacterial phyla indicating that loss of this (or these) gene(s) has occurred multiple times during evolution. We have identified several survival strategies in lack of dUTPases: i) simultaneous lack or inhibition of UNG, ii) acquisition of a less dUTP-specific sanitizing nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and iii) supply of dUTPase from bacteriophages.

Previous studies have established its binding protein and the most distal effector of its growth arrest activity as methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP- 2) and p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1, respectively. However, the mechanistic steps between these two effectors have not been identified. We have found that addition of exogenous guanine and guanine-containing nucleosides to culture medium will completely reverse the cytostatic effect of TNP- 470 on both cultured bovine aortic and mouse pulmonary endothelial cells. Western blotting showed that supplementation with exogenous guanosine reverses the induction of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 by TNP- 470. This “rescue” by guanine/guanosine was abolished when the guanine salvage pathway of nucleotide biosynthesis was inhibited with Immucillin H, suggesting that TNP- 470 might reduce de novo guanine synthesis in endothelial cells. However, an analysis of inosine 5 ′-monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine synthesis and target of the antiangiogenic drug mycophenolic acid, showed no TNP- 470 -induced changes. Curiously, quantitation of <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotides</b> confirmed that GTP levels were not reduced after TNP- 470 treatment. Addition of guanosine {{at the start of}} G 1 phase causes a doubling in GTP levels that persists to the G 1 /S phase transition, where commitment to TNP- 470 growth arrest occurs.

This {{is the second}} GGDEF-EAL-encoding locus determined {{to be involved in}} the regulation of swarming: the first was previously characterized and named scrABC (for “swarming and capsular polysaccharide regulation”). GGDEF and EAL domain-containing proteins participate in the synthesis and degradation of the nucleotide signal cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in many bacteria. Overexpression of scrG was sufficient to induce lateral flagellar gene expression in liquid, decrease biofilm formation, decrease cps gene expression, and suppress the ΔscrABC phenotype. Removal of its EAL domain reversed ScrG activity, converting ScrG to an inhibitor of swarming and activator of cps expression. Overexpression of scrG decreased the intensity of a 32 P-labeled nucleotide spot comigrating with c-di-GMP standard, whereas overexpression of scrGΔEAL enhanced the intensity of the spot. Mutants with defects in scrG showed altered swarming and lateral flagellin production and colony morphology (but not swimming motility); furthermore, mutation of two GGDEF-EAL-encoding loci (scrG and scrABC) produced cumulative effects on swarming, lateral flagellar gene expression, lateral flagellin production and colony morphology. Mutant analysis supports the assignment of the primary in vivo activity of ScrG to acting as a phosphodiesterase.

In both cases the rate of hexose transport was not modified until ATP had dropped to 70 % of its initial value; then it decreased with the cellular ATP level.

Our results are consistent with an inhibition of H+-ATPase activity in anoxia by the high levels of cellular ADP and AMP, and provide in vivo evidence that sugar uptake is dependent upon the proton motive force rather than cellular ATP concentration.

40|$|Treatment with {{colchicine}} or vinblastine, both inhibitors of microtubule assembly, renders quiescent 3 T 3 {{cells in}} an "activated state" {{as evidenced by}} induction of DNA synthesis and other criteria. Microtubule disassembly caused by colchicine or vinblastine brings about a dramatic expansion of total cellular UTP pools with a concomitant diminution in total cellular ATP pools, thus resulting in a marked imbalance in total <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> pools. Colchicine and vinblastine also stimulate total cellular RNA synthesis without enhancing uridine phosphorylation, suggesting that these drugs affect the G 1 phase of the cell cycle at a point beyond the enhancement of uridine phosphorylation that usually accompanies mitogenic stimulation of quiescent mammalian cells. The markedly expanded cellular UTP pools appear to be necessary for initiation of the colchicine-stimulated DNA synthesis because decreasing cellular UTP pools by addition of D-glucosamine results in a selective inhibition of DNA synthesis in the colchicine-stimulated, but not control, cells. Furthermore, D-glucosamine exerts its inhibitory effect only when it {{is present in the}} cultures within the first 14 hr after colchicine treatment. When added at 21 hr, D-glucosamine still decreases cellular UTP pools, but it is no longer inhibitory for DNA synthesis, which commences 14 - 16 hr after colchicine stimulation. Taxol, an antitumor drug, prevents microtubule disassembly and also blocks such events as expansion of total cellular UTP pools and stimulation of RNA and DNA synthesis, indicating that microtubule depolymerization acts as a primary event initiating the process of cell activation induced by colchicine...|$|E
40|$|Lethal {{mutagenesis}} is {{the mechanism}} of action of ribavirin against poliovirus (PV) and numerous other RNA viruses. However, there is still considerable debate regarding {{the mechanism of}} action of ribavirin against a variety of RNA viruses. Here we show by using T 7 RNA polymerase mediated production of PV genomic RNA, PV polymerase-catalyzed primer extension and cell-free PV synthesis that a pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphate analogue (rPTP) with ambiguous basepairing capacity is an efficient mutagen of the PV genome. The in vitro incorporation properties of rPTP are superior to ribavirin triphosphate. We observed a log-linear relationship between virus titer reduction {{and the number of}} rPMP molecules incorporated. A PV genome encoding a high-fidelity polymerase was more sensitive to rPMP incorporation, consistent with diminished mutational robustness of high-fidelity PV. The nucleoside (rP) did not exhibit antiviral activity in cell culture owing to the inability of rP to be converted to rPMP by <b>cellular</b> <b>nucleotide</b> kinases. rP was also a poor substrate for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase. The block to nucleoside phosphorylation could be bypassed by treatment with the P nucleobase, which exhibited both antiviral activity and mutagenesis, presumably a reflection of rP nucleotide formation by a nucleotide salvage pathway. These studies provide additional support for lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy, suggest that rPMP prodrugs may be highly efficacious antiviral agents, and provide a new tool to determine the sensitivity of RNA virus genomes to mutagenesis as well as interrogation of the impact of mutational load on the population dynamics of these viruses...|$|E

The concept of a purinergic signalling system was first proposed by Professor Geoffrey Burnstock over 30 years ago. This includes the cellular responses to purine nucleotides, such as ATP, and nucleosides, such as adenosine, that act as extracellular messengers playing a role through specific nucleotide and adenosine receptors in all systems. Indeed, {{in addition to their}} role in <b>cellular</b> metabolism, <b>nucleotides</b> as well as nucleosides are extracellular mediators that activate biological responses in all cells. Cells subjected to activation or shear or mechanical stress release nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP in large amounts. All cells can release nucleotides in a controlled fashion [1]. The mechanisms of nucleotide release have been the focus of intense researc...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is a {{critical}} regulator of energy balance at both the cellular and whole-body levels. Two upstream kinases {{have been reported to}} activate AMPK in cell-free assays, i. e., the tumor suppressor LKB 1 and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. However, evidence that this is physiologically relevant currently only exists for LKB 1. We now report that there is a significant basal activity and phosphorylation of AMPK in LKB 1 -deficient cells that can be stimulated by Ca 2 + ionophores, and studies using the CaMKK inhibitor STO- 609 and isoform-specific siRNAs show that CaMKKβ is required for this effect. CaMKKβ also activates AMPK much more rapidly than CaMKKα in cell-free assays. K+-induced depolarization in rat cerebrocortical slices, which increases intracellular Ca 2 + without disturbing <b>cellular</b> adenine <b>nucleotide</b> levels, activates AMPK, and this is blocked by STO- 609. Our results suggest a potential Ca 2 +-dependent neuroprotective pathway involving phosphorylation and activation of AMPK by CaMKKβ...|$|R
