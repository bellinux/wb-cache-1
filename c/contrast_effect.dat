40|$|Although {{many studies}} {{focus on the}} how <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> can impact {{cognitive}} evaluations, {{the question of whether}} emotions are regulated by such <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> is still the subject of considerable debate, especially in the study of loss-related decisions. To address this gap in the literature, we designed three decision making loss conditions: (i) both losses are trivial (TT), (ii) one loss is trivial and the other loss is vital (TV), or (iii) one loss is trivial and the other loss is routine (TR). In study 1, which compared the difference between the negative emotion ratings in TT and TV, we found that negative emotions were affected by the <b>contrast</b> <b>effects.</b> In study 2, which compared the difference between the importance of trivial options in TT and TV, we found that the <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> differentially changed the importance of trivial options in the two conditions, which in turn down-regulated negative emotions. In study 3, the impact of decision difficulty was controlled by predetermining the items to be lost. In this study, we found that, when comparing the differences between the negative emotions of losing trivial options in TV and TR, the <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> still modulated the loss-related emotions. We concluded that the <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> could down-regulate emotions.

50|$|The Chubb {{illusion}} {{is similar}} to another visual illusion, the <b>contrast</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>contrast</b> <b>effect</b> is an illusion in which the perceived brightness or luminance of an identical central visual target form on a larger uniform background varies to the test subject depending on {{the ratio of the}} central form's luminance to that of its background. This illusion, simultaneous contrast, is illustrated in Figure 2. In it, the central target is brighter. I.e., the ratio of the top central rectangle’s luminance (A) to its background field's luminance is greater than one. In the bottom rectangle (B), the background field is brighter. That is, the ratio is less than one. Although the two central target patches are equally bright (identical in luminance) the one on a dark background appears lighter and the one on a lighter background appears darker.|$|E

40|$|Context {{effects are}} a robust finding in {{psychology}} and are {{manifested in the}} form of assimilation <b>effects</b> and <b>contrast</b> <b>effects.</b> Assimilation effects occur when judgments of a target stimulus are biased toward the level of non-target, context stimuli. <b>Contrast</b> <b>effects</b> occur when judgments of a target stimulus are biased in the opposite direction of non-target context stimuli and are much more prevalent than assimilation effects. Limited research has been conducted on <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> in the area of industrial/organizational psychology and no study has yet examined <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> when target and non-target stimuli are observed simultaneously. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> in a group interaction setting (a leaderless group discussion (LGD) exercise of an assessment center) where all stimuli were observed simultaneously. Two factors were manipulated: the performance level of non-target stimuli (above standard and/or below standard candidates) and observation condition of the target stimulus (a standard candidate). In addition, the order in which the standard candidate was rated was counterbalanced. It was hypothesized that (1) <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> would occur in the LGD. One hundred, eighty-seven undergraduates were trained as raters and then viewed a videotape of a leaderless group discussion exercise in which a standard candidate was interacting either with two above standard candidates, two below standard candidates, or an above standard and a below standard candidate. Each videotape contained the same footage of the standard candidate; consequently, her performance was identical across conditions. Participants were assigned to observe one of the three candidates (the target candidate or one of the non-target candidates). During the rating session when the assessors discussed the performance of the candidates, performance of the standard candidate was discussed in either the first, second or third position. Individual ratings and consensus ratings were collected and analyzed. At the individual rating level, <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> were present in leaderless group discussion exercise ratings. Specifically, the standard candidate was rated significantly higher when performing with below standard candidates than with above standard candidates. The observation assignment had no significant influence on the magnitude of contrast effects; however, a leniency effect occurred for those assessors who were assigned to observe the standard candidate. <b>Contrast</b> <b>effects</b> were not present in the raters' consensus ratings.

The same accessible information can result in assimilation or <b>contrast</b> <b>effects,</b> depending on how it is categorized.

5000|$|The <b>contrast</b> <b>effect</b> {{was noted}} by the seventeenth century philosopher John Locke, who {{observed}} that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold, {{depending on whether the}} hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water. In the early twentieth century, Wilhelm Wundt identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas. Contrast effects can shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including the perception of weight. One experiment found that thinking of the name [...] "Hitler" [...] led to subjects rating a person as more friendly. Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was unpleasant or pleasant. For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem to shrink when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building.Furthermore, the <b>contrast</b> <b>effect</b> has been argued to apply to foreign policies of states.

40|$|Spectral <b>contrast</b> <b>effects</b> are context-dependent {{effects that}} {{influence}} the way we perceive certain sounds.

Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category substitute) than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category substitute). This preference for within-category substitutes appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category substitutes are more similar to the missing good, their inferiority to it is more noticeable.

50|$|Critics of {{this theory}} claim it is {{dependent}} on complex social context (which {{is responsible for the}} creation of dissonance), but research has shown the same effects in children (who understand less about social context and therefore {{are less likely to be}} influenced by it) and even in pigeons. Alessandri, Darcheville & Zentall (2008) argue that the cause for these findings, both in humans and animals, is the <b>contrast</b> <b>effect.</b> According to this theory, the preference is a result of the difference between the reward and the situation that leads to it. When the preliminary situation is unpleasant or strenuous, the difference between it and the reward that follows is great. When the preliminary situation is not especially unpleasant or strenuous, the difference between it and the reward is smaller. The reward that has the larger difference from its preliminary situation will be preferred since it is experienced as more positive.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{contrast}} {{refers to}} a change in the strength of one response that occurs when the rate of reward of a second response, or of the first response under different conditions, is changed.

Then suddenly pecking the key when it is green brings food less frequently. Positive contrast is seen when the rate of response to the red key goes up, even though the frequency of reward in red remains unchanged. Likewise, increasing the reward to green tends to reduce the response rate to red (negative contrast). This sort of <b>contrast</b> <b>effect</b> may occur following changes in the amount, frequency, or nature of the reward, and it has been shown to occur with various experimental designs and response measures (e.g. response rate, running speed).|$|E
