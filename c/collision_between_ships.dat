Ship accidents are generally caused by a several cases, such as human error, natural disaster, technical errors, missed communication, poor condition of the ship, and many more. Ship wreckage have huge impact for ship navigation, environment, economics, and others. Those impact have many disadvantages for the shipowners, and also for environment. For examples the fuel spills that pollute the environment, make disturbance to sailing ship because the track for those navigation is blocked by the ship wreck and their cargo especially on shallow location (< 50 m). These research will discuss the effect the container when it is floats on the sea and its interference other ships. The main objective {{of this study is}} to present a risk assessment on the environmental impact of the wreck and container cargo. Wrecks on the seabed is likely to pose a risk to passing ships. container and its contents as well as the possibility of refloat, and also their environmental risks emanating from the wreck and container cargo, such as fuels, lubricants, and chemical cargo. Variations scenario is a <b>collision</b> <b>between</b> <b>ships</b> that pass by floating containers. The frequency of refloating container, and the consequences of the passing ship depends on several factors, which will be the subject of research. However, because of the frequency of refloating containers is unlikely, then the risk is low and does not pose a danger to navigation. These risk assessment using risk matrix 5 x 5 which is the combined value of the frequency and consequences of the incident.

First it gives a background in ship collision analysis, different techniques are discussed,and emphasis {{is given to the}} decoupling of the ship collision problem. Secondly itassesses the rules that come into account when introducing LNG fuel tanks in a cargoship, rules regarding modelling of ship structures as well as expected rule development. An introduction to the existing methods for estimation of energy involved in shipcollisions is given. The different structural components of a ship section are discussed,and applicable analytical formulae as well as an analytical method for determining theforce indentation curves for a full ship section are reviewed. Special structural elementsof core type are briefly discussed. A parametrical model of a ship side section capable of modelling different configurationsfor the structural layout is developed. This model is used for collision analysis by meansof LS-DYNA, where displacement controlled impact with a rigid and simple cone shapeindenter is driven into the side section at a right angle. The simulations are uncoupled. They are verified by means of convergence and sensitivity testing. Variables whichshould be given close attention enclose failure strain of the material and the staticfriction coefficient. The model is compared to analytical solutions, showing agreement toa certain degree. For comparative studies the model is given confidence. The model is used for a comparative study where the aim is to assess the reduction insafe distance for a gas tank, by taking into account the effect of ice strengthening. In thiscase study it is concluded that the fuel tanks could be moved 1. 37 metres or 1. 45 metrescloser to the ship side for two different implementations of ice class. Structuralparameters are studied. The main conclusions are that an increase of the outer skinthickness or the introduction of an extra stringer gives good results. For concurrentincrease the thicknesses in webframes, stringers and outer skin give good results. Acomparison table is developed, and a comparison ratio is presented for eachparametrical variation.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} risk of ship {{collisions}} in the Barents Sea in 2030 between three future scenarios; Minimum, Basis and Maximum Scenario. IWRAP Mk 2 program is utilized to make the calculations. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data of 2013 is used to parameterize current traffic density, while the increased traffic in the different scenarios is derived from an analysis of multiple sources, including Rystad Petro Foresight, government documents and reports from DNV. The petroleum production in the North Sea is expected to decline, while exploration and production in the Northern part Norway is expected to increase. This will lead to that the Barents Sea {{will be a major}} contributor to oil and gas production, instead of the North Sea and the southern Norwegian Sea towards the end of 2030 s. The petroleum industry is on its way north to an area that earlier mainly has been associated with high fishing activity, but may now be more dominated by larger supply vessels. This change will cause an increase in ship traffic in the area, and the probability of ship collisions may therefore be elevated. The issues discussed in this report are important for the industry, and necessary for predicting the future risk picture in the Barents Sea. It is vital to idenfity the future risk of ship collision with regards to the increase in ship traffic due to the potential consequences with respect to the harsh and vulnerable environment and lack of infrastructure {{in the northern part of}} Norway. This thesis will investigate how the probability of ship collision change, and also identify {{the risk of}} ship collisions in the Barents Sea within the different scenarios of petroleum development. There are five types of <b>collision</b> <b>between</b> <b>ships</b> which are taken into account in this thesis, these are; Head on collsion, crossing collsion, overtaking collsion, bend collision and merge collsion. The thesis will answer the research problems regarding to how the environmental conditions in the Barents Sea are, how the increased offshore-related traffic increase the probability of ship collision in the Barents Sea in 2030, and how the risk of ship collisions change between the three scenarios. The results show that there will be significantly differens in the likelihood for ship collisions in the three scenarios. The total likelihood for minimum scenario is 5, 80 E- 04 incidents/year, while the likelihood in basis and maximum scenario is calculated to 1, 8 E- 03 and 1, 75 E- 03. The final leg into `Polarbase` (Hammerfest) is the leg in all scenarios that will have the greatest likelihood for ship collisions, and will also be the most critical leg with respect to the high density of ships in it, despite its short length. The ship type that will be the biggest contributer to ship collisions is both support ships and crude oil tankers, these collisions will be by type; head on collision and overtaking collision. A critical situation will occur in the Barents Sea if a ship collision takes place, and especially collisions with crude oil tankers with its chemicals. This will put great demand on the oil spill management in the region...|$|E
