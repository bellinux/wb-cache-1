In pancreatic beta-cells, intracellular insulin stores in beta-granules are mostly upheld by efficiently up- regulating proinsulin biosynthesis at the translational level to rapidly replenish the insulin lost via exocytosis. Under normal circumstances, intracellular degradation of insulin plays a relatively minor janitorial role in retiring aged beta-granules, apparently via crinophagy. However, this mechanism alone {{is not sufficient to}} maintain optimal insulin storage in beta-cells when insulin secretion is dysfunctional. Here, we show that despite an abnormal imbalance of glucose/glucagon- like peptide 1 regulated insulin production over secretion in Rab 3 A(-/-) mice compared with control animals, insulin storage levels were maintained due to increased intracellular beta- granule degradation.

40|$|Plants {{continuously}} {{generate new}} organs {{through the activity}} of populations of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in highly ordered, spiralled, or whorled patterns via a process called phyllotaxis. It is commonly accepted that the active transport of the plant hormone auxin {{plays a major role}} in this process. Current hypotheses propose that <b>cellular</b> <b>hormone</b> transporters of the PIN family would create local auxin maxima at precise positions, which in turn would lead to organ initiation. To explain how auxin transporters could create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant, different concepts have been proposed. A major hypothesis, canalization, proposes that the auxin transporters act by amplifying and stabilizing existing fluxes, which could be initiated, for example, by local diffusion. This convincingly explains the organised auxin fluxes during vein formation, but for the shoot apical meristem a second hypothesis was proposed, where the hormone would be systematically transported towards the areas with the highest concentrations. This implies the coexistence of two radically different mechanisms for PIN allocation in the membrane, one based on flux sensing and the other on local concentration sensing. Because these patterning processes require the interaction of hundreds of cells, it is impossible to estimate on a purely intuitive basis if a particular scenario is plausible or not. Therefore, computational modelling provides a powerful means to test this type of complex hypothesis.

This study aims to further identify the biological roles of E. faecium by characterizing the hepatic proteomic changes of broilers (Gallus gallus) fed E. faecium using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Results: Thirty-three proteins (50 protein spots) involved in nutrient metabolism, immunity and the antioxidant system were shown to be differentially expressed in the liver of broilers fed E. faecium than from birds not fed the probiotic. The biological processes of sulphur amino acids, vitamin and <b>cellular</b> <b>hormone</b> metabolism, sulphur compound biosynthesis and protein tetramerization were enhanced in the liver of broilers fed E. faecium.

B cells which had attached to Petri dishes during a culture period of four days were well preserved at the ultrastructural level, with mitochondria clustered at the cell face attached to the Petri dish and secretory granules concentrated towards {{the portion of the}} cell facing the medium. Since {{it was not possible to}} estimate <b>cellular</b> <b>hormone</b> content or hormone release as a function of the number of specific types of cells, fractional rates of release and hormone content ratios were compared with those for intact islets maintained in culture in parallel.

In contrast to the lack of responsiveness seen with freshly dispersed islet cells, the cultured cells released insulin in response to glucose and glucose plus IBMX in a fashion comparable to that seen with cultured islets.

Total thyroxine (TT 4) and FT 4 were measured at 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours post-dosing. Microsomal ethoxy- and pentoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase (EROD and PROD) activity and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) activity were determined. No significant increase in TT 4 or FT 4 concentrations was seen at any time point. PCB 153 significantly decreased TT 4 and FT 4 in young and adult rats, with young rats showing a time-by-treatment interaction from 2 to 48 hours post-dosing in serum FT 4. With PCB 169 exposure, young rats showed a decrease in FT 4 only, whereas adult rats showed decreases in TT 4 only. Hepatic EROD and PROD activities were both dramatically increased fol-lowing PCB 169 and 153, respectively.

Inflammation-induced D 2 expression was confirmed in macrophages, in conjunction with selective thyroid hormone transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 10) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha 1 stimulation, and was absent in hepatocytes. Moreover, D 2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a clear attenuation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced IL- 1 beta and GM-CSF expression, in addition to aberrant phagocytosis. Locally produced T- 3, acting via the TR alpha, may be instrumental in this novel inflammatory response, because LPS-treated TR alpha(0 / 0) mice showed a markedly decreased LPS-induced GM-CSF mRNA expression.

AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) regulates energy homeostasis and is activated by <b>cellular</b> stress, <b>hormones</b> and the widely prescribed type 2 diabetes drug metformin 1, 2. Ampk phosphorylates mouse acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc 1; refs. 3, 4) at Ser 79 and Acc 2 at Ser 212, inhibiting the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The latter metabolite is a precursor in fatty acid synthesis 5 and an allosteric inhibitor of fatty acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation 6. To test the physiological impact of these phosphorylation events, we generated mice with alanine knock-in mutations in both Acc 1 (at Ser 79) and Acc 2 (at Ser 212) (Acc double knock-in, AccDKI). Compared to wild-type mice, these mice have elevated lipogenesis and lower fatty acid oxidation, which contribute to the progression of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and NAFLD, but not obesity. Notably, AccDKI mice made obese by high-fat feeding are refractory to the lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin. These findings establish that inhibitory phosphorylation of Acc by Ampk is essential for the control of lipid metabolism and, in the setting of obesity, for metformin-induced improvements in insulin action...|$|R

Incubation with EPO at a doses of 400 U/ml exerted a protective effect on cell death assessed by LDH release and Annexin V FACS analysis. This was paralleled by up-regulation of SGK 1 expression, as well as phosphorylation. Downregulation of SGK 1 expression by small interfering RNA technique ameliorated the anti-apoptotic effect of EPO treatment. In an in vivo rat model of unilateral renal I/R injury, rats were treated with 500 U/kg EPO 24 h prior to ischemia. EPO resulted in less severe tissue injury and ameliorated the elevation in creatinine and urea nitrogen levels 24 h after reperfusion.

Baseline reference values were obtained from 10 bone age- matched healthy girls. Basal GH-BP activity, IGF-I, and IGFBP levels were similar in patients and controls. Four h after the intramuscular injection, GH-BP activity maximally increased and returned to baseline 6 - 7 h later; during long-term r-hGH administration GH-BP activity peaked at + 180 d but declined to pretreatment at + 360 d.

It is activated by increases in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio caused by metabolic stresses that either interfere with ATP production (eg, deprivation for glucose or oxygen) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg, muscle contraction). Activation in response to increases in AMP involves phosphorylation by an upstream kinase, the tumor suppressor LKB 1. In certain cells (eg, neurones, endothelial cells, and lymphocytes), AMPK can also be activated by a Ca 2 -dependent and AMP-independent process involving phosphorylation by an alternate upstream kinase, CaMKK. Once activated, AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP, while switching off ATP-consuming processes such as biosynthesis and cell growth and proliferation. The AMPK complex contains 3 subunits, with the subunit being catalytic, the subunit containing a glycogen-sensing domain, and the subunits containing 2 regulatory sites that bind the activating and inhibitory nucleotides AMP and ATP. Although it may have evolved to respond to metabolic stress at the <b>cellular</b> level, <b>hormones</b> and cytokines such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin can interact with the system, and it now appears to {{play a key role}} in maintaining energy balance at the whole body level. The AMPK system may be partly responsible for the health benefits of exercise and is the target for the antidiabetic drug metformin. It is a key player in the development of new treatments for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. (Circ Res. 2007; 100 : 328 - 341.)

40|$|Abstract The mammary {{epithelium}} {{is a highly}} heterogenous and dynamic tissue that includes a range of cell types with varying levels of proliferative capacity and differentiation po-tential, from stem to committed progenitor and mature cells. Generation of mature cells through expansion and specifica-tion of immature precursors is driven by hormonal and local stimuli. Intriguingly, although circulating hormones can be directly sensed only by a subset of mammary cells, they also regulate the behaviour of cells lacking their cognate receptors through paracrine mechanisms. Thus, mapping the hormonal signalling network on to the emerging mammary cell hierar-chy {{appears to be a}} difficult task. Nevertheless, a first step towards a better understanding is the characterization of the hormone receptor expression pattern across individual cell types in the {{mammary epithelium}}. Here we review the most relevant findings on the <b>cellular</b> distribution of <b>hormone</b> re-ceptors in the mammary gland, taking into account differences between mice and humans, the methods employed to assess receptor expression as well as the variety of approaches used to resolve the mammary cell heterogeneity...|$|R
