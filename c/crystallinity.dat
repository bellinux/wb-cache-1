25|$|The diverse {{material}} behavior {{of different types}} of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. Molecular weight and <b>crystallinity</b> are having the biggest impact, the <b>crystallinity</b> in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the <b>crystallinity</b> of polyethylene. The <b>crystallinity</b> is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within crystallites polyethylene has a density of 1.0nbsp&g·cm−3, in the amorphous regions of 0.86nbsp&g·cm−3. Thus, an almost linear relationship exists between density and <b>crystallinity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polymers with {{a degree}} of <b>crystallinity</b> {{approaching}} zero or one will tend to be transparent, while polymers with intermediate degrees of <b>crystallinity</b> will tend to be opaque due to light scattering by crystalline or glassy regions. Thus for many polymers, reduced <b>crystallinity</b> may also be associated with increased transparency.|$|E
40|$|Sediments of the CRP- 2 / 2 A {{drill core}} from the {{continental}} shelf of McMurdo Sound in Ross Sea, Pacific {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean, have been investigated for their clay mineral assemblages, especially for the smectite contents and smectite <b>crystallinities.</b> Highest smectite amounts and best <b>crystallinities</b> occur in three intervals below 485 mbsf in CRP- 2 / 2 A. They indicate deposition of sediments {{during a time when}} chemical weathering was active on large ice-free areas on the nearby Antarctic continent. In he upper part of the core, smectite contents are much lower and <b>crystallinities</b> are worse. This clay mineral composition indicates deposition of sediments during a time when physical weathering prevailed on an ice-covered continent. At deep-sea sites around Antarctica the shift from smectite-dominated to smectite-poor and illite-rich assemblages is well dated as earliest Oligocene, 33. 9 - 33. 1 Ma, and documents the onset of continental glaciation in East Antarctica. At CIROS- 1 a corresponding shift in the clay mineralogy was observed at a depth of 425 - 445 mbsf...|$|R

25|$|Pulp {{chemistry}} has {{a significant}} influence on nanocellulose microstructure. Carboxymethylation increases the numbers of charged groups on the fibril surfaces, making the fibrils easier to liberate and results in smaller and more uniform fibril widths (5–15nm) compared to enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose, where the fibril widths were 10–30nm. The degree of <b>crystallinity</b> and crystal structure of nanocellulose. Nanocellulose exhibits cellulose crystal I organization {{and the degree of}} <b>crystallinity</b> is unchanged by the preparation of the nanocellulose. Typical values for the degree of <b>crystallinity</b> were around 63%.|$|E
25|$|As {{electrolyte}} materials, {{the inclusion}} of MOFs seems at first counter-intuitive. Fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode. Additionally, membranes tend to have low <b>crystallinity</b> because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials. On the other hand, pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the ionic conductivity {{of the system and}} high <b>crystallinity</b> makes the design process less complex.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} steps {{is crucial for}} the <b>crystallinity,</b> {{uniformity}} and stoichiometry of the resulting film. The mostly used methods for modelling the PLD process are the Monte Carlo techniques.|$|E

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} compressive and multi-directional {{bending properties}} after hydrothermal treatment of juvenile and mature elm wood were analyzed. Wood chemical composition and X-ray diffraction {{analyses were conducted}} in order to investigate the different properties of the juvenile and mature wood. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the wood’s microstructure during longitudinal compression. The results indicated that both juvenile and mature wood could bend multi-directionally and that their relative cellulose <b>crystallinities</b> increased after hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal-treated juvenile wood contained more hemicellulose with unstable net-linked polysaccharide and condensed lignin, higher relative <b>crystallinities</b> degree than did mature wood, and more spaces formed by the extractive separation of mature wood. The longitudinal compressive and bending performances of the juvenile wood were worse than those of mature wood. The relationship between variations of stress and strain was separated into two stages, both of which displayed linear increases. However, the stage after the proportional ultimate stress increased slowly and smoothly, confirming the formation of some folds in the wood cells...|$|R
40|$|Based on DSC evidence, {{annealing}} of ethylene- 1 -octene copolymers {{results in}} a gradually increasing thermal stability of the original, metastable, crystals. SAXS and WAXD were used to monitor the structural changes involved after isothermal annealing for a fixed time at step-wise higher temperatures. A series of samples that differ in molar mass and comonomer content, ranging from 0 to 11. 8 mol % 1 -octene, were cooled at two extreme rates from 150 degrees C, i. e., a quenching into liquid nitrogen and a controlled cooling at 0. 1 degrees C per minute to room temperature. The <b>crystallinities</b> of the quenched linear polyethylenes (LPEs), being {{included in this study}} as reference materials, and of the quenched copolymer with a 1 -octene content of 2. 1 mol % are always found to be lower than the <b>crystallinities</b> of the slowly cooled samples. On the other hand, higher <b>crystallinities</b> can be found for the quenched copolymers with a higher comonomer content compared to the slowly cooled specimens. A sequence of cocrystallization and recrystallization events is proposed to explain this contraintuitive, but reproducible experimental fact. This reasoning can also account for the steeper increase of the amorphous layer thickness of the latter slowly cooled copolymers compared to the quenched samples. All copolymers show a very moderate increase of the lamellar thickness after each heating step. Besides additional crystallization and recrystallization, lateral growth of the crystals and an increase of the crystallite density can account for the gradual increase of the thermal stability of copolymer crystals during prolonged annealing. The morphological effects observed for the LPEs confirm earlier findings. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, <b>crystallinity,</b> type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of <b>crystallinity</b> and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

The solubilities of carboxymethylated biomass, alkaline lignin, klason lignin, holocellulose, and α_cellulose were measured and the <b>crystallinities</b> of α_celluloses were also measured by X-ray diffraction. The main resistance factor to solubilization in water {{is thought to}} be the density in crystalline region of cellulose which was formed during long growth cycle in perennial plants.|$|R
40|$|Amylose {{fractions}} of different peak Degree of Polymerisation (DP) (DP 20, DP 60, DP 400, DP 950) were complexed with docosanoic acid (C 22) and glyceryl monostearate (GMS) at 60 and 90 degreesC. Complexation yields, relative <b>crystallinities,</b> dissociation temperatures and enthalpies increased with amylose chain lengths (DP 20 -DP 60 -DP 400). Relative <b>crystallinities</b> and thermal stabilities of the DP 950 -complexes were {{slightly lower than}} those of the other amylose fractions, probably due to increased conformational disorders, resulting in crystal defaults. Molecular weight distributions of the complexes revealed that, irrespective to the complexation temperature, the critical DP for complex formation and precipitation was 35 and 40 for complexes with GMS and C 22, respectively, corresponding to the length needed to accommodate two GMS- or C 22 -molecules within an amylose helix. Complexation of dextrins with a well-chosen lipid, allows to separate starch derived dextrins with a predictable critical chain length as border. Dextrins, of sufficient DP will complex and precipitate, while the shorter dextrins will remain in solution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Polyethylene {{consists}} of nonpolar, saturated, {{high molecular weight}} hydrocarbons. Therefore, its chemical behavior is similar to paraffin.

40|$|Poly(styrene-graft-ethylene oxide), having alkyl chains (C- 12 or C- 18) on the {{polystyrene}} {{main chain}} {{or on the}} poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) side chains, were synthesized. The main chain was alkylated by first ionizing amide groups in a styrene/acrylamide copolymer with tert-butoxide, and then using the amide anions as sites for reactions with 1 -bromoalkanes. An excess of amide anions {{was used in the}} reaction, and the remaining anions were subsequently utilized as initiator sites for the anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide (EO). Synthesis of poly(styrene-graft-ethylene oxide) with alkylated side chains was accomplished by polymerization of EO onto the ionized styrene/acrylamide copolymer, followed by an alkylation of the terminal alkoxide anions with 1 -bromoalkanes. The alkylated graft copolymers were structurally characterized by using elemental analysis, H- 1 NMR, GPC, and IR spectroscopy. DSC analysis showed that only graft copolymers with PEO contents exceeding about 50 wt % had side chain <b>crystallinities</b> comparable to those of homo-PEO. Main chain alkylated graft copolymers generally had higher <b>crystallinities,</b> as compared to nonalkylated and side chain alkylated samples.

25|$|The <b>crystallinity</b> of the {{produced}} tungsten layers can {{be controlled}} by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which the main passivation material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3).

The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E

This idea, however, was initially met with a high degree of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, <b>crystallinity,</b> or color).|$|E
