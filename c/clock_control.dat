50|$|Humans, {{like most}} living organisms, have various {{biological}} rhythms. Circadian rhythms, {{often referred to}} as the body clock or the biological <b>clock,</b> <b>control</b> processes that re-occur daily, e.g. body temperature, alertness, and hormone secretion as well as sleep timing. Due to the circadian clock, sleepiness does not continuously increase throughout the day; a person's desire and ability to fall asleep is influenced both by the length of time since the person woke from an adequate sleep and by internal circadian rhythms. Thus, a person's body is ready for sleep and for wakefulness at relatively specific times of the day.|$|E

The FIFO buffer status portion consists of a 2 bit status channel and a clock. SPI 4.2 supports a data width of 16 bits and can be PHY-link, link-link, link-PHY or PHY-PHY connection.

50|$|Rck-2 is a {{gene that}} {{plays a major role}} in <b>clock</b> <b>control</b> of translation. Rck-2 protein is a kinase and is rhythmically {{activated}} through phosphorylation events based on the periodicity of the clock. Rck-2 activation is directly associated with the phosphorylation of eEF-2, which is an elongation factor that {{plays a major role in}} translation. Phosphorylation of eEF-2 has an inhibitory effect on the activity of translation. Rck-2 is largely studied in Neurospora crassa but has significant homology to humans. Knockout strains have been produced in the model organism N. crassa but there are no human pathologies associated with its deletion. While the basic mechanisms of circadian transcriptional control are known, little is understood about how the clock controls mRNA translation, which makes the characterization of pathways responsible for translational control all the more important.|$|E

50|$|With {{the release}} of the Radeon X1950 Pro (RV570 GPU), ATI has {{completely}} revised CrossFire's connection infrastructure to further eliminate the need for past Y-dongle/Master card and slave card configurations for CrossFire to operate. ATI's CrossFire connector is now a ribbon-like connector attached to the top of each graphics adapter, similar to nVidia's SLI bridges, but different in physical and logical natures. As such, Master Cards no longer exist, and are not required for maximum performance. Two dongles can be used per card; these were put to full use with {{the release of}} CrossFireX. Radeon HD 2900 and HD 3000 series cards use the same ribbon connectors, but the HD 3800 series of cards only require one ribbon connector, to facilitate CrossFireX.

An alternative attack on the Gollmann cascade is also described, which requires solving quadratic equations.

We also present weaknesses in the filter functions of Pomaranch by successfully computing annihilators and low degree multiples of the functions. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} on the {{cryptanalysis}} of cryptographic primitives especially stream ciphers which is an important topic in cryptography. Additionally, the security of network coding is discussed and improved with a new scheme. First, a new statistical test, called Quadratic Box-Test, is presented. It can be used to evaluate the randomness quality of the pseudorandom sequences which can be the output of a cryptographic primitive. Moreover, it {{can be used as a}} distinguisher to attack stream ciphers, block ciphers and hash functions. In the second part of the thesis, some stream ciphers are analyzed and some successful attacks are presented. A modified algebraic attack is used against some <b>clock</b> <b>controlled</b> stream ciphers. In order to have successful attacks, the modified algebraic attack is accompanied by some new ideas. Moreover, the security of <b>clock</b> <b>controlled</b> stream ciphers based on its jumping system is investigated and discussed which resulted in some recommendations to design a <b>clock</b> <b>controlled</b> stream cipher. Finally, a differential distinguishing attack based on a fault attack is presented in this thesis to attack the Shannon stream cipher. The last part of this thesis focuses on the security of network coding which promises increased efficiency for future networks. For secure network coding, a new attack model is studied and the secrecy capacity is improved by a concatenated secret sharing scheme...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to being useful for manufacturing [...] "go/no go" [...] testing, scan chains {{can also be used}} to [...] "debug" [...] chip designs. In this context, the chip is exercised in normal [...] "functional mode" [...] (for example, a computer or mobile-phone chip might execute assembly language instructions). At any time, the chip clock can be stopped, and the chip re-configured into [...] "test mode". At this point the full internal state can be dumped out, or set to any desired values, by use of the scan chains. Another use of scan to aid debug consists of scanning in an initial state to all memory elements and then go back to functional mode to perform system debug. The advantage is to bring the system to a known state without going through many clock cycles. This use of scan chains, along with the <b>clock</b> <b>control</b> circuits are a related sub-discipline of logic design called [...] "Design for Debug" [...] or [...] "Design for Debuggability".|$|E
5000|$|The protein encoded by the Bmal1 gene in mammals binds with {{a second}} bHLH-PAS protein via the PAS domain, CLOCK (or its paralog, NPAS2) to form a {{heterodimer}} in the nucleus. Via its BHLH domain, this heterodimer binds to E-box response elements in the promoter regions of Per (Per1 and Per2) and Cry genes (Cry1 and Cry2). This binding upregulates the transcription and translation of PER1, PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 proteins. [...] After the PER and CRY proteins have accumulated to sufficient levels, they interact by their PAS motifs to form a large repressor complex that travels into the nucleus to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer [...] This inhibits the transcription of Per and Cry genes, and causes protein levels of PER and CRY drop. This transcription, translation negative feedback loop (TTFL) is modulated in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation of PER proteins by casein kinase 1ε or δ (CK1 ε or CK1 δ), signaling these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. SIRT1 also regulates PER protein degradation by inhibiting transcriptional activity of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer in a circadian manner through deacetylation. The degradation of PER proteins prevents the formation the large protein complex, and thus prevents the inhibition of transcriptional activity of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer. The CRY protein is also signaled for degradation by poly-ubiquination from the FBXL3 protein, also preventing the inhibition of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer. This allows transcription of the Per and Cry genes to resume. It has also been observed in the TTFL loop of nocturnal mice that transcription levels of the Bmal1 gene peak at CT18, during the mid-subjective night, anti-phase to the transcription levels of Per, Cry, and other <b>clock</b> <b>control</b> genes, which peak at CT6, during the mid-subjective day. This process occurs with a period length of approximately 24 hours and supports the notion that this molecular mechanism is rhythmic.|$|E

40|$|Proliferation of {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cells}} is rhythmic throughout the day. This temporal organization occurs through {{the interaction between}} the endogenous peripheral circadian <b>clock</b> and pathways <b>controlling</b> cell cycle progression. Per 2, a core clock gene with tumour suppresser function, is critical to clock function and to the regulation of cellular proliferation. Circadian disruption, which increases colon cancer incidence, may do so by deregulating <b>clock</b> <b>controlled</b> epithelial cell proliferation. Increased expression of b-catenin is a contributing cause of most familial and spontaneous human colon cancer and the cause of multiple intestinal neoplasia of the ApcMin/+ mouse. Here we report that increased b-catenin destabilizes PER 2 clock protein by inducing bTrCP, an F-box protein of SCF ubiquitin E 3 ligase. In the intestinal mucosa of the ApcMin/+ mouse, the decrease in PER 2 protein levels is associated with altered circadian rhythms of clock genes, Per 1 and Per 2, and <b>clock</b> <b>controlled</b> genes, Dbp and Wee 1. These findings suggest that disruption of the peripheral intestinal circadian clock may be intimately involved in b-catenin induced intestinal epithelial neoplastic transformation in both mouse and man...|$|R
