The company began issuing card money in January 1722 with two authorizing signatures of company directors in France or local officers in Louisiana. Denominations ranged from 5 sous to 50 livres, in different shapes to be easily distinguished by non-French speaking and illiterate population. With the introduction of the <b>company</b> <b>card</b> money also came severe inflation. By 1725 both the company vouchers and cards had been redeemed.|$|E
