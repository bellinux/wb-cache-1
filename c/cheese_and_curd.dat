40|$|Second cheese whey (SCW) is a {{by-product}} of <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> cheese production that is usually not recovered and therefore contributes substantially to the negative environmental impact of the cheese manufacture plants. Membrane technology, namely nanofiltration (NF), is used in this work for the recovery of SCW organic nutrients, resulting from "Serpa" <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> production. The SCW is processed by NF to recover a rich lactose fraction in the concentrate and a process water with a high salt content in the permeate. The permeation experiments were carried out in a plate and frame NF unit, where two NF membranes (NFT 50 and HR- 95 -PP) were characterized and tested. The NF permeation experiments were performed accordingly with two different operation modes: total recirculation and concentration. In order to select the best membrane and operating pressure for the SCW fractionation, total recirculation experiments were carried out. After the membrane selection, the concentration experiments showed that the selected membrane (NFT 50) at 30 bar allows a water recovery of approximately 80 %, concentrating the second cheese whey nutrients approximately 5 times. Therefore, the NF operation can successfully reduce the wastewater organic load and simultaneously contribute to the valorisation of the <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> cheese manufacture by-products...|$|E

40|$|In {{partnership}} with AREN Agribusiness Research and Education Network. This study {{is one of}} four studies of New Zealand agribusiness success. In 2006 and 2007, The Agribusiness Research and Education Network researched the success of the New Zealand dairy, kiwifruit, sheepmeat and venison industries. These studies are all business history studies focusing on issues of industry strategy, structure, conduct and performance as perceived by industry participants and the AREN research team. New Zealand is a major player in world dairy markets. New Zealand exports six categories of dairy products: Milk and cream (not concentrated); Milk and cream (concentrated); Buttermilk and related products; Whey and related products; Butter and related products; and <b>Cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd.</b> Concentrated milk (particularly whole milk powder and skim milk powder is the largest product category. <b>Cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> is currently the second most important product category having taken over from butter which has declined in relative importance but remains the third most important category. Non-concentrated milk, buttermilk and whey products are smaller categories but whey products have increased in importance in recent years. The business context for dairy industry participants has been characterised by significant change over the last three decades. Contextual changes have been significant. European and North American subsidies have distorted markets for much of the period. Low cost producers have emerged in China and Latin America. Dairying has had to respond to animal welfare, and environmental challenges. Industry structure has evolved considerably over the last three decades. Structural change has occurred throughout the dairy industry. A key change was the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2003 associated with the dissolution of the NZ Dairy Board, the establishment of Fonterra and the removal of statutory monopoly power. The Act was proceeded by a long period of industry concentration and has been followed by industry evolution at a fast pace. Industry conduct and performance have evolved in response to legislative change, business opportunities and business capabilities. Key developments within the industry have included: enhanced farm productivity, uptake of labour saving technologies, the use of nitrogen fertiliser and supplementary feeds, and ongoing adaptation to new technologies and larger farm size. Interviews with industry participants identified eight key success factors. The eight critical success factors identified were: development of international markets; effective political support in international markets; effective political support within New Zealand; effective evolution of industry structure; farmer engagement in policy, strategy, structure and operations; continuing technological advance; maintaining disease free status; and the development of economies of scale. The dairy industry continues to evolve and faces numerous challenges. Key challenges identified by industry participants were: increasing animal welfare demands; enhancing animal health; meeting environmental challenges; managing intergenerational transfers; achieving appropriate research investment in pastures; achieving sustainable and efficient industry structures; and sustaining effective international marketing strategies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of factors influencing Australia's dairy product exports to Thailand. To the author's knowledge, such an analysis has not been conducted so far. The research consists of literature reviews of the theories and empirical studies of comparative advantage and export demand, the econometric estimation of Thailand's demand for Australia's exports of dairy products to analyse the determinants of Thailand's demand for Australian dairy products, and an investigation of experience of selected Australian exporting companies in exporting dairy products to Thailand based on the interviews of export managers. Australia exports dairy products such as, milk dry (skim milk powder or SMP and whole milk powder or WMP), butter, <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd,</b> and whey products to Thailand. SMP is the principle ingredient of Thailand's milk processing industry. Australia's main competitors in Thailand for exports of dairy products are New Zealand, the EU {{and to some extent}} the U. S. A. Thailand has heavily protected its local dairy industry by high tariffs and regulation. The Thai government promotes local dairy production and the use of local milk products. However, the dairy sector of Thailand is still incapable of meeting the demand from the domestic dairy processing industry and consumers. Hence, Thailand has to import a large volume of dairy products each year. The Australia-Thailand free trade agreement (FTA) started to operate in January 2005. Thailand's import tariffs on Australia's dairy products will decline to zero to 32 per cent, and be phased out by 2010 or 2020. The quotas on Australia's exports of milk powders and milk and cream to the Thai market will be increased by 2025. The analysis of revealed comparative advantage and revealed competitive advantage identify that among the dairy product exporting countries, Australia has comparative advantage and competitive advantage of all of the dairy products (milk evaporated, milk dry, whey preserved and concentrated butter and <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd).</b> Thailand has comparative advantage and competitive advantage only in milk condensed and evaporated. Thailand has comparative disadvantage and competitive disadvantage in the other dairy product categories. Australia's competitors in the Thai market (New Zealand, and the selected EU countries) have comparative and competitive advantages in most of the dairy products. These results suggest that Australian dairy exporting companies and policy makers could focus on increasing the volumes of all of the dairy products exported to Thailand, except milk condensed and evaporated. The results from the estimation of econometric models of Thailand's demand for Australia's exports of milk dry shows that in the short run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand declines when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries increases, while it is not responsive to Thailand's real national income. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand declines when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries' price increases. The estimated long run price elasticity of export demand is - 2. 76. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand does not change significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. In the short run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand falls when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries increases, but it is not responsive to Thailand's real national income. The quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand declines when the Thai baht depreciates against the Australian dollar. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand decreases when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries' price increases. The estimated long run relative price elasticity of demand is - 1. 13. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand does not change significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. The quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand declines when the Thai baht depreciates against the Australian dollar. The estimated long run exchange rate elasticity of demand is - 6. 34. In the short run, the quantity of Australia's <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> exports demanded in Thailand is not responsive either to the relative price of exports or to Thailand's real national income. In the long run the quantity of Australia's <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> exports demanded in Thailand changes significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. The estimated long run income elasticity of demand is 1. 84. During the interviews, the export managers of Australian dairy export companies agreed that Thailand is a significant importer of Australia's dairy products, particularly for SMP, WMP, whey powder, butter and cheese. Thailand's stable economic and political environment {{is one of the reasons}} that they are attracted to the Thai market. The principal factors that make Australia's products successful in the Thai market are competitive price and 'clean, green and natural' products. However, limited Australian dairy product varieties and distribution channels are major factors that contribute to Australia falling behind New Zealand and the EU in the Thai market. The Australian dairy Corporation (ADC) is not involved in promoting Australian dairy products in the Thai market at present, but has done so in the past. Thailand's tariff and import quota protection and support to local dairying industry is one of the barriers encountered by Australia's exports to Thailand. All the managers are hopeful of expanding opportunities for their dairy exports in the Thai market. These findings imply that Australian dairy export companies could expand the dairy product varieties they export and offer for sale in the Thai market. They could also take advantage of the established sales distribution network in addition to exploring the possibilities of setting up their own distribution channels. They could be looking into the possibilities of setting up of joint ventures with local dairy processing companies in Thailand so that their dairy exports could be expanded. The Australian dairy export companies as well as the ADC have to actively promote in various ways the Australian dairy product exports in the Thai market in order to take advantage of the window of opportunities open to them within the trade liberalisation framework of the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement (FTA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of established threshold {{values for the}} analytical authentication (stable isotopes and fatty acids) of organic drinking milk in Germany was determined for more strongly processed organic dairy products (n = 56). Milk fat extracted from both soft and semi-hard cheeses, butter, cream, sour cream, buttermilk, yoghurt and low-fat milk always possessed an alpha-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 w 3) content above the minimum level of 0. 50 % and a stable isotope ratio of carbon (delta 13 C) below the maximum level of - 26. 5 ‰ required for organic milk. Noncompliant results were obtained for whey as well as both Italian ice creams and cheeses. Analyses of German cream <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> lipids revealed that 7 out of 39 samples did not comply with the two thresholds. An additional analysis of delta 13 C in the defatted dry matter showed that these reconstituted products apparently contained a combination of organic skim milk and conventional or imported organic cream. The inherent correlation between delta 13 C in the fat and defatted dry matter indicates their different origins, which may provide evidence of fraud. This study showed that the previous C 18 : 3 w 3 and delta 13 C thresholds are generally applicable to processed dairy products from Germany. An analysis of delta 15 N in defatted dry matter confirmed the recently proposed threshold of 5. 5 ‰ for organic dairy products...|$|E

Paper analyzes the development of the of milk consumption and level of its substitution by milk products. There w as quantified the elasticity of demand and   estimated own price elasticity and income elasticity. For the past 17 years, consumption of milk, except cheese, cottage cheese, sour milk products and butter, decreased. Expressed by linear regression model in recent years (since 1995) in Slovakia occurred overall reduction in the consumption of milk and dairy products by an average of 0. 988 kg per capita per year. This development was mainly conditioned by the annual descent of demand for milk, as its consumption with little variation in average decreased annually by up to 1. 88 kg per capita. This development is largely due to the increase of milk prices and especially the increasing supply {{of a wide range of}} quality and flavored sour milk and cheese products. Acidified milk product consumption in recent observed years increased and is expressed by the average growth factor of 0. 6748 kg per capita per year. Prognosis with a five percent risk of error of estimate could increase their consumption up to 13. 936 kg per capita in 2014.

40|$|Thai dairy {{industry}} is heavily intervened {{by the government}} and depended on a large proportion of dairy product imports. New Zealand and Australia are the most important suppliers to Thailand dairy import market. Both countries together contribute more than 50 percent to Thailand total dairy import market. In 2005, Thailand signed free trade agreements with Australia (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement: TAFTA) and New Zealand (Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership: THNZCEP). Both agreements include tariff liberalisation in dairy products which directly affect Thai {{dairy industry}}. It is debatable whether both agreements create or divert resource allocation efficiency for Thailand dairy production. This study assessed the welfare impacts of the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA. The modified gravity model was employed to assess trade creation and trade diversion effects of both agreements in seven dairy product categories: non-concentrated milk and cream, concentrated milk and cream, buttermilk and yogurt, whey, butter, <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> and total dairy products. The modified gravity model for each dairy product was estimated by pooling the data from 1991 :Q 1 - 2009 :Q 4 across Thailand top five trading partners using Time Series and Cross Sections (TSCS) estimation. In addition, the study employed the import price model to examine effects of the Thailand tariff reduction for New Zealand and Australian dairy products on the prices of New Zealand and Australian dairy products and the relative price of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) dairy products in Thailand market. The results show that the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA leads to net positive trade creation in most dairy product categories which indicates their members’ welfare improvement, except in whey for THNZCEP and concentrated milk and cream for TAFTA. In addition, it is found that the reduction in tariffs for dairy products from New Zealand and Australia has negligible effects on the Thailand import prices of dairy products from both countries while other factors such as exchange rate, competitor price, and drought have significantly larger effects. Furthermore, the reduction in tariffs for dairy products from New Zealand and Australia significantly increases the ratio of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) prices in some dairy products in Thailand market. This finding indicates that the dairy product prices of non-FTA members are relatively high in Thailand market after the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA...|$|E
40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese, curd and casein manufacture and as {{an excellent source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals and lactose can be used in wide range of industrial production. If treated as waste material without further processing, it can have negative impact on the environment. Main components of whey are water (93 % of total volume), lactose (70 to 72 % of dry matter), whey protein (8 to 10 % solids), and minerals (12 to 15 % solids). Of the minerals, most abundant are magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and their salts which are passed to whey from milk. Predominantly represented vitamins are water-soluble vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 12, B 6, and C) from which the vitamins B 2, B 12 and C are bound to the whey proteins. The most abundant whey proteins are betalactoglobulin, alfa lactalbumin, GMP (glycomacropeptide), bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase. For each of these proteins have been demonstrated or at least implied, unique functional, nutritional or nutraceutical properties. The aim of the thesis was to compile a literature review focused on the possibility of using whey from the production of <b>cheese</b> <b>and</b> <b>curd</b> as raw materials for the manufacture of various types of beverages and monitoring the effect of the addition of various flavor components and whey proteins on the sensory quality of the drink prepared from fresh sour whey. The hypothesis of this work was that flavored whey drinks made from acid whey supplemented with whey protein have a higher sensory quality score than flavored drinks without the addition of whey protein and that whey drinks flavored with mango flavour are more acceptable by consumers they are able to mask undesirable off-tastes of sour whey better than flavor peaches, cherries and black currants. In all specimens, the effect of 8 different recipes and flavors of peaches, cherries, mango and blackcurrant on the final sensory quality and acceptability to consumers was observed. It was found that the best rated drinks were of cherry and mango flavors. Beverages with the addition of mango juice were able to reliably mask natural off-taste of whey, which supports the hypothesis about the appropriateness of using this flavor. Drinks with peach flavor were evaluated to be of the worst senzory quality. As of the best sensory quality were evaluated drinks flavored with cherry flavor, which reached the best overall evaluation. In all variants of formulas was observed that drinks with added WPC achieved better overall evaluation than similar variations without addition of WPC. Statistically significant results of this finding, however, were observed only in the context of mango flavors...|$|E
