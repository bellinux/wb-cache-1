The {{aim of the}} work is to obtain heat flows and flow fields local values; to study influence of blow-in, sphere rotation, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>edge</b> slip angle upon flow around characteristics. Gravimetric methods of direct statistical modelling were applied in solving flow about problems.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the spatial resolution of proton CT using both a prototype proton CT scanner and Monte Carlo simulations. Methods: A custom <b>cylindrical</b> <b>edge</b> phantom containing twelve tissue-equivalent inserts with four different compositions at varying radial displacements from {{the axis of}} rotation was developed for measuring the modulation transfer function (MTF) of a prototype proton CT scanner. Two scans of the phantom, centered on the axis of rotation, were obtained with a 200 MeV, low-intensity proton beam: one scan with steps of 4 °, and one scan with the phantom continuously rotating. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations of the phantom scan were performed using scanners idealized to various degrees. The data were reconstructed using an iterative projection method with added total variation superiorization based on individual proton histories. Edge spread functions in the radial and azimuthal directions were obtained using the oversampling technique. These were then used to obtain the modulation transfer functions. The spatial resolution was defined by the 10 % value of the modulation transfer function (MTF 10 %) in units of line pairs per centimeter (lp/cm). Data from the simulations were used {{to better understand the}} contributions of multiple Coulomb scattering in the phantom and the scanner hardware, as well as the effect of discretization of proton location. Results: The radial spatial resolution of the prototype proton CT scanner depends on the total path length, W, of the proton in the phantom, whereas the azimuthal spatial resolution depends both on W and the position, u−, at which the most-likely path uncertainty is evaluated along the path. For protons contributing to radial spatial resolution, W varies with the radial position of the edge, whereas for protons contributing to azimuthal spatial resolution, W is approximately constant. For a pixel size of 0. 625 mm, the radial spatial resolution of the image reconstructed from the fully idealized simulation data ranged between 6. 31 ± 0. 36 lp/cm for W = 197 mm i. e., close {{to the center of the}} phantom, and 13. 79 ± 0. 36 lp/cm for W = 97 mm, near the periphery of the phantom. The azimuthal spatial resolution ranged from 6. 99 ± 0. 23 lp/cm at u− = 75 mm (near the center) to 11. 20 ± 0. 26 lp/cm at u− = 20 mm (near the periphery). Multiple Coulomb scattering limits the radial spatial resolution for path lengths greater than approximately 130 mm, and the azimuthal spatial resolution for positions of evaluation greater than approximately 40 mm for W = 199 mm. The radial spatial resolution of the image reconstructed from data from the 4 ° stepped experimental scan ranged from 5. 11 ± 0. 61 lp/cm for W = 197 mm to 8. 58 ± 0. 50 lp/cm for W = 97 mm. In the azimuthal direction, the spatial resolution ranged from 5. 37 ± 0. 40 lp/cm at u− = 75 mm to 7. 27 ± 0. 39 lp/cm at u− = 20 mm. The continuous scan achieved the same spatial resolution as that of the stepped scan. Conclusions: Multiple Coulomb scattering in the phantom is the limiting physical factor of the achievable spatial resolution of proton CT; additional loss of spatial resolution in the prototype system is associated with scattering in the proton tracking system and inadequacies of the proton path estimate used in the iterative reconstruction algorithm. Improvement in spatial resolution may be achievable by improving the most likely path estimate by incorporating information about high and low density materials, and by minimizing multiple Coulomb scattering in the proton tracking system...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of boundary layer transition phenomena in relation to turbomachinery flows. The present study involved the experimental investigation of the flow field around flat plates with various leading edge configurations. This study has also included some theoretical predictions using computational fluid dynamics. The experimental investigation involved a variety of free stream environments which have attempted to simulate typical turbomachinery flows. Three flat plate configurations with a sharp, a semi-circular and a C 4 leading edge shapes have been employed. The effect of free stream turbulence intensity over a range of free stream Reynolds numbers has been examined. Surface flow visualisation techniques have been applied to a total of 36 different experimental conditions in order to define the transitional characteristics of the boundary layer. This flow visualisation method was found to be appropriate for the large range of test cases involved and especially for the flat plate with the <b>cylindrical</b> leading <b>edge.</b> For the <b>cylindrical</b> leading <b>edge</b> configuration, a separation bubble has been detected {{in the vicinity of the}} leading edge, under all tested conditions. Hot-wire investigation of the boundary layer has been undertaken over the flat plate with the C 4 leading edge, which has been regarded as the most relevant configuration for turbomachinery applications. This method provided high frequency velocity data which have been analysed in order to obtain information about the spatial distribution of integral parameters of the boundary layer, such as the mean velocity, the turbulence intensity and the skewness and flatness factors. Boundary layer spectra have also been acquired. Statistical analysis of this data has been employed in order to obtain the intermittency distribution. The present results have been found to be in good agreement with existing transition correlations. Calculations of the flow over flat plates with leading edge shapes similar to the experimental configuration have been undertaken using a two-dimensional elliptic Navier-Stokes solver. A solution of the flow field around a semi-circular and an elliptical leading edge has been obtained. Low Reynolds number k-Ɛ modelling has been applied in order to model the transitional characteristics of the boundary layer flow very near the wall.
