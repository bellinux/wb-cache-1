25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> <b>extension</b> along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|E

50|$|There are {{currently}} two routes in use. The main line {{which is a}} shorter route that runs {{within the boundaries of}} the botanical gardens itself and the museum line which takes the trains under Lord Baden Powell Drive over to the loop next to Museum of the Riverina <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> A proposed <b>extension</b> to the main line includes a spiral.|$|R
25|$|Phases 2 and 3 {{would be}} {{undertaken}} between 2015 and 2030. Further aircraft parking stands {{would be built}} {{to the east of}} the terminal, and a taxiway would be constructed alongside and to the south of the runway, to avoid the need for aircraft to back-track on the runway. Both these developments would involve further reduction in the water area of the King George V Dock. The existing fuel farm would be relocated to a site at the east of the airport, where it could be supplied by barge, and linked to a hydrant based supply system, thus eliminating both road tanker deliveries and on-airport fuel bowser movements. The existing surface <b>car</b> <b>park</b> would be replaced by a multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> allowing <b>extension</b> of the vehicle drop-off and pick up area. The jet centre and hangar facilities would be further extended. Finally the existing terminal building would be replaced.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the potential reinstatement of the Dufftown branch, Transport Scotland have published proposals to improve the facilities here. This could see the existing passing loop extended through the station and a second platform built north of the current one.

The majority of disabled <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are located on the top deck of this <b>car</b> <b>park</b> near the Loft entrance. A four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R
