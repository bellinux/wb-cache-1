50|$|<b>Conduit</b> <b>power</b> {{was first}} {{designed}} in the steam age (c.1900) when power was transmitted mechanically {{from a series of}} steam-powered rotating screws, as shown in the illustration (left) also published by Harmsworth Popular Science.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{propulsion}} of streetcars {{finally won}} out {{over all the}} other experimental methods. Electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> made their first appearance in New Orleans on the Carrollton line on February 1, 1893. The line was also extended out Carrollton Avenue and renamed St. Charles.|$|R
50|$|NOTE: This section {{begins with}} the {{introduction}} of rubber-tired buses to the transit operations in Hampton and Newport News, following many years of public transit service performed earlier and during the transition by horse-drawn and electrically <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> utlilizing rails imbedded in the streets and roads of the area.|$|R
50|$|The American Car Company was {{a builder}} of {{electric}} <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars.</b> ACC was bought {{out by the}} J. G. Brill Company of Philadelphia in 1902. However, Brill continued to operate the American Car Co. under its own name until 1931, when it was reorganized as J. G. Brill of Missouri.|$|R
50|$|Engineering works {{included}} a steam-powered municipal water system in operation by 1857 {{and the massive}} Victoria Bridge (Montreal) built in 1859. The Montreal City Passenger Railway Company began offering horse-car service in 1861 and converted to electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> in 1891. In 1884 the Royal Electric Company began providing electricity to the city.|$|R
50|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{was originally}} {{a part of}} the South Atlanta's Metropolitan Street Railroad Company and the section of the trail was separated from public roadways.The route which ran through Edgewood, Kirkwood and Oakhurst eventually became Route 18 of the Georgia <b>Power</b> <b>Streetcar</b> system but since it runs out-of-band is ideal for cyclists and runners today.|$|R

50|$|Factories {{and other}} {{industries}} sprang {{up around the}} start of the 20th century due to the Chicago River and Avondale's dense network of transportation corridors that were built in the 1870s and improved after its annexation into Chicago including replacement of cable cars with electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars.</b> The resulting jobs in the area were responsible for drawing the initial wave of European immigrants.|$|R
25|$|The Pacific Electric, {{nicknamed the}} Red Cars, was a privately owned mass transit system in Southern California {{consisting}} of electrically <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars,</b> interurban cars, and buses {{and was the}} largest electric railway {{system in the world}} in the 1920s. Organized around the city centers of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, it connected cities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County and Riverside County.|$|R
5000|$|The company built many of {{the wooden}} {{electric}} overhead-trolley <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> used throughout the United States primarily {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. Known for their workmanship and durability, some of the cars built by Perley A. Thomas Car Works in the early 1920s are still operating today in New Orleans. Thomas based the design of these cars on New Orleans' first order for double-ended, double-trucked, arch-roofed electric streetcars, the 400-series from Southern Car Works.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Capital Traction began {{construction}} on a power house in Georgetown to <b>power</b> its <b>streetcars.</b> The facility {{opened on the}} waterfront in 1912.|$|R
5000|$|Transit {{history in}} the Spokane area dates back more than 125 years {{beginning}} with the inaugural trip of a horse-drawn streetcar running between downtown Spokane and the Browne's Addition neighborhood to the west in 1888. The first electrically <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> began operations November 1889 and traveled between downtown Spokane through {{what is now the}} University District. [...] Over the next several decades, multiple private interests constructed and operated streetcars and cable cars typically {{as an integral part of}} a real estate development plan.|$|R

Like Kessler, she was working with the First Sons, and was a specialist researching mind-control techniques. For a time John White was assigned to work with Sasha when he was undercover within the organization. In Post-Blast, she {{is the leader of}} the Reapers who dominate the Neon District.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the century, the rise of the new middle class created a demand for housing beyond the city core. This was met by private {{contractors}} building individual homes on single lots in newly created suburbs, adjacent to the downtown core. Public transport was provided by the extension of the new electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> to the suburbs. The downtown core began to lose its residential vocation and became a space increasingly devoted to commerce, industry and to a lesser extent, public life.|$|R
50|$|BC Electric Company {{began as}} the British Columbia Electric Railway (streetcar and {{lighting}} utility) in Victoria, Vancouver and New Westminster in 1897. Power was generated by coal-fired steam plants. Increasing {{demand in the}} Edwardian boom years meant BC Electric sought expansions through Hydro power at Buntzen Lake, and later at Stave Lake. Sensible growth and expansion of the <b>power,</b> <b>streetcar</b> and coal gas utilities meant that BC Electric was a major company in the region.An English financier named Robert Horne-Payne secured the funding and created the large company from {{what had been a}} patchwork of small regional electric railway and steam, hydro and diesel plants.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, transit systems were {{generally}} rail, first horse-drawn streetcars, and later electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> and cable cars. Rail was more comfortable and had less rolling resistance than street traffic on granite block or macadam and horse-drawn streetcars were, in most places, a step up from horsebus: faster, more sanitary, and cheaper to run; electric traction was much more so, with the cost, excreta, epizootic risk, and carcass disposal of horses eliminated entirely. Obsolete streetcars were later seen as obstructions to traffic, but for nearly 20 years they had the highest power-to-weight ratio of anything commonly found on the road, and the lowest rolling resistance.|$|R

50|$|First {{formed in}} 1854, the Columbus Street Railroad Company was {{authorized}} by the city to build a number of lines, but nothing came about initially. A Horse <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> line first ran along High Street on 10 June 1863. Similar to the proposed modern line, the initial line ran for 1.5 mi from Union Station to Mound Street. When traffic dropped off after the Civil War, the Columbus Street Railroad Company faced financial difficulties, but started making a profit by 1868. Following the stabilization of the High Street line, the Friend Street Railroad Company {{set up shop in}} the same year, first reaching East Public Lane (now Parsons Avenue) and eventually reaching the Fairgrounds (now Franklin Park).|$|R

2500|$|When {{electric}} streetcars {{were introduced}} in the late 19th century, conduit current collection {{was one of the}} first ways of supplying power, but it proved to be much more expensive, complicated, and trouble-prone than overhead wires. When electric street railways became ubiquitous, <b>conduit</b> <b>power</b> was used in those cities that did not permit overhead wires. In Europe, it was used in London, Paris, Berlin, Marseille, Budapest, and Prague. In the United States, it was used in parts of New York City and Washington, DC. Third rail technology was investigated for use on the Gold Coast of Australia for the [...] light rail, though power from overhead lines was ultimately utilized for that system.|$|R
5000|$|The Portland Streetcar is an {{electrically}} <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> (or tram) {{system which}} presently serves the inner westside, downtown Portland and the South Waterfront District. It runs between the Northwest district and the South Waterfront, also providing {{service to the}} Pearl District, Portland State University, and Oregon Health and Science University. Unlike MAX, which primarily runs in its own right-of-way, the streetcar shares most of its right-of-way with vehicular traffic. The streetcar interchanges with both the MAX system and the Portland Aerial Tram, an aerial cableway. Opened in 2001 and extended three times since then, the streetcar line is currently 4 mi end-to-end, but construction of a second line began in August 2009 and will extend the system by 3.3 mi, crossing the Willamette River to serve the inner eastside district.|$|R
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the Lubbe Hydroelectric Plant was {{operated}} near Goldstream and created electricity by running high pressure drinking water through a turbine. A powerline then ran 12 mi into Victoria and provided electricity to <b>power</b> the <b>streetcars</b> of the day. The plant still exists but is inaccessible to the public.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Frederick Stark Pearson {{was the son}} of Ambrose and Hannah (Edgerly) Pearson. He {{graduated}} from Tufts University in 1883 with an A.M.B. and received an A.M.M. degree one year later. Previously, for one year (1879-80), he was instructor in chemistry in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; later (1883-86), he was instructor in mathematics and applied mechanics at Tufts College. From college, he went on to develop the electric transportation system in Boston and, with electric <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars</b> of major importance, in 1894 he was appointed the head engineer for Metropolitan Street Railways in New York City. Pearson built a reputation as an innovative electrical engineer in the United States and he was soon contracted by governments and businesses as a consulting engineer for power generating stations throughout North America. A man with great business skills and a foresight, with ready financial backers he undertook major projects in North and South America. He was the Founder of Barcelona Traction and Brookfield Asset Management.|$|R
50|$|The {{transportation}} division originally operated only streetcars. The {{electric transmission}} network <b>powering</b> the <b>streetcars</b> {{was a natural}} fit for the energy operations when the company was formed. In 1917, Public Service began adding bus routes. The streetcar division was called Public Service Railway Company (Public Service Railways), while the bus division was called Public Service Transportation Company. The two divisions were merged in 1928 to create Public Service Coordinated Transport.|$|R
5000|$|The City Passenger Railway {{became the}} Montreal Street Railway in 1886. The {{decision}} to use electricity instead of horses for propulsion was made in 1892. On September 21 of that same year, [...] "The Rocket," [...] Montreal's first electric streetcar made its maiden voyage. By 1894, the remaining horsecar lines had all been converted to accommodate the new electrically <b>powered</b> <b>streetcars.</b> The Montreal Street Railway was {{known as one of}} the most innovative and progressive in North America. One of its innovations was the introduction of the [...] "Pay As You Enter" [...] (P.A.Y.E.) system of fare collection in 1905. Prior to that time, conductors would walk through the car collecting fares meaning many passengers probably rode for free on very crowded cars. The P.A.Y.E. system was adopted worldwide by many other transit companies. The company also designed and built two open sightseeing (another two were built later) cars that were in service until the late 1950s. The designs of those sightseeing cars were sold to transit companies in Quebec City, Calgary and Vancouver, who all built their own versions of the car.|$|R
5000|$|The Portland Streetcar is an {{electrically}} <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> (or tram) {{system with}} two lines, which serves downtown Portland and adjacent areas. The first line, opened in 2001 and later designated the NS Line, runs between the Northwest district and the South Waterfront district, also providing {{service to the}} Pearl District and Portland State University (PSU). The CL Line was opened in 2012 and serves the Central Eastside District and the Lloyd District before crossing the Broadway Bridge to join the NS Line and follow its downtown section south as far as PSU. Unlike MAX, which primarily runs in its own right-of-way, the streetcar shares most of its right-of-way with vehicular traffic. The streetcar interchanges with both the MAX system and the Portland Aerial Tram, an aerial cableway. The NS Line has been and extended three times since its 2001 opening and is currently 4 mi end-to-end. The CL line extended the system by 3.3 mi and has an overall length of 4.4 mi, end-to-end, when the 1.1-mile section shared with the NS Line is included.|$|R

However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns {{that the only way to}} remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb <b>Conduit</b> <b>powers</b> and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as [...] "freaks", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.|$|R

5000|$|In 1888, {{the first}} {{electric}} <b>powered</b> <b>streetcar</b> ran on Chittenden Avenue from High Street {{to the current}} site of the Ohio State Fair. However, it was not successful initially. The first line with successful electrification was the Glenwood & Green Lawn Street Railroad (with trackage mainly along Broad Street), which was completed in August 1890. The High Street, Long Street, and Mount Vernon Avenue lines were electrified in the following year. The advantages in speed and cleanliness quickly made equestrian power obsolete, and the last horse drawn car ran in 1892. Also in that year, yet another naming change came with {{the sale of the}} Columbus Consolidated Street Railroad Company to the newly formed [...] "Columbus Street Railway Company" [...] for $3,000,000. At this time, the Glenwood & Green Lawn line was acquired. In 1895, the Columbus Railway, Power and Light Company purchased an amusement park that would be known as Olentangy Park. It was located on the southern end of Clintonville. The idea behind the purchase was to increase ridership on the line during non-peak hours by providing an attractive destination at the terminus. Likewise, other transit companies built Indianola Park on North Fourth Street and Minerva Park in the village of the same name.|$|R
