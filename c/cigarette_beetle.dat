2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{reported}} to be pest and disease free. [...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing damping-off disease. The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap. After harvesting many beetle species including the red flour beetle and the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle</b> may feed on seeds which are not properly stored in air-tight containers [...] Cucumeropsis mannii provides ground cover, effectively suppressing weeds. Intercropping with sorghum, cassava, coffee, cotton, maize, or banana crops can reduce weedings during the growing season from 2-3 to just one. This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.|$|E

2500|$|Herbivores {{are unable}} to digest complex {{cellulose}} and rely on mutualistic, internal symbiotic bacteria, fungi, or protozoa to break down cellulose {{so it can be}} used by the herbivore. [...] Microbial symbionts also allow herbivores to eat plants that would otherwise be inedible by detoxifying plant secondary metabolites. [...] For example, fungal symbionts of <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetles</b> (Lasioderma serricorne) use certain plant allelochemicals as their source of carbon, in addition to producing detoxification enzymes (esterases) to get rid of other toxins. Microbial symbionts also assist in the acquisition of plant material by weakening a host plant's defenses. [...] Some herbivores are more successful at feeding on damaged hosts. As an example, several species of bark beetle introduce blue stain fungi of the genera Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma into trees before feeding. The blue stain fungi cause lesions that reduce the trees' defensive mechanisms and allow the bark beetles to feed.|$|R

Low % 0 2 in a closed system was achieved and maintained by displacement with gaseous nitrogen. The effect of anoxia on representative species of cockroaches (Dictyoptera), fabric beetles (Dermestidae), stored product beetles (Anobiidae), termites (Rhinotermitidae), and wood-boring beetles (Lyctidae) was evaluated. Most insects succumbed within hours or a few days exposure. A few, such as larval carpet beetles, Anthrenus fluvipes, eggs of <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetles,</b> Lasiocierme serrico 2 ne, and powderpost beetles, Lycfus spp, survived> 8 -day expoiure. Length of exposure for mortality (LT) appeared to be related to metabolic rate and to the ability of the exposed stage to regulate water loss. In this regard, LT was generally inversely correlated to % 0 2 and to exposure temperature and relative humidity. Increasing 0 2 to 0. 32 % increased time for LT for some species but not for others. Increasing 0 2 to 0. 62 % approximately doubled LT. Adding C 02 during anoxic exposure reduced LT, apparently by increasing futile metabolism. It was difficult and relatively costly to maintain < 0. 1 % 0 2. Higher 0 2 rates may be practical for controlling some species if higher temperature or low humidity may be maintained.

40|$|<b>Cigarette</b> <b>beetles,</b> Lasioderma serricorne (F.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae), cause {{significant}} {{damage to the}} multi-billion dollar food and tobacco industries worldwide each year. A non-insecticidal alternative to manage L. serricorne is the application of mating disruption, in which high levels of synthetic sex pheromone are released to create an atmosphere that results in males failing to mate females thereby causing population suppression or extinction. The reported work used synthetic serricornin, the predominant sex pheromone of L. serricorne, in mating disruption trials conducted in selected food and feed processing facilities in South Carolina during 2010 and 2011. Mills subjected to mating disruption trials were monitored using oviposition cups filled with larval food and pheromone traps for males that contained monitoring lures. Immediately after deployment of mating disruption dispensers, trap captures declined significantly and indicated a reduction in population levels, i. e. there was “trap shut down”. A significant reduction was observed in numbers of adult beetles caught in the traps eight weeks before and eight weeks after treatment in both years. Beetle numbers from pheromone traps in untreated buildings remained at similar levels or increased after the time of mating disruption deployment in treated buildings. The numbers of adults that emerged from oviposition food cups were generally low and varied irregularly in treated and untreated buildings, and were determined to be of little value for assessing treatment effects on reproduction. These initial field studies in the U. S. suggest that release of the synthetic sex pheromone of L. serricorne for mating disruption can significantly inhibit proper orientation behavior of male L. serricorne to females and may lead to pest population decline from mating disruption...|$|R
50|$|The {{drugstore}} beetle's larvae are small, white grubs, {{that can}} be distinguished from the grubs of the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle</b> by their shorter hair.

50|$|This beetle {{is related}} to the {{commonly}} known <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle.</b> Adult drugstore beetles are cylindrical with lengths ranging from 2.25 to 3.5 mm. They are a reddish-brown color and have elytra, sclerotized (hardened) wings that fold back over the abdomen and hinge upwards, allowing the hind wings to come out to fly. Females are capable of laying up to 75 eggs during a 13- to 65-day period. After the eggs are laid, they hatch into a larval period that can range anywhere from four to 20 weeks. After the larval period, drugstore beetle larvae move out of the substrate to build a cocoon and pupate. The pupation period takes a total of 12-18 days. The entire life cycle of the drugstore beetle lasts approximately two months, but can be as long as seven months. These stored product pests will infest almost anything readily available. Food products prone to infestation include: flours, dry mixes, breads, cookies and other spices. Nonfood material includes: wool, hair, leather and museum specimens. This specific type of beetle has symbiotic yeasts that produce B vitamins, which allow the beetle to survive even when consuming foods of low nutritional value. They are found in areas that have a warmer climate, yet are less plentiful in the tropics than the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|E

The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation was investigated by GC MS. The main components of the essential oil were identified to be E-citral (geranial) (27. 49 %), Z-citral (neral) (23. 57 %) and d-limonene (18. 82 %) followed by β-thujene (3. 34 %), β-pinene (2. 85 %), α-pinene (2. 57 %), 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one (2. 40 %) and linalool (2. 36 %). Citral (Z/E-citral), d-limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene and linalool were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. Citral and linalool showed strong contact toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (LD 50 = 11. 76, 12. 74 μg/adult and 20. 15, 99. 97 μg/cm 2, respectively) and fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (16. 54, 18. 04 mg/L air and 0. 14, 0. 71 mg/L air, respectively).

40|$|Among {{the insect}} species causing infestations and serious damages to stored commodities, the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle,</b> Lasiodermaserricorne (F.) and the tobacco moth, Ephestiaelutella (Hübner) {{are the major}} pests of both raw and {{manufactured}} tobacco. Post-harvest tobacco control is achieved through sanitation, insect monitoring, and fumigation with phosphine. However, insect resistance to phosphine and control failures have been reported, and increasing regulatory pressure is being exerted on fumigants. Biological control agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) appear to be environmentally sound and potentially viable alternatives to chemical control. Bt is a bacterium that produces insecticidal crystal proteins during the sporulation phase and has been, for more than 40 years, the microorganism of choice for the biocontrol of phytophagous insect pests. It produces insecticidal crystal proteins that display specific activity against certain orders of insects and become active upon ingestion by the insect. Our laboratory has conducted extensive research and worldwide surveys to evaluate the presence of Bt in stored tobacco and has confirmed previous findings indicating that Bt may be {{considered part of the}} naturally occurring phylloplanemicroflora. Several Bt strains were isolated from tobacco and characterized by DNA and protein profiling. The insecticidal activity of selected strains and of two commercial products against the larvae of L. serricorne was determined by diet incorporation assays. Moreover, the stability of Bt spores and crystal proteins on cured tobacco leaves was assessed over a storage period of time of 30 months. Cigarette prototypes were made with Bt-treated tobacco. Standard cigarette and smoke evaluations did not show any significant difference between the test and control cigarettes.

Optimal casein hydrolysis by luminal proteinases of L. serricorne was in pH 8. 5 – 9. 0 buffers, although the pH of luminal contents was slightly acidic. Results from substrate and inhibitor analyses indicated that the primary digestive proteinases were serine proteinases. The most effective inhibitors of caseinolytic hydrolysis were from soybean (both Bowman Birk and Kunitz), with some inhibition by chymostatin, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and leupeptin. Casein zymogram analysis identified at least eight proteolytic activities.

Therefore, several life history parameters of L. serricorne were studied on ground, pelleted feed at 28 °C and 65 % RH, to facilitate harvesting stages of specific ages in large numbers for assays with elevated temperatures. The mean duration for eggs was 8. 1 d, and the mean egg survivorship was 92. 0 %. There were four discrete instars, and the mean durations of first...|$|E
40|$|Insect pests are {{responsible}} for substantial damage to museum objects, historic books and in buildings like palaces or historic houses. Different wood boring beetles (Anobium punctatum, Hylotrupes bajulus, Lyctus sp. or introduced species), the biscuit beetle (Stegobium paniceum), the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle</b> (Lasioderma serricorne), different Dermestides (Attagenus sp., Anthrenus sp., Dermestes sp., Trogoderma sp.), moths like the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), Silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and booklice (Psocoptera) can damage materials, objects or building parts. They {{are the most common}} pests found in collections in central Europe, but most of them are distributed all over the world. In tropical countries, termites, cockroaches and other insect pests are also found and result in even higher damage of wood and paper or are a commune annoyance in buildings. In this short review, an introduction to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in museums is given, the most valuable collections, preventive measures, monitoring in museums, staff responsible for the IPM and chemical free treatment methods are described. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the most important insect pests occurring in museums, archives, libraries and historic buildings in central Europe are discussed with a description of the materials and object types that are mostly infested and damaged. Some information on their phenology and biology are highlighted as they can be used in the IPM concept against them...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} chemical composition of essential oils obtained from Zanthoxylum dissitum leaves and roots and their insecticidal activities against several stored product pests, namely the <b>cigarette</b> <b>beetle</b> (Lasioderma serricorne), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) and {{black carpet beetle}} (Attagenus piceus). The analysis by GC-MS of the essential oils allowed the identification of 28 and 22 components, respectively. It was found that sesquiterpenoids comprised a fairly high portion of the two essential oils, with percentages of 74. 0 % and 80. 9 % in the leaves and roots, respectively. The main constituents identified in the essential oil of Z. dissitum leaves were δ-cadinol (12. 8 %), caryophyllene (12. 7 %), β-cubebene (7. 9 %), 4 -terpineol (7. 5 %) and germacrene D- 4 -ol (5. 7 %), while humulene epoxide II (29. 4 %), caryophyllene oxide (24. 0 %), diepicedrene- 1 -oxide (10. 7 %) and Z,Z,Z- 1, 5, 9, 9 -tetramethyl- 1, 4, 7 -cycloundecatriene (8. 7 %) were the major components in the essential oil of Z. dissitum roots. The insecticidal activity {{results indicated that the}} essential oil of Z. dissitum roots exhibited moderate contact toxicity against three species of storage pests, L. serricorne,T. castaneum and A. piceus, with LD 50 values of 13. 8, 43. 7 and 96. 8 µg/adult, respectively...|$|E
