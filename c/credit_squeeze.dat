5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a <b>credit</b> <b>squeeze</b> as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of BUA's financial results had shown that raising the airline's profile and quality during Max Stuart-Shaw's tenure meant that costs were growing faster than revenues. Other factors contributing to BUA's rapid cost escalation included high launch costs of several, initially unprofitable scheduled services, {{as well as an}} unexpected falloff in traffic {{as a result of a}} <b>credit</b> <b>squeeze</b> combined with new overseas travel restrictions due to a tightening of existing exchange controls. This was further compounded by the large number of overheads resulting from the group's complex organisation in which many functions were duplicated and the limited opportunities for independent airlines to operate scheduled services on domestic and international trunk routes in competition with the corporations.|$|E

[...] Normally a publisher {{would pay a}} printer three months in arrears, but when a <b>credit</b> <b>squeeze</b> began in May 1931, it led to pressure to reduce this delay. [...] The financial difficulties led Clayton to start alternating {{the publication of his}} magazines, and he switched Astounding to a bimonthly schedule with the June 1932 issue. [...] Some printers bought the magazines which were indebted to them: Clayton decided to buy his printer to prevent this from happening. [...] This proved a disastrous move. [...] Clayton did not have the money to complete the transaction, and in October 1932, Clayton decided to cease publication of Astounding, with the expectation that the January 1933 issue would be the last one. [...] As it turned out, enough stories were in inventory, and enough paper was available, to publish one further issue, so the last Clayton Astounding was dated March 1933. [...] In April, Clayton went bankrupt, and sold his magazine titles to T.R. Foley for $100; Foley resold them in August to Street & Smith, a well-established publisher.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) {{can be used}} for modeling and forecasting a more refined business cycle classification beyond the usual distinction between expansions and contractions. Univariate Markov-switching models for monthly coincident variables and the LEI show that a three regime model is more appropriate than a model with only two regimes. Interestingly, the third regime captures `severe recessions' contrasting the conventional view that the additional third regime represents a 'recovery' phase. This is confirmed by means of Markov-switching vector autoregressive models that allow for phase shifts between the cyclical regimes of LEI and industrial production. Results indicate that a three regime model with a severe recession phase describes the cyclical dynamics in these series better than a two regime model (with only recession and expansion regimes) and a three regime model with a recovery phase. T he timing of the third regime mostly corresponds with periods of substantial <b>credit</b> <b>squeezes</b> and dramatic increases in the default spread as in the recent recession of 2007 - 2009. These findings provide empirical evidence for the theory of 'financial accelerator'. The severe recession regime of the LEI leads that of IP by 6. 5 months whereas for mild recessions this lead time increases to one year...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} an equilibrium model of diversification through merger formation. Due to moral hazard problems, poorly capitalized firms are credit rationed and may seek {{to alleviate the}} incentive problem (and thereby raise external funds) by either merging, employing a monitor {{or a combination of}} the two. Within this setting, the effects on merger activity of different kinds of capital tightening are studied. In particular, <b>credit</b> crunches, collateral <b>squeezes</b> and savings squeezes are analyzed. The main results are that diversifying merger activity increases during times of economic expansion and is positively related to aggregate economic activity, business incorporations and easing of access to credit (both interest and non-interest terms of credit). Furthermore, the model offers a rationale for diversification that is immune to the diversification neutrality result and furthermore, explains why diversified companies trade at a discount relative to their non-diversified counterparts.

40|$|MCom (Economics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{worldwide}} {{economic downturn}} and {{recession in the}} second half of 2008 were mainly the result of the crises that influenced the world‟s financial markets. After the financial crisis, the extended period of rapid credit growth that was driven by asset price increases, especially property prices, came to an end. This identified two problems central to the theme of this study. The first problem was illustrated through the recent crisis, which showed that problems in the financial sector have a potentially destabilising effect on the economy, to such an extent that they also affect the real economy. The second problem highlighted by the recent financial crisis pertains to the current macroeconomic framework, which indicates policy failure to detect and deal with financial sector instabilities. The objective of this study was to develop a framework in which the influence that rapidly growing credit and asset prices have on financial stability could be determined. Two distinct empirical models were estimated in order to reach the main objective of this study. The first model established the influence that asset prices and credit growth have on the real economy. It concluded that a long-run relationship exists between inflation, real GDP, credit extended to the private sector, house prices and share prices. A bi-directional relationship was found between house and share price, which indicates the interdependence of asset prices in SA. The transmission channels assume that credit is influenced by interest rates, but the results also found that interest rates are largely influenced by credit. The second model determined the influence of asset prices and credit on financial stability. A significant long-run relationship was found between financial stability, share and house prices, and between share prices, credit and financial stability. It was found that credit and share prices can be used to signal financial instability, and share prices can help to determine future credit extended to the private sector. In addition, the empirical analysis indicated that a <b>credit</b> market <b>squeeze</b> will be experienced after a decrease in financial stability. Lastly, credit extended will increase as a result of shock to house and share prices and financial stability will decrease when there is a shock to share and house prices. Master...|$|R

A sector which provides maximum employment cannot be left to fend for itself without a major transformation led by the entrepreneurs, policy makers and also other support organizations. There are several innovative options that one can try at four different levels such as (a) stimulating demand, (b) upgrading technology and skills, (c) promoting innovations for developing new products and services and (d) forging new partnerships among the entrepreneurs and also with the R&D institutions, grassroots innovation networks and the technology students. Some of the urgent steps required are: (a) technology audit of MSMEs by formal R&D institutions, (b) Creation of National Innovation and R&D Fund for MSMEs, dedicated for replacing age old materials, technologies and production processes, (c) awards for innovations by and for MSMEs, particularly, engaging youth as attempted by Karnataka Council of Science and Technology and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and (d) dedicated R&D centres for various industrial clusters. This is a painful time for the MSMEs and the workers being laid off. A bipartition approach is required among the major political parties to put forward a revitalization plan.
