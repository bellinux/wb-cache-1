For example, they participated in the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746–1786), and have continued to participate up to the present-day <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Iraq and Afghanistan. Puerto Rico became a U.S. Territory after the 1898 Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish–American War. The United States appointed a military governor and soon the United States Army established itself in San Juan.|$|E

5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E

Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors.|$|E

40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Management) This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the conflict and the concomitant disruption experienced in black urban secondary schools in the RSA. The causes, the nature {{and the extent of}} such conflict and disruption are indicated, and the attempts thus far, to manage such conflict, are discussed. Attention is also given to alternative methods of managing <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> an effort to curtail the disruption of schools so that unimpeded meaningful education may take place. The premise is that education is at the centre of <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> black communities and that unrest and disruption at schools constitutes a specific form of <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> the South African situation. The variable success rate achieved in attempting to combat <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> black schools through conventional methods of managing such conflict necessitates a search for alternative <b>conflict</b> management methods <b>in</b> education. This {{research focuses on}} the process of mediation as a technique for managing conflict. The main aim is to ascertain whether mediation may be employed to manage <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> black schools effectively. To achieve this aim, both a study of the literature and analytical research have been carried out by way of a questionnaire and interviews. The use of mediation as a technique for managing <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> schools overseas and the successes achieved in USA schools are also addressed. The conclusion is drawn that a very real need exists to use mediation as a technique for managing <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> black schools. This research shows that mediation is both an acceptable and a viable mechanism for the effective management of <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> black schools. Several recommendations are made on the use of mediation as a technique for minimising <b>conflict</b> and disruption <b>in</b> the field of education. It is recommended, inter alia. that all teacher training programmes should include courses on non-violent conflict management techniques. with the emphasis on mediation. Education authorities should put to use the resources and the skills of all institutions that have managed conflict through mediation...|$|R
