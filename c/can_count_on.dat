5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

Meanwhile, Doctor Doom conquers Earth, corrupting and creating clones of many of the heroes. In a final effort, the team travels to Latveria to confront Dr. Doom. The heroes use the M'Kraan Crystal and Muonic Inducer to weaken Doom. As the heroes weaken Doom, he is blasted by a bolt of lightning sent by a rejuvenated Odin, leaving nothing but his mask behind. As the heroes meet on the repaired Helicarrier, Nick Fury informs the heroes that the team must disband and asks if S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> them when another threat happens.

The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of communist ideology, the Party of Italian Communists and Communist Refoundation Party, within the same government as parties of Catholic inspiration, Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy and UDEUR Populars. The latter was led by Clemente Mastella, former chairman of Christian Democracy. Therefore, according to critics, {{it was difficult to}} have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in Afghanistan).|$|E

In 1997, Ocasek told a journalist that the band would never reunite: [...] "I'm saying never and you <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> that." [...] A partial reunion of the band occurred in 2005 when keyboardist Greg Hawkes and lead guitarist Elliot Easton toured with singer Todd Rundgren, drummer Prairie Prince and bassist Kasim Sulton as [...] "The New Cars"; neither Ocasek nor Cars drummer David Robinson participated, and the Rundgren lineup split following two years of touring.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Nows Kevin Ritchie criticized the song for its [...] "cutesy lyrics" [...] and [...] "insipid rhymes like [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> me like one, two, three". He {{added that the}} song doesn't {{contribute}} for the album cohesion, but add for a [...] "no-brainer radio references to Coldplay, U2, Michael Jackson, Sade, Feist and so on". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian concurred with the latter on the [...] "saccharine sound" [...] and explained that during the recording [...] "you start to boggle that Britain's teens are being fed something so sugary without Jamie Oliver getting a campaign up about it".|$|E

[...] 4Music's Jessica Lever called it [...] "another pop classic", and said, [...] "with the same sass as her debut song, we're sure this one's also going to rock the music world". Billboard said [...] "Lips Are Movin" [...] "is definitely {{in the same vein}} as 'All About That Bass,' which spells great things for the song...".

500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, {{who gave}} the album a C rating, wrote the review in a parody memo from Aguilera's point of view. He mocked at Aguilera's attempt at making Spanish-language album simply because of her Ecuadorian heritage, criticized her [...] "unnecessary" [...] high note", ballads that [...] "old Latin ladies'll like", and the photos used in the album's booklet. Mike Magnuson of HOB.com wrote a {{critical}} review of the album admonishing the photos in the record for attempting to make Aguilera look Latino which he insisted was a bad influence for the younger audience. Though he mentions that [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> her agreeable voice" [...] and lauded the use of Latin percussion and horns, he asserted that the record was [...] "purely a marketing scam gone too far." [...] Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel stated that [...] "Mi Reflejo lacks emotional depth, and her decision to record in Spanish seems more a bid to conquer new chart territory than anything else".|$|E
500|$|On March 30, Specter won {{the backing}} of the AFL-CIO, which was {{considered}} one of the most important endorsements in the primary race. It was one of several major labor endorsements Specter had received, including the state Service Employees International Union and the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represented 200,000 state teachers. Representatives from the AFL-CIO cited Specter's backing of President Obama's stimulus package as a major factor in their decision. Sestak criticized the union federation's decision, pointing out he had a 100 percent rating from the national AFL-CIO while Specter had a 61 percent rating. He also attacked Specter for previously backing President George W. Bush's economic policies and said, [...] "Pennsylvania workers need a Senator they <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> to be there when they need him, not only when he needs them during an election." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer writer Thomas Fitzgerald called the endorsement [...] "a powerful affirmation of how smoothly Specter has managed his political transition to the Democratic Party since leaving the Republican Party less than a year ago".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues even with her reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step things up and kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, she was good in a [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether she was a little overzealous or not".|$|E

Wong also promised that if elected, he would call upon the Prime Minister and Home Minister to immediately cease the legal dispute with the Christian churches over these matters to protect the freedom of religion in Malaysia for non-Muslims. The DAP has also challenge candidate Robert Lau to make his stand about the ban on non-Muslims using the word “Allah” with DAP MP Teresa Kok stating that [...] "If Robert Lau intends to be a Member of Parliament that speaks up for a Christian-majority constituency, Sibu, then he has the moral duty to declare his stand on this thorny issue, so that the voters in Sibu can decide whether they <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> him to speak up on this issue," [...] Another issue that was brought up during the by-election was {{the decision of the}} Home Ministry to destroy the 5,000 copies of Indonesian Bibles confiscated.|$|E

Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' Nothing I <b>can</b> <b>count</b> <b>on</b> and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting." [...] She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.|$|E
