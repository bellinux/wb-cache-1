5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the <b>common</b> <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

40|$|During 1927 and 1928, {{the writer}} made some {{studies of the}} sex {{reactions}} of the <b>common</b> glistening <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> fungus, Coprinus micaceus (Bull.) Fr. In this work fruiting bodies were produced in pure cultures started from spores. The methods employed differ in some respects from those used by other investigators of the sex reactions of the higher Basidiomycetes and, with the results, may prove of interest to many in the botanical field. Fruiting bodies of Coprinus micaceus were found growing abundantly in several locations within a few city blocks of the Ohio State University campus and thus {{a constant source of}} supply was assured throughout most of the summer. This fungus is often found in lawns, where shade trees have been removed and the roots left in the soil. Although not specific for Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) it was found growing commonly from the decaying roots of this species. Spore print...|$|R

5000|$|Coprinus comatus {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the <b>common</b> <b>Ink</b> <b>Cap,</b> which contains coprine and can induce coprine poisoning. Symptoms of coprine poisoning include vomiting, diarrhoea, palpitations and a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, some {{treatments}} were missed {{due to the}} pollution in substrate such as <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> growth. Although applying a pasteurization step assumes that the material used was not already heavily contaminated with microorganisms before it was pasteurized, the pasteurization condition can be revised in further studies. <b>Ink</b> <b>cap</b> (Coprinus spp.) fungi appeared on the substrate before mushroom fruiting. Coprinus indicates the presence of free ammonia or conversely a high content of nitrogen in the compost. On the other hand, the appearance of <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> fungi in the growing room indicates the low quality of substrate due to the disturbance of the fermentation and the substrate’s pasteurization process (Sharma et al. 2007). Sterilized substrate production and containers and use of plant products could considerably minimize the nematode damage to mushrooms and maximize the yields. Therefore, the need for substrate supplementation to complement is necessary to afford the nutrient requirement of the fungi {{in terms of both}} organic (carbon and nitrogen) and inorganic components.|$|R

50|$|Parasola plicatilis {{is a small}} saprotrophic {{mushroom}} with a plicate cap (diameter up to 35 mm). It is {{a widely}} distributed species in Europe and North America. This <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> species is a decomposer {{which can be found}} in grassy areas, alone, scattered or in small groups. The fruiting bodies grow at night after rain, and will self decompose after spore dispersion is achieved. Otherwise, they are quickly dried up in morning sunlight, or will eventually collapse beneath the weight of their caps.|$|R
5|$|Like many <b>ink</b> <b>caps,</b> {{it grows}} in tufts.

It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|R

The stipe has a loose ring and measures 10 - 40 cm high by 1 - 2.5 cm diameter. Microscopically it lacks pleurocystidia. The spore print is black-brown and the spores measure 10-13 by 6.5-8 µm. The flesh is white and the taste mild.|$|R
40|$|On 6 April 2003 {{a tragic}} {{accident}} {{led to the}} untimely death of Kees Uljé, mycologist and {{active member of the}} Netherlands’ Mycological Society. Kees’ first contact with mycology dated back some twenty years ago when, not being able to continue his profession as a roadworker, he became more and more interested in the study of agarics and taxonomy. In the first few years he acquired a general knowledge of mushrooms and toadstools, collecting and painting them in his own meticulous style, but gradually he became more and more involved in the study of <b>ink</b> <b>caps</b> (Coprinus),, eventually becoming one of the world’s leading specialists in this taxonomically and ecologically interesting and difficult group of fungi. This resulted not only in a series of popular and scientific papers, but also in a network of personal contacts with mycologists all over the world. Kees was typically a self-made man: with only a limited higher education, he nonetheless developed all the knowledge and skills necessary for his mycological studies. He had a gift for drawing and made beautiful illustrations for his publications. His affinity with computers and programming was put to good use to produce a unique website on Coprinus, and to develop an identification program, which could be down-loaded from his site, and not only served for the identification of <b>ink</b> <b>caps,</b> but also a wide range of other genera...|$|R

50|$|Coprinus comatus, the shaggy <b>ink</b> <b>cap,</b> lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is {{a common}} fungus often seen growing on lawns, along gravel roads and waste areas. The young fruit bodies first appear as white {{cylinders}} emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped caps open out. The caps are white, and covered with scales—this is {{the origin of the}} common names of the fungus. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with spores (hence the “ink cap” name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself {{in a matter of hours}} after being picked or depositing spores.|$|R

50|$|With {{the notable}} {{exception}} of the gigantic Phlebopus marginatus, possibly Australia's largest mushroom, {{many of the most}} conspicuous fungi have been introduced in association with exotic soil and trees; Lactarius deliciosus, Chalciporus piperatus, Suillus luteus and Suillus granulatus are European fungi found in pine plantations in Eastern Australia. The deadly Amanita phalloides is found under Oak in urban Canberra and Melbourne and has caused deaths. There are concerns at least one of them, Amanita muscaria is spreading into (and forming new mycorrhizal associations with) native Nothofagus woodland and possibly displacing local species. Lawns, farms and parklands see exotic fungi such as the shaggy <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> (Coprinus comatus), the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites and several species of Agaricus, including the edible A. bisporus and A. campestris as well as mildly poisonous A. xanthodermus.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{process of}} washing a check is {{relatively}} simple {{and can be}} accomplished with basic solvents. The actual solvent is largely irrelevant — more importantly, the polarity of the solvent must match the polarity of the dye in the ink. For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (e.g. acetone or isopropanol). Both nail polish remover (acetone) and rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) are able to pull most <b>common</b> <b>inks</b> away from paper in minutes. Similarly, a non-polar dye would require a non-polar solvent (e.g. toluene or a similar hydrocarbon).|$|R
500|$|Coprinopsis variegata, {{commonly}} known as the scaly <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> or the feltscale inky cap, is a species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. Distributed in eastern North America, it has a medium-sized, bell-shaped to flattened cap up to [...] in diameter, with felt-like, patchy scales. The gills, initially white, turn black in maturity and eventually dissolve into a black [...] "ink". Fruit bodies grow in clusters or groups on leaf litter or rotted hardwood, although the wood may be buried, giving the appearance of growing in the soil. The fungus is found in the United States, in areas east of the Great Plains. Coprinus ebulbosus and Coprinus quadrifidus are names assigned by Charles Horton Peck to what he believed were species distinct from C.variegata; they were later shown to represent the same species, and are now [...] synonyms.
