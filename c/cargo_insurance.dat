40|$|Abstract –Piracy {{continues}} to be a very real problem for ship operators, ship owners, <b>cargo</b> owners, <b>insurance</b> companies, flag states, and host states. Fortunately, the nature and locations of modern day acts of piracy tend to be fairly predictable and are concentrated in certain regions of the world. Potential acts of maritime terrorism are highly unpredictable and pose a worldwide threat since terrorists may attack a country’s interests abroad. Commercial ship operators can take concrete steps to help defend themselves against maritime terrorism and piracy. Many ship self defense countermeasures against piracy and maritime terrorism are simple and inexpensive to implement. Developing a thorough ship security plan is essential for commercial ship self defense. I...|$|R

40|$|This report reviews {{research}} on the potential affect cold climate might have on cargoes carried onboard commercial vessels. Due to the recent years’ shrinkage and melting of the sea ice in the Arctic {{the possibility of a}} shorter route between Asia and Europe has been enhanced. Companies within the shipping industry hope to benefit from the reduced fuel costs and shorter transit time that the Northern Sea Route (NSR) could offer. With the increased interest from shipping companies, the need for increased knowledge of the potential risks for cargoes has emerged. This report provides an overview of the NSR as well as presenting possible affects on cargoes and related equipment in cold Arctic climate. The research focuses on three primary cargo segments identified as General and Unitised Cargo, Liquid Bulk and Dry Bulk. Information has been gathered by interviewing proficient personnel within the shipping industry such as ship-owners within the different <b>cargo</b> segments, <b>insurance</b> companies with experience and knowledge of potential damage to cargoes, and cargo owners with great knowledge about their cargoes’ properties. We have managed to compile the information into a report that provides a general picture of potential affects within our chosen cargo segments. The risk factors that have been identified in this report have also made us aware of the available solutions. If shipping wants to use the Northern Sea Route as a new commercial shipping route they must be aware of risk factors such as solidification, condensation, and required heating precautions as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the solutions for these problems. It is especially important in such a remote area as the Arctic Ocean, where infrastructure and support are undeveloped. Nevertheless, the common opinion from our interview objects is that there are generally no increased problems to ship cargoes in a cold climate as long as the cargo related gear operates properly. This report will present some cargoes that are examples of specific properties that without certain precautions get affected if transported in a cold climate...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{introduces the}} inspection and survey of ships {{looking at this}} intricate topic from several different viewpoints. Numerous stakeholders play various roles in the shipping industry, ranging from ship and <b>cargo</b> owners to <b>insurance</b> companies, from society at large represented by maritime administrations to regulatory and inspection bodies, etc. As shipping is intrinsically an international and strategic business, its regulations and standards, {{as well as the}} relevant inspection activities have long been the subject of international agreement. Indeed, due to the large number of actors on the scene, the inspection and survey regime of ships is not easy to unravel. Though many books and documents present the matter from the viewpoint of one of the stakeholders, very few give an overall presentation of this subject in a rational way. Some bibliographical references are provided {{at the end of this}} chapter, together with some brief explanations for further elucidation. In the following, the ship inspection or survey is treated as an event occurring at various times within a shipï¿½s life. As such, the discussion starts by identifying who requires, and who carries out inspections and surveys. This is done in some detail, thus introducing the main regulatory instruments (rules and conventions) applicable to ships and the various inspection and survey bodies which verify their application. A brief summary is given of the frequency of inspections and surveys, operational and environmental conditions during inspections and the location on ships and of items to be inspected or surveyed. A more comprehensive description of items to be inspected or surveyed and relevant degradation modes and/or expected defects follows, with particular reference to structural deterioration. State of the art of inspection and survey methods and techniques are reviewed: the focus is not on non-destructive testing (NDT) or test techniques, rather on the onboard practices covering safety measures, accessibility and scope and extension of inspections and surveys. Although NDT techniques are applied, the survey practice and management is the dominant factor, crucial for the success of the survey or inspection. The conclusion of this chapter deals with the Inspection Matrix: such a matrix is a proposal to establish a rational tool for the judgment of the ship inspection and survey regime, identifying areas that may be subject to possible over-inspection and areas possibly requiring further strengthening of the inspection and survey regime. The terms 'inspection' and 'survey' are often incorrectly used as synonyms. Within the marine environment they carry quite different definitions. An inspection is a verification that a specific item, whether a piece of structure or item of equipment, meets a specific regulatory or other standard at the time that it is inspected. For example, a flag State inspector will verify that a fire extinguisher certificate is current and has not expired at the time that it is visually inspected. At a scheduled inspection, all fire extinguishers on the ship will be checked to verify compliance in this manner. A survey is carried out by a classification society surveyor. It is a risk-based approach to assessing the overall compliance of a vesselï¿½s structure and machinery with the applicable Rules of that society by sampling based on empirical experience. Such sampling allows the surveyor to use his professional judgment to determine if the vessel will continue to remain in compliance with the relevant Rule requirement for the period until the next scheduled survey. The sampling approach is necessary because of the size and complexity of modern ships. For example, a large tanker will have many kilometers of welds within its hull structure. It is not practical to visually inspect every centimeter of those welds on a periodic basis. However, experience will indicate that certain areas of the ship are subject to higher stress or greater corrosion and so the survey will focus on those areas. A further term 'audit'' should also be introduced as certain regulatory requirements are subject to periodic audit. These are principally the ISM and ISPS Codes. These are management systems. Verification of compliance is carried out through an audit of the system by a trained auditor. In many instances the classification society surveyor will attend a ship in multiple roles: he may conduct a periodic class survey; he may then act as a flag State inspector to conduct a regulatory inspection; and, if appropriately trained, he may then act as an auditor to verify continued compliance with the statutorily mandated ISM and ISPS Codes...|$|R
50|$|The law of {{fundamental}} breach was historically {{treated as an}} extension of the doctrine of deviation. The development of this doctrine can be traced down to the first half of the 19th century, when Tindal C.J. stated in Davis v. Garrett that deviation made by the carrier from the agreed voyage route brings the latter outside of contract and therefore outside of exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This harsh attitude to deviation cases originated from the earlier marine insurance practice when <b>cargo</b> <b>insurance</b> policy was lost in case of deviation. Thereby strict obligations imposed to the carrier were designed to afford protection to the cargo owner.|$|E

The insurers cited and relied on Mayban General Insurance v Alstom Power Plants. [...] Mayban had held that goods tendered for shipment had to be capable of withstanding the forces that they could ordinarily be expected to encounter during the voyage. The court held that Mayan was wrongly decided as, if it were to stand, it would wrongly reduce the scope of <b>cargo</b> <b>insurance</b> cover to loss through perils of the sea that was [...] "exceptional, unforeseen or unforeseeable".|$|E

5000|$|Cargo insurance: [...] <b>Cargo</b> <b>insurance</b> is underwritten on the Institute Cargo Clauses, with {{coverage}} on an A, B, or C basis, A having the widest cover and C the most restricted. Valuable cargo {{is known as}} specie. Institute Clauses also exist for the insurance of specific types of cargo, such as frozen food, frozen meat, and particular commodities such as bulk oil, coal, and jute. Often these insurance conditions are developed for a specific group {{as is the case}} with the Institute Federation of Oils, Seeds and Fats Associations (FOFSA) Trades Clauses which have been agreed with the Federation of Oils, Seeds and Fats Associations and Institute Commodity Trades Clauses which are used for the insurance of shipments of cocoa, coffee, cotton, fats and oils, hides and skins, metals, oil seeds, refined sugar, and tea and have been agreed with the Federation of Commodity Associations.|$|E
5000|$|The Marine Insurance Act includes, as a schedule, a {{standard}} policy (known as the [...] "SG form"), which parties were {{at liberty to}} use if they wished. Because each term in the policy had been tested through at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was extremely thorough. However, it was also expressed in rather archaic terms. In 1991, the London market produced a new standard policy wording known as the MAR 91 form using the Institute Clauses. The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; the Institute Clauses are used to set out the detail of the insurance cover. In practice, the policy document usually consists of the MAR form used as a cover, with the Clauses stapled to the inside. Typically, each clause will be stamped, with the stamp overlapping both onto the inside cover and to other clauses; this practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses.because marine insurance is typically underwritten on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: We, the Underwriters, agree to bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another .... In legal terms, liability under the policy is several and not joint, i.e., the underwriters are all liable together, but only for their share or proportion of the risk. If one underwriter should default, the remainder are not liable to pick {{his share of the}} claim. Typically, marine insurance is split between the vessels and the <b>cargo.</b> <b>Insurance</b> of the vessels is generally known as [...] "Hull and Machinery" [...] (H&M). A more restricted form of cover is [...] "Total Loss Only" [...] (TLO), generally used as a reinsurance, which only covers the total loss of the vessel and not any partial loss. Cover may be on either a [...] "voyage" [...] or [...] "time" [...] basis.
