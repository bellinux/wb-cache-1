40|$|Multiple-class multiple-resource (MCMR) systems, {{where each}} class of {{customers}} requires {{a particular set of}} resources, are common. These systems are often analyzed under steady-state conditions. We describe a simple method, referred to as Z-iteration, to estimate both transient and steady-state performances of such systems. The method makes use of results and techniques available from queueing theory, network analysis, dynamic flow theory, and numerical analysis. We show the generality of the Z-iteration by applying it to an ATM network, a parallel disk system, and a distributed batch system. Validations against discreteevent simulations show the accuracy and computational advantages of the Z-iteration. 1 Introduction We consider a general multiple-class multiple-resource (MCMR) system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the development, experiments and evaluation of the iFloor, an interactive floor prototype installed at the local central municipality library. The {{primary purpose of the}} iFloor prototype is to support and stimulate community interaction between collocated people. The context of the library demands that any user can walk up and use the prototype without any devices or prior introduction. To achieve this, the iFloor proposes innovative interaction (modes/paradigms/patterns) for floor surfaces through the means of video tracking. Browsing and selecting content is done in a collaborative process and mobile phones are used for posting messages onto the floor.

This consists primarily {{of the development}} and support of VisIt, a data analysis and visualization tool. Support ranges from answering questions about the tool, providing classes {{on how to use}} the tool, and performing data analysis and visualization for customers. The Information Management and Graphics Group supports and develops tools that enhance our ability to access, display, and understand large, complex data sets. Activities include applying visualization software for large scale data exploration; running video production labs on two networks; supporting graphics libraries and tools for end users; maintaining PowerWalls and assorted other displays; and developing software for searching and managing scientific data. Researchers in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) work on various projects including the development of visualization techniques for large scale data exploration that are funded by the ASC program, among others. The researchers also have LDRD projects and collaborations with other lab researchers, academia, and industry. The IMG group is located in the Terascale Simulation Facility, home to Dawn, Atlas, BGL, and others, which includes both classified and unclassified visualization theaters, a visualization <b>computer</b> <b>floor</b> and deployment workshop, and video production labs. We continued to provide the traditional graphics group consulting and video production support. We maintained five PowerWalls and many other displays. We deployed a 576 -node Opteron/IB cluster with 72 TB of memory providing a visualization production server on our classified network. We continue to support a 128 -node Opteron/IB cluster providing a visualization production server for our unclassified systems and an older 256 -node Opteron/IB cluster for the classified systems, as well as several smaller clusters to drive the PowerWalls. The visualization production systems includes NFS servers to provide dedicated storage for data analysis and visualization. The ASC projects have delivered new versions of visualization and scientific data management tools to end users and continue to refine them. VisIt had 4 releases during the past year, ending with VisIt 2. 0. We released version 2. 4 of Hopper, a Java application for managing and transferring files. This release included a graphical disk usage view which works on all types of connections and an aggregated copy feature for quickly transferring massive datasets quickly and efficiently to HPSS.

However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that [...] "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that [...] "It's not important if the customer knows that.

40|$|The {{revitalisation}} {{of existing}} buildings {{is getting more}} and more important. We are facing a situation where in many cases {{there is no need to}} design new buildings because an increasing number of existing buildings is not used anymore. The most ecological procedure to revitalise these buildings would be through a continuous usage and by making few or no alterations to the stock. Thus, the modus operandi could be named a “non-destructive” approach. From the architects' point of view, non-destructive redesign of existing buildings is time-consuming and complex. The methodology we developed to aid architects in solving such tasks is based on exchanging or swapping utilisation of specific rooms to converge in a design solution. With the aid of mathematical rules, which will be executed by the use of a <b>computer,</b> solutions to <b>floor</b> space relocation problems will be generated.
