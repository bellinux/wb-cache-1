2500|$|According to the SEC {{indictment}} against Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, two {{back office}} workers {{who worked for}} Madoff, they created false trading reports based on the returns that Madoff ordered for each customer. For example, when Madoff determined a customer's return, one of the back office workers would enter a false trade report with a previous date and then enter a false <b>closing</b> <b>trade</b> in the amount required to produce the required profit, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege that Bongiorno used a computer program specially designed to backdate trades and manipulate account statements. They quote her as writing to a manager in the early 1990s [...] "I need the ability to give any settlement date I want." [...] In some cases, returns were allegedly determined before the account was even opened.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{trade in}} Guangzhou existed {{primarily}} through private traders {{and without the}} supervision and supporting authority of the United States government. [...] Soon after 1784, an American consul was appointed in Guangzhou and functioned as a reporting agent on trade to the U.S. government. [...] The consul was not recognized by the Chinese authorities or the hoppo, and {{was not allowed to}} fly the American flag over its factory until well after 1799. The Americans had to trade with the Chinese as subordinates instead of equals and use the cohong for any and all demands. [...] Consequently, the Americans did not have the leverage to raise political or legal protests and had to submit themselves to the Chinese justice system that believed in a [...] "life for a life" [...] and holding groups accountable for the actions of individuals. [...] The chief concern of foreign traders was preventing the Chinese from <b>closing</b> <b>trade,</b> as they could threaten to do over legal disputes.|$|E

This occurred in 1893, which formalized the Egba United Government based in Abẹokuta which became recognized by the United Kingdom. In 1914, the city was made part of the colony of Nigeria by the British.|$|E

50|$|Some Order Management Systems go a {{step further}} in their trade {{allocation}} process by providing taxlot assignment. Because investment managers are graded on unrealized profit & loss, but the investor needs to pay capital gains on realized profit & loss; it is often beneficial for the investor that the exact share/contract uses in a <b>closing</b> <b>trade</b> be carefully chosen. For example, selling older shares rather than newly acquired shares may reduce the effective tax rate. This information {{does not need to be}} finalized until capital gains are to be paid or until taxes are to be filed, OMS taxlot assignments are considered usually tentative. The taxlot assignments remade or recorded within the Accounting System are considered definitive.|$|E

40|$|In the {{standard}} Krugman (1979) non-CES trade model, several asymmetric countries typically lose from increasing trade costs. However, all countries transiently benefit from such increase {{at the moment}} of <b>closing</b> <b>trade,</b> under almost-prohibitive trade costs (i. e., near autarky, which is possible only under non-CES preferences). In other words, during trade liberalization the first step from autarky to trade is necessarily harmful. Our explanation rests on market distortion and business destruction effects...|$|E

40|$|International credit, {{financial}} integration and the euro Jan Toporowski* Prospects for the European Monetary Union are inevitably {{affected by the}} theoretical presuppositions of the observer. The most common approach, the theory of optimal cur-rency areas, postulates that traded goods are produced by labour and the exchange rate between ‘national ’ currencies is the ratio of commodity wages, expressed in monetary units, in different countries. In this analysis the exchange rate and wages are substitutes for obtaining international ‘competitiveness’. Such a view {{is the basis for}} current reflec-tions {{about the future of the}} euro and the reduction of its difficulties to relative wages rates in different countries of the eurozone. The theory has two important limitations. First, it takes no account of the import intensity of exports, which would require wage adjustments to reinforce exchange rate adjustments, so that wages and exchange rates are necessarily complementary parameters, rather than being substitutes for each other. Hence, exit from the eurozone as a means of <b>closing</b> <b>trade</b> deficits would require addi-tional austerity. Even more importantly, it is a commodity money theory, in which imbal-ances are accommodated by accumulations of specie or fiat money. However, in a credit economy, banking systems absorb trade imbalances into their balance sheets. Moreover, {{financial integration}} means that banking systems throughout Europe are vulnerable to balance sheet risks from exchange rate depreciation in any country in Europe...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{evidence}} of the theoretical relationship between exchange rate and inflation has been a difficult proposition in an exchange rate market, despite many studies in developed markets. Three recent papers employing a new research design, Theil’s Divisia index method, found that this relationship holds only in the long run, given the sticky price hypothesis. However, this relationship {{has not yet been}} tested for economic regions with <b>close</b> <b>trading</b> networks. The use of this method enables us to resolve a longstanding issue as to the veracity of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This paper presents results that suggest long-run equilibria in two <b>close</b> <b>trading</b> regions, within both developed and emerging economies. We believe that these findings on long-run equilibrium and the length of time to equilibrium will enrich the literature on exchange rate market behaviour in both developed and emerging markets...|$|R
