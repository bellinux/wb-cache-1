Each <b>cathetometer</b> has a horizontal travel of 1. 8 m and a vertical travel of 1. 2 m. The cathetometers are required to measure X, Y, and Z coordinates (see figure) to within plus or minus 0. 005 in. (plus or minus 0. 127 mm). Each <b>cathetometer</b> consists of an alignment telescope on a platform mounted on a two-dimensional translation stage. The knowledge required for calibration of each <b>cathetometer</b> is (1) the two-dimensional position of the <b>cathetometer</b> platform {{as a function of the}} electronic readouts of position encoders on the translation stage and (2) the amount of any angular misalignment (roll, pitch, and/or yaw) of the <b>cathetometer</b> platform as a function of the two-dimensional coordinates or the position-encoder readouts.

30|$|A {{calibrated}} dilatometer with {{a volume}} of 3.594  mL made of heat-resistant glass was put into a water jacket equipped with a UT- 15 thermostat. The temperature of heat carrier (distilled water) was controlled with a TL- 6 thermometer (measuring accuracy ± 0.1  °C). The volume change was measured with a KM- 6 <b>cathetometer</b> (measuring accuracy ± 0.001  mm). The passed time of the reaction was measured with a stopwatch. The accuracy of time measurement does not exceed 1  s during 30  min. To prepare the solution of monomer, 0.05  mol of monomeric complex, 5  mL of dimethylformamide, and 2, 2 ′-azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) in amount of 1 % w/w were put into a beaker and stirred until complete dissolution. The homogeneous solution thus obtained was transferred into the dilatometer with a long funnel. The dilatometer was attached to a vacuum pump and an argon tank by a three-way stopcock. The cooled dilatometer was firstly vacuumized and then filled with argon. This procedure was carried out three times. Prepared dilatometer filled with argon was sealed, and the reference point was set with the <b>cathetometer</b> at 20.0  °C. Afterwards, the dilatometer was put into the water jacket (the temperature of heat carrier was maintained at 80.0  °C) and the contraction of the solution was monitored with <b>cathetometer.</b> The time reading was started {{in a few minutes}} after the initial thermal expansion of liquid had finished. The stopwatch’s readings were taken in 1 – 5 -min increments depending on the rate of contraction. After the polymerization had been completed, the dilatometer was taken out from the water jacket and put into ice-cold water. Its content was quantitatively transferred into a beaker with isopropyl alcohol to precipitate the polymeric complex. The precipitate was filtered off on a glass filter # 16 and dried in a vacuum dryer at 40  °C to a constant mass.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is supported by}} the Dutch Heart Foundation One of the factors thought responsible for the failure of small-diameter vascular prostheses is the haemodynamic influence of the difference in compliance between the artery and the prosthesis. Therefore, an experimental setup is built to measure the mechanical behaviour of these prostheses. Quasi-static tests have been performed on elastic tubes of latex and silicone, a small-diameter prosthesis of Corvita and a small-diameter prosthesis of Gore. The porosity problem of the Corvita prosthesis is overcome by mounting the much more compliant, but water-tight silicone rubber tube inside the prosthesis. Pressure is measured by a mercury manometer and the diameter is measured optically by a <b>cathetometer.</b> Highly anisotropic material behaviour was found for the Gore prosthesis. The Corvita prosthesis behaves anisotropic as well. Furthermore, the stiffness of this prosthesis seems to increase at higher strains. 1 Samenvattin...|$|E
40|$|Intensity {{broadening}} of internally reflected {{laser beam}} from a meniscus formed in a capillary pore—applied for automated liquid column height measurements K. D. Kihm, D. M. Pratt Abstract An automated liquid column height measure-ment technique using the {{total internal reflection}} of a collimated laser beam from the convex meniscus surface is proposed. This new technique can alleviate the short-comings of the traditional <b>cathetometer</b> that tends to introduce user bias. Experimental measurements and theoretical predictions have been conducted to examine the detected signal broadening and measurement uncer-tainties of the proposed technique, resulting from (1) the finite laser-beam diameter, (2) the capillary pore diameter, (3) the beam steering by thermal gradients, and (4) the beam steering by density variations of the liquid inside a capillary pore. For the collimated 52. 6 -lm diameter laser beam, for three different tested pores of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mm diameter, the overall uncertainty of the wicking height measurement {{is estimated to be}} ± 12 lm in the case of on-axis detection, and ± 24 lm in the case of off-axis detection. ...|$|E

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) [I] is {{a relatively}} new process that is being investigated world-wide as a low cost, energy saving alternative to conventional separation processes such as distillation and reverse osmosis (RO). This process offers some advantages compared to other more popular separation processes, such as working at room conditions (pressure and temperature); low-grade, waste and/or alternative energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy may be used; a very high level of rejection with inorganic solutions; small equipment can be employed, etc. The driving force in MD processes is the vapor pressure difference across the membrane. A temperature difference is imposed across the membrane, which results in a vapor pressure difference. The principal problem in this kind of system is the accurate measurement of the recipient volume change, especially at very low flows. A <b>cathetometer,</b> with up to 0, 05 min resolution, is the instrument used to take these measurements, but the necessary human intervention makes this instrument not suitable for automated systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new high}} {{precision}} automatic measurement system for liquid level measurement in membrane distillation application is presented. Membrane distillation (MD) {{is a relatively new}} process that is being investigated worldwide. It has some advantages in relation to other separation processes such as conventional distillation and reverse osmosis (110), which are: high quality of distillate, low operating temperatures, low operating pressure, low power consumption allowing the use of alternative energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy. For MD process it is necessary a very high precision system to measure the solution level in the reservoirs, able to detect changes smaller than 0. 05 mm. This is due to the small fluxes through the membrane, and therefore it is necessary to detect the small changes produced in the liquid levels in the reservoirs. Until now such measurement has been made manually, by means of a <b>cathetometer,</b> but it resulted very uncomfortable. In order to overcome this issue, a high resolution and accuracy system (0. 013 +/- 0. 008 mm), that makes automatic measurements of both reservoirs, cold and hot, is proposed. This system is based on a laser beam, assisted with a high resolution 3 Mpixels CMOS camera and a computer vision processor implemented in a FPGA, with a measurement rate up to 12 times per second...|$|E

The time-dependent amounts of CO 2 were recorded with a telescopic <b>cathetometer</b> and analyzed by using a one-dimensional diffusion model to obtain diffusion coefficients of CO 2 in two ILs, namely, 1 -n-butyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim] [PF 6]) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim] [BF 4]) at pressures up to 10 MPa. Solubility data of CO 2 in the two ILs up to 20 MPa were also obtained from its equilibrium masses and compared with those reported in the literature. The Peng-Robinson equation of state with the van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules was employed to correlate the experimental solubility data, revealing satisfactory calculation results. The measured diffusion coefficients of CO 2 in [bmim][PF 6] and [bmim][BF 4] separately increase from 3. 550 X 10 (- 10) to 6. 064 x 10 (- 10) m(2) /s and from 7. 184 x 10 (- 10) to 9. 880 x 10 (- 10) m(2) /s following the pressure increase from 2. 0 to 10. 0 MPa at 323. 2 K, while those at 5. 0 MPa and different temperatures follow the Arrhenius equation, providing the diffusion activation energies of 25. 53 and 20. 30 kJ/mol for the [bmim][PF 6]-CO 2 and [bmim][BF 4]-CO 2 systems, respectively...|$|E

40|$|After {{exploring}} {{a large number}} of sparingly soluble systems, the author obtained good rings with the following materials in the agar agar gel a) Lead silicate, b) silver molybdate, c) thorium oxinate, d) cadmium oxinate, e) cupric chromate and f) thorium carbonate. Out of these systems, Liesegang rings of cupric chromate are found to be reported in the past literature. Since no quantitative studies were made on this system and this system was found {{to be one of the}} best, from the view point of possessing detailed macro and micro structures, it has been purposely included in this thesis to reflect more light on the mechanism of formation of Liesegang rings. Out of six systems, four systems were of white colour and two systems were of greenish yellow and scarlet red cum dark yellow colour respectively. White rings system of lead silicate and thorium carbonate were very similar to one another in appearance and in their large number, produced in the test tubes. These rings were of thin discs nature separated by medium spacing, just somewhat micro spicing reported in some systems. Contrary to these two systems, thorium and cadmium oxinate produced a few number somewhat thicker rings separated by large void spaces. Cupric chromate system produced one category of system with M/ 20 concentration of internal electrolyte, but largely different in the remaining lower concentrations of internal electrolyte. Rings obtained with M/ 20 internal electrolyte had all the combinations of the three types of structures, viz. Revert type alternate coloured band followed by clear spaces and in between these precipitate rings occurred the micro structure fringes. In these studies the distances between the consecutive rings were measured with the help of a <b>cathetometer.</b> The data obtained are processed as per equation 			Log (Xn – Xn- 1) = A + α Xn And plotted in various figures. These figures were used for the verification of the validity of logarithmic equation and thus the indirectly the validity of Mathur’s Damped Harmonic Wave Diffusion Theory. Different curves drawn for different concentrations of external and internal electrolytes for each system depicted the influence of the concentrations on the rings spacing obeying the following relationship. 			(Xn – Xn- 1) = [P(S/CoC’o) ] eαxn In some of the systems like lead silicate and thorium carbonate the number of rings was fairly large and uniformly distributed. Hence, in these two cases the ring points were falling more precisely on straight line curves than in some other systems in which the number of rings produced were less and the disturbance effect of temperature etc., sometime is more pronounced as in the case of silver molybdate. In some systems which produced broad rings separated by large void spaces such as the one thorium oxinate, it could be observed that even the thickness of the precipitate rings changes from ring to ring and also from test tube to test tube for the nth ring with respect to the concentration of the electrolyte. Data on thickness of the rings are also recorded in this particular case. The author investigated qualitatively and quantitatively in detail six different systems of periodic precipitations and verified the validity of Wave Harmonic Diffusion Theory of Mathur for Liesegang Rings are found that the data obtained on these few systems studied for under the present research work fits in the theory and the equations derived by Mathur...|$|E
40|$|Lidar is {{a useful}} tool for taking {{metrology}} measurements without the need for physical contact with the parts under test. Lidar instruments are aimed at a target using azimuth and elevation stages, then focus a beam of coherent, frequency modulated laser energy onto the target, such as the surface of a mechanical structure. Energy from the reflected beam is mixed with an optical reference signal that travels in a fiber path internal to the instrument, and the range to the target is calculated based on the difference in the frequency of the returned and reference signals. In cases when the parts are in extreme environments, additional steps need to be taken to separate the operator and lidar from that environment. A model has been developed that accurately reduces the lidar data to an absolute position and accounts for the three media in the testbed air, fused silica, and vacuum but the approach can be adapted for any environment or material. The accuracy of laser metrology measurements depends upon knowing the parameters of the media through which the measurement beam travels. Under normal conditions, this means knowledge of the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the air in the measurement volume. In the past, chamber windows have been used to separate the measuring device from the extreme environment within the chamber and still permit optical measurement, but, so far, only relative changes have been diagnosed. The ability to make accurate measurements through a window presents a challenge as {{there are a number of}} factors to consider. In the case of the lidar, the window will increase the time-of-flight of the laser beam causing a ranging error, and refract the direction of the beam causing angular positioning errors. In addition, differences in pressure, temperature, and humidity on each side of the window will cause slight atmospheric index changes and induce deformation and a refractive index gradient within the window. Also, since the window is a dispersive media, the effect of both phase and group indices have to be considered. Taking all these factors into account, a method was developed to measure targets through multiple regions of different materials and produce results that are absolute measurements of target position in three-dimensional space, rather than simply relative position. The environment in which the lidar measurements are taken must be broken down into separate regions of interest and each region solved for separately. In this case, there were three regions of interest: air, fused silica, and vacuum. The angular position of the target inside the chamber is solved using only phase index and phase velocity, while the ranging effects due to travel from air to glass to vacuum/air are solved with group index and group velocity. When all parameters are solved simultaneously, an absolute knowledge of the position of each target within an environmental chamber can be derived. Novel features of this innovation include measuring absolute position of targets through multiple dispersive and non-dispersive media, deconstruction of lidar raw data from a commercial off-the-shelf unit into reworkable parameters, and use of group velocities to reduce range data. Measurement of structures within a vacuum chamber or other harsh environment, such as a furnace, may now be measured as easily as if they were in an ambient laboratory. This analysis permits transformation of the raw data into absolute spatial units (e. g., mm). This technique has also been extended to laser tracker, theodolite, and <b>cathetometer</b> measurements through refractive media...|$|E
