5000|$|Controversy erupted over <b>concessionary</b> <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> {{the elderly}} and disabled. Originally, it was planned that <b>concessionary</b> <b>travel,</b> that {{is the ability of}} those with a Scottish National Entitlement Card to travel on public {{transport}} free-of-charge, {{was not going to be}} offered on the tramway. This was despite the fact that Edinburgh Trams is to be run by Lothian Buses, who are mandated to offer free travel to those with concession cards on all their bus routes. This revelation quickly caused city leaders to support an Edinburgh Evening News campaign to ensure that <b>concessionary</b> <b>travel</b> would be offered on the new tramway. City transport convener Lesley Hinds stated [...] "People in Edinburgh have paid through their council tax and their taxes for the trams to get up and running and it would be wrong for a large proportion of the population not to be allowed to use their concessionary bus pass".Despite this, the Scottish Government refused to pay <b>for</b> <b>concessionary</b> <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid <b>for</b> tram <b>travel,</b> but that they should be paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|R

Using data from Scotland and the UK more generally, this paper provides an analysis of likely changes in bus use by elderly people over the next 13 years, showing that numbers of total trips {{would be likely to}} remain constant in the absence of scheme changes, in spite of a 19 % increase in the total number of elderly people.

50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of service 701 and {{introduction of the}} new low-floor bus fleet for the replacement Aberystwyth to Cardiff (X40) service sparked concerns and complaints about the suitability of a service bus for the four-hour journey. There was no on-board toilet, which did not make an ideal situation for such a distance. Toilet breaks (even though there are limited facilities along the rural route) would be frowned upon as they would interfere with the timetable. The X40 also did not accept <b>concessionary</b> <b>travel</b> passes <b>for</b> <b>travel</b> over the section south of Carmarthen.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{transportation}} poses difficult dilemmas {{for social and}} environmental policy. There is broad agreement {{that a variety of}} 'carrot' and 'stick' measures are needed. This article asks whether tax-free <b>travel</b> vouchers <b>for</b> <b>employees</b> could be important as incentives or 'carrots' to encourage the use of public transport. The basic idea of it is like Luncheon Vouchers for public transport. Employers issue the vouchers and claim the tax back from the Government. Potentially, travel vouchers could generate a 'win-win' situation in which transport operators' rising revenues justified new services and these, in turn, encouraged more passengers. The research described here uses survey data and the National Travel Survey to examine acceptability and potential fiscal impact of a rural tax-free travel voucher scheme throughout the UK. These results show that there is sufficient acceptance of the idea of travel vouchers in rural areas to justify the further development of this policy. ...|$|R
