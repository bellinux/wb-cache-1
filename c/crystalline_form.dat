5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral <b>crystalline</b> <b>form.</b> An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense <b>crystalline</b> <b>form</b> of water.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{nonmetals}} {{exist as}} diatomic molecules in their standard states: hydrogen (H2); nitrogen (N2); oxygen (O2); fluorine (F2); chlorine (Cl2); bromine (Br2); and iodine (I2). They are generally highly insulating, highly electronegative, non-reflective gases, noting that bromine, a liquid, and iodine, a solid, are both volatile at room temperature. Exceptions to this generalised description {{occur at the}} boundaries of the category: hydrogen has a comparatively low electronegativity due to its unique atomic structure; iodine, in <b>crystalline</b> <b>form,</b> is semi-lustrous, and a semiconductor in the direction of its layers, both of these attributes being consistent with incipient metallic character.|$|E

The all-trans form Ip exhibits the largest cohesive energy, bulk, and Young’s modulus among the nine <b>crystalline</b> <b>forms.</b> The DFT calculations suggest that the δ <b>crystalline</b> <b>forms</b> (IIIau, IIIpu, IIIpd, and IIIad) possess poor chain rigidity among the nine PVDF <b>crystalline</b> <b>forms.</b> In contrast, a change of relative orientation of PVDF chains {{does not lead to}} significant change in cohesive energy and mechanic properties.

5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the <b>crystalline</b> <b>form</b> of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second <b>crystalline</b> <b>form</b> was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
