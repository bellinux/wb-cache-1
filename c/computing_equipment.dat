Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations. However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment. Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets and municipal or private recycling centers. Computing supplies, such as printer cartridges, paper, and batteries may be recycled as well.|$|E

40|$|Provisioning {{for power}} failure is an {{important}} element of data center design. It is important to assess both tangible and intangible costs of unplanned data center downtime. These costs must be compared with the capital cost of providing various levels of backup power infrastructure to <b>compute</b> and cooling <b>equipment.</b> Various levels of backup power infrastructure each lead to a most probable transient scenario after utility power failure. Because of differences between facilities, the level of risk that unacceptable <b>compute</b> <b>equipment</b> inlet temperature associated with each level of backup power infrastructure is not standardized; in particular, facilities with differing <b>compute</b> <b>equipment</b> power densities may require different levels of backup power infrastructure to maintain safe operation. Choosing one level of backup power infrastructure above another is not necessarily obvious for every facility, as there may be large gaps in costs and unknown levels of risk for lower levels of provisioning. A first order model is also used to compare inclusion of various thermal capacitance values with experimental results. Room level experiments also illustrate the relative level of risk associated with various levels of provisioning for the same control volume and <b>compute</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although provisioning to back up as much equipment as possible remains the "safest" solution, cost will continue to play a factor in facility design decisions. This work offers a step toward appropriate modeling of data center power failure events and suggests further steps to continue the process. M. S. Committee Chair: Yogendra K.

25|$|Sweden {{has had an}} {{economic}} model in the post-World War II era, characterized by close cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high taxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international economic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published in Computer Sweden in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for information technology and <b>computing</b> <b>equipment,</b> except in the financial and banking sector, {{the part of the}} industry that created the crisis. The investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992 there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange rate. Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.|$|E

50|$|If {{the design}} of the {{liquid-cooling}} system allows for high coolant temperatures, energy can be saved or even reused, depending on the climate conditions and on the local infrastructure. For example, free cooling is possible if the coolant temperature is higher than the ambient temperature. In that case the energy for chillers can be saved. If the coolant temperature is even higher, the waste heat from the <b>compute</b> <b>equipment</b> could be used for heating purposes or to drive an adsorption chiller to generate chilled water. The former option is implemented, e.g., by theLeibniz-Rechenzentrum in Germany, where SuperMUC drives the heating of the data center during winter with roughly 1 MW recovered from the <b>compute</b> <b>equipment.</b> The latter option, which is the design target of iDataCool, requires a high quality of the heat, which can only be achieved by direct hot-water cooling. One example for direct hot-water cooling is the Aquasar project at ETH Zürich, which is operated at coolant temperatures around 60°C.The aim of iDataCool was to achieve coolant temperatures of more than 65°C, at which commercially available adsorption chillers tend to become efficient, and to demonstrate the long-term stability of a large production machine under these conditions.|$|R
