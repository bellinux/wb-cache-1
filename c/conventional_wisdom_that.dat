25|$|The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution is a 2009 book by anthropologists Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Starting {{with their}} own take on the <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> the {{evolutionary}} process stopped when modern humans appeared, the authors explain the genetic basis of their view that human evolution is accelerating, illustrating it with some examples.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{started the}} war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was {{initially}} reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could {{take as long as}} two years, and the <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being so different from that of Western Europe, would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> Thomas's votes follow Antonin Scalia's is {{reflected}} by Linda Greenhouse's observation that Thomas voted with Scalia 91 {{percent of the}} time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time. Jan Crawford asserts that to some extent, this is true in the other direction as well, that Scalia often joins Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia. Statistics compiled annually by Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog demonstrate that Greenhouse's count is methodology-specific, counting non-unanimous cases where Scalia and Thomas voted for the same litigant, regardless of whether they got there by the same reasoning. Goldstein's statistics show that the two agreed in full only 74% of the time, and that the frequency of agreement between Scalia and Thomas is not as outstanding as is often implied by pieces aimed at lay audiences. For example, in that same term, Souter and Ginsburg voted together 81% of the time by the method of counting that yields a 74% agreement between Thomas and Scalia. By the metric that produces the 91% Scalia/Thomas figure, Ginsburg and Breyer agreed 90% of the time. Roberts and Alito agreed 94% of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Madetoja {{continued}} {{to feel this}} way throughout his life. A decade later, he sought to defend Sibelius against the (growing) <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> he was a poor teacher around whom no appreciable school of thought had formed (unlike, for example, Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School). In Aulos, a volume published {{on the occasion of}} Sibelius's sixtieth birthday in 1925, Madetoja argued for a more nuanced, less [...] "superficial" [...] definition of the word 'teacher' and recounted with fondness his personal experiences as one of Sibelius's pupils.|$|E
50|$|The Buchholz Hypothesis {{holds that}} crime is {{strongly}} correlated with interest rates.

2500|$|... "As a consequence," [...] Morris concludes, [...] "only a {{few years}} after Taft-Hartley, the NLRB and its union and {{employer}} constituents were routinely viewing majority-union bargaining—which was certainly the ultimate goal intended by the Act—as the only bargaining contemplated by the Act. [...] Although unions had originally favored NLRB elections out of sheer convenience, their reliance on the election process had now become routine, with attendant misunderstanding of the true scope of bargaining offered by the statute. ... Thus was born the latter-day <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> assumes that majority-union representation is {{the sine qua non of}} collective bargaining." ...|$|E
2500|$|Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards {{have all}} tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was {{canceled}} quickly, usually {{within the first}} season.

Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up!, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show. Larry David said of the curse, [...] "It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> hiring independent boards limit earnings manipulations {{and promote}} accurate reporting. In contrast, this {{study indicates that}} hiring some insiders to the board facilitates {{the integrity of the}} reporting process. The central result is that strengthening board independence curtails earnings overstatements, but heightens the likelihood of understatements. This is because, reinforcing board independence limits the CEO’s ability to over-report, but also encourages the auditor to economize on effort. The reduced effort impairs the auditor’s ability to verify high earnings and, because auditors tend to favor conservative reports when in doubt, leads <b>Conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> holds <b>that</b> good corporate governance practices, such as electing independent boards, upholds the integrity of financial reporting by reining in financial distortions.
