5000|$|The red <b>cushion</b> <b>star</b> is an {{omnivore}} and {{feeds on}} the seabed sediment and the epiphytic algae, sponges and small invertebrates it finds there. It rakes together heaps of sediment {{and then turns}} its cardiac stomach inside out and engulfs the mass. Edible sponge species are chosen in preference to other prey and tend to be eliminated from areas where the starfish abound.|$|E

50|$|Like other sea <b>stars,</b> the <b>Cushion</b> Sea <b>Star</b> is a slow-moving animal {{using its}} tube feet to move about, {{collecting}} or subduing the food items that constitute this omnivorous species diet, namely, algae, detritus, mussels and other invertebrates. This species is viviparous like {{a few others}} classified in the genus Patiriella, brooding its young within the body.|$|R
50|$|Culcita schmideliana feeds {{mainly on}} the epibenthic film of organic {{detritus}} and micro-organisms growing on algae and sea grasses. It also browses on the sponge Gellius cymiformis, which is usually associated with the symbiotic alga Ceratodictyon spongiosum, and the living tissues and polyps of the stony corals Galaxea and Goniopora and the soft coral Xenia. In grazing in this way on corals it resembles the better known <b>cushion</b> <b>star</b> Culcita novaeguineae.|$|E
50|$|The red <b>cushion</b> <b>star</b> is {{much the}} largest sea star found within its range, {{sometimes}} growing to about 50 cm in diameter. It usually has five thick, broad arms projecting from a broad cushioned disc but some specimens have four, six or seven. The upper surface is hard and is covered with blunt spines. The colour of adults is some shade of red, orange, yellow or brown. The juveniles are greenish-brown with mottled markings.|$|E
50|$|Pentaceraster cumingi, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Panamic <b>cushion</b> <b>star,</b> Cortez starfish or knobby star (a name also used for other species), is a species of starfish in the family Oreasteridae. It is found in warmer parts of the East Pacific (Gulf of California to northwest Peru, including offshore islands like the Galápagos) and in Hawaii. In Panama this species has been collected from the Pearl Islands Archipelago (depth 8 m), Gulf of Panama and off Coiba Island, Gulf of Chiriqui. It reaches a diameter of about 12 in.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cushion</b> Sea <b>Star</b> {{is found}} in the {{intertidal}} zone of Australian coasts from Western Australia's south coast to Queensland's coast off Currumbin, while including Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This sea star species favours rocky coasts abiding both in tide pools and to a maximum depth of 3 meters below sea level.|$|R
50|$|A mature C. novaeguineae is {{pentagonal}} {{in shape}} with an inflated appearance and much-abbreviated arms. It can grow to {{a diameter of}} 30 cm. Rows of tube feet are on the underside, {{and it has a}} central mouth. The colour is very variable and includes a mottling with darker and lighter shades of fawn, brown, orange, yellow and green. The armoured body wall is made of calcareous ossicles which are supported internally by pillars which buttress the ambulacra. The armouring contains pits into which the tube feet can be retracted. The body cavity is filled with water. Small <b>cushion</b> <b>stars</b> are very different in appearance. They are star-shaped, with five short, broad arms and a low profile. As they grow, the inter-arm areas fill in and expand relative to the tube-feet areas, and the arms get shorter relative to the disc which becomes inflated and more massive.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cushion</b> Sea <b>Star</b> {{has eight}} short, distinct, {{triangular}} [...] "arms", though 7- or 9-armed individuals can be found. These [...] "arms" [...] are laterally fused together {{for some of}} their length, leaving ray-like tips of varying length to jut from the disk-like body. This species aboral surface can be any colour or combination of colours, while the oral side is uniformly pale. This sea star attains a maximum diameter from arm tip to arm tip of 5cm-10 cm.|$|R
50|$|The sexes are {{separate}} {{in the red}} <b>cushion</b> <b>star.</b> In subtropical areas it breeds in the summer, but in more tropical locations it breeds all year. Large numbers of individuals may collect together in one location at breeding time with densities sometimes reaching fourteen per square metre (yard). This concentration of individuals enhances the chance of fertilisation when the gametes are liberated into the sea. The larvae form part of the zooplankton and drift with the currents. After passing through several developmental stages they settle on the seabed, usually among seagrass, and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile starfish.|$|E
50|$|The order {{encompasses}} both tiny species, {{which are}} only a few millimetres in diameter, like those in the genus Asterina, and species which can reach up to 75 cm, such as species in the genus Thromidia. Almost all species in this order have five arms with tube feet. This order is primarily identified by the presence of conspicuous marginal ossicles, which characterize most of the species. Most members of this order have five arms and two rows of tube feet with suckers. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the <b>cushion</b> <b>star,</b> and the leather star.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the deep}} waters off Malta in the Mediterranean Sea, Leiopathes glaberrima is the {{dominant}} species in what have been called [...] "coral gardens", where it is associated with other scleractinian corals, gorgonians and zoanthids. The areas are characterised by strong turbulent currents and the corals grow on steep rocky terraces. The colonies are typically a metre or more high, with four or five per square metre. The majority of Leiopathes glaberrima colonies have white polyps, but some are orange. Associated animals include soft corals, gorgonians, crabs, stalked barnacles, numerous species of fish, the <b>cushion</b> <b>star</b> Peltaster placenta, squat lobsters and the spiny lobster Palinurus elephas. The ecosystem is easily damaged by deep water fishing activities including trammel nets and long lines which break the colonies or get tangled in them.|$|E
40|$|Although {{their record}} extends {{back to the}} Early Ordovician, the {{occurrence}} of fossil starfish (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) is dependent almost exclusively upon horizons of exceptional preservation. Thus, asteroids found in Silurian obrution deposits of the English Midlands and Welsh Borderlands are particularly significant {{to an understanding of}} the early diversity of the group. Six species are described here: Hudsonaster? carectum sp. nov. (Hudsonasteridae), from the lower part of the Lower Elton Formation; and, from the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation, the hudsonasterids Doliaster brachyactis gen. et sp. nov. and Siluraster? ketleyi (Spencer, 1916), the lepidasterids Lepidaster grayi Forbes, 1850 and Lepidactis wenlocki Spencer, 1918, and the palasterinid Palasterina orchilocalia sp. nov. Though few in number, they show a diverse range of body morphologies when compared with Ordovician taxa: L. wenlocki had long, slender rays when fully grown whereas D. brachyactis is the first asteroid with the short-rayed body form of extant <b>cushion</b> <b>stars.</b> Most distinctive of all is L. grayi, the earliest multiradiate taxon known, all complete specimens of which have 13 rays. This morphological variety is interpreted as indicating that by the Early Silurian starfish were exploiting a wide range of feeding habits and ecological niches. © 2007 The Palaeontological Association...|$|R
