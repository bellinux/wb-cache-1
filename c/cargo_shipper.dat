30|$|The {{deployment}} of mega container ships with {{a capacity for}} 18, 000 [*]+[*]TEU on major trade lanes is a recent trend within the ocean shipping industry. Larger ships pose multiple challenges to ports and hinterland connections {{as well as to}} the beneficial cargo owners. To achieve maximum utilization of their larger vessels, carriers have entered cooperative global alliances on predetermined routes, resulting in new discharge patterns at U.S. ports. These multi-partner networks involve several competing firms which voluntarily and interactively engage in service delivery. Container carriage is increasingly competitive, and requires continuing cost reductions. There is increasing evidence, however, that <b>cargo</b> <b>shippers</b> are less satisfied with the service their supply chains are receiving. Standardizing process performance through supply chain integration and removing inefficiency will be needed to stabilize the international shipping market, but the question remains how ocean carriers will be able differentiate themselves and create improved supply chain performance. This paper suggests an answer through a simple standard performance measurement model. We will suggest that old systems of carrier competition could evolve to greater cooperation and coordination between business competitors, a state sometimes called “coopetition”, by development of standard setting processes for sharing information while retaining specific service delivery structures to provide differentiated value to customers.|$|R
40|$|Port {{choice is}} an {{important}} issue to be investigated to ensure the effective integration of container supply chains and the sustainable development of regional economy. The selection of appropriate ports to facilitate shipping activities and international trade is crucial for many stakeholders, including shipping lines, port administrators, <b>cargo</b> <b>shippers</b> and national governments. The task is essentially a process of multiple criterion decision-making (MCDM) under uncertainty, requiring analysts to derive rational decisions from uncertain and incomplete data related to different quantitative and qualitative determinants. This paper aims at proposing a new conceptual port choice method by explaining the role fuzzy logic in evidential reasoning in a complementary way, in which various forms of raw data (either objective or subjective) collected to evaluate port performance can first be converted into and presented as fuzzy grades defined using linguistics terms with degrees of belief (DoBs) and second be combined using evidential reasoning to produce a port choice preference score. The method is applied to analyse the selection of major Northeast Asian (NEA) container ports from a shipping line&# 039;s perspective. The outcome, a port choice preference score, is calculated using evidential reasoning to directly synthesize the true estimation of the port with respect to each criterion and therefore, unlike a relative ranking index, keeps the &# 039;goodness&# 039; of port evaluation, capable of benchmarking a specific port&# 039;s performance and monitoring the increase of its competitiveness in a longitude study with respect to an individual criterion or all the criteria as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Ladies &) Gentlemen, I am {{grateful}} for this opportunity {{to talk to you}} about the developing scene in the civil air transport industry. And to take a look at the evolving role of IATA - the International Air Transport Association - in the 1980 s. It is particularly gratifying to me that some of you are from younger countries where airlines are growing and preparing themselves to play their part in international commerce as an instrument for national development. About two-thirds of present ICAO members did not exist at the time when ICAO and IATA were created or re-created in the mid 40 s. If anything, this is indicative of the major changes which have taken place since in world aviation. It may be helpful if I start by giving a brief description of IATA and its activities. The organization is the trade association for scheduled international and domestic airlines. There are currently more than 100 member airlines from some 85 nations. An additional 137 airlines are our interline partners as signatories to the multilateral IATA standard interline agreements. It is a voluntary, non-exclusive, non-political organization which follows democratic decision-making procedures. I emphasize that it is non-political. This means that the airline representatives from nations with differing economies and political philosophies can and do come together to discuss matters of mutual interest in a friendly and cooperative manner. This is to the benefit not only of the airlines themselves but of their all-important customers - the passengers and <b>cargo</b> <b>shippers</b> worldwide. Furthermore, their governments - which for political reasons sometimes simply cannot talk to each other - greatly benefit from this neutral forum and instrument for the solution of aviation problems. Here, I should add sometimes there are also other problems with heavier political overtones [...] . July 9, 198...|$|R

40|$|Air cargo {{carriers}} used to 'own' the air cargo business. For {{over a decade}} though, the air {{cargo carriers}}' market share has been growing at lower rates than the air cargo market itself. Despite these difficulties and IATA's efforts to simplify air cargo processes by introducing electronic documentation, most shipments are still accompanied by printed documents - up to 30 and more per shipment. It {{is the purpose of}} the research to analyse the dynamics of the air cargo system, which lead to the challenges the air cargo industry is currently faced with. It is analysed, which role the various players of the air cargo system and its environment play and who is driving developments in the air cargo industry. Furthermore it is reflected, to what extent ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), namely electronic documentation for air cargo, impact the air cargo system’s dynamics and whether they can contribute to strengthen the air cargo industry again. Based on a historic review the main players of the air cargo system are identified and the development of their role is described in a first step. Applying a systems theoretic approach the dynamics of the air cargo system are reflected. This analysis reveals that, whilst there is information available regarding the structures of the air cargo system's environment, very little is known regarding the structures within the air cargo system itself and between its players: the freight forwarders, the air cargo carriers and the handling agents. In order to close this research gap, in a second empirical step, structured expert interviews with key players of the entire air cargo system (freight forwarders, handling agents, air <b>cargo</b> carriers, <b>shippers</b> and consignees, IT providers, IATA, customs) were held. Based on these interviews dynamics within the air cargo system are reflected and the impact of electronic documentation on these structures is analysed. The research shows that the use of ICT and particularly electronic documentation are a necessary, but not sufficient step for rendering air cargo profitable again. Instead, it is essential for the players within the air cargo system to redefine their own role as well as their mode of cooperation and communication...|$|R
5000|$|However, a novel type of {{insurance}} {{that one would}} recognise as modern emerged in the London [...] "coffee shops" [...] in the 19th century. Shipowners and charterers would seek underwriters to insure their ships, and <b>cargo</b> owners (whether <b>shippers,</b> importers or consignees) would insure their cargoes. Carriers soon realised that often they might themselves be at fault should cargo be lost or damaged at sea, and they sought to take out third-party indemnity insurance in respect of cargo liability. Underwriters evinced an unwillingness to take on such open-ended risks, so shipowners responded by forming their own mutual P&I Clubs, acting as a shipowner's co-operative. An advantage was that a Club worked for the shipowners, thereby eliminating the underwriters' profit margins and making P&I Insurance significantly cheaper. In {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the number of claims greatly increased due to the number of passengers emigrating to North America and Australia. Shipowners became aware of their insurers' compensation limits, especially when it came to damages caused by ship collisions. While the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1854 had determined that, when evaluating insurance claims, the value of ships should be no less than £15 per ton, many ships had an actual lower market value and existing insurance policies did not cover this gap in liability. The compensation for collision damages also excluded a quarter of such damages. Existing hull insurance policies included damages to the insured ship and liability for the damages it had caused, while the maximum amount shipowners could recover after collisions was the ship's insured value. injured crew members might seek compensation from their employers. Later, the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 made it easier for passengers or their survivors to file claims. Also, injured crew members might seek compensation from their employers.|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} {{examined}} the concept of value creation in the maritime chain of transportation. A maritime transport chain can best be conceptualized as a network through which carriers (e. g. shipping companies and haulage providers) and third parties (e. g. terminal operators, freight forwarders, brokers and agents) provide services for the movement of <b>cargo</b> provided by <b>shippers.</b> The main actors in the maritime chain of transportation are the carriers who add value to the shipper by moving goods from areas with excess supply to areas with excess demand. In this process a number of (independent) third parties may provide a number of services. The shipper and/or carrier will employ these agents if the rise in costs is more than compensated by {{the value of the}} service. The third parties can thus only exist if they provide value added services to the carrier and/or to other third party service providers. From a financial perspective value is created when a business earns revenue that exceeds the expenses. In many sectors, however, value is increasingly being created by more intangible drivers such as research, innovation, branding, ideas and networks which usually provide indirect rather than direct benefits (Kaplan & Norton, 2004 a; 2004 b). This is also the case within maritime logistics. According to Johansson et al. (1993) third parties may add value through (1) improve the level of service, (2) quality, (3) cost and (4) time reduction. The chartering agent’s network and market knowledge allows him to speed up the search time and match process for shippers and carriers (time reduction). The port agent’s local network allows him to speed up port operations (time reduction) and make the necessary arrangement on behalf of the carrier (service). Freight forwarders may take over part of the production chain and provide services which manufacturers don’t consider their core business (service). This includes assembly, quality control, customizing and packing of goods, pest control and after sales services. Third party ship management companies may reduce costs through economies of scale (cost reduction) and increase quality of crew and equipment maintenance through specialization (quality). Just to mention a few. While the report has investigated the concept of value creation, the question of value capturing has not been addressed in this study. Value capturing depends on the individual transactions between the actors in the chain. A port agent may add value to a carrier by securing smooth port operations and thus reduce waiting time. The added value may, however, be captured by a freight forwarder who forces the carrier to lower the price or more likely be distributed among several actors. The business model literature may provide a fruitful lens for exploring this in greater depth. The maritime chain of transportation is becoming increasingly complex and involves an increasing number of actors. The services of some actors are furthermore overlapping. Inland haulage can thus be provided by shippers, freight forwarders, independent liner agents, in-house liner sales offices, or by an independent haulage provider. Freight forwarders are increasingly overtaking functions in the value chain from manufacturer etc. In order to successfully navigate this network is it important to have an overview of the chain of transportation at a more general level...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to <b>cargo</b> claims by <b>shippers</b> or <b>cargo</b> owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|R
