40|$|ABSTRACT: Visually driven {{activity}} is not re-quired {{for the establishment}} of ocular dominance col-umns, orientation columns, and long-range horizontal connections in visual cortex, although spontaneous ac-tivity appears to be necessary. The role of activity may be instructive or simply permissive; evidence for an instructive role requires inquiry into the role of the pattern of activity in shaping cortical circuits. The few experiments that have probed the role of patterned ac-tivity include the effects of artificial strabismus, artificial stimulation of the optic nerve, and rewiring visual pro-jections from the retina to the auditory thalamus and cortex.

40|$|The {{automorphism}} invariant {{theory of}} Crawford[8] has shown great promise, however its application {{is limited by}} the paradigm to the domain of spin space. Our conjecture {{is that there is a}} broader principle at work which applies even to classical physics. Specifically, the laws of physics should be invariant under polydimensional transformations which reshuffle the geometry (e. g. exchanges vectors for trivectors) but preserves the algebra. To complete the symmetry, it follows that the laws of physics must be themselves polydimensional, having scalar, vector, bivector etc. parts in one multivector equation. Clifford algebra is the natural language in which to formulate this principle, as vectors/tensors were for relativity. This allows for a new treatment of the relativistic spinning particle (the Papapetrou equations) which is problematic in standard theory.
