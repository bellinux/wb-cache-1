CeRu_ 2 Al_ 10 is an exceptional <b>cerium</b> <b>compound</b> with an unusually high Neel temperature of 27 K. Here we study {{the stability of the}} unusual magnetic order by means of controlled doping, and we uncover further surprising attributes of this phase transition. The heat capacity, resistivity and μSR measurements reveal an onset of magnetic ordering below 23 K, while a broad peak at 31 K (i. e. above T_N), has been observed in the temperature dependent susceptibility, indicating an opening of a spin gap above T_N. Our important finding, from the neutron diffraction, is that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a propagation vector k = (1 0 0) and the ordered state moment is 0. 20 (1) μ_B along the b-axis. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} undoped compound, which shows AFM ordering at 27 K with the ordered moment of 0. 39 (3) μ_B along the c-axis. Similar to CeRu_ 2 Al_ 10 our inelastic neutron scattering study on the Re doped shows a sharp spin gap-type excitation near 8 meV at 5 K, but with slightly reduced intensity compared to the undoped compound. Further the excitation broadens and shifts to lower energy (< 4 meV) near 35 K. These results suggest that the low temperature magnetic properties of the hole doped sample is governed by the competition between the anisotropic hybridization effect and crystal field anisotropy as observed in hole-doped CeOs_ 2 Al_ 10.

40|$|Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 is a <b>cerium</b> <b>compound</b> that {{exhibits}} a hybridization gap and concomitant semiconducting {{behavior in the}} coherent ground state. Using neutron powder diffraction, we have determined the variation of the lattice constant with temperature at two pressures (P= 10 - 3 and 17. 7 kbar), and determined the bulk modulus and atomic mean-square displacements for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and its normal analog, La 3 Bi 4 Pt 3. The thermal expansion Δβ in Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 {{exhibits a}} maximum at Tmax= 50 K at ambient pressure. Below 50 K, the bulk modulus ΔB is proportional to TΔβ. We apply a Grüneisen analysis, {{under the assumption that}} the free energy exhibits T/T 0 (V) scaling. The Grüneisen parameter deduced from the ratio ΔB/TΔβ is consistent with the value Ω= 36 deduced from the pressure variation of Tmax. The analysis allows us to predict the temperature dependence of the 4 f specific heat (ΔCΔβ/Ω), which thus has a maximum at 50 K and a high-temperature entropy nearly equal the expected value R ln 6. We argue that the maximum at 50 K reflects an (indirect) hybridization gap of order 100 K. We show further that the lattice constant anomaly Δa 0 is proportional to the effective moment Tχ; this suggests that a relationship known to be valid for antiferromagnets, namely (Tχ) /TΔC where ΔC is the specific heat, may be valid for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3. Finally, we show that the temperature dependence of the mean-square atomic displacements is nearly identical for Ce 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and La 3 Bi 4 Pt 3 and can be fitted by a simple Debye-Waller model; hence the expansion anomaly does not affect the average lattice dynamics. © 1992 The American Physical Society...|$|E

40|$|The {{demands for}} {{advanced}} power sources with high energy efficiency, minimum environmental impact, and low cost {{have been the}} impetus {{for the development of a}} new generation of batteries and fuel cells. One of the key challenges in this effort is to develop and fabricate effective electrodes with desirable composition, microstructure and performance. This work focused on the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanostructured electrodes in an effort to minimize electrode polarization losses. Solid-state diffusion often limits the utilization and rate capability of electrode materials in a lithium-ion battery, especially at high charge/discharge rates. When the fluxes of Li+ insertion or extraction exceed the diffusion-limited rate of Li+ transport within the bulk phase of an electrode, concentration polarization occurs. Further, large volume changes associated with Li+ insertion or extraction could induce stresses in bulk electrodes, potentially leading to mechanical failure. Interconnected porous materials with high surface-to-volume ratio were designed to suppress the stress and promote mass transport. In this work, electrodes with these unique architectures for lithium ion batteries have been fabricated to improve the cycleability, rate capability and capacity retention. Cathodic interfacial polarization represents the predominant voltage loss in a low-temperature SOFC. For the first time, regular, homogeneous and bimodal porous MIEC electrodes were successfully fabricated using breath figure templating, which is self-assembly of the water droplets in polymer solution. The homogeneous macropores promoted rapid mass transport by decreasing the tortuosity. And mesoporous microstructure provided more surface areas for gas adsorption and more TPBs for the electrochemical reactions. Moreover, composite electrodes were developed with a modified sol-gel process for honeycomb SOFCs. The sol gel derived cathodes with fine grain size and large specific surface area, showed much lower interfacial polarization resistances than those prepared by other existing processing methods. Nanopetals of cerium hydroxycarbonate have been synthesized via a controlled hydrothermal process in a mixed water-ethanol medium. The formation of the <b>cerium</b> <b>compound</b> depends strongly on the composition of the precursors, and is attributed to the favored ethanol oxidation by Ce(IV) ions over Ce(IV) hydrolysis process.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} catalytic upgrading of phenolic compounds over ceria-based materials. The work {{was motivated by}} the need to find alternative industrial uses for the light rare earth elements (e. g. cerium) as part of the Critical Materials Institute. Cerium is typically encountered in the + 3 or + 4 oxidation state and its dioxide is the most technologically advanced <b>cerium</b> <b>compound.</b> Cerium dioxide (ceria) is best known for its ability to release and store oxygen, thereby acting as an oxygen buffer in many catalytic systems. The oxygen storage and release capability has been exploited in three-way catalysis {{and is one of the}} most industrialized uses of cerium. Traditionally, ceria has been explored for small molecule (e. g. CO) oxidation catalysis, while its utility as a catalyst for organic oxidations has been gaining attention. The unique oxygen-activating property of ceria has delayed its study as a catalyst component for reductive transformations. Phenolics represent an interesting class of oxygenates for transformation over ceria-based materials. The chemistry of hydroxyl-containing compounds over ceria is well-studied and is often preceded by reactive adsorption to form activated intermediates. The economic importance of phenolics as precursors for nylon production and the oxygenate-activating ability of ceria-based materials provide a good starting point for determining alternative industrial uses for cerium. Furthermore, phenolics can be derived from renewable resources, an industrial sector that is expected to see large growth during the current century. Identifying active, selective, and environmentally friendly catalytic systems that convert biorenewable compounds into commodity chemicals is thus critical for ushering in the biorefinery era. The catalytic systems described here demonstrate ceria-based materials are active for the reductive transformation of phenolics using molecular hydrogen and aliphatic alcohols. Palladium supported on high-surface-area ceria was found to effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone at atmospheric pressure and room temperature under batch conditions. The activity was highly dependent on the catalyst prereduction temperature which led to optimization of Pd dispersion and metal-support interactions. Analogous to alkyl alcohols, phenol underwent dissociative adsorption on ceria to yield cerium-bound phenoxy and water. The phenoxy species were activated toward dearomatization by molecular hydrogen. Palladium supported on high-surface-area ceria (Pd/CeO 2) and sodium-modified ceria (Pd/Ce-Na) were used as catalysts for the aqueous-phase transfer hydrogenation of phenol using 2 -propanol under flow conditions. Both catalysts were active and showed constant activity for 7 days on-stream. Pd/Ce-Na showed a marked increase (6 x) in transfer hydrogenation activity over Pd/CeO 2. Modification of ceria by sodium provided more 2 -propanol adsorption sites and redox active sites (i. e. defects) for 2 -propanol dehydrogenation which resulted in higher phenol transfer hydrogenation activity. For primary alcohols, reduction of the ceria support to from cerium hydroxy carbonate occurred and led to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. A deactivation mechanism involving C-C scission of acyl and carboxylate intermediates to form CO was proposed. Deposition of trimethylphosphate onto ceria followed by thermal treatment resulted in formation of surface phosphates with retention of redox activity. The introduction of phosphates generated BrÃÂ¸nsted acidic sites and decreased the number of Lewis acidic sites on the surface. Upon deposition of Pd, the multifunctional material showed enhanced activity for phenolic hydrogenolysis compared to Pd on the unmodified ceria support. This was attributed to the cooperativity between the Lewis acid sites, which activate phenolics for dearomatization, and the redox/acid property, which catalyzes hydrogenolysis...|$|E

Pöttgen, B. Chevalier, Z. Naturforsch. 2015, 70 b, 695]...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane-Wave (FP-LAPW) calculations of the layered <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> CeRhIn 5 and CeIrIn 5, which {{belong to the}} new, intensively investigated family of heavy fermion (HF) materials. The ground states of this compounds can be tuned between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and superconductivity (SC) by external pressure or doping. We have carried out x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments to compare measured valence band spectra with theoretical calculations. We also analyse the XPS 3 d Ce spectra, to estimate the occupation of the Ce 4 f shell and the hybridization between 4 f and conduction electrons. We have found and discussed an influence of the lattice parameter a and the d-f interatomic hybridization effect on the ground state properties in the series of CeMIn 5 compounds...|$|R
40|$|This comment clarifies {{the mixed}} {{definition}} of the cerium valence in the article entitled: Quantitative study of the $f$ occupation in CeMIn 5 and other <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> with hard X-rays, published in Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena [URL] and available on arXiv: 1601. 03270. Indeed, it is unclear wether electrons belonging on hybridized f-states are part or not of the valence. When one tries to simulate the system, an Anderson impurity model only includes valence bands electrons and localized 4 -f states. Therefore hybridized 4 -f states are mixed with the localized ones. From a heavy fermion perspective it however essential to differentiate hybridized and localized states as only the second are responsible for strong correlations, such as obtained by susceptibility or direct comparisons to model systems...|$|R
40|$|The crystal field level {{scheme of}} RX 3 (R = Ce, Pr, Nd; X = In, Pb) {{intermetallic}} compounds {{has been determined}} by fitting susceptibility curves and specific heat Schottky anomalies; an inelastic neutron diffraction experiment has been performed for NdIn 3. The fourth order C. E. F. parameter A 04 of the <b>cérium</b> <b>compounds</b> is positive; it decreases for the praseodymium compounds and becomes negative for the neodymium compounds. The sixth order C. E. F. parameter A 0 6 exhibits the same trend to negative values from praseodymium to neodymium compounds. This sign change of the C. E. F. parameters appears {{to be related to}} the small energy difference between the conduction band and the 4 f levels at the beginning of the first rare earth series...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> exhibit {{hysteresis}} cycles {{with sharp}} macroscopic jumps in the magnetization {{at very low}} temperatures. This effect is attributed {{to the formation of}} clusters in which the anisotropy competes with the applied magnetic field. Here, we present a simple model where a lattice of ferromagnetically coupled spins is separated in clusters of random sizes and with random anisotropy. Within this model, we obtain hysteresis cycles presenting jumps that behave in a similar way as the experimental ones and that disappear when increasing the temperature. The results are in good agreement with the hysteresis cycles measured at very low temperatures in CeNi 1 −xCux, and the comparison with these experimental results allows to discriminate the relative importance of the mechanisms driving the thermal evolution of the cycles...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{structural}} analysis of <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> by EXAFS (Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure) is unreliable due to particularly strong multielectron photoexcitations (MPE). The {{collection of the}} MPE in the pure atomic signal of Ce, to be removed before the procedure, has not been measured or calculated ab initio; our suggestion is to transfer it from another Ce sample. An estimate of MPE contribution is extracted from the absorption spectrum of a Ce compound with known structure by removing the structural signal, calculated ab initio. In a combined fitting procedure of spectra of different compounds, the MPE estimate is refined. Using specific Ce 3 + and Ce 4 + estimates, absorption spectra of Ce oxide films are prepared free of the major part of MPE signal, especially of its long-wave components, so that a regular EXAFS analysis of the samples is possible...|$|R
40|$|The title compound, {{synthesized}} from Cr VI and Ce IV species, crystallizes in {{the space}} group P 6 3 with a = 19. 3015 (2), c = 25. 2684 (4) Å, and Z = 2. The structural design of the title compound differs essentially from structures of known mixed-valence <b>cerium</b> <b>compounds</b> which all form three-dimensional networks. In the title <b>compound</b> the <b>cerium</b> atoms, interlinked by sulfate groups, extend to form layers held together by hydrogen-bonding contacts. Perpendicular to these layers there are 10 Å wide channels. One third of the channels host solvent water only, while the other {{two thirds of the}} channels also host [Cr(H 2 O) 6] 3 + and [Ce(SO 4) 3 (H 2 O) 6] 3 - units, blocking each of these channels once per unit cell, resulting in 14 Å long voids...|$|R
