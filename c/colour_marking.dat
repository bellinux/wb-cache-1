40|$|In {{the search}} for {{companies}} to distinguish themselves from the mass, so called non-traditional trade marks have become increasingly popular, and in particular <b>colour</b> <b>marks.</b> It {{is now clear that}} abstract <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> can be registered as trade marks, and the number of registered <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> has increased considerably in recent years. However, it remains a lot more uncertain, mainly due to lack of case law, what the extent of colour marks’ scope of protection is. Are colours actually worth protecting? The purpose of this thesis is to examine the scope of protection of registered abstract <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> from an EU perspective. Through this examination it will also be established whether colours are worth protecting. The essential function of trade marks is to indicate the origin of products. Signs that are capable of being represented graphically and capable of distinguishing goods and services from one undertaking from those of other undertakings can be registered as trade <b>marks.</b> <b>Colours</b> can fulfil these criteria in certain circumstances, however, colours can practically never have distinctive character per se. Instead, they must have acquired distinctive character through use. Since it is quite difficult to register <b>colour</b> <b>marks,</b> a <b>colour</b> <b>mark</b> proprietor should be prepared to have the validity of his trade mark challenged if he issues proceedings for infringement. There are a few national cases from EU Member States that have concerned infringement of <b>colour</b> <b>marks,</b> and in all of these the plaintiff was successful in claiming infringement. Through the decisions in these cases, general legal principles and statements made in literature, the scope of protection of <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> has been examined. Infringement of a <b>colour</b> <b>mark</b> occurs in three different situations: where there is likelihood of confusion, where there is double identity and where there is dilution of a trade mark with a reputation. Some of the most important findings are that confusingly similar colours include adjacent shades, but in order to prove likelihood of confusion, the infringing colour must probably be perceived by the public as an indication of origin and other signs that appear together with the colour must probably be taken into account, which limits the scope of protection to some extent. However, since <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> must almost always have acquired distinctive character through use, consumers are used to perceiving that colour as a trade mark in relation to those types of goods/services, and are therefore more likely to do so also when the colour is used by the third party. Furthermore, there have to be an individual assessment in each case in order to determine whether surrounding signs exclude a likelihood of confusion, where all factors should be considered, including the distinctiveness of the <b>colour</b> <b>mark</b> and how clear and prominent the other signs are. In situations of double identity, the infringing sign {{does not have to be}} used as a trade mark, which is advantageous for <b>colour</b> <b>mark</b> owners. Furthermore, identical colours can possibly include other shades if they are so similar that the difference is barely perceptible in a direct comparison. <b>Colour</b> <b>marks</b> can often qualify as trade marks with a reputation, since the assessment of whether trade marks have a reputation is similar to the assessment of whether trade marks have acquired distinctive character through use. Trade marks with a reputation has an extended protection meaning that if a third party uses a sign that is identical or similar to a trade mark with a reputation, and that use without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the trade mark, then that use constitutes infringement. This applies both in relation to identical, similar and dissimilar products, however, it will probably only apply in relation to identical or similar products when it comes to <b>colour</b> <b>marks,</b> due to the extensive use of colours in the market. The extended protection could be relevant in particular in situations where likelihood of confusion cannot be proven, because the public does not perceive the infringing sign as a trade mark or because of surrounding prominent signs. This examination shows that the scope of protection of <b>colour</b> <b>marks</b> is not great, it has some weaknesses. However, it is definitely not worthless either, which clearly shows in the fact that the plaintiffs were successful in claiming infringement in all of the infringement cases. By registering a colour as a trade mark, a company can to some extent stop others from using the same or similar colour, and it will also most likely have a discouraging effect. However, some carefulness should still be applied in relation to <b>colour</b> <b>marks,</b> since this is still a very new phenomenon and additional case law can take another direction. But considering how the situation looks today, colours are worth protecting as trade marks...|$|R

Mosquitoes can be marked to determine population size, distribution and flight distance or distinguish closely related species. In this study, two methods of <b>colour</b> <b>marking</b> mosquitoes were described in detail {{and the impact of}} both methods on the survival and host-seeking behaviour of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was investigated. Methods: Mosquitoes were marked in groups with fluorescent powder or fluorescent dye. The powder was applied by creating a cloud of powder in a paper cup and the dye was applied with an airbrush. The effect of marking on the survival of mosquitoes of different age groups was tested under controlled conditions. The effect of marking on the host seeking response of the mosquitoes was tested in an olfactometer with human and cow odour as baits. Results: No effect of either of the marking methods was found on the survival of mosquitoes that were treated 1 or 3 days after emergence, however, the survival of mosquitoes treated 5 or 9 days after emergence was significantly reduced. The host-seeking response of mosquitoes to human or cow odour was tested in a dual-port olfactometer and was not found to be affected by treatment with fluorescent powder or dye. Conclusions: Both methods are suitable for <b>colour</b> <b>marking</b> large groups of mosquitoes. Marking with fluorescent powder, however, is preferred because the method is simpler, visible without a UV light and no specific materials are required...|$|E

30|$|The {{quality of}} service (QoS) {{requirements}} do not define a marker algorithm for service classes and managing network traffic to provide fair bandwidth sharing among aggregate flows. Additionally, the assured service is designed for applications relying on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This article analyses and evaluates a new time sliding window traffic marker algorithm called the Optimized time sliding window Three <b>Colour</b> <b>Marker</b> (OtswTCM). The new design of the OtswTCM algorithm depends on the adaptability of the gamma (γ) concept in the Improved time sliding window Three <b>Colour</b> <b>Marker</b> (ItswTCM), the Double Improved time sliding window Three <b>Colour</b> <b>Marker</b> (I 2 tswTCM) and the Double Modified Double Improved time sliding window Three <b>Colour</b> <b>Marker</b> (M 2 I 2 tswTCM) algorithms to affect fairness and multiple protocols in classifying network traffic. This is achieved through separating marker TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and extending the marking probability for injecting more green and yellow traffic into the network. The marking probability mechanism was also studied to check how parameters in the traffic rate affect fairness. Extensive simulations were carried out to implement the algorithm using the NS 2 simulator and compare the proposed marker algorithm with several other algorithms. The {{results show that the}} proposed marker algorithm is not affected by the number of flows and outperforms the previous marker algorithms in terms of fairness.|$|R

30|$|However, {{the marker}} {{algorithms}} were {{not designed to}} investigate the unfairness problem or responsive and non-responsive fairness in the aggregate and their causes [28].

The contribution of the proposed marker algorithm is that it extends the guarantee of the service rate to inject more green and yellow traffic into the fair sharing of bandwidth among aggregates, including taking into consideration the responsive and non-responsiveness of the aggregate.

40|$|Sonia Delaunay (1885 – 1979) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} female artists of the early twentieth century, whose contribution to the European avant-garde was fundamental. Russian-born, she moved to Paris in 1906 where she studied at the Académie de la Palette. Her early work was influenced by the bold Fauvist paintings of Matisse, Gauguin and Van Gogh among others. Shifting her interest to abstraction, she celebrated the modern world and urban life, exploring ideas of colour theory together with her husband Robert Delaunay. She also collaborated with artists and poets such as Guillaume Apollinaire and Blaise Cendrars with whom she created the acclaimed book Prose on the Transsiberian Railway and of Little Jehanne of France. After spending time in Spain and Portugal during the First World War, Delaunay returned to Paris in the 1920 s where she translated her experiments in painting into the realm of fashion. She collaborated with the Metz & Co textile department in Amsterdam and Liberty in London and also produced individual items of clothing under commission. Her interest in fashion expanded into theatre and cinema, for which she created costumes and designs for film sets. During the Second World War and soon after, she participated in the creation of the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles (1939) and developed her interest in different media, creating mosaics, tapestries and lithographs. In the same period, her paintings and gouaches evoked a renewed interest in abstraction and <b>colour,</b> <b>marking</b> her seminal role in the development of postwar abstract and applied art...|$|E

40|$|Survival {{is a key}} {{demographic}} parameter in bird populations yet remarkably {{little is}} known about the seasonal pattern of survival. Mortality may increase as a result of breeding behaviour, harsh environmental conditions, resource limitation or any combination of these; knowing which is important for understanding the ecology of population change. We analyse an intensive ten-year <b>colour</b> <b>marking</b> programme of European blackbirds Turdus merula to estimate seasonal and sex-specific survival rates. The annual survival rate (0. 67) was similar to that produced from analyses of dead recoveries across Britain, but within year variation was significant. Survival rates were lowest during the early part of the breeding period and highest in the autumn, but there was little difference between the sexes. Understanding this pattern of variation is important in interpreting both life-history variation and the mechanisms of population change. Benjamin Franklin noted that ‘‘in the world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes’’; birds don’t face taxes, but they do face death from a remarkable array of factors. Such factors may relate to the bird’s activities, for example, breeding is likely to be a costly exercise (e. g. Williams 1966, Reznick 1985), or simply because of the environment they are in, for instance temperate winters are often harsh with limiting resources leading to increased mortality (e. g. van Balen 1980, Robinson et al. 2007). However, although much has been published on annual survival rates in birds, there is a dearth of information on the timing of mortality. As a consequence, those interested in life-history variation have tended to assume mortality occurs during the breeding period (e. g. Owens and Bennett 1994, Liker and Székely 2005), while those concerned with population ecology have more often assumed greatest mortality in the non-breeding period (e. g...|$|E

40|$|Productivity in Swedish pig {{production}} is high, but unfortunately so are production costs, {{especially those of}} labour and of buildings. The piglet producing herds allocate {{about a quarter of}} their total working time for the work operation scraping manure (including supervision). In addition to being labour consuming, the workers also consider that manure scraping is heavy and hard work. Problems with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially in the upper extremities, are also a reality for today's workers in animal production, especially for women. Since women mainly work in the farrowing and lactation units in Swedish pig herds, farrowing pen design deserves special attention. In this study, working time and workload for two different work operations in the farrowing unit, was studied in 16 herds. The purpose was to obtain more knowledge about the workload of workers in modern farrowing pens and to use this knowledge to develop recommendations to prevent injuries among the workers. The herds were visited on 1 - 2 occasions per herd. One of the herd selection criteria was that the herds had farrowing pens which were built after year 2000. There were 7 herds with pens for farrowing, lactation and nursery (until 25 kg) periods (pen type A, without a protective gate system) and 9 herds with pens for farrowing and lactation (pen type B, with protective gate system). In the present study, previously conducted observations were supplemented with details about the gate structures, closures, piglet corners, gaps to remove manure etc. Two working operations, "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals “(WO 1), where manure scraping and control of the piglets were combined, and "Handling of piglets” (WO 2), where the time required to capture and mark all piglets in the pen with a colour marker on zthe back, were studied. The working operations were carried out continuously in a number of farrowing pens per unit. The time spent on the various work elements within the work operation was registered using a portable handheld computer (PSION). Both work operations were performed by the same person in all herds (person 1). Similarly, all the work time registrations using the hand computer were carried out by the same individual (person 2) in all the herds. The following work elements were recorded: transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with pen gates, manure scraping from inside the pen, manure scraping from outside the pen, work with boards, work with creep area, work with handling of the pigs (catching each pig, lifting them up, marking them on the back with a colour marker). Using a digital camera, the different work elements in the two working procedures were videotaped. Observation studies of the video recordings were used to carry out detailed analyses of the workload and to visualize and identify the movements and postures used in the studied work procedures. To analyze the work postures in the different work lements, the program WinOWAS was used. WinOWAS is based on 84 so-called “basic type work positions” after evaluations of the positions of the back (4 positions), the arms (3 positions) and the legs (7 positions). The various “basic type work positions” are, depending on the degree of work load, classified in one of four action categories (higher score corresponding to higher load). For the various work elements, the program calculated the percentage of time in each action category. Classification of load was also made for the weight of the burden that was handled (20 kg) (Figure 1). To calculate the load on the different body parts, the program 2 DSSPP (2 D Static Strength Prediction Program) was used. The study estimated the torque (Nm) as a measure of the mechanical stress on the shoulder and lumbar spine (Figures 2 and 3) for the work elements: “Manure Scraping (keeper inside the pen) " and "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) ". The load of the work element "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) " was calculated when reaching with the scraper either 150 cm or 200 cm. The study showed that there was a wide variation in the farrowing pen designs. In addition to variation in size, many different solutions for equipment details were found. How well the solutions functioned would have significant impact on the work time and work load for the different work elements. For example, the design of the gate locking system (Figure 4) affected how quickly the opening and closing of the gates could be done. In some of the farrowing pens, retractable wooden boards were used instead of gates (Figure 5). In these pens, the keeper normally stepped over the wall when entering the pens during the daily manure scraping routine. From a work load perspective, it would be a disadvantage to have to climb over a wall instead of being able to walk through a gate. In some pens, the gates in the dung alley between the pens were designed with a low "threshold", so that the keepers had to deal with both a gate and climbing over a low wall (Figure 6). The time spent manure scraping was not only affected by the pen hygiene but also how the manure was scraped into the manure channel (Figure 7). Having flaps in the slatted floor often were perceived as a problem because they often were not sufficiently durable. Openings in the slats under the gate between the pens in the manure channel appeared to be the most valued solution. In many of the herds manure scraping was not done in the whole pen every day. On certain week days, only the concrete area in the pen was cleaned and the manure moved out onto the slatted area. The actual manure scraping work was most often carried out from inside the pen but sometimes it was done from the inspection alley (Figure 8). In {{order to be able to}} scrape from the inspection alley, the pen had to be “facing forward” i. e., the solid floor had to be placed adjacent to the inspection alley and the slatted floor had to be relatively large so that the solid area did not become too wide. For the work operation “Handling of piglets” the capturing of the piglets was facilitated if the pigs could be gathered in a piglet corner. Most of the type A pens were equipped with a permanent board which could be closed to lock in the piglets. In pen type B such permanent “closing in” devices for the piglets were missing. Instead, loose boards, which were moved from pen to pen, were hooked onto metal profiles on the pen wall. The average time for the work operation WO 1 "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals“, was a little longer (0. 95 min) in the type A-pens (no protective gate system and 64 % solid floor), than in the type B-pens (0. 76 min) (with a protective gate system and 52 % solid floor). However, the difference between the pen types was not statistically significant (Table 1). Type A-pens were scraped predominantly from inside the pen (98 % of the cases), while type B-pens more often were scraped from the inspection alley (55 % of the cases). The mean time for “Handling of piglets” (WO 2) was slightly shorter in type A-pens (1. 38 min) without protection devices, compared with the type B-pens (1. 50 min) with a protective gate system. The difference was not significant (Table 1). Work with pen manure scraping from inside resulted in a work load score of 1. 50, as compared to that of 1. 83 when the pen scraping was done from the inspection alley, because particularly the spine is subjected to greater stress when the pen manure is scraped from outside. Capturing and <b>colour</b> <b>marking</b> the pigs involved both bending and twisting the back, and this work element was therefore the most stressful one in the work operation WO 2, with a work load score of 2. 65 (Table 3). In Figure 10 it is shown that, for WO 1, a shorter working time often has to be "paid for" by a higher work load. Despite a numerically longer working time (although not significant) for WO 1 in pen type A, a significantly lower work load for this work operation (WO 1) and pen type was registered, as compared to that for the type B-pen (Table 3). The relationship between working time and work load for WO 2 was reversed. A tendency towards a shorter working time for WO 2 in the type A-pens resulted in there being a tendency to a higher work load in this pen type (Table 4, Figure 11). The mechanical load on the shoulders and back was alculated for the work element "manure scraping" when the keeper either carried out the work from inside the pen or from the outside (Figure 12). When scraping pen manure from outside, the work load according to two different depths (150 and 200 cm) of how far the keeper had to reach as a maximum, was compared. Maximum work load on both the shoulders and the back was obtained when the keeper had to scrape pen manure from outside, extending to a maximum of 200 cm (Table 5). Farrowing pens with partly solid floors will always require a certain work time for manure scraping. As expected, the study showed that the work time for “removal of manure and monitoring the animals” (WO 1) was longer (0. 95 min per pen) in type A-pens, with a higher proportion (64 %) of solid pen flooring compared with the type B pens (0. 76 min per pen), with a smaller proportion (52 %) of solid flooring. However, the variation between the different herds was large, and the difference was not significant. The results suggested that it was not only the relationship between the solid and the slatted areas in the pen that affected the pen manure scraping working time. In type B-pens, it was possible to reach and scrape the solid floor from the inspection alley outside the pen. This was because the solid floor was not as wide/deep as in pen type A. Thus, no working time for opening gates was needed. However, in the studies of work load, it was concluded that it was more stressful to scrape pen manure from outside (score 1. 83), compared with inside the pen (score 1. 50). To scrape pen manure from outside meant more bending and more twisting of the back, compared to carrying out this work element inside the pen. The biomechanical calculations showed that it could be up to four times more burdensome, especially for the back, to scrape pen manure from outside than inside. The work load depended on how far into the pen the keeper needed to reach with the scraper. The height of the pen wall and the location of the solid pen area in relation to the inspection alley were other factors affecting this work load. The results were interesting and should provide ground for reflection among the people in managerial positions in our pig producing herds. Together with an achievable positive and wanted rationalization of the work with manure scraping in the newer farrowing pens, the work with scraping has actually become more of a burden for the keepers. Given that reports of MSDs problems already are many, the result was somewhat alarming. In conclusion, the "new" Swedish farrowing pens appear to be more competitive in terms of working time for the work element “manure scraping”, but the work with manure scraping that remains becomes more of a burden. For the employees, this does not directly mean something positive. Instead, the overall work load increases at the same time as an employee manages to clean a larger number of farrowing pens. This condition means that the requirements for a good and well planned work organization in future pig-producing herds, so that the staff do not risk injuries in the future, will be even higher. It is suggested that the modern, large-scale agriculture make use of the experience gained in other industries. Job rotation and alternation between work tasks is recommended as being important components of future organization on pig farms to reduce occupational injuries among the pig keepers...|$|E
