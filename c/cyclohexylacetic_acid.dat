40|$|Aqueous solution, 10 mm, of cyclohexanecarboxylic, cyclohexylacetic, cyclohexylpropionic, cyclohexylbutyric acids (all {{components}} of naphthenic acid); cis- 1, 2 -, and trans- 1, 4 -cyclohexyldicarboxylic acids; 3 -cyclohexene- 1 -carboxylic and cyclohexylsulfamic acids; and cyclohexyl mercaptan {{were applied to}} 14 -day-old bush bean plants, Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Top Crop. Only cyclohexanecarboxylic and <b>cyclohexylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> resulted in a statistically significant (P = 0. 05) increase in pod production per plant in all experiments. The stimulation by the first four monocarboxylic acids decreased {{as the number of}} methylene groups in the side chain increased from 0 to 3. The effective compounds possessed an H-saturated 6 -carbon ring with a single carboxyl group attached directly to the ring or separated from it by no more than one methylene group...|$|E
