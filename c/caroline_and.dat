During the battle the Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen was left unsupported by the remainder of the squadron and, isolated, was forced to surrender. Captain Peter Rainier, the British commander, was subsequently free to remove his prize from within sight of the Dutch port when the remainder of the Dutch squadron refused to engage <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> their crews deliberately grounded the ships to avoid capture.

5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, {{lying at anchor}} in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} only by the 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than <b>Caroline,</b> <b>and</b> could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E

5|$|The Raid on Saint Paul was an {{important}} demonstration of Rowley's ability to strike at the French anchorages directly. Landing men at unwatched beaches, the British soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines of the landing party were able to storm the defences from the landward side and rout the defenders. This allowed Rowley's squadron to enter the harbour and capture <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> a number of smaller ships that were docked there. The attack caused consternation {{on the island and}} its commander, Nicolas Des Bruslys, committed suicide rather than order his troops to attack the British positions. Unopposed, Rowley was able to destroy the defences and public works in the town before leaving with large quantities of captured supplies and ships. Colonel Chrysostome Sainte-Suzanne replaced Des Bruslys but was unable to effectively defend the island with the remaining garrison {{in the event of a}} concerted invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Saint-Paul was an amphibious {{operation}} {{conducted by a}} combined British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines force against the fortified French port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte (now known as Réunion) during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation was launched on 20September 1809 as both a precursor to a future full-scale invasion of Île Bonaparte {{and in order to}} capture the French frigate <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were sheltering in the harbour. The operation was a complete success, with British storming parties capturing the batteries overlooking the port, which allowed a naval squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the bay and capture the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The old king's estrangement {{from his}} three daughters {{from his first}} {{marriage}} (Princesses Louise, Stéphanie, and Clémentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared. A trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government had a right to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony.|$|E

5|$|When {{the winter}} {{hurricane}} season {{ended in the}} spring of 1807, Admiral Pellew found his squadron dispersed on a variety of operations from the Red Sea to the South China Sea. Without the forces required for an extended operation against the remainder of the Dutch squadron, Pellew was forced to limit his operations in the Java Sea to frigate reconnaissance, sending HMS <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> Psyche (under Fleetwood Pellew) to ascertain the exact location of the Dutch ships of the line. On 29 August, the frigates reached Panka at the easternmost point of Java and the following day captured a merchant ship from Batavia which revealed that the Dutch ships of the line were anchored at Griessie near Surabaya and had deteriorated beyond repair. With their mission complete, the frigates separated to raid Dutch shipping, Psyche sailing west along the coast until Pellew reached the port of Semarang.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, as in the preceding conflict, French privateers operated from the islands, including a fleet of small vessels run by Robert Surcouf. Supplementing these ships were occasional French naval vessels, principally the frigate Piémontaise (captured in March 1808) and the old frigates Sémillante and Canonnière. These ships operated independently of one another and achieved minor successes against smaller British warships and merchant vessels but were not powerful enough to have a serious effect on the Indian Ocean trade routes. In August 1808, Sémillante and Canonnière were downgraded to armed storeships and sent back to France. To replace these ships, four large frigates under Jacques Hamelin were sent to Governor Charles Decaen on Isle de France in the late autumn of 1808. These vessels, Vénus, Manche, <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> Bellone were large and powerful ships under orders to operate from Isle de France and Île Bonaparte against British trade in the Indian Ocean. Based on Isle de France, these frigates had access to large numbers of unemployed sailors and several fortified anchorages from which to launch raids on the British trade routes. A fifth frigate, Niémen, was to have joined the force in the summer of 1809, but was intercepted and captured within hours of leaving France at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Street is {{situated}} along the northwestern {{side of the}} island, in an historic district known as Old Town Key West. Part of the district, roughly defined as the area between Caroline Street and Angela Streets (which run parallel about four blocks apart), harbors many old houses, some of which belonged to famous writers and other influential persons. For example, the Dr. Joseph Y. Porter House at 429 Caroline Street was home to the first public health inspector {{in the state of}} Florida. The Porter House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Many of the houses in the area have been converted into inns; the Curry Mansion Inn at the corner of <b>Caroline</b> <b>and</b> Ann streets was originally built in 1855 for the Currys, a prominent local family. At Caroline Street's southern terminus across from the Presidential Gates is the Airways Building, which served as the original Pan American World Airways office during its formation in 1927.|$|E
