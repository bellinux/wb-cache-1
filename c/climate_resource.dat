40|$|Many factors, {{including}} <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> availability, {{and habitat}} diversity, {{have been proposed}} as determinants of global diversity, but the links among them have rarely been studied. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we investigated direct and indirect effects of climate variables, host-plant richness, and habitat diversity on butterfly species richness across Britain, at 20 -km grid resolution. These factors were all important determinants of butterfly diversity, but their relative contributions differed between habitat generalists and specialists, and whether the effects were direct or indirect. Climate variables had strong effects on habitat generalists, whereas host-plant richness and habitat diversity contributed relatively more for habitat specialists. Considering total effects (direct and indirect together), climate variables had the strongest link to butterfly species richness for all groups of species. The results suggest that different mechanistic hypotheses to explain species richness may be more appropriate for habitat generalists and specialists, with generalists hypothesized to show direct physiological limitations and specialists additionally being constrained by trophic interactions (climate affecting host-plant richness) ...|$|E
30|$|Due to the simpleness {{and cheap}} {{implementation}} cost, air cooling {{is the most}} common approach used in the industry. Cooling energy is primarily consumed by chillers, CRACs, pumps, cooling towers, and fans, which compose a “standard” cooling subsystem. There are a number of works concentrating on energy-minimization techniques for air cooling systems. For instance, Iyengar and Schmid [8] modeled energy consumption for every component based on physics. They also formulated a holistic energy model of HVAC subsystem by adding up the energy of overall components within a cooling system. Their models are capable of estimating energy consumption and heat transfer phenomenon. Some experiments [27 – 29] leveraged the active tiles to balance cooling airflow velocity between under-provisioning and over-provisioning. With the assistance of active tile fans, they tried to exactly provide the airflow volume required by servers. Taking full advantages of local <b>climate</b> <b>resource,</b> some studies concentrated on saving cooling energy by air-side economizer [30, 31]. Khalaj et al. [32] conducted cooling energy simulations for nine different air economizers, and carried out measurement for 23 location in Australia.

One of several metrics for the suitability of climate for sightseeing is Mieczkowski’s “Tourism Climatic Index” (TCI), which summarizes and combines seven climate variables.

40|$|We {{studied the}} floristic {{composition}} in the pastures of the Southern Alps (Trento Province, Italy). One hundred and five plots in seven different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2) montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5) calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures. Forward selection and variation partitioning {{were applied to}} identify {{the most important factors}} controlling the species composition and plant traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main environmental filters: <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> availability, and grazing pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect. Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature, soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type — soil pH. Our results confirm the importance of taking the effects of climate and resource availability into account when describing plant and community functions of grasslands...|$|E

Fossil algae (diatoms, pigments) and invertebrates (chironomids) in Pasqua Lake were analyzed by variance partitioning analysis (VPA) to determine the relative importance of <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> use, and urbanization as controls of aquatic community composition 1920 – 1994. From fossil analyses, we identified three distinct biological assemblages in Pasqua Lake. Prior to agriculture (ca. 1776 – 1890), the lake was naturally eutrophic with abundant cyanobacterial carotenoids (myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll), eutrophic diatoms (Stephanodiscus niagarae, Aulacoseira granulata, Fragilaria capucina/bidens), and anoxia-tolerant chironomids (Chironomus). Principal components (PCA) and dissimilarity analyses demonstrated that diatom and chironomid communities did not vary significantly (P � 0. 05) before European settlement. Communities changed rapidly during early land settlement (ca. 1890 – 1930) before forming a distinct assemblage ca. 1930 – 1960 characterized by elevated algal biomass (inferred as �-carotene), nuisance cyanobacteria, eutrophic Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and low abundance of deep-water zoobenthos.

40|$|Climate is {{important}} to tourism, but {{the relationship between the}} two is complex. This is because of the multifaceted nature of climate and the complicated way these variables come together to give meaning to a particular weather or climate condition for tourism. Researchers have attempted to tackle the problem by integrating relevant climate and tourism variables into a single index for ease of interpretation. However, these indices have been largely reliant on subjective judgements of the researcher(s) and not validated through field investigation. In the present study we aim to address this limitation by devising and then testing a theoretically informed and practically useful climatic index for tourism. The Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) can be derived using either standard climate data or, for short-time forecasts, weather variables. In either case the CIT relies on actual observations rather than on averaged data. The CIT combines three conceptual attributes of climate for tourism and recreation: the thermal, aesthetic and physical/mechanical. Unlike some existing climate indices for the tourism-recreation sector that rated the climate for broad-based “cultural tourism ” or “urban tourism”, the CIT rates the <b>climate</b> <b>resource</b> for activities that are highly climate/weather sensitive (e. g., beach holidays, resort tourism, water-based sporting holidays).

40|$|Geographic and cross-national {{variation}} {{in the frequency of}} intrastate armed conflict and civil war is a subject of great interest. Previous theory on this variation has focused on the influence on human behaviour of <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> competition, national wealth, and cultural characteristics. We present the parasite-stress model of intrastate conflict, which unites previous work on the correlates of intrastate conflict by linking frequency of the outbreak of such conflict, including civil war, to the intensity of infectious disease across countries of the world. High intensity of infectious disease leads to the emergence of xenophobic and ethnocentric cultural norms. These cultures suffer greater poverty and deprivation due to the morbidity and mortality caused by disease, {{and as a result of}} decreased investment in public health and welfare. Resource competition among xenophobic and ethnocentric groups within a nation leads to increased frequency of civil war. We present support for the parasite-stress model with regression analyses. We find support for a direct effect of infectious disease on intrastate armed conflict, and support for an indirect effect of infectious disease on the incidence of civil war via its negative effect on national wealth. We consider the entanglements of feedback of conflict into further reduced wealth and increased incidence of disease, and discuss implications for international warfare and global patterns of wealth and imperialism...|$|E
40|$|Paleoecological {{analyses}} of fossil chironomid assemblages from eight lakes of the Qu’Appelle Valley, Saskatch-ewan, Canada, {{were used to}} quantify the relative influence of <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> use, and urbanization on benthic invertebrate communities 1850 – 1995. Fossil analyses inferred that Qu’Appelle lakes are naturally productive but that invertebrate communities were altered by agriculture and urbanization. In western lakes, rates of community change (chord distance per 5 yr) were low and nonsignificant (P. 0. 05) prior to European settlement, but increased twofold after; 1930 – 1940. In contrast, uniformly significant rates of community change were recorded in eastern downstream lakes only after the 1960 s. In both cases, high rates of change corresponded to alterations in the balance between deep-water (Chironomus) and littoral species (Cladotanytarsus mancus group, Tanytarsus s. lat. [s. l. ]). Comparison of historical and fossil time series (; 1920 – 1993) using variance partitioning analysis (VPA) explained up to 86. 6 % of past variations in chironomid community composition. Unexpectedly, climate (winter temperature) explained a significant (P, 0. 05) and substantial (mean 6 SD, n 5 8; 24. 8 6 21. 9 %) amount of community variance at all sites except Round Lake.

40|$|Biomass {{production}} in grasslands, {{a key component}} of food provision for domestic herbivores, is known to depend on <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> availability, and on the functional characteristics of communities. However, the combined effects of these different factors remain largely unknown. The aim {{of the present study was}} to unravel the causes of variations in the standing biomass of plant communities using a long-term experiment conducted in a Mediterranean rangeland of Southern France. Two management regimes, sheep grazing and grazing associated with mineral fertilization, were applied to different areas of the study site over the past 25 years. Abiotic (temperature, available water, nutrients) and biotic (components of the functional structure communities) factors were considered to explain interannual and spatial variations in standing biomass in these rangelands. Standing biomass was highly predictable, with the best model explaining; 80 % of variations in the amount of biomass produced, but the variation explained by abiotic and biotic factors was dependent on the season and on the management regime. Abiotic factors were found to have comparable effects in both management regimes: The amount of biomass produced in the spring was limited by cold temperatures, while it was limited by water availability and high temperatures in the summer. In the fertilized community, the progressive change in the functional structure of the communities had significant effects on the amount of biomass produced: the dominance of few productive species which were functionally close led to higher peak standing biomass in spring.

40|$|The western {{coast of}} Ireland {{possesses}} {{one of the}} highest wave energy resources in the world and consequently is a promising location for the future deployment of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). Most wave climate studies for this region have focused primarily on the offshore area since it enjoys higher energy densities. However, recent studies have shown that nearshore locations offer a similar potential for the exploitation of wave energy as offshore sites [13]. Furthermore, the proximity of WEC devices to the shore will likely reduce losses in power transport, and facilitate access for maintenance activities. In this context, we analyse the wave climate over a ten year period for several nearshore sites off the Irish West Coast. The wave climate is estimated using a spectral wave model, WaveWatch III, forced with wind and spectral wave data from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast) operational archive. The wave model is validated with wave buoy data from intermediate to shallow depths (< 60 m). Our focus is on two aspects of the wave <b>climate</b> <b>resource</b> assessment. Firstly, we characterise the directionality of the wave energy resource (mean direction, directional spread) which affects the site selection, design and performance of nearshore WECs. Secondly, we discuss the climate data from the perspective of accessibility for maintenance. When selecting sites for the deployment of WECs, a balance needs to be found between two opposing criteria: the existence of sufficiently long, continuous time intervals of calm sea states (weather windows) which are necessary for maintenance activities to take place, and a high, consistent level of wave energy density, essential for economically viable wave energy extraction...|$|E
40|$|Partially {{decomposed}} {{plant and}} animal remains have been accumulating in organic soils (i. e. > 40 % C content) for millennia, making them the largest terrestrial carbon store. There is growing concern that, in a warming world, soil biotic processing will accelerate and release greenhouse gases that further exacerbate climate change. However, {{the magnitude of this}} response remains uncertain as the constraints are abiotic, biotic and interactive. Here, we examined the influence of resource quality and biological activity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under different soil moisture regimes. Organic soils were sampled from 13 boreal and peatland ecosystems located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Sweden, representing a natural resource quality range of C, N and P. They were incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 °C) at either 60 % or 100 % water holding capacity (WHC). Our results showed that chemical and biological properties {{play an important role in}} determining soil respiration responses to temperature and moisture changes. High soil C : P and C : N ratios were symptomatic of slow C turnover and long-term C accumulation. In boreal soils, low bacterial to fungal ratios were related to greater temperature sensitivity of respiration, which was amplified in drier conditions. This contrasted with peatland soils which were dominated by bacterial communities and enchytraeid grazing, resulting in a more rapid C turnover under warmer and wetter conditions. The unexpected acceleration of C mineralization under high moisture contents was possibly linked to the primarily role of fermented organic matter, instead of oxygen, in mediating microbial decomposition. We conclude that to improve C model simulations of soil respiration, a better resolution of the interactions occurring between <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> quality and the decomposer community will be required...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{changes in}} public elderly care in Sweden have been {{resulting}} in a standing need of updating staff competence to match the new demands and maintain quality. Since the ability to learn is of importance when confronting changing conditions, organizations in general, {{as well as the}} authorities responsible for elderly care, invest large amounts of resources in learning in the workplace. However, the success of such investments depends on the interactions among numerous individual and organizational factors. This thesis has aimed at increasing our understanding of the process and consequences of the learning intervention Steps for Skills in the context of elderly care, by addressing three specific research aims. The first aim focused on the psychosocial environment as a precondition for learning. The perceived learning climate was addressed in Study 1, and correlations were found between leaders’ and employees’ perceived learning climate and, to some extent, between employees’ perceived learning climate and work group skills. The second aim focused on the consequences of the intervention for employees in terms of their psychosocial environment and the building of new infrastructures for learning. Changes in perceived learning climate and their relation to the transfer of knowledge were addressed in Study 2. It was found that the intervention had influenced the perceived learning climate differently for different groups. In addition, the use of the new knowledge depended on the learning climate. The consequences for employees were also addressed in Study 3 by examining the relation between process and outcome. Results showed that although the same method was used, the content of the improvement work differed, influencing employees’ perceptions of the learning <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> adequacy and workload differently. The third research aim focused on the consequences of the intervention for elderly by addressing elderly care quality, conceived as autonomy-support. The results from Study 4 identified too many constraining interactions for elderly care to be described as an autonomy-supportive. It is concluded that general quality improvement work does not guarantee increased autonomy-support. All in all, these results show that context and process matter, and also provide information concerning quality improvement through learning interventions. Lärande och kunskap i äldreomsor...|$|E
