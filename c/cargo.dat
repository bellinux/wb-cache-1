5|$|British Airways {{provides}} <b>cargo</b> services {{under the}} British Airways World <b>Cargo</b> brand. The division {{has been part}} of IAG <b>Cargo</b> since 2012, and is the world's twelfth-largest <b>cargo</b> airline based on total freight tonne-kilometres flown. BA World <b>Cargo</b> operates using the main BA fleet. Until the end of March 2014 they also operated three Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft providing dedicated long-haul services under a wet lease arrangement from Global Supply Systems. The division operates an automated <b>cargo</b> centre at London Heathrow Airport and handles freight at Gatwick and Stansted airports.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of its A330 fleet {{and the introduction of}} Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft, the airline converted some of its older Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft to freighters to meet <b>cargo</b> market demands. EVA Air <b>Cargo</b> established its European <b>Cargo</b> Center in Brussels in 2003 and opened its Southern China <b>Cargo</b> Center in Hong Kong in 2006.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{divides the}} foreign trade traffic of major North China ports into export and import <b>cargoes</b> {{for the past}} 10 years. Then, the {{concentration}} ratios and shift effects are analyzed {{in order to determine}} their relationships with the ports’ competition structures. Here, the HHI, a BCG matrix analysis, and the shift effects are applied as study methods. The results indicate that the oligopoly market structure of major North China ports has gradually decreased. Furthermore, the concentration ratios of import <b>cargoes</b> are higher than those of export <b>cargoes,</b> indicating that competition to attract import <b>cargoes</b> will intensify. Therefore, the effects of the South Korea–China FTA mean that the competition structures of these ports with regard to export and import <b>cargoes</b> are highly likely to be differentiated further over time...|$|R

5|$|The Deepak-class tanker {{can carry}} 17,900 tonnes of <b>cargo,</b> {{including}} 15,500 tonnes of liquid <b>cargo</b> (water, ship and aircraft fuel) and 500 tonnes of solid <b>cargo</b> (victuals and ammunition). The modern <b>cargo</b> handling facility {{on board the}} ship enables transfer of heavy solid <b>cargo</b> via a 30 tonne capacity deck crane, and simultaneous fuelling of multiple ships at sea, and can refuel {{at the rate of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour. Workshop facilities on the ship can support other ships of the fleet and it is capable of supporting heavy helicopters.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a <b>cargo</b> module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the <b>cargo</b> module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the <b>cargo</b> module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the <b>cargo</b> module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} <b>cargo</b> module.|$|E
5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's <b>cargo</b> ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type <b>cargo.</b> In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk <b>cargo</b> in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total <b>cargo</b> volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|The Guild’s {{extensive}} {{work on the}} porcelains of Drake and Cermeño {{along with}} those of other <b>cargos</b> from across the globe have firmly established that two different <b>cargoes</b> have been found at Drakes Bay native American sites.|$|R
5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control {{this sort of}} problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required <b>cargoes</b> to be leveled, or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} <b>cargo's</b> surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in <b>cargoes</b> such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.|$|R

5|$|British Airways World <b>Cargo</b> was the airline's freight {{division}} {{prior to}} its merger with Iberia <b>Cargo</b> to form IAG <b>Cargo.</b> Aircraft types used by the division between 1974 and 1983 were Vickers 953C, Boeing 707-300C and Boeing 747-200F while the Boeing 747-400F was operated from the 1990s to 2001 through Atlas Air and 2002 to early 2012 by Global Supply Systems, of these only one of Atlas Air's aircraft wore BA livery, the others flew in Atlas and Global Supply's own colours. From 2012 until the termination of Global Supply System's contract in 2014, three Boeing 747-8F aircraft were flown for British Airways World <b>Cargo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bulk <b>cargo</b> {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: <b>cargo</b> shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and <b>cargo</b> saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient <b>cargo</b> handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cargo</b> {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} <b>cargo</b> and the top of the hold. <b>Cargo</b> is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more <b>cargo</b> to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E

5|$|Dedicated EVA Air <b>Cargo</b> {{operations}} {{began in}} April 1995, {{with the first}} weekly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. EVA Air Cargo's fleet was expanded to five freighters {{by the end of}} the year. Previously, EVA Air <b>Cargo</b> operations mainly relied on passenger aircraft <b>cargo</b> space.|$|E
5|$|Further {{investments}} beyond {{construction of}} the new terminal were planned since 2007 for bulk <b>cargo</b> terminal equipment worth €80M, <b>cargo</b> terminal equipment worth €11million, replacement of equipment in pre-2007 port facilities valued at €26million and re{{construction of the}} liquid <b>cargo</b> terminal worth €70million. These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010. The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build-operate-transfer contracts and public–private partnerships. The investments made since 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port's throughput from 8 to 10million tonnes of <b>cargo</b> per year.|$|E

40|$|Extracellular vesicles {{deliver a}} variety of <b>cargos</b> to {{recipient}} cells, including the delivery of <b>cargos</b> in dietary vesicles from bovine milk to non-bovine species. The rate of discovery in this important line of research is slowed by a controversy whether the delivery and bioactivity of a single class of vesicle <b>cargos,</b> microRNAs, are real or not. This opinion paper argues that the {{evidence in support of}} the bioavailability of microRNAs encapsulated in dietary exosomes outweighs the evidence produced by scholars doubting that phenomenon is real. Importantly, this paper posits that the time is ripe to look beyond microRNA <b>cargos</b> and pursue innovative pathways through which dietary exosomes alter metabolism. Here, we highlight potentially fruitful lines of exploration...|$|R
