He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> <b>wires,</b> and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E

The cable tie, originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|E

2500|$|While {{considered}} simple by today's standards, the [...] "flying" [...] {{effects on}} Adventures of Superman were advanced for the period, although during season one {{it was apparent}} that, for distance flight shots, Superman was lying on a flat surface, his torso and thighs noticeably flattened between elbows and knees. Beginning with season two, Superman's [...] "flying" [...] involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. <b>Cables</b> <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> were used for Superman’s take-offs early in filming. In early episodes, stuntmen sometimes replaced Reeves for Superman’s wire-assisted take-offs. When Reeves came close to suffering a concussion in the episode [...] "Ghost Wolf" [...] (the supporting wires snapped and he fell to the studio floor), <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> were discarded and a springboard was brought in, designed by Thol [...] "Si" [...] Simonson, who remained with the series until its end. Reeves would run into frame and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him out of frame (sometimes over the camera) and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, {{to make it look}} as though he was actually taking off. The flying scenes were accomplished through a relatively few number of repeated shots. The typical technique had footage of Reeves stretched out on a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a boom microphone, allowing him to bank as if in flight. In a couple of later episodes, such as [...] "The Atomic Secret", Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes in marked contrast to the stock footage of Superman in flight.|$|E

We explored {{the relationship between the}} innovative activities of the firm and explanatory variables established in the literature. Data for the study was collected through a structured questionnaire, relevant publications and focused discussions with key individuals. Our results show that the firm’s performance is poor in terms of technological innovation. However, we found strong evidences of organisational and marketing innovation as well as significant benefits derived from the industry association. We therefore conclude, contrary to expectations, that it is very unlikely that the seemingly impressive performance of the firms in Nigeria’s <b>Cable</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wire</b> manufacturing sub-sector can be adduced to technological innovation capability. Further studies are required to confirm this position...|$|R
