40|$|The primary {{objective}} for this thesis is {{to contribute to}} the understanding of the oxide removal process for a corrosion sensing device. The goal for designing such a device is for monitoring corrosion on metallic structures. The sensing material (6. 35 mm x 1 mm discs) of the device is composed of <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> particles mixed in some polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The PDMS, “housing,” is meant for controlling the oxidation rate through the sensing material. A solvent was used to facilitate the etchant diffusion through the PDMS matrix. Toluene and acetic acid were the ideal solvent and etchant, respectively, for carrying out the oxide removal process. [1] The experimental setup used a Microsoft® LifeCam to measure the expansion of the sensing material submitted to the oxide removal process. LabVIEW™ and Vision Assistant™ where used to acquire and store the swelling data, which was then analyzed in Matlab®. There were two oxide removal processes adopted in this thesis. The first process consisted of submerging the <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> to PDMS composite sample in toluene until it reached its known maximum growth size and then adding the etchant to carry out the oxide removal process. This process proved to be efficient and failure proof. Though the time for reaching maximum growth weighed against the oxide removal time, this process ensured a thorough oxide etching within the sensing material. The second process consisted of premixing the solvent and etchant prior to submerging the <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> to PDMS composites. The second process proved to be faster than the first process, since the sample was not initially grown to its maximum size, with an average time constant (maximum swelling and supposedly complete oxide removal time) differed by about half the average time constant of the first process. Two different growth instances with two different time constants were observed on the graphs of the second process. These instances could be caused by the removal of the oxide which had previously stiffened the PDMS structure prohibiting the solvent from reaching certain areas of the PDMS’s matrix. Once the oxide removed, those areas were exposed permitting the solvent to have access thus causing a second distinct growth instance for the same <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> composite sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of carboxylic acids with copper {{is a phenomenon}} found both outdoors and, more commonly, indoors. The influence on copper of some carboxylic acids (formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric) have so far been studied at concentrations levels at least three or four orders of magnitude higher than actual indoor conditions (< 20 ppb, volume parts per billion), and with only limited emphasis on any mechanistic approach. In this licentiate study a unique analytical setup has been successfully applied for in situ characterization and quantification of corrosion products formed during initial atmospheric corrosion of copper {{in the presence of}} acetic, formic or propionic acid. The setup is based on monitoring mass changes by the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and simultaneously identifying the chemical species by infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). Post-analysis of corrosion products was performed by coulometric reduction (mass of <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> formed), grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (phase identification) and atomic force microscopy (surface topography). The absolute amounts of mass of individual constituents in the corrosion products, mainly <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> or cuprite, copper (II) carboxylate and water or hydroxyl groups, have been deduced in situ during exposure in 120 ppb of carboxylic acid concentration, 95 % relative humidity and 20 ºC. An overall result is the consistency of analytical information obtained. For <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> the quantified data estimated from IRAS, QCM or coulomeric reduction agrees with a relative accuracy of 12 % or better. The {{interaction of}} copper with the carboxylic acids seems to follow two spatially separated main pathways.

The first pathway is initially very fast but levels off with a more uniform growth over the surface. This pathway dominates in acetic acid. The second pathway exhibits a more constant growth rate and localized growth, and dominates in formic acid. Propionic acid exhibits low rates for both pathways. The difference between the carboxylic acids with respect to both total corrosion rate and carboxylate-induced dissolution can be attributed to differences in acid dissociation constant and deposition velocity...|$|E

40|$|Degradation {{of metals}} through {{atmospheric}} corrosion {{is a most}} important and costly phenomenon with significant effects on, e. g., the lifespan of industrial materials, the reliability of electronic components and military equipment, and the aesthetic appearance of our cultural heritage. Atmospheric corrosion {{is the result of}} the interaction between the metal and its atmospheric environment, and occurs in the presence of a thin aqueous adlayer. The common incorporation of pollutant species into this adlayer usually enhances the degradation process. During atmospheric corrosion indoors, low concentrations of organic atmospheric constituents, such as formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and oxalic acids, have found to play an accelerating role on a broad range of metals or their alloys, including lead, steel, nickel, copper, cadmium, magnesium and zinc. In this doctoral thesis the initial stages of the atmospheric corrosion of copper exposed to synthetic air, aiming at simulating representative indoor atmospheric environments, have been investigated both experimentally and through a computational method. The experiments have been based on a unique analytical setup in which a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was integrated with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). This enabled the initial atmospheric corrosion of copper to be analyzed during ongoing corrosion in humidified air at room temperature and additions of 120 ppb (parts per volume billions) of acetic, formic or propionic acid. The main phases identified were <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> (Cu 2 O) and various forms of copper carboxylate, and their amounts deduced with the different analytical techniques agree with a relative accuracy of 12 % or better. Particular emphasis has been on the identification of different forms of <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> generated during these exposures. An electrochemically based model has been proposed to describe how copper oxides, formed in the presence of acetic acid, are electrochemically reduced in neutral solution. The model includes the electrochemical reduction of copper (II) oxide (CuO), amorphous <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> (Cu 2 O) am, intermediate <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> (Cu 2 O) in, and crystalline <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> (Cu 2 O) cr. A good agreement is obtained between the model and experimental data, which supports the idea of a reduction sequence which starts with copper (II) oxide and continues with the reduction of the three copper (I) oxides at more negative potentials. The quantified analytical data obtained in this doctoral study on corrosion products formed on copper, and corresponding data on zinc reported elsewhere, were used as the starting point to develop a computational model, GILDES, that describes the atmospheric corrosion processes involved. GILDES considers the whole interfacial regime in which all known chemical reactions have been considered which are assumed to govern the initial atmospheric corrosion of copper or zinc in the presence of carboxylic acids. The model includes two separate pathways, a proton-induced dissolution of cuprous ions or zinc ions followed by the formation of either <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> <b>oxide</b> or zinc (II) oxide, and a carboxylate-induced dissolution followed by the formation of either copper (II) carboxylate or zinc (II) carboxylate. The model succeeds to predict the two main phases in the corrosion products and a correct ranking of aggressiveness of the three acids for both copper and zinc. The ranking has been attributed to differences in acid dissociation constant and deposition velocity of the carboxylic acids investigated. QC 2011111...|$|E

Methods: <b>Copper</b> (<b>I)</b> -treated (100 μM) bovine retinal homogenates were incubated with 6 different concentrations (i. e. 0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 00, 2. 00 and 4. 00 mM) of N-acetyl-serotonin or vitamin E. The malondialdehyde level was measured as an index of lipid peroxidation. Results: <b>Copper</b> (<b>I)</b> ions induced a significant dose-dependent increase in malondialdehyde (p= 0. 007). Co-incubation with N-acetyl-serotonin or vitamin E significantly suppressed the <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> -induced malondialdehyde production (p< 0. 0001).

Another <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> complex [Cu(DADPh 2) (PPh 3) ]PF 6 (5) can also be obtained by the one pot reaction involving ligand 1, [Cu(CH 3 CN) 4]PF 6 and triphenylphosphine. Solid state structures of all the five compounds were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The solid state structures of the copper complexes 3 - 5 reveal a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> centers. The <b>copper</b> complexes 3 - 5 were tested as catalysts for the coupling reaction of o-iodophenol and phenyl acetylene and {{it was observed that}} complex 4 exhibits the highest catalytic activit...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pinoline is a pineal {{indoleamine}} naturally {{found in}} the retina. This study compared the effects of pinoline and vitamin E on the <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> -induced retinal lipid peroxidation (LPO). Methods: Porcine retinal homogenates were mixed with 120 μM <b>copper</b> (<b>I)</b> solution. The mixtures were co-incubated with various concentrations of pinoline or trolox (water-soluble vitamin E analogue) at 37 degrees Centigrade for 60 minutes. The amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein were assayed to quantify the LPO. Results: <b>Copper</b> (<b>I)</b> ions significantly increased the MDA concentration in the retinal homogenates (p < 0. 0007). Both pinoline and trolox significantly suppressed MDA in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0. 0001) and their effects were significantly different (p = 0. 004). The concentrations that inhibited 50 per cent of LPO were 0. 24 mM and 0. 68 mM for pinoline and trolox, respectively. Discussion: Pinoline suppressed the LPO at a potency of 2. 8 times compared with trolox. The results support an anti-oxidative role for pinoline in the retina. Further study is required to characterise the pharmacological potency of pinoline in vivo. School of Optometr...|$|R
