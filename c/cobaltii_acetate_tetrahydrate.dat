50|$|Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) {{nanoparticles}} {{are generally}} synthesized at low temperature; However, {{the tendency of}} Co3O4 to grow into complex microstructure made the addition of organic surfactant necessary. Organic surfactant is both expensive and pollutant. Using organometallic molecular as a precursor to synthesize Co3O4 under high temperature can ensure purity, composition, phase purity, and microstructure. Using organometallic chemistry, Co3O4 is synthesized by heating 0.01 mol of bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediiminecobalt(II, known as Co-(salen), to 500 °C in the air. The synthesis of the organometallic molecular precursor Co-(salen) is prepared by first making the bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine crystal. By dissolving salicylaldehyde in methanol with drops of 1,2- ethylenediamine, 92% of bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine crystal could be purified via reflux and filtration. Bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediirninccobalt(II) is then prepared by adding <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> in propanol and warmed to 50 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, followed by adding bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine and purification through reflux and recrystallization.|$|E

The reaction mixtures were analysed by HPLC. Product identification was via the use of authentic compounds and retention times. The oxidation of 4 -t-butyltoluene using hydrogen peroxide yielded five measurable products, 4 -t-butylbenzaldehyde, 4 -t-butylbenzoic acid, 4 -t-butylphenol, 4 -t-butylbenzyl bromide, and 4 -t-butylbenzyl alcohol. The major product was 4 -t-butylbenzaldehyde. The selectivity with respect to 4 -t-butylbenzaldehyde depended upon the temperature, addition time of oxidant, oxidant type and concentration, and the <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> and sodium bromide concentrations. The effect of the temperature at which the reaction was operated was studied. It was found that the oxidation of 4 -t-butyltoluene should be carried out at lower temperatures due to the instability of the hydrogen peroxide at the higher temperatures. Th...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of {{transition metal ions}} with ditopic ligands containing two 2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine units linked by flexible spacers can give metallosupramolecular polymers, discrete metallomacrocycles or mixtures of the two. The outcome of the coordination depends on the precise reaction conditions {{as well as the}} nature of the spacer and the transition metal salt. This thesis is concerned with the reaction between cobalt(II) salts and bis(2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) ligands in which the metal-binding domains are linked by flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers. An initial study of the ligands and several model mononuclear bis(2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) cobalt(II) and (III) complexes gave some insight into the solid state and solution properties of these systems, and PGSE NMR spectroscopy was found to be a useful tool for determination of the size of both the ligands and the cobalt(III) complexes in solution. The {{reaction of}} the ditopic ligands with <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> in pure alcohol was found to cause the decomposition of the ligand and the formation of a mononuclear bis(4 '-alkoxy- 2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) cobalt(II) complex. This reaction was extended to monotopic 4 '-substituted- 2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridines and can be considered as a reaction giving rise to polymer end-capping units, thus influencing the final outcome of the coordination. The effect of the anion on the coordination was considered further, and the speciation of mono- and bis(2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) cobalt(II) complexes in solution was investigated using the 4 '-methoxy- 2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine ligand. The product mixtures were found to depend heavily on the anion, solvent and initial ratio of ligand to metal salt. Similar behaviour was observed for a model ditopic ligand. The presence of the mono(2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) cobalt(II) complexes within a system containing the ditopic ligands would also provide polymer end-capping units, influencing the speciation of these mixtures. Finally, a detailed study of the product mixtures obtained from the reactions of the ditopic ligands with cobalt(II) salts revealed a complex dependence of the speciation of many bis(2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine) cobalt(II) complexes on the ligand, anion, solvent, concentration and other seemingly minor reaction parameters. Using the PGSE NMR spectroscopic technique, the sizes of some of the metallomacrocyclic species present in the equilibrium mixtures could be determined. These measurements were in excellent agreement with X-ray crystallographic data. Analysis of initial product mixtures using the same technique suggested that the initial kinetic products of the complexation are significantly larger species. ...|$|E
