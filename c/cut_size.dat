40|$|We {{prove that}} in an undirected graph there are at most O(n 2) <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> {{strictly}} less than 3 = 2 {{of the size of}} the minimum cut. 1 Introduction Recently there have been a number of efforts to bound the number of nearly minimum cuts in a weighted undirected graph. Karger and Stein [2] show that there are at most n 2 ff <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> no more than ff times the size of the minimum cut, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Nagamochi, Nishimura, and Ibaraki [3] provide an improvement on this result by showing that if the size of the minimum cut is, then there are at most Γ n 2 Δ <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> strictly less than 4 3. They demonstrate that their bound is tight with K 4, the complete graph on four vertices, which has 4 <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> 3 and 3 <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> 4, for a total of 7 ? Γ 4 2 Δ <b>cuts</b> of <b>size</b> no more than 4 3 times the optimal.

50|$|Minimum cut {{partitioning}} however fails {{when the}} number of communities to be partitioned, or the partition sizes are unknown. For instance, optimizing the <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> for free group sizes puts all vertices in the same community. Additionally, <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> may be the wrong thing to minimize since a good division is not just one with small number of edges between communities. This motivated the use of Modularity (Q) as a metric to optimize a balanced graph partition. The example in Figure 3 illustrates 2 instances of the same graph such that in (a) modularity (Q) is the partitioning metric and in (b), ratio-cut is the partitioning metric.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{bottom-up}} clustering algorithm based on recursive collapsing of small cliques in a graph. The sizes of the small cliques are derived using random graph theory. This clustering algorithm leads to a natural parallel implementation in which multiple processors are used to identify clusters simultaneously. We also present a cluster-based partitioning method in which our clustering algorithm {{is used as a}} preprocessing step to both the bisection algorithm by Fiduccia and Mattheyses and a ratio-cut algorithm by Wei and Cheng. Our results show that cluster-based partitioning obtains <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 49. 6 % smaller than the bisection algorithm, and obtains ratio <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 66. 8 % smaller than the ratio-cut algorithm. Moreover, we show that cluster-based partitioning produces much stabler results than direct partitioning...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the success}} of recent greedy schemes with tie-breaking rules {{proposed}} by the authors, this paper extends the investigation by considering different greedy approaches for the graph bi-partitioning problem. In particular, a new method is proposed (Diff-Greedy) that ameliorates in a significant way {{the performance of the}} previously proposed Min-Max-Greedy, while requiring less computation. The computational complexity is demonstrated to be O(jEj), E being the edge set of the graph. Experimental results are presented for a large sample of two classes of randomly generated graphs, one with a connection probability independent of the vertices, the second one with a two-dimensional geometric structure. Remarkably enough, the <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> obtained through independent repetitions are close to, and in some cases better than the <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> obtainedby more sophisticated techniques based on standard greedy construction followed by local search with prohibition-based diversification (Tabu Search), for comparable running times...|$|R

This is to help ensure that the paper will cut without white edges due to very small differences in where the blade cuts the cards, and it is almost impossible to cut the cards properly without. Just being a hair off can result in white lines, and the blade itself will pull the paper while cutting. The image on the paper can also shift from page to page which is called a bounce, which is generally off by a hairline on an offset press, but can be quite large on lower end equipment such as a copier or a duplicator press.

But this local process considers one vertex {{at a time}} and fails to move clusters between subsets when the movement of any single vertex increases <b>cut</b> <b>size,</b> even though moving the whole cluster would reduce it. A new heuristic identifies clusters from the population of locally optimized random partitions that must anyway be created to seed the MA, and as the MA runs it makes beneficial cluster moves.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{precedence}} constraints among vertices, the partitioning {{problem for}} time-multiplexed field-programmable gate arrays (TMFPGAs) {{is different from}} the traditional one. In this paper, we first derive logic formulations for the precedence-constrained partitioning problems and then transform the formulations into integer linear programs (ILPs). The ILPs can handle the precedence constraints and minimize <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> simultaneously. To enhance performance, we also propose a clustering method to reduce the problem size. Experimental results based on the Xilinx TMFPGA architecture show that our approach outperforms the list-scheduling (List), the network-flow-based (FBB-m) (Liu and Wong, 1998), and the probability-based (PAT) (Chao, 1999) methods by respective average improvements of 46. 6 %, 32. 3 %, and 21. 5 % in <b>cut</b> <b>sizes.</b> Our approach is practical and scales well to larger problems; the empirical runtime grows close to linearly in the circuit size. More importantly, our approach is very flexible and can readily extend to the partitioning problems with various objectives and constraints, which makes the ILP formulations superior alternatives to the TMFPGA partitioning problems.
