40|$|International audienceThe present review {{summarizes}} the recent {{literature on the}} relation between <b>chronic</b> workplace <b>irritant</b> exposures and asthma, focusing on exposures of low to moderate levels. We discuss results from epidemiological surveys, potential biological mechanisms, and needs for further research. These aspects are largely illustrated by studies on exposure to cleaning products. Recent results from nine population-based and workplace-based epidemiological studies, mostly cross-sectional, found {{an increased risk of}} both new-onset and work-exacerbated asthma among participants exposed to moderate level of irritants and/or cleaning products. Evidence of a causal effect of <b>chronic</b> workplace <b>irritant</b> exposure in new-onset asthma remains limited, mainly {{because of a lack of}} longitudinal studies and the difficulty to evaluate irritant exposures. However, recent epidemiological studies strengthen the evidence of an effect of <b>chronic</b> exposure to <b>irritants</b> in work-related asthma. The underlying mechanism remains unknown but may be related to oxidative stress, neurogenic inflammation and dual irritant and adjuvant effects. However, disentangling <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> effects from either acute irritant-induced asthma or immunological low molecular weight agent-induced asthma is difficult for some agents. Further research is needed to improve assessment of irritant exposures and identify biomarkers...|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis is uncertain. It has been {{hypothesized}} that the pseudodiverticulae are not a primary phenomenon, but rather are secondary to a <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> to the esophagus, or to accentuation in {{the movement of the}} esophagus (hypermotility). Both of these factors lead to obstruction or compression of the subucosal ducts of the esophagus, leading to the formation of the pseudodiverticulae. Autopsy specimens of individuals with esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis have confirmed that the flask-like openings are indeed dilated submucosal glands.

40|$|Bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is a tract {{between the}} biliary system and {{bronchial}} tree {{with the presence}} of bile in the bronchus and the sputum. They are rare but serious complications. In most cases, they are caused by hepatic or subphrenic abscesses, resulting from different conditions. Pulmonary symptoms dominate the clinical picture, and the main manifestations are <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> cough, production of greenish sputum, bronchopneumonia, and dyspnea. The diagnosis of BBF can be confirmed by imaging procedures such as biliary scintigraphy with hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Bronchoscopy can demonstrate the presence of bile in the bronchial tree and may delineate the site of fistula. The treatment strategy for patients with BBF and biliary tract obstruction is the reestablishment of bile drainage, which allows the fistula to heal by reducing intrabiliary pressure. We present two cases of biliary-bronchial fistula, one related to hepatic abscess and the other due to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for common bile duct obstruction secondary to inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Dermal {{exposure}} to alkaline agents {{may lead to}} skin barrier damage and irritant contact dermatitis.

40|$|Background: Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{of the head and}} neck is the 6 th most frequently occurring cancer worldwide, with over 400, 000 cases projected annually. Multiple factors such as tobacco, alcohol, irradiation, virus, and <b>chronic</b> <b>irritants</b> are involved in the development of oral squamous {{cell carcinoma}}s (OSCCs). The most important risk factors are chronic exposure to tobacco and alcohol. Although the evidence that implicates virus is increasing, particularly (human papillomavirus [HPV]), in the carcinogenesis process, the role of virus is not well established. Aim and Objective: This study is designed to assess the presence of HPV in potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the oral cavity as well as to correlate the presence of HPV with addictive habits and histopathological grading of the disease. Materials and Methods: Biopsy samples of OSCC and potentially malignant lesions were obtained and 3, 5 μm thickness sections were cut using a microtome. The sections were collected using a sterile brush and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction for the detection of HPV were done.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about cytokines {{involved}} in <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis. Individual cytokine profiles might explain {{at least part of}} the differences in the individual response to irritation. Our objective was to investigate the relation between baseline stratum corneum (SC) cytokine levels and the skin response to a single and a repeated irritation test. This study also aimed to determine changes in SC cytokine levels after repeated irritation. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema were measured in 20 volunteers after single 24 -hr exposure to 1 % sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and during and after repeated exposure to 0. 1 % SLS over a 3 -week period. SC cytokine levels were measured from an unexposed skin site and from the repeatedly exposed site. Interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha decreased by 30 % after repeated exposure, while IL- 1 RA increased 10 -fold and IL- 8 increased fourfold. Baseline IL- 1 RA and IL- 8 values were predictors of TEWL and erythema after single exposure (r = 0. 55 - 0. 61). 6 subjects showed barrier recovery during repeated exposure. Baseline IL- 1 RA and IL- 8 levels are likely to be indicators of higher skin irritability after single exposure to SLS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cytokines play an {{important}} role in skin inflammation. OBJECTIVES: We determined whether polymorphisms in cytokine genes contribute to the occurrence of occupational <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis (CICD). METHODS: In a case-control study, 9 polymorphisms in the genes coding for interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 8, IL- 10, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha were determined in 197 patients with CICD. 217 apprentices in vocational training for high-risk occupations for CICD served as controls. RESULTS: For all polymorphisms, no differences in genotype distributions were found between patients and controls. However, in patients with self-reported low levels of wet work and irritant exposure, more TNFA - 308 variant genotypes (G/A and A/A) were present compared with those exposed to higher levels or controls, which indicates a TNFA-induced increase of susceptibility. In patients with TNFA - 308 variant genotypes, the prevalence of flexural eczema was higher (48 % and 57 %) compared with that in patients presented with wild-type genotype (30 %). Regarding IL 1 A - 889, prevalence of symptoms of dermatitis was lower in apprentices with T/T or C/T genotype (32 % and 36 %) compared with wild-type genotype (54 %, C/C). This indicates a protective effect of these variant alleles in acquiring hand dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that some genetic variations alter susceptibility to (chronic) dermatitis.

40|$|A {{model of}} chronic {{pulmonary}} infection {{was used for}} studying cellular events in a sequential manner. In this model, agarose beads containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were instilled endotracheally into cats. Nine cats were inoculated with agarose beads containing P. aeruginosa, and four others were inoculated with sterile beads. With a fiberoptic bronchoscope, bronchial washings were obtained biweekly for up to 30 weeks. The quantitative pulmonary inflammatory cell response and alveolar macrophage morphology of the animals exposed to P. aeruginosa were compared with those for the animals exposed to a <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> (agarose beads). Bronchial washings of all animals before inoculation showed that 70 to 90 % of the cells were macrophages. After inoculation with P. aeruginosa, a persistent inflammatory response was observed (60 to 70 % granulocytes). In the sterile-bead-inoculated group, the response was less prominent (30 to 40 % granulocytes). As early as 2 weeks after inoculation, alveolar macrophages from infected animals were larger and had cytoplasmic features that differed from those of controls. Electron microscope examination showed prominent surface alterations in alveolar macrophages from the infected cats. These alterations persisted from 2 to 12 weeks after infection. In animals inoculated with sterile beads, alveolar macrophages exhibited less extensive surface changes that had resolved by week 8. Histologically, chronic bronchiolitis and pneumonia were more severe in the infected animals than in controls. This model of chronic inflammation and macrophage stimulation, {{which is similar to}} the chronic pneumonia of cystic fibrosis, may be a useful approach to answer questions on the role of macrophage activation in chronic lung disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha and its {{receptor}} antagonist IL- 1 ra {{play a role}} in skin inflammation. Several polymorphisms in the IL 1 gene cluster, coding for IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 ra, and IL- 1 beta, {{influence their}} protein expression. Within this cluster, strong linkage disequilibrium has been shown. OBJECTIVE: We studied the association between the polymorphisms IL 1 A- 889 (C [...] >T) and IL 1 B- 31 (T [...] >C) and the concentration of IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 ra in the stratum corneum (SC). METHOD: In 124 patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis, we genotyped the IL 1 A- 889 and IL 1 B- 31 polymorphisms and determined the amount of IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 ra on tape strips obtained from uninvolved skin of the volar forearm. RESULTS: The SC IL- 1 alpha concentration was 23 % and 47 % lower in subjects with IL 1 A- 889 C/T genotype and T/T genotype, respectively, compared with wild-type genotype. In subjects with IL 1 B- 31 C/C genotype, the IL- 1 alpha concentration was 51 % lower compared with C/T and T/T genotypes. The ratio IL- 1 ra/IL- 1 alpha increased twofold in IL 1 A- 889 C/T genotype and threefold in T/T genotype compared with wild type. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown a clear effect of IL 1 genotype on protein expression in the SC. This altered expression may be responsible for the interindividual differences in the inflammatory response of the ski...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) and loss-of-function {{mutations in}} the filaggrin gene (FLG) are both associated with <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis (ICD). As FLG mutations also {{are a major}} risk factor for AD, {{it is not clear}} whether FLG mutations are an independent risk factor for ICD or whether the risk is mediated by AD. To investigate the relative contribution and interaction of FLG mutations and AD in German patients with occupational ICD and controls (vocational school apprentices). A total of 634 patients and 393 controls were genotyped for R 501 X, 2282 del 4, R 2447 X and S 3247 X. Current or past flexural eczema was used as an indicator of AD. FLG mutations were found in 15 · 9 % of the patients with ICD and 8 · 3 % of the controls, with a crude odds ratio (OR) of 2 · 09 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1 · 33 - 3 · 28] for the combined genotype. The adjusted OR for FLG mutations, corrected for AD, was 1 · 62 (95 % CI 1 · 01 - 2 · 58). Subjects with AD were at approximately three times higher risk of developing ICD than controls (OR 2 · 89; 95 % CI 2 · 09 - 3 · 99). There was no evidence of an interaction between these two risk factors. Our results indicate that both FLG mutations and AD increase the risk of ICD.

40|$|Background Polymorphisms in the filaggrin (FLG) gene, which {{result in}} loss of filaggrin production, may alter the skin barrier {{and are a}} {{well-known}} predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis. Objectives As a compromised skin barrier and atopic dermatitis are risk factors for <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis (CICD), our objective {{was to determine whether}} polymorphisms in the FLG gene contribute towards susceptibility to occupational CICD. Methods In a case-control study, the FLG polymorphisms R 501 X and 2282 del 4 were determined in 296 patients with CICD. Two hundred and seventeen apprentices in vocational training for high-risk occupations for CICD were chosen as controls. Data on skin diseases and conditions were collected by dermatologists from patients and by means of questionnaires from controls. Results Heterozygotes for R 501 X and 2282 del 4, FLG null alleles, were more frequent among patients with CICD (12. 5 %) compared with controls (6. 9 %), resulting in an odds ratio of 1. 91 (95 % confidence interval 1. 02 - 3. 59). Among patients who were carriers of a FLG null allele, we found a higher lifetime prevalence of flexural eczema (62 % vs. 46 %; P = 0. 04) and a higher atopy score (13 vs. 10 points; P = 0. 05) compared with noncarriers. In the apprentice group, signs of dermatitis {{before the start of the}} vocational training were four times more prevalent in carriers (43 %) than in noncarriers (10 %; P < 0. 001). Conclusions Our study shows that FLG null alleles are associated with increased susceptibility to CICD; whether or not the FLG null allele is an independent risk factor needs further stud...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common inflammatory skin diseases. The cause of AD is multifactoral and it is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Of all the causes of potential barrier defects, the lowered amino-acid derived natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in the stratum corneum (SC), especially associated with a known filaggrin mutation, shows the strongest link to AD. As a result, quantification of NMF in the SC in both healthy and compromised SC is the principal aim of this thesis. Because tape stripping is a key technique used to harvest the SC, a novel imaging method to measure the amount of SC per tape strip was validated. This method offers rapid, simple and reproducible SC quantification. It shows good correlation with existing gravimetric and infrared absorption methods and may provide a better standard method in the future. The tape-stripping extraction of NMF showed an abundant SC ‘reservoir’ of the constituents in healthy skin. Iontophoretic extraction of NMF was highly dependant upon molecular properties, particularly charge and concentration. In general, charged NMF constituents were easily extracted by reverse iontophoresis, whereas iontophoresis only offered modest enhancement of zwitterionic species. Quantification of NMF at different body sites, specifically forehead and forearm, showed similar profiles. However, forehead SC was thinner, and in general contained a lower total amount of NMF and less-ordered lipids. Forehead SC may therefore be considered a less competent barrier. A 3 -week application of 0. 1 % w/v sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) to healthy volunteers was used to model damaged skin similar to that in AD and <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis. The SC barrier post-treatment showed significantly reduced NMF, substantial lipid disordering, and the presence of immature corneocytes. The methods employed were sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes. In particular, the NMF components present at high levels in the SC may be useful, potential markers for skin ‘health’ and for its resistance to irritant chemicals.

Design: A cross-sectional, descriptive and observational study was carried out among all the residents in 3 Centres for the Aged in Vigo-Spain. The standardized criteria of the DMFT (Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth) index and The Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) of the World Health Organization (WHO) were used. Results: 459 subjects were examined with a mean age of 83. 8 years, 23 % were men and 77 % were women; 45 % fit for everyday life and 23 % require intensive care. In the 85 to 89 -year-old group, 53 % presented both maxillary and mandibular edentulism and 5 % have all of their own teeth. 40 % of residents wear a maxillary and mandibular prosthesis and 21 % do not wear any kind of dental prosthesis; 38 % have complete well-adjusted prosthesis, 28 % badly-adjusted prosthesis and 18 % need replacing. 38 % have inadequate oral hygiene and 20 % of prosthesis wearers have a large amount of build-up of dental plaque-calculus. In the subjects studied, the DMFT index was 27. 02 with a 36 % prevalence of dental caries and a mean of 1. 45 caries (SD ± 2. 58.), with 76. 7 % missing teeth, 3. 6 % filled teeth and 4. 2 % decayed teeth.

We previously reported that nasal administration of environmental irritants acutely increases meningeal blood flow via a TRPA 1 -dependent mechanism involving the trigeminovascular system. Here, we examine whether <b>chronic</b> environmental <b>irritant</b> exposure sensitizes the trigeminovascular system. Methods Male rats were exposed to acrolein, a TRPA 1 agonist, or room air by inhalation for four days prior to meningeal blood flow measurements. Some animals were injected daily with a TRPA 1 antagonist, AP- 18, or vehicle prior to inhalation exposure. Trigeminal ganglia were isolated following blood flow measurements for immunocytochemistry and/or qPCR determination of TRPV 1, TRPA 1 and CGRP levels. Results Acrolein inhalation exposure potentiated blood flow responses both to TRPA 1 and TRPV 1 agonists compared to room air. Acrolein exposure did not alter TRPV 1 or TRPA 1 mRNA levels or TRPV 1 or CGRP immunoreactive cell counts in the trigeminal ganglion. Acrolein sensitization of trigeminovascular responses to a TRPA 1 agonist was attenuated by pre-treatment with AP- 18.

40|$|Occupational dermatoses (OD) have {{topped the}} list of {{occupational}} diseases in Germany for years. Presently, approximately 16, 000 new OD cases are officially reported to public statutory employers’ liability insurance bodies, each year. The disease burden is high not only for individuals but also for society as a whole. Estimated annual economic costs in Germany due to sick-leave and lack of productivity due to OD are more than 1. 5 billion euros. Thus, in recent years, various pilot initiatives aiming to improve prevention of occupational skin diseases (of various degrees of severity) have been developed and recently evaluated in Osnabrück. These activities have been funded by statutory employers’ liability insurance schemes. Concepts underpinning these initiatives include multidisciplinary skin protection teaching programs for various high-risk professions, {{which turned out to}} be pivotal for the success of these projects. A corollary of this work is a nationwide multi-step intervention approach currently implemented by the public statutory insurance system. This approach offers quick preventive help for all levels of severity of OD. These nation-wide activities are accompanied by a national Prevention Campaign: Skin 2007 / 2008 (Figure 1 (Fig. 1)), which focuses mainly on primary prevention. Despite the high prevalence of OD and its poor prognosis, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop <b>chronic</b> <b>irritant</b> dermatitis. Skin irritation tests are thus far of only limited value. Presently, our institution, in collaboration with Amsterdam universities, focuses on immunogenetic risk factors potentially involved in individual susceptibility to OD in order to improve pre-employment counseling and predictive skin testing. For early secondary prevention, the so-called dermatologist’s procedure was recently up-dated in order to provide more rapid dermatological consultation. Additionally, combined outpatient dermatological and educational intervention seminars (secondary individual prevention, SIP) are offered to affected employees. We recently demonstrated the sustainability of the SIP approach in hairdressing for periods of up to 10 years. For those cases of OD, in which the abovementioned outpatient prevention measures are not sufficiently successful, specific interdisciplinary inpatient prevention measures have been developed (tertiary individual prevention, or TIP). TIP represents the ultima ratio within the hierarchical prevention concept of the Osnabrück Model. TIP comprises 2 – 3 weeks of inpatient dermatological diagnostics and treatment as well as intensive health-related pedagogic and psychological counseling. Subsequent to this, 3 consecutive weeks of outpatient treatment are given by a local dermatologist. Each patient remains on sick-leave for a total of 6 weeks to allow full barrier recovery. A total of 764 out of 1164 (66 %) TIP patients treated in our university, followed-up regularly by a local dermatologist for up to 1 year, were successful in remaining in their respective (risk-) professions as assessed by questionnaire 1 year after discharge. Recently obtained SIP and TIP data reveal that there are reliable, evidence-based options for multidisciplinary prevention and patient management of OD, using a combined approach by a network of clinics, practices and statutory social insurance bodies. A multicentre study, which aims to further standardize TIP and evaluate sustainability of prevention in more depth (3 -year dermatological follow-up of 1000 OD patients) is currently being conducted in Germany...|$|R
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled <b>irritants.</b> <b>Chronic</b> bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|R
40|$|Capsaicin, {{a topical}} {{analgesic}} {{used in the}} treatment of <b>chronic</b> pain, has <b>irritant</b> properties that frequently interrupt its use. In this work, the effect of nanoencapsulation of the main capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) on skin irritation was tested in humans. Skin tolerance of a novel vehicle composed of chitosan hydrogel containing nonloaded nanocapsules (CH-NC) was also evaluated. The chitosan hydrogel containing nanoencapsulated capsaicinoids (CH-NC-CP) did not cause skin irritation, as measured by an erythema probe and on a visual scale, while a formulation containing free capsaicinoids (chitosan gel with hydroalcoholic solution [CH-ET-CP]) and a commercially available capsaicinoids formulation caused skin irritation. Thirty-one percent of volunteers reported slight irritation one hour after application of CH-NC-CP, while moderate (46 % [CH-ET-CP] and 23 % [commercial product]) and severe (8 % [CH-ET-CP] and 69 % [commercial product]) irritation were described for the formulations containing free capsaicinoids. When CH-NC was applied to the skin, erythema was not observed and only 8 % of volunteers felt slight irritation, which demonstrates the utility of the novel vehicle. A complementary in vitro skin permeation study showed that permeation of capsaicinoids through an epidermal human membrane was reduced but not prevented by nanoencapsulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundInvestigators have {{suggested}} a correlation of tracheomalacia with <b>chronic</b> inflammation and <b>irritants,</b> such as cigarette smoke. Recent advances in CT imaging {{provide an opportunity}} to non-invasively diagnose the condition {{with a high level of}} accuracy. Dynamic CT of the chest exhibits tracheal collapse with crescentic bowing of the posterior membranous trachea during expiration. Aim of the workTo determine the prevalence of tracheomalacia identified on computed tomography of the chest in patients clinically diagnosed with COPD. Subjects and methodsThirty COPD patients were included in the study and the diagnosis of COPD was based on lung function and reversibility test. The CT protocol focused on the central airways and included imaging during two phases of respiration. The percentage of luminal collapse was calculated by dividing the dynamic expiratory cross-sectional area by the end-inspiratory cross-sectional area and multiplying by 100. If luminal collapse is more than 50 % the case is diagnosed as tracheomalacia. ResultsThis study showed that 20 % (6 of 30) of COPD subjects showed evidence of tracheomalacia based on the criteria of a ⩾ 50 % reduction in the cross-sectional trachea lumen area at end expiration. FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC were statistically significant lower in subjects with tracheomalacia than those without tracheomalacia. ConclusionThe results of this study clarify that a significant subgroup of patients with a reported clinical diagnosis of COPD has features consistent with tracheomalacia on dynamic CT scanning of the chest. This indicates that tracheomalacia may be a hidden comorbidity in COPD...|$|R
40|$|Hand {{dermatitis}} {{is regarded}} as one of the most often observed dermatological disorders among nurses. The factors that increase the risk of developing hand dermatitis are as follows: frequent washing hands, using disinfectants, wetwork conditions, exposure to medical substances, detergents and wearing rubber gloves. Most cases of occupational hand dermatitis is due to <b>chronic</b> exposure to <b>irritants</b> that cause the inflammation on the nonallergic pathway. Recurring contact to irritants disturbes the natural skin barrier and causes inflammation. There are reports showing the presence of skin barrier alterations among nurses working in operating room units. The most common contact allergens in the hospital environment include rubber, latex, medicaments and antiseptic products. In our study the incidence of self-reported hand dermatitis in hospital staff was very high. About 70 % of respondents declared the presence of symptoms of hand eczema within the last 12 months and about 46 % of the studied group had skin lesions at the moment of self-examination. Almost 75 % of employees with hand dermatitis had observed the worsening of skin problems in relation to work and 79 % reported improvement of skin changes during the leisure time. We also noted that a personal or family history of atopy increases the risk of developing hand dermatitis in nurses. We would also like to emphasize the psychological consequencies that affect nurses with hand dermatitis. According to our data 48 % of hospital employees with hand eczema declare psychological distress caused by their skin lesions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of <b>chronic</b> or acute <b>irritant</b> gas exposures to cause asthma or a variant condition, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), was investigated by observing asthma incidence {{in a large}} working population, using person-years at risk (P-YR) to compute relative rates (RR). Health data came from employee examinations at 62 pulp and paper plants. The 39 122 workers who denied asthma beginning before the observation period included: 19 326 denying irritant exposures, with no gassing exposures; 19 349 with self-reported irritant exposures, and no gassing; and 447 with documented gassings. Asthma was defined as self-reported asthma beginning {{after the start of}} observation. P-YR accrued from September 29, 1986, for the nonexposed and exposed workers, and from date of first gassing for gassed workers, and ended with disease onset in any who developed asthma. RR of asthma with 95 % confidence intervals (CI 95) were calculated for the exposed and gassed groups, relative to the nonexposed. Exposed (nongassed) workers had an elevated asthma rate, RR= 1. 48, CI 95 = 1. 17 − 1. 86, after adjustment for effects of gender and number of examinations. The rate in gassed workers was not significantly elevated: RR= 1. 95, CI 95 = 0. 75 − 5. 08. Of the five asthma cases occurring after gassings, none conformed to diagnostic criteria for RADS. Chronic exposures were associated with increased rate of asthma onset, which must be interpreted with caution because self-reported data defined both exposure category and disease. Documented gassings were not associated with significantly increased rate, and none of 447 gassed persons developed RADS...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe airway {{epithelium}} is {{the first}} line of defence in the response to inhaled particles and <b>irritants.</b> <b>Chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease characterised by an irreversible loss of lung function, with cigarette smoking as a major risk factor. Here, we address intraepithelial T-cells in COPD, as these cells are a distinct T-cell subtype thought to have important regulatory functions. We hypothesised that intraepithelial T-cells {{play a role in the}} response to lung irritants and that the T-cell populations would be altered and associated with signs of inflammation in COPD. MethodsBronchoscopy with endobronchial mucosal biopsy sampling was performed in 22 patients (mean age; 57) with stable COPD (median FEV 1 % predicted: 51). Age- and smoking- matched smokers (S) with normal lung function (n= 14) and age-matched non-smokers (NS) (n= 15) served as controls. Airway inflammation was recorded visually using bronchitis index (BI). Biopsy specimens were processed into glycol methacrylate resin and inflammatory cells were stained immunohistochemically. ResultsThe number of intraepithelial CD 4 + T-cells were significantly higher in COPD patients compared to smokers as well as trend towards significance in non-smokers (p= 0. 005 and p= 0. 036, respectively), whereas intraepithelial CD 8 + T-cells number were increased in patients with COPD compared to non-smokers (p= 0. 017). Both patients with COPD and smokers had a higher BI than non-smokers (p< 0. 001 for both). ConclusionsThe present data suggest a role for intraepithelial CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells in stable COPD and indicate that T-cells are of importance in the long-term inflammatory response in COPD or, alternatively, play a regulatory role...|$|R
