50|$|Cylindrical in shape, {{it is made}} of {{cast iron}} with {{internal}} grooves to facilitate fragmentation during its bursting. Its weight is about 490 grams (depending on the version). It contains 60 grams of <b>cheddite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, <b>Cheddite</b> is the {{commercial}} name for an explosive compound {{used as an}} explosive primer for shotgun cartridges. It contains 90% potassium chlorate, 7% paraffin, 3% petroleum jelly, and traces of carbon black.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cheddite</b> is a {{class of}} {{explosive}} materials invented in 1897 by E. A. G. Street of the firm of Berges, Corbin et Cie and originally manufactured {{in the town of}} Chedde in Haute-Savoie, France in the early twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|Closely {{related to}} Sprengel explosives, <b>cheddites</b> {{consisted}} of {{a high proportion of}} inorganic chlorates mixed with nitroaromatics (e.g. nitrobenzene or dinitrotoluene) plus a little paraffin or castor oil as a moderant for the chlorate. Several different types were made, and they were principally used in quarrying. Due to availability of ingredients and easy production process it was also the most common explosive material manufactured by the Polish Underground State in occupied Poland during World War II; it was used for production of the R wz. 42 and Filipinka hand grenades.|$|R
50|$|The Filipinka was an {{offensive}} impact grenade, cylindrical in shape. In {{the upper part}} of the shell a screw for the fuse was located. Coating of the first series (roughly 4,000 produced) was made of Bakelite, which shattered without producing fragments like a metal-bodied grenade. Later the shell was replaced with a metal impress. The filling was composed mostly of home-made explosives, either <b>cheddite</b> or ammonal. At times explosives from German air bombs and artillery shells, as well as British plastic explosive delivered through air bridges was used. The grenade was equipped with a contact fuze which functioned on impact with the target.|$|E
