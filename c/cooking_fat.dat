2500|$|The modern fish-and-chip shop ("chippy" [...] or [...] "chipper" [...] {{in modern}} British slang) {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of <b>cooking</b> <b>fat,</b> heated by a coal fire.

40|$|The {{content of}} fatty acids in margarines and <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> {{changes over time}} due to product development. To receive current {{nutrient}} values on the fat quality in the most common margarines in Sweden, fatty acids were analysed during 2009 and 2010 at the National Food Agency. The whole range of fatty acids and trans fatty acids were analysed, {{and the content of}} saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat as well as omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids were calculated in the margarines. The result shows that the most common margarines and <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> on the Swedish market now has a content of trans fatty acids below 1 percent (except the ones containing dairy fat). This {{is an example of the}} adaptability of the Swedish food industry to demands from authorities and consumers. The National Food Agency will continue to analyse margarines and <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> in order to control that the content of trans fatty acids remains low in Swedish food products...|$|R

50|$|Fires {{involving}} <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> {{and oils}} (classified as class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard class B extinguisher ineffective. Flammable liquids have flash points under 37 degrees Celsius. Cooking oil is a combustible liquid, {{since it has}} a flash point over 37 degrees Celsius. Such fires should be extinguished with a wet chemical extinguisher. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap. This process is endothermic, meaning that it absorbs thermal energy from its surroundings, which decreases {{the temperature of the}} surroundings, further inhibiting the fire.|$|R
2500|$|The Wichita {{lived in}} fixed villages notable for their large, domed-shaped, grass-covered dwellings, {{sometimes}} up to 30 feet in diameter. The Wichita were successful hunters and farmers, skillful traders and negotiators. They ranged from San Antonio, Texas {{in the south}} to as far north as Great Bend, Kansas. A semi-sedentary people, they occupied northern Texas in the early 18th century. [...] They traded with other Southern Plains Indians {{on both sides of the}} Red River and as far south as Waco. For much of the year, the Wichita lived in huts made of forked cedar poles covered by dry grasses. [...] In the winter, they followed American bison in a seasonal hunt and left their villages behind.

2500|$|Many Italian staples {{and internationally}} {{recognized}} favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages {{and the early}} Renaissance; pasta was on everyone's dinner plate by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat; pizza, the medieval Italian term for [...] "pie", and tortes came in many varieties {{with a wide range}} of toppings, ranging from marzipan, and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp; polenta made from French green lentils or barley; risotto; and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone. As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark. Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes (herboletos) and frittatas. Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the <b>cooking</b> <b>fat</b> of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.|$|E
2500|$|To {{some extent}} the Rashaida {{alleviate}} these discrepancies by processing milk {{that is not}} needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into storable products. Unprocessed camel milk remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into {{two different types of}} product with practically unlimited [...] "shelf-life" [...] by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. Through heating, zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as <b>cooking</b> <b>fat</b> or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The other milk product described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun-dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed.|$|E

2500|$|The raw fruit {{can have}} a {{somewhat}} bitter taste, or even an astringent quality, but becomes tender when cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. The fruit is capable of absorbing large amounts of <b>cooking</b> <b>fats</b> and sauces, making for very rich dishes, but salting reduces the amount of oil absorbed. Many recipes advise salting, rinsing, and draining the sliced fruit (a process known as [...] "degorging") to soften it and {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>fat</b> absorbed during <b>cooking,</b> but mainly to remove the bitterness of the earlier cultivars.

50|$|Schmaltz {{rendered}} from {{a chicken}} or goose {{was used by}} northwestern and eastern European Jews who were forbidden by kashrut (Jewish dietary laws) from frying their meats in butter or lard, the common forms of <b>cooking</b> <b>fat</b> in Northern Europe, as butter, being derived from milk, cannot be used with meat under the Jewish prohibition on mixing meat and dairy, and lard is derived from pork, an unkosher meat. Furthermore, tallow derived from beef or mutton would have been uneconomical, particularly given that virtually all suet (the raw material for tallow) is chelev and its consumption is forbidden. Northwestern and Eastern European Jews also could not obtain the kinds of vegetable-derived cooking oils such as olive oil and sesame oil, used in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean (as in Spain and Italy).

5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as <b>cooking</b> <b>fats,</b> butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas.
