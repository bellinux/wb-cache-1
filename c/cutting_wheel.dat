2500|$|The {{can opener}} is a device used to open metal cans. Most non-electrical can openers today use the hand-cranked rotary version {{consisting}} of a wheel with serrated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin cans. The first rotary can opener with a <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented in 1870 by William W. Lyman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who received a U.S. Patent 105,346 on July 12, 1870. In 1925 the Star Can Opener Company of San Francisco improved on Lyman's wheel blade by adding a second, serrated or toothed wheel, called a [...] "feed wheel" [...] or [...] "turning gear" [...] to ride below {{the rim of the}} can and rotate the can against the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{rotating}} <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is located}} at {{the front end of the}} shield. Behind the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> there is a chamber where the excavated soil is either mixed with slurry (so-called slurry TBM) or left as-is (earth pressure balance or EPB shield), depending on the type of the TBM. The choice of TBM type depends on the soil conditions. Systems are also present for removal of the soil (or the soil mixed with slurry).|$|E

5000|$|Whereas all {{previous}} openers required using one hand or other means {{to hold the}} can, can-holding openers simultaneously grip the can and open it. The first such opener was patented in 1931 by the Bunker Clancey Company of Kansas City, Missouri and was, therefore, called the [...] "Bunker". It featured the now standard pliers-type handles, when squeezed would tightly grip the can rim, while turning the key would rotate the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel,</b> progressively cutting the lid along the rim. The <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> is coupled to a serrated feed wheel via a set of gears, as in the Star design. The Bunker company was absorbed by the Rival Manufacturing Company, also of Kansas City, in 1938.|$|E

50|$|A {{can opener}} (in North American English and Australian English) or tin opener (in British and Commonwealth English) is a device used to open tin cans (metal cans). Although {{preservation}} of food using tin cans had been practiced {{since at least}} 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced. The first can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented in 1870 but was considered too difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A breakthrough design came in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> on the ring of the can. This easy to use design {{has become one of}} the most popular can opener models.|$|E
5000|$|A micro {{trencher}} is a [...] "small rockwheel" [...] {{specially designed}} {{for work in}} urban area. It is fitted with a <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> that cuts a microtrench with smaller dimensions than can be achieved with conventional trench digging equipment. Microtrench widths range from about 30 to 130 mm with a depth of 500 mm or less. These machines are sometimes radio-controlled.|$|E
50|$|The {{bucket wheel}} {{from which the}} {{machines}} get their name is a large, round wheel with a configuration of scoops which is fixed to a boom and is capable of rotating. Material {{picked up by the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> is transferred back along the boom. In early cell-type bucket wheels, the material was transferred through a chute leading from each bucket, while newer cell-less and semi-cell designs use a stationary chute through which all of the buckets discharge.|$|E
50|$|The hydromill trench cutter {{is a type}} of {{construction}} equipment designed to dig the narrow but deep trenches used in the casting of slurry walls. Typically, it is a cutter attachment mounted on a crawler crane base machine, with different types of hose handling systems. The machine excavates by cutting the soil using two <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels,</b> while a powerful pump extracts the loose material mixed with some of the slurry, typically bentonite.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{combination}} locked safe that offers high protection against combinations of mechanical, electrical, and cutting tools. The safe will resist abuse for 30 minutes from tools such as hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or electrical tools, grinding points, carbide drills, devices that apply pressure, <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels,</b> power saws, impact tools and, in addition, can withstand an oxy-fuel welding and cutting torch (tested gas limited to [...] combined total oxygen and fuel gas.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Power miter saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple miter saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be cut. Miter saws with abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels</b> are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
50|$|Grinding is {{commonly}} used on cast iron and various types of steel. These materials lend themselves to grinding {{because they can be}} held by the magnetic chuck commonly used on grinding machines, and they do not melt into the wheel, clogging it and preventing it from cutting. Materials that are less commonly ground are Aluminum, stainless steel, brass & plastics. These all tend to clog the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> more than steel & cast iron, but with special techniques it is possible to grind them.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after, {{the first}} Pow-R-Stump Cutter was introduced. While testing a new stump cutter {{prototype}} in 1957, a Vermeer employee accidentally hit the wrong lever which caused the <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> to move horizontally across the stump. This mistake {{led to the}} production of a stump cutter design that is still being used today. Although other devices had been used in removing stumps, they were generally expensive, cumbersome, and not practical for widespread use. The patented Vermeer stump cutter was the first practical, low-cost answer to stump removal.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{pastries}} include kleina, a small fried dough bun {{where the}} dough is flattened and cut into small trapezoids with a special <b>cutting</b> <b>wheel</b> (kleinujárn), a slit cut {{in the middle and}} then one end pulled through the slit to form a [...] "knot". This is then deep-fried in oil. Laufabrauð (lit. [...] "leafbread"), a very thin wafer, with patterns cut into it with a sharp knife and ridged cutting wheels and fried crisp in oil, is a traditional Christmas food, sometimes served with hangikjöt.|$|E

In the last part, the measured unit machine time of the technology of material division with grinding operations and two other methods of dividing the material and wear of <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels</b> are compared...|$|R
50|$|Less than 1% of the world's {{diamonds}} are cut to {{hearts and}} arrows optical symmetry precision. This is {{in large part}} due to the greater amount of rough diamond that necessitates additional polishing to create diamonds with this precise optical symmetry. Diamond polishers take up to three times longer to cut diamonds of this cut quality, with much greater waste of the original diamond rough material.Using specialized tooling and high quality <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels</b> and in some cases 100X magnification, factories must employ careful analysis through every stage of production. Diamonds cut in this way are more expensive than average cut diamonds.|$|R
50|$|Workers must {{completely}} {{strip the}} ship {{down to a}} bare hull, with objects cut free using saws, grinders, abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>wheels,</b> hand held shears, plasma and gas torches. Anything of value, such as spare parts and electronic equipment is sold for re-use, although labour costs mean that low value items are not economical to sell. The Basel Convention demands that all yards separate hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have appropriate storage units, and this must be done before the hull is cut up. Asbestos, found in the engine room, is isolated and stored in custom-made plastic wrapping prior to being placed in secure steel containers, which are then landfilled.|$|R
