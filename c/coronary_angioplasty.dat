25|$|An ECG {{that reveals}} ST segment {{elevation}} or new left bundle branch block suggests complete blockage {{of one of}} the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are now moving to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than thrombolysis if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for angioplasty.|$|E
25|$|Reperfusion {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically {{after a heart attack}} (myocardial infarction) (MI). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis. Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive endovascular procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty.</b> The angioplasty uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents.

[...] Building on their work and his own research involving balloon-tipped catheters, Andreas Gruentzig performed the first success percutaneous transluminal <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> (known as PTCA or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) on a human on September 16, 1977 at University Hospital, Zurich. [...] The results of the procedure were presented at the American Heart Association meeting two months later to a stunned audience of cardiologists. [...] In the subsequent three years, Dr. Gruentzig performed coronary angioplasties in 169 patients in Zurich, while teaching the practice of <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> to a field of budding interventional cardiologists. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} ten years later, nearly 90 percent of these individuals were still alive.

2500|$|Thrombolytic {{therapy to}} abort a {{myocardial}} infarction {{is not always}} effective. [...] The degree of effectiveness of a thrombolytic agent {{is dependent on the}} time since the myocardial infarction began, with the best results occurring if the thrombolytic is used within two hours of the onset of symptoms. Failure rates of thrombolytics can be as high as 50%. In cases of failure of the thrombolytic agent to open the infarct-related coronary artery, the person is then either treated conservatively with anticoagulants and allowed to [...] "complete the infarction" [...] or percutaneous coronary intervention (and <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty)</b> is then performed. [...] Percutaneous coronary intervention in this setting is known as [...] "rescue PCI" [...] or [...] "salvage PCI". Complications, particularly bleeding, are significantly higher with rescue PCI than with primary PCI due to the action of the thrombolytic.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{procedure}} to treat blocked coronary arteries was {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG), wherein a section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the body is used to bypass the diseased segment of coronary artery. In 1977, Andreas Grüntzig introduced percutaneous transluminal <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> (PTCA), also called balloon angioplasty, in which a catheter was introduced through a peripheral artery and a balloon expanded to dilate the narrowed segment of artery. As equipment and techniques improved, the use of PTCA rapidly increased, and by the mid-1980s, PTCA and CABG were being performed at equivalent rates. Balloon angioplasty was generally effective and safe, but restenosis was frequent, occurring in [...] about 30–40% of cases, usually within the first year after dilation. [...] In about 3% of balloon angioplasty cases, failure of the dilation and acute or threatened closure of the coronary artery (often because of dissection) prompted emergency CABGs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{benefit of}} prompt, [...] primary {{angioplasty}} over thrombolytic therapy for acute STEMI is now well established. When performed rapidly, an angioplasty restores {{flow in the}} blocked artery in more than 95% of patients compared with the reperfusion rate of about 65% achieved by thrombolysis. Logistic and economic obstacles seem to hinder a more widespread application of angioplasty, although the feasibility of providing regionalized angioplasty for STEMI is currently being explored in the United States. The use of a <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> to abort a myocardial infarction is preceded by a primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The goal of a prompt angioplasty is to open the artery as soon as possible, and preferably within 90 minutes of the patient presenting to the emergency room. This time {{is referred to as}} the door-to-balloon time. Few hospitals can provide an angioplasty within the 90 minute interval, which prompted the American College of Cardiology (ACC) to launch a national Door to Balloon (D2B) Initiative in November 2006. Over 800 hospitals have joined the D2B Alliance as of March 16, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|If the ECG {{confirms}} changes {{suggestive of}} myocardial infarction (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), thrombolytics may be administered or primary <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasty</b> may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates fibrinolysis, destroying blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial arteries and {{advanced to the}} heart to identify blockages in the coronaries.
