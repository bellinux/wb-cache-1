And they being convinced by their own consciences, &c. if thou dost call the law the light of Christ, that also will <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> or make known sin; For by the law is the knowledge of sin (Rom 3:20). If thou dost call even nature itself, the light of Christ; That also doth shew, that sins are a shame, even those sins which some leap over (1Cor 11:14), and ruffian-like they will wear long hair, which nature itself forbiddeth, and is commended for the same by the apostle. The Spirit of Christ also will <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin. That, because these several things will <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, therefore will they needs be the Spirit of Christ? Or do they altogether make but one Spirit of Christ? dost thou profess thyself {{to walk in the}} light, and art not able to know these things; Or, if thou dost know them art thou so unfaithful as not to tell poor people of them, who are some of them at their wits end, by reason they are not enlightened into these things.|$|R

60|$|I answer. There is conscience, and the law, yea, {{and nature}} itself that doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> son; as before I have proved at large.

He {{that will}} but observe {{the motions of}} that light which very man hath within him (say they) so as to obey and close in with it to follow it, shall {{undoubtedly}} be saved from the wrath to come. Now {{this is clearly a}} gross error; for first, If all men have not Christ, as they have not, then is it not an error to press men to seek for life, by following that which is not able to give life. Yet this they do, who labour to persuade men, yea, the souls of men, that it is no less than the very Spirit of Christ in every man, that doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, when the scriptures say plainly [...] "the law" [...] (Rom 3:14), [...] "Conscience" [...] (Rom 2:15), and nature itself (Rom 2:14; 1Cor 11:14), will and doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, yet none of these is the Spirit of Christ. And the great argument that they bring to prove that it is the Spirit of Christ, is, because the Spirit doth also <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin. Now what a poor argument is this, to say, That because the Spirit <b>of</b> Christ doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, therefore whatsoever doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, must needs be the Spirit of Christ. As much as to say, because the saints are called [...] "the light of the word" [...] (Matt 5:14). Therefore the saints are the Saviour of the world, seeing Christ also doth call himself the light of the world (John 8:12), or because the moon hath, or is light, therefore the moon is the sun. This is but sophistical arguing, and doth beget most damnable errors and heresies in the world; but his is the way that they take, to entangle poor souls with their sad and erroneous doctrine, see page 22 of his book, lines 12 and 13. They say, that it must be Christ within them, that must within them work out justification for them; when it is evident from the whole current of scripture, that the Son of Mary was delivered to be crucified for our offences, and his resurrection, through faith in it, is our justification; as all along, through grace, I have declared and cleared. And the work that the Spirit doth in point of justification, is, to shew us what the Son of Mary hath done an suffered in his own body on the tree, and is now doing in the presence of his Father, in the highest heaven.|$|R
60|$|Then {{thou art}} offended, because I said the devil doth deceive poor souls by bidding them listen within, {{and see if}} there be not that which doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin. friend, all men have not the Spirit, though they have that {{conscience}} that doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> son (John 8:9). Now seeing all men have not the Spirit, is it not a great deceit of the devil to persuade poor souls, that because they are convinced for son by their own consciences, therefore they have the Spirit of Christ: surely it is from the devil. Because he would make thee believe that conscience, which is but a creature, is the Spirit of Christ, by whom the world was made. Again, because the soul, being persuaded that it hath the Spirit (when it hath it not) as all men naturally are without it (Eph 5:13,14), it is kept off from seeking and begging for it, being already persuaded (falsely) that it hath it.|$|R

6000|$|The {{next thing}} I {{take notice of}} is, that thou findest fault with mine answer to this question. [...] "But doth not the scripture say, {{that it is the}} Spirit of Christ that doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin?" [...] Thou sayest it is a good question, but I have confounded it in the answer, and not {{answered}} plainly. Wherefore I shall not at all stick at the pains, to give the reader in brief some of the heads of the answer I then gave to it word for word, or to the same purpose. The answer was, yes, that Spirit doth <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin; but for the better understanding of this place, I shall lay down this, said I, That there are two things spoken of in scripture, that do manifest or <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin. First, the law (Rom 3:20). [...] "For by the law is the knowledge of sin." [...] Secondly, the Spirit of Christ doth also the same, as it is written, [...] "And when he is come, he will 4convince the world of sin" [...] (John 16:7-9). Now say I, sometimes the law itself, by its own power doth manifest sin, {{as in the case of}} Judas, who was so far from having the Spirit of Christ, that the devil had very great possession of him. Which things my adversary doth wrangle at, yet dares not affirm the contrary: only saith this, he had the righteous law of God written in his heart: which thing is not the Spirit of Christ. The law in not of faith. The law is not the comforter, but rather a tormentor: yet the Spirit of Christ is a comforter. Again say I, the Spirit of Christ doth take the law, and doth effectually <b>convince</b> <b>of</b> sin, &c. Then I put forth another question, saying, [...] "But how should I know whether I am convinced by the law alone, or whether the law be effectually set home by the spirit?" [...] To which I answer, when the law doth convince by its own power, it doth <b>convince</b> only <b>of</b> sins against the law; as lying, swearing, stealing, &c. pronouncing an horrible curse against thee if thou fulfil it not, and there leaves thee, but gives thee no power to fulfil it completely and continually, which thou must do, if thou be saved thereby. With which my adversary is much offended; also saying, that I am confounded in my discourse, and so leaves me, confuting none of my words by holy scripture, but falls a railing, because I reckon Pharisees and Quakers together.|$|R

During the country-wide uprisings of 1549 Dudley put down Kett's Rebellion in Norfolk. <b>Convinced</b> <b>of</b> the Protector's incompetence, he and other privy councillors forced Somerset out of office in October 1549. Having averted a conservative reaction in religion and a plot to destroy him alongside Somerset, Dudley emerged in early 1550 as de facto regent for the 12-year-old EdwardVI. He reconciled himself with Somerset, who nevertheless soon began to intrigue against him and his policies. Somerset was executed on largely fabricated charges, three months after Dudley had been raised to the Dukedom of Northumberland in October 1551.|$|E
