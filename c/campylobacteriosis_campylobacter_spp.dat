40|$|The STAT! Campy immunochromatographic assay for Campylobacter antigen was {{compared}} to culture for 500 clinical stool specimens. Antigen was detected in six culture-negative, PCR-positive specimens. C. upsaliensis, a pathogenic species that is tra-ditionally difficult to recover in routine stool cultures, was detected in two of these culture-negative specimens. This study pro-vides evidence that antigen testing may cross-react {{with at least one}} additional non-jejuni and-coli Campylobacter species that may be missed by routine culture for <b>campylobacteriosis.</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> are fastidious bacteria that may be difficultto recover in culture due to suboptimal specimen transport and/or storage conditions and lack of universal culture proce-dures. However, Campylobacter antigens may persist in clinical specimens in the absence of viable organisms. The variable clinical specificity reported for several commercially available Campylo-bacter antigen detection assays remains unresolved in the litera-ture (1 – 4). Several studies have reported higher numbers of anti-gen-positive than of culture-positive specimens (1, 2, 5), but it is unclear whether these are simply false-positive results or are due to Campylobacter spp. in the specimens that are nonviable, viable but nonculturable, or not readily cultivated under commonly employed conditions. This study sought to determine whether culture-negative, antigen-positive specimens, as determined by immunochromatographic assay, actually contained difficult-to-culture Campylobacter spp. which could explain the antigen pos-itivity. In addition, we examined the stability and cross-reactivity profile of the immunochromatographic assay to further define the performance characteristics of the test.

40|$|Background: <b>Campylobacteriosis</b> {{caused by}} <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> {{is the most}} common {{notifiable}} bacterial gastrointestinal disease in Germany and a major problem in many other European countries as well. In contrast to other infectious diseases, e. g., salmonellosis, the annual number of notified campylobacteriosis cases has increased in Germany and other European countries from 2001 – 2010. Methods: National surveillance data from 2001 through 2010 were the basis of {{a detailed description of the}} epidemiological pattern of Campylobacter infections in Germany. Special focus was placed on geographical distribution and time trends of Campylobacter infections as well as the identification of risk groups. Results: In total, 588, 308 cases of campylobacteriosis were recorded during the observed time period. The mean annual incidence increased from 67 cases/ 100, 000 population in 2001 to 80 / 100, 000 population in 2010. Almost 92 % of the notified Campylobacter infections were acquired in Germany. A seasonal distribution was observed with a large peak in the summer months and a small peak in January. Incidence was highest in children ≤ 4 years and young adults 20 – 29 years of age. Especially young children living in rural regions in Germany seemed to be at high risk of Campylobacter infection. Conclusions: Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in Germany, and has been of rising public health concern. There is a need for enhanced prevention of Campylobacter infections and the data presented here may contribute to better target prevention measures with focus on identified risk groups such as children and young adults...|$|R

In most of the cases infection with <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in humans originate from contaminated poultry meat and poultry meat products. This study was designed to estimate prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in meat and meat products imported in Republic of Macedonia. During the period of 8 months (January-August 2008) we tested 56 samples of meat and meat products (poultry meat, MDM, pork meat, beef meat and smoked beef). Samples were submitted to analysis for detection of thermo-tolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> according to ISO 10272 : 1995. We determined among the analyzed samples highest prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in MDM with 84 % positive samples, poultry meat with 81, 8 %, pork meat with 10 %. We didn. t detect any positive samples in beef meat and smoked beef. Overall prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in all tested samples was 55, 36 %. This study shows that the high prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in tested samples and in correlation with severe symptoms in humans are reasons good enough for the producing and processing poultry meat industry and food business operators so they should take in consideration <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in their risk assessment and preparation of HACCP plan...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of non-culturable forms of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> {{especially with regard}} to the epidemiology of this organism in poultry flocks, was explored. Two different experiments were conducted to produce non-culturable <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and test their ability to colonize the animal gut. In the first experiment a mixture of 28 different strains of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> from various sources was inoculated in both sterilized surface water and potassium phosphate buffer and stored at 4 degrees C. After <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> were no longer detectable by culture in the microcosms, the mixtures of non-culturable cells were used to challenge both chicks and mice. Recovery of non-culturable <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> from the animals was not successful at 4 weeks after administration. In the second experiment the survival of six individual strains of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in sterilized surface water at 4 degrees C was studied and the resulting non-culturable cells were used to challenge chicks. None of the campylobacter strains could be recovered from the chicks at 2 weeks after administration. We conclude that occurrence of non-culturable forms of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> capable of colonizing chicks is not a common phenomenon and that non-culturable forms of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> are likely to be insignificant for importantly to the epidemiology of the organism in Dutch broiler flocks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In 2006, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{published}} two standard protocols for {{the detection}} and enumeration of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in foods: the ISO 10272 - 2 (direct method) and the ISO 10272 - 1 (enrichment method). The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficiency of these two methods in the detection of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and propose a modification in the enrichment method. Compared with the enrichment method, the direct method yielded a higher number of positive results for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and, consequently, presented higher sensitivity percentage. The isolation of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> was more difficult when 10 mL of rinse was used in the enrichment method, which is currently recommended by the ISO protocol. Therefore, different rinse volumes were tested (2. 5 and 5 mL). The most efficient recovery of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> occurred when 2. 5 mL of rinse were used in the enrichment method, most likely due to a lower number of microbial contaminants than that present in the 5 or 10 mL rinses.

The presence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> {{as well as the}} detection of multidrug-resistant isolates in this study, indicates that consuming of duck and goose meat might be a potential campylobacteriosis risk in this region.

40|$|Abstract Background Campylobacteriosis is {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported zoonosis in the EU and the epidemiology of sporadic campylobacteriosis, especially the routes of transmission, is {{to a great extent}} unclear. Poultry easily become colonised with <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> being symptom-less intestinal carriers. Earlier it was estimated that internationally between 50 % and 80 % of the cases could be attributed to chicken as a reservoir. In a Norwegian surveillance programme all broiler flocks under 50 days of age were tested for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> The aim of the current study was to identify simultaneous local space-time clusters each year from 2002 to 2007 for human cases of campylobacteriosis and for broiler flocks testing positive for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> using a multivariate spatial scan statistic method. A cluster occurring simultaneously in humans and broilers could indicate the presence of common factors associated with the dissemination of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> for both humans and broilers. Results Local space-time clusters of humans and broilers positive for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> occurring simultaneously were identified in all investigated years. All clusters but one were identified from May to August. Some municipalities were included in clusters all years. Conclusions The simultaneous occurrence of clusters of humans and broilers positive for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> combined with the knowledge that poultry meat has a nation-wide distribution indicates that campylobacteriosis cases might also be caused by other risk factors than consumption and handling of poultry meat. Broiler farms that are positive could contaminate the environment with further spread to new broiler farms or to humans living in the area and local environmental factors, such as climate, might influence the spread of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in an area. Further studies to clarify the role of such factors are needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans {{worldwide}} and human <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> infections can result in severe sequelae. Because broilers are an important reservoir for human <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> infections, it is relevant to control <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> on broiler farms. The costs of interventions to control <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> on broiler farms are important for acceptance and implementation by farmers. In comparing costs of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> interventions on broiler farms between countries, differences in national economic factors, such as interest level and labour costs, are often considered, but differences in average technical and economic performance of broiler farms are not taken into account. This study used a farm calculation model based on the economic engineering-approach to estimate annual costs of eight interventions on a common commercial broiler farm in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom, for the year 2009 considering differences in national economic factors and in technical and economic farm performance. Across countries, the interventions building an anteroom with hygiene barrier, applying designated tools and applying fly screens had the lowest estimated costs and replacing old houses with new houses, slaughter at 35 days and a ban on thinning (partial depopulation) the highest. Applying drink nipples without a cup and having a maximum downtime of ten days resulted in intermediate estimated costs. Across interventions, Poland and Spain had the lowest estimated costs, Denmark and Norway the highest. The estimated costs in the most expensive country were between 67 % and 550 % higher than in the cheapest country, depending on the intervention. The estimated costs of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> interventions on broiler farms varied substantially between countries due to differences in average technical and economic farm performance and in national economic factors. </p...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a presença de <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> na cadeia produtiva de suínos, desde a granja até o abate. Amostras de suabes de fezes e carcaças foram coletadas de três lotes diferentes de suínos em terminação. As coletas foram {{realizadas}} em três etapas: na granja, no frigorífico (pocilga de espera) e em três pontos durante o abate. Ao todo, foram coletadas 45 amostras de suabes de fezes na granja e 45 no frigorífico. As 135 amostras coletadas durante o abate (suabes de carcaças e linfonodos) foram assim divididas: 45 após a escalda/depiladeira, 45 após evisceração (linfonodos) e 45 após serragem da carcaça. Foi encontrada prevalência de 66, 6 % (30 / 45) para <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> nas amostras de fezes nos suínos na granja e 93, 3 % (42 / 45) no frigorífico. Houve diferença estatística significativa na positividade dos suínos avaliados na granja e no frigorífico (P= 0, 004). No frigorífico, das 135 amostras de suabes de carcaças e linfonodos analisadas foi obtido 43, 7 % (59 / 135) de positividade para <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> sendo: 57, 7 % (26 / 45) após escalda/depiladeira, 40, 0 % (18 / 45) após evisceração (linfonodos) e 33, 3 % (15 / 45) após serragem das carcaças. A positividade nas amostras coletadas em todas as etapas durante o abate foi significativamente reduzida do primeiro ao último ponto avaliado (P= 0, 01). Observou-se que as carcaças positivas em todos os pontos amostrados eram provenientes de animais positivos antes do abate. Procedimentos realizados antes do abate dos animais devem ser adotados visando reduzir a positividade das carcaças para <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> Neste estudo observou-se que os procedimentos realizados durante o abate suíno reduziram os índices de positividade, mas não são suficientes para garantir sua ausência nas carcaças. Os resultados obtidos permitem concluir que a alta positividade para <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> em suínos de terminação na granja conduz à propagação desse microrganismo nas carcaças durante as operações de abate. This {{study was}} done to evaluate the prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in swine productive chain, in finishing farm and slaughter. Swine faecal and carcass swabs were collected form three groups of pigs in three different segments: in finishing farm, slaughterhouse and the slaughter plant (in three points). Altogether were collected 45 samples of faecal swabs at finishing farm and 45 samples in slaughterhouse (cold storage). The 135 collected samples (carcass swabs and linfonodes) were divided in three groups during the slaughter: 45 samples after scalding/deharing; 45 samples after evisceration (linfonodes) and 45 after the splitting operation of carcass. The prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp</b> in swine faecal samples was 66. 6 % (30 / 45) at finishing farm and 93. 3 % (42 / 45) at slaughter. There was a significant statistical difference in the positivity occurrence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in evaluated swines at finishing farm and slaughterhouse (P= 0, 004). At slaughter, in the 135 analyzed samples of carcass swabs and linfonodes was obtained 43. 7 % (59 / 135) of positivity to <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> : 57. 7 % (26 / 45) after scalding/deharing, 40. 0 % (18 / 45) after evisceration (linfonodes) and 33. 3 % (15 / 45) after the splitting operation of carcass. The positivity occurrence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp</b> in collected samples in all stages during slaughter was significantly reduced from the beginning {{until the end of}} process analysis (P= 0. 01). It was observed that positive carcasses in all the samples were originated in positive animals before slaughter. Procedures to reduce the positivity occurrence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> must be used before animal slaughter. In this study was observed that procedures realyzed during swine slaughter can reduced the positivity rates of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> but it is insufficient to confirm the absence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in swine carcasses. The obtained results in this study permit conclude that the high positivity to <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in swines of finishing farm causes propagation of this microorganism in carcasses during the slaughter process...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the prevalence of}} thermotolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> compared that of to Salmonella spp. in raw yolk and on eggshells. A total of 2, 710 eggs were investigated for each bacterium.

40|$|A {{surveillance}} {{study was}} carried out to determine the prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in poultry meat in Iran. Over a 24 -month period (January 2006 – May 2008), a total of 800 poultry meat sam-ples from raw chicken (n= 280), quail (n= 248), turkey (n= 212) and ostrich (n= 60) meat were procured from the Esfahan city of Iran and analyzed. The highest prevalence (68. 4 %) of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> was recorded in quail meat, followed by chicken meat (56. 1 %), turkey meat (27. 4 %) and ostrich meat (11. 7 %). The overall prevalence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in studied samples was 47. 1 % (377 from 800), out of which 76. 4 % were identified as C. jejuni and 23. 6 % as C. coli. It was concluded that {{a high proportion of}} poultry meat marketed in Esfahan, Iran, was contaminated by <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and that consumption of undercooked or cooked contaminated poultry products presented a possible risk for consumers...|$|R
40|$|Thermophilic Campylobacter species {{represent}} {{the most common}} zoonotic microorganisms implicated in human food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. Very {{little is known about}} the presence of these pathogens in commercially reared rabbits for the production of meat for human consumption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of thermophilic <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in intensively reared meat rabbits in Northern Italy, where a high density of meat rabbit farms is concentrated. Two hundred and sixty rectal swabs were collected from clinically healthy breeding does housed in 13 farms (20 swabs per farm) and submitted to microbiological examination to detect the presence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> following the procedure suggested by the OIE (2008). Out of 260 rectal swabs, none was found positive for thermophilic <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> This finding indicates that meat rabbits could not be potential carriers of thermophilic <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and could probably not play a role in the transmission of campylobacteriosis to humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the prevalence and diversity of Arcobacter and <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in 298 stool samples of patients with diarrhoea, collected from 22 Portuguese hospitals, between September and November 2012. Detection of Arcobacter and <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> was performed using molecular-based detection techniques, such as real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR, species-specific PCR, and sequencing of amplified PCR products. Overall, 1. 3 % of the samples were positive for Arcobacter butzleri and 0. 3 % for Arcobacter cryaerophilus. <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> were found in 31. 9 % of diarrhoeic faeces. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter concisus were the most prevalent species (13. 7 % and 8. 0 %, respectively). The prevalence of Arcobacter and <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> was significantly different between children and adults (39. 7 % versus 22. 8 %, P = 0. 003). We underline the high prevalence of these pathogens in diarrhoeal samples among Portuguese patients, with particular relevance in the paediatric age group...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} thermotolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in commercially reared partridges (Perdix perdix) in southern Italy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cloacal swabs of partridges (n = 240), equally distributed {{between male and female}} birds, from a game bird farm located in the Southern Italy were examined for the prevalence of thermotolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> The samples were processed in order to detect thermotolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> by culture methods. The positive samples were then confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Thermotolerant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> were isolated from 118 (49. 2 %) of the 240 cloacal swabs examined. As proved by PCR, 100 % of the strains were identified as Campylobacter coli (118 / 118), and 15 (12. 7 %) out of the 118 positive samples were also positive for Campylobacter jejuni. In contrast, Campylobacter lari was not identified. Adult partridges showed a significantly higher prevalence (P < 0. 05) than younger ones. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the assumption that game birds may be considered as potential carriers of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> for human being and other animal species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although an earlier 1986 publication described the prevalence of Campylobacter coli in commercially reared partridges, this is the first report to confirm the species of Campylobacter using a PCR test...|$|R
40|$|<b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> {{have become}} the most {{important}} bacte-ria causing diarrhea in humans in many countries of the world (4). The most important species is Campylobacter jejuni, ac-counting for over 90 % of the infections (4), with Campy-lobacter coli accounting for most of the remaining infections (6, 7). Macrolides are the drugs of choice for treatment of human infected with <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> Only limited prevalence of macrolide resistance has been detected for C. jejuni (1), espe-cially that of human origin, while a higher prevalence has been found for C. coli (6, 7, 9, 10). <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> are consid-ered zoonotic pathogens (1), and resistance among isolates in the animal reservoir could have implications for the treatment of infections in humans (8). The genetic background for mac-rolide resistance in <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> has not previously been identified. Some have reported indications of horizontal trans-fer of macrolide resistance between <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> (3), while others {{have not been able to}} transfer macrolide resis-tance (11).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{importance}} of quantitatively detecting <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in environmental surface water. The prevalence and the quantity of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> thermotolerant coliforms, and Escherichia coli in 2, 471 samples collected weekly, over a 2 -year period, from 13 rivers and 12 streams in the Eastern Townships, Québec, Canada, were determined. Overall, 1, 071 (43 %), 1, 481 (60 %), and 1, 463 (59 %) samples were positive for <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.,</b> thermotolerant coliforms, and E. coli, respectively. There were weak correlations between the weekly distributions of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> and thermotolerant coliforms (Spearman's ρ coefficient = 0. 27; P = 0. 008) and between the quantitative levels of the two classes of organisms (Kendall tau-b correlation coefficient = 0. 233; P < 0. 0001). Well water samples from the Eastern Townships were also tested. Five (10 %) of 53 samples from private surface wells were positive for Campylobacter jejuni, of which only 2 were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. These findings suggest that microbial monitoring of raw water by using only fecal indicator organisms is not sufficient for assessing the occurrence or the load of thermophilic <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> Insights {{into the role of}} environmental water as sources for sporadic Campylobacter infection will require genus-specific monitoring techniques...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacteriosis is a {{worldwide}} distributed zoonosis. One {{of the main}} virulence factors related to <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in animals and humans is the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), encoded by three adjacent genes (cdtA, cdtB, cdtC). The occurrence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> in samples of vegeta-bles has not been reported in Brazil yet, and has seldom been described in the international literature. The detection of CDT in these strains has not been reported, either. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to determine the occurrence of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> strains carrying virulence factors in samples of poultry and vegetables (lettuce and spinach) from different points of sale, thus verifying if vegetables are as an important vehicle for potentially virulent <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> strains as poultry. Twenty four strains were identified as Campylobacter jejuni by phenotypic and genotypic methods: 22 from broiler carcasses and two from lettuce samples. Three strains were identified as Campylobacter coli: two from broiler carcasses and one from lettuce. The presence of the cdt genes were detected in 20 / 24 (83. 3 %) C. jejuni strains, and 3 / 3 (100 %) C. coli strains. The isolation of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>spp.</b> strains with the cdt gene cluster in lettuce samples points to a new possible source of contamination, which could have an impact in the vegetable production chain and risk to public health. Results show that potentially virulent C. jejuni and C. coli strains remain viable in sam-ples of broiler carcasses and vegetables at the points of sale.
