Methodology. In connection with the physical and moral depreciation of rolling stock in modern conditions the most important area to ensure the effectiveness of rail transport in the foreseeable future is the rational use of the rolling stock in operation within the designated and extended service life. At the same time extending the operational time of the locomotives must be achieved by compliance with the optimum ratio of measures to adjust the timing and technology maintenance, <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> and preparation of repair base. The paper presents the components of dependency forming work amount on maintenance, <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> with time operation. By the modeling of its changes a graph that implement adjusted system to the content of the rolling stock traction after operation were constructed. The study found that the dynamics of change processes of necessary expenses for maintenance and current repair increases. It is shown that under aging conditions of locomotive fleet and repair base of locomotive economy, a situation that is a critical for the railway transport of Ukraine has appeared. According to it, to the end of operation the amount of work relative to the recommended rules of repair increases slightly. When the locomotive is new or renovated, deviations from the standard path for rigid observance of repair requirements (the compliance with technical standards) does not exceed the norm. However, when the standard period is exhausted, to comply with these standards is not possible. From the data it was found that the greater the amount of maintenance, routine repair in the repair cycle, the more effort you need to put in a multiplicity of software runs between scheduled of maintenance, <b>current</b> <b>repairs.</b> It is advisable to conduct more repair work to ensure lower costs for the maintenance of locomotives.

40|$|Purpose. On {{the basis}} of the results {{analysis}} of the computer simulation and laboratory studies it is necessary to determine the changes impact dependence of the hydraulic level of groundwater on the tunnels processing stability in the underground due to the deformations development of the surrounding dredging massif. Methodology. The methodological basis of the research complex consists of the analysis, generalization of known scientific results and practical experience of forecasting and preconditioning of deformations of tunnel and surrounding soil mass processing, as well as computer simulation of the critical stress-strain state of the tunnel processing at changes in the hydraulic level of groundwater. Findings. In the process of technological construction and under the non-pressure groundwaters impact, when operating tunnels of subway lines of shallow foundation, the stability of all-section machining is ensured due to the uniform hydrostatic reduction of processing. At this the sediments are within the permissible values. The results of the research show that different levels of hydrostatic pressure can occur when the groundwater level changes {{from both sides of the}} tunnel. At the same time, there is a redistribution of stresses of the soil mass around the cross section of the tunnel, which, in turn, leads to the appearance of additional non-uniform deformations and the opening of cracks in the tunnels during operation. Originality. The authors of the work firstly established the effect of changes in hydrostatic pressure, which may arise due to fluctuations in the level of groundwater on the whole-section processing of tunnels of metro lines of shallow foundation due to secondary sedimentation. The conditions of occurrence of the secondary sediment have been determined and the nature of the deformation course has been established during the operation of the shallow subway. Practical value. At the stage of designing the metro lines of the shallow foundation, it is necessary to take into account the possibility of uneven precipitation from the action of hydrostatic pressure during operation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Even today, {{there is}} still great {{speculation}} as to the underlying pathogenesis of inguinal hernia. As a result, it could be extrapolated {{that the vast majority}} of repairs are based upon conjecture. Most <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> are founded upon the principle of "closing the defect" in the anatomy, either by suturing closed under tension, covering with a mesh or obliterating the defect with a plug. Many variants of each method are refined to achieve better clinical outcomes. Yet few, if any, strive to understand a fundamental question: "What has gone wrong with the normal physiological and anatomical mechanisms that prevent abdominal structures protruding through the abdominal wall?" We consider, in the normal subject, the muscular structures that converge and wrap around the inguinal canal as a highly dynamic structure, which forms a reactive barrier to the augmentation of intra-abdominal pressures. In effect, the structures work together like a "striated sphincter complex. " Through years of surgical experience, we have seen the formation of adhesions and fibrosis in these delicate and key structures, and hypothesised that they may impair its shuttering action, thus, creating a patency of this jammed inguinal ring leading to hernia. Based upon these observations, we have created a hernia repair variant that tries to "unblock" the muscles prior to repair, thus, hopefully restoring a degree of physiologic function. METHODS: A retrospective study describes the results of 47 patients operated for indirect inguinal hernia with a standardised procedure consisting of meticulous adhesiolysis of the hernia area and mechanical dilation (divulsion) of the inguinal orifice in order to break stiff fibres within the muscle, allowing viable muscle fibres to contract freely once more. After dilation, a proprietary lamellar-shaped implant was delivered into the canal. Its form and function are designed to eliminate impingement of the cord structures and give a gentle outwards force to induce a reactive contraction of the sphincter-like muscle complex during healing. This gentle contraction offers the possibility to eliminate fixation of the implant. RESULTS: The removal of scar tissue, dilation and the introduction of the implant into the internal inguinal ring induced a forceful "gripping" contraction by the sphincter complex in all patients. Even without fixation, it became almost impossible to pull the implant out of the canal. After obliterating the orifice with the lamellar implant, it was clear that there was no dilative compression upon the cord structures. CONCLUSION: The results of this combined procedure, scar removal, dilation and implant delivery, led to thoughtful suggestions regarding the anatomy and the physiology of the inguinal canal. The procedural adhesiolysis during indirect inguinal hernia repair has always shown the well described concentric muscular arrangement formed by the internal oblique and transversus muscles. This circular-shaped muscular structure is often recognised as a static barrier that, due to weakness and/or together with other causes, fails in its role and allows indirect inguinal hernia protrusion. According to the results of our observations, we consider this concentric muscular complex as a dynamic formation: we will use the term "striated sphincter complex. " Its steady tightening motion after divulsion and the insertion of a lamellar implant is always accompanied by a strong gripping action, which is not seen prior to divulsion. This indicates that it could correspond to a sphincter: the "inguinal sphincter. " The impairment of this sphincter could be the cause of the inguinal canal's patency and the development of hernia...|$|E

The structural members were unpropped during repair and throughout the 60 week monitoring period. The strains in the repair patches were monitored with vibrating-wire gauges. Four different repair materials were investigated whose elastic modulus was greater than that of the substrate concrete (E-rm > E-sub). The results show that efficient repairs are achieved with E-rm> E-sub, the optimum relationship being E-rm > 1. 3 E(sub). This enables the repair material to shed a significant proportion of its shrinkage strain to the substrate, thereby reducing restrained-shrinkage tension. It also enables the repair to attract externally applied load from the substrate in the long term. The effect of creep and shrinkage on the performance of the repair patch is also determined. Overall, the results show that <b>current</b> <b>repair</b> standards have limitations with respect to repair material specifications...|$|R
