Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E

5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the signs {{were placed in}} tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas.

5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crew and made many revisions as a result.

Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative.
