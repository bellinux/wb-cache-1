5000|$|Critical {{reception}} of <b>Cardle's</b> {{version of the}} song was mostly positive although many reviewers noted they preferred the original version. Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised <b>Cardle's</b> vocals, stating he delivered [...] "the violence-tinged lyrics with an appealing sense of intimacy, navigating the inevitable key change with ease and really smashing it on the final note". Rachael Patan of Femalefirst.com and The Beat Review applauded the song choice with the latter stating [...] "his untimely cover of Biffy Clyro’s ‘Many of Horror’ is a very clever and risque {{thing to do and}} we applaud him for that".

2500|$|Throughout {{the fifth}} series, several {{people in the}} {{entertainment}} industry, including Ronan Keating, Noel Gallagher and Graham Norton questioned Minogue's judging credentials and mentoring ability. On 22 November 2008, during a live broadcast of the programme, Minogue broke down in tears {{and was unable to}} introduce one of her acts, Rachel Hylton, following an on-air row with Louis Walsh over a choice of song. Despite the controversies, she proved popular in public votes and polls. Minogue later stated that she did not enjoy her experience on the fifth series and [...] "would never want to go through that again". Minogue returned for the sixth series in 2009. She chose Rachel Adedeji, Lucie Jones and Stacey Solomon as her final three acts to compete in the live shows and was assisted at the judges' houses stage by her older sister, Kylie Minogue. Despite losing Adedeji in week 4 and Jones the following week, Solomon went on to advance into the final and ultimately finish in third place. In 2010, Minogue was pregnant.

Minogue was assisted by fellow Australian and friend Natalie Imbruglia who was a guest judge in Birmingham that year filling in for Minogue. <b>Cardle</b> was her only act to make it into the final and eventually won, with Minogue becoming the winning mentor for the second time.|$|E
