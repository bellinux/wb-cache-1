Understanding the release characteristic of Na during the combustion is essential to viable utilization <b>of</b> this <b>coal.</b> In this work, coal samples were treated with a sequence of solvents: water (H 2 O), ammonium acetate (NH 4 Ac), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the release characteristics <b>of</b> various <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> Na during <b>coal</b> combustion were investigated using the technique of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. The relative contribution <b>of</b> various Na <b>classes</b> to the Na release during each combustion stage was found to be similar, in the order of H 2 O-soluble Na > NH 4 Ac-soluble Na > HCl-soluble Na > insoluble Na. Sodium released during the devolatilization stage can be attributed to each <b>of</b> the sodium <b>classes.</b> After the devolatilization stage, H 2 O-soluble Na and NH 4 Ac-soluble Na dominated the Na release during both char and ash stages. Over 64 % of the total Na released during combustion comes from the H 2 O-soluble Na, which suggests that the Na release during the combustion <b>of</b> Zhun-Dong <b>coal</b> can be reduced effectively after treatment by H 2 O washing...|$|R
