40|$|The {{properties}} of false-twist textured yarns in {{the aspects of}} crimp characteristic and tensile behavior depend mainly on the draw ratio and the D/Y ratio. This study comprises investigations {{of the effect of}} D/Y ratio and draw ratio on the crimp and tensile properties and percent crystallinity. While there was no noticeable change on the percent crystallinity by altering these parameters, tenacity increased and crimp contraction decreased with increasing draw ratio, and <b>crimp</b> <b>stability</b> decreased when the D/Y ratio increased. K/S value also decreased with increasing draw ratio...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of false-twist {{texturing}} parameters (texturing speed, heater temperature, draw ratio and disc-to-yarn speed ratio (D/Y ratio)) on the structure and crimp properties of polyester yarn has been studied using a high temperature heater and high texturing speeds. Textured yarn was analyzed and characterized {{in terms of the}} degree of crystallinity, degree of orientation and crimp properties (crimp contraction, crimp module and <b>crimp</b> <b>stability).</b> The most important parameters, significantly affecting yarn temperature and its uniformity and thus textured yarn structure and crimp properties, are texturing speed and heater temperature. Depending on these texturing parameters, the degree of crystallinity and orientation varied in the range of 24. 48 to 36. 66 % and 0. 371 to 0. 595, respectively. The crimp characteristics increase with the increase in heater temperature, and decrease with the increase in texturing speed. The effect of draw ratio and D/Y ratio on the textured yarn structure and properties is less pronounced. Obtained results show that partially oriented polyester yarn used in this study can be textured at significantly higher texturing speed (up to 1100 m/min) than the standard texturing speed (up to 700 m/min) used for the yarn count examined.

40|$|Abstract. PET/PTT {{conjugate}} yarn has a three-dimension spiral and permanent crimp, which endow the yarn and loomage with excellent performances of crimp extension and crimp recovery. The residual deformation and internal {{stress of the}} self-crimp yarn can be eliminated after the moist heat treatment, {{in order to develop}} the favorable crimp extension and crimp recovery of the self-crimp yarn, and to give the loomage soft handle and good dimension <b>stability.</b> <b>Crimp</b> shrinkage, crimp module, etc, of the different types of PET/PTT yarn, were tested, and the axial morphology of the yarn was observed, to investigate the effect of linear density, moist heat temperature on PET/PTT yarn...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for making superconducting joints between wires made of dissimilar superconducting metals has been devised. The technique is especially suitable for fabrication of superconducting circuits {{needed to support}} persistent electric currents in electromagnets in diverse cryogenic applications. Examples of such electromagnets include those in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Sometimes, it is desirable to fabricate different parts of a persistent-current-supporting superconducting loop from different metals. For example, a sensory coil in a SQUID might be made of Pb, a Pb/Sn alloy, or a Cu wire plated with Pb/Sn, while the connections to the sensory coil might be made via Nb or Nb/Ti wires. Conventional wire-bonding techniques, including resistance spot welding and pressed contact, are not workable because of large differences between the hardnesses and melting temperatures of the different metals. The present technique {{is not subject to}} this limitation. The present technique involves the use (1) of a cheap, miniature, easy-to-operate, capacitor-discharging welding apparatus that has an Nb or Nb/Ti tip and operates with a continuous local flow of gaseous helium and (2) preparation of a joint in a special spark-discharge welding geometry. In a typical application, a piece of Nb foil about 25 m thick is rolled to form a tube, into which is inserted a wire that one seeks to weld to the tube (see figure). The tube can be slightly <b>crimped</b> for mechanical <b>stability.</b> Then a spark weld is made by use of the aforementioned apparatus with energy and time settings chosen to melt a small section of the niobium foil. The energy setting corresponds to the setting of a voltage to which the capacitor is charged. In an experiment, the technique was used to weld an Nb foil to a copper wire coated with a Pb/Sn soft solder, which is superconducting. The joint was evaluated as part of a persistent-current circuit having an inductance of 1 mH. A current was induced in a loop, and no attenuation of the current after a time interval 1, 000 s was discernible in a measurement having a fractional accuracy of 10 (exp - 4) : This observation supports the conclusion that the weld had an electrical resistance < 10 (exp - 10) omega...|$|R
