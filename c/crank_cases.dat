50|$|The Serpollet Tricycle {{was one of}} {{the first}} industrially {{manufactured}} motor vehicles; it was designed by Léon Serpollet, and first presented in 1886. The tricycle possessed an oil-fired boiler and a single-cylinder engine with poppet valves and <b>crank</b> <b>cases.</b> The steam tricycle of 1899 produced about 5 HP with its 4 cylinders. It achieved a maximum speed of about 25 km/h (16 mph).|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha WR200 {{shown above}} {{has the same}} crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> {{are similar to the}} DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and {{slightly}} revised induction port shapes in the <b>crank</b> <b>cases.</b> The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports ether side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct cable clutch drive pinion in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center. The WR200 also uses a larger Mikuni TM30SS Carburetor. The WR200 Frame, Tank, seat, plastics, forks, swingarm, airbox, rear shock and electrics differ from the DT200R.|$|E
50|$|The heavily finned, {{air-cooled}} Blaster engine has roots from a water-cooled machine, {{as evidenced}} by the plugged water pump casting {{on the right side of}} the engine. The history of the engine in its water-cooled form can be traced directly back to the RD/RZ125 lc (shares an identical bottom end and <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> but uses a different stroke crank) and the Australian market WR200. It is possible to use parts from either of these bikes and build an all-Yamaha water-cooled Blaster engine, or one can simply swap the engines since the engine mounts are nearly identical.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> {{ventilation}} of [...] modern road-use {{diesel engines}} is diverted into the intake manifold, because ventilating the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains. If the engine's piston rings malfunction, this will cause excessive {{pressure in the}} <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold. Since most engines use oil which can be burnt {{in the same fashion}} as diesel, this will result in diesel engine runaway. To prevent that, more premium <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist.|$|R
50|$|During normal {{operation}} of a car engine, some vapors from the cylinder pass by the piston rings and down into the <b>crank</b> <b>case.</b> Without ventilation this can pressurize the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> and cause issues such as lack of piston ring sealing and damaged oil seals.|$|R
40|$|<b>Crank</b> <b>case</b> as the {{foundation}} for almost all engine parts are mounted her machine. Such as transmission gear shaft, crank shaft, shaft coupling, bushing and various other components. All of components are related to each other, if components are not installed with precision, the machine rejected. Manufacturing of the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> begins with the die casting process, face milling, drilling, boring, reaming, spot facing and tapping. The most important process is the face milling. Face milling is done {{on both sides of the}} <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> R & L, which will both be united. Therefore, it takes surface roughness 12. 5 μm, flat and level, because if there are scratches on the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> surface after combined oil seepage will occur. It is already a reject. It required an analysis of the failure of face milling process by considering several things, namely machining parameters are used, the condition of the cutting tool,the installation of the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> on the jig and the coolant used. Analyzing the four factors above, it is hoped will be able to optimize the face milling process as well as reduced product reject. ...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{different}} coefficients of thermal expansion of aluminium and silicon, high residual stresses of second order occur in Al-Si alloys depending on the cooling rate during the molding process. In products as for example <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> made of Al-Si alloys these residual stresses may cause microcracks. In the work at hand measurements of the eigenstresses in the single phases (i. e. residual stresses of second kind) performed via neutron diffractometry are compared to numerical simulations for a specific cooling rate. To this end a three-phase model is presented, which considers the α aluminium, the eutectic aluminium, and the silicon particles. The presented model is able to predict the residual stresses in the single phases within an elastoplastic framework. The simulation of tensile loadings of these structures are compared to experiments. The numerical computations are carried on stochastic geometry models by using a fast solver [1] for the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation, {{which is based on}} the fast Fourier transformation.

40|$|Cylinder bore {{finishing}} {{requirements are}} defined by quality features such as roundness and cylindricity {{as well as by}} the manifestation of the surface profile. Honing is a proven manufacturing method s to achieve this. Undesirable distortions of the cylinder shape occur under operating conditions in a reciprocating internal combustion engine. These negatively affect the tribological system of piston, piston ring, and cylinder bore. As a result, efficiency deteriorates and oil consumption rises. The cylinder <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> are finished in a defined tensioned state to compensate for distortions. This results in a highly complex manufacturing process and is only suited for compensating static distortions. Further increasing machining requirements resulting from strategies such as lightweight construction, downsizing, and friction reduction are pushing conventional honing methods to their technological limits. Adaptronic form honing constitutes a production engineering approach to manufacturing a free form in the cylinder bore. The objective is to keep inverse distortion geometries in store as macro shapes. These will then represent ideal cylinder shapes under the influence of distortion mechanisms in a defined engine operating range. Tool and process development and the analysis of machining results with respect to productivity, shape accuracy, and surface topography are presented and viewed as potential options for optimizing the tribological system of piston, piston ring, and cylinder bore. Other options such as shortening the process chain will be derived...|$|E
