40|$|The European Union beef market {{regulation}} is largely {{influenced by the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). With the 1992 CAP reform, there was a partial shift by the EU from product price support to a more direct form of income support by way of <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> For beef there was a move to <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> on intermediate products which was essentially a <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> for the possession of various categories of animals and these were linked to a land resource base. The Agenda 2000 reform consists in a further price decrease associated with an increase <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> The objective {{of this paper is}} to assess how the behaviour of beef producers is sensitive to changes in production prices and to changes in premiums. The analysis relies on an analytical framework which allows to take into account the dynamic feature of beef production and the subsidies provided by the Common Agricultural Policy. We studys how the beef supply response is modified when various exogenous variables like prices or premiums are changed.

One path toward better integration would be to modify the ACRE (Average Crop Revenue Election) program so that it covers county revenue rather than state revenue. For approximately the same cost as the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> program, 100 % of planted acres could be covered at a 95 % coverage level.

40|$|We analyse the {{development}} of income inequality in Swiss agriculture for the period 1990 - 2009. To this end, Gini coefficients are estimated using FADN data.

Our analysis is separated for the three production regions in Swiss agriculture: valley, hill and mountain regions. This study is motivated {{by the fact that}} Swiss agricultural policy reforms resulted in dramatic changes of the importance of different income sources in the here considered period. Our results show that household income inequality increased only slightly between 1990 and 2009. Furthermore, agricultural policy reforms affected the income inequality differently in the considered production regions. More specifically, the introduction of area-based <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> 1992 mainly affected the valley region.

40|$|The {{progressive}} attempt {{and implementation}} of <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> limitations since the 1992 CAP reform has developed a “modulation mechanism” aiming to transfer funds from market support and <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> schemes (CAP first pillar) towards rural development measures (CAP second pillar). Under the 2007 - 2013 European financial perspectives, the annual 5 % rate of modulation is expected to increase. The paper focuses on the financial impacts of four scenarios together with corresponding political and institutional feasibilities. The paper imposes on itself three sound constraints: (i) expanding modulation should not jeopardise the future in-depth reform of the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> regime, (ii) modulation should be compulsory and consistent with rural development financial needs, and (iii) present <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> per farm should not be capped or subject to complex and differentiated reduction rates. Then, the paper suggests adopting a dynamic and uniform modulation rate to be increased by 1 percent per year from 2009 and then by 2 percent during the final step reaching 10 percent in 2012 (2013 financial year). It would deliver certainty to farmers and contribute to an efficient use in European spending, with {{no need for a}} controversial equity instrument. <b>Direct</b> <b>payment</b> reductions raise subsidiarity and budgetary issues which should be discussed within the European budget review. Considering the modulation mechanism as a related past-policy tool, renewed European decision making process and actors should outline from 2009 a new paradigm <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> regime.
