5|$|Since the {{publication}} of From Bakunin to Lacan in 2001, {{there have been several}} attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that, while retaining many of Newman's specific <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anarchistic qualities of radical post-structuralist thought, would take postanarchist theory beyond academic discourse and into broader and more diverse environments, as the originator of postanarchism, Hakim Bey, had intended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1817 Captain George Woodbine, one of Nicolls's former {{subordinate}} officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar, Gregor MacGregor. Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, Woodbine, and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries. The threat, real or imaginary, was an anathema to North American popular <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
40|$|John McDowell espouses {{a certain}} <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{thinking}} subject: as a living, embodied, finite being, with {{a capacity for}} experience that can take in the world, and stand in relations of warrant to subjects’ beliefs. McDowell presents this <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject as requiring a related <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world: as not located outside the conceptual sphere. In this latter conception, idealism and common-sense realism are supposed to coincide. But I suggest that McDowell’s <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject scuppers this intended coincidence. The upshot is a dilemma: McDowell can retain his <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject, but lose the coincidence; or he can keep the coincidence, but abandon his <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject...|$|R

5|$|A Community of Witches {{is based}} on {{interviews}} with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of late modernity, as opposed to postmodernity, and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists Anthony Giddens and James A. Beckford. Themes covered include Pagan <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children in the movement and the increasing routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E

In order to do so, it will be at first given a brief description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normative theory articulated by Forst in his first book. After that, it will be exposed his <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> toleration as respect, and his <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person. Finally, some conceptual interactions between Forst’s general theory and his <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person will be identified, out of which some implications from his more general theory for such conception will emerge. After a brief summary  of those implications, I conclude with a brief critique to such <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person and, nevertheless, argue for <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> his approach for contemporary problems...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{paper is}} to analyse <b>the</b> {{theoretical}} foundations <b>of</b> human development policies as found in Sen’s and Nussbaum’s capability approach to development, and to examine to what extent undertaking policies according to the capability approach respects people’s freedom to pursue their own <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good. The paper argues that policies undertaken according to the capability approach have to be guided by a perfectionist <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good, that is, they cannot avoid promoting one certain <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human good. Such a perfectionist <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human good, and the policies ensuing from it, have often been qualified as paternalist, depriving <b>the</b> human being <b>of</b> choosing her own <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good. The paper examines to what extent those fears of paternalism that seem to underlie policies guided by a perfectionist account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good are legitimate, {{and to what extent}} the capability approach can escape those charges of paternalism and respect each person’s freedom to pursue the human good as she conceives it...|$|R
