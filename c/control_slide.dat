40|$|Over 80 % of wood {{extraction}} operations {{have been performed}} by conventional methods in Turkey. Conventional methods include skidding or sliding of logs mainly by man and animal power, which poses problems in terms of technical, economical, environmental, and ergonomic aspects. Skidding wood on plastic chutes has been implemented in limited numbers of logging applications in recent years, and provides important advantages such as reducing environmental damages and minimizing the value and volume loss of transported wood products. In this study, a chute system integrated with a mobile winch was developed for <b>controlled</b> <b>sliding</b> of large diameter logs downhill. In addition, synthetic ropes rather than steel cables were used to pull log products, resulting in a lower weight and more efficient extraction system. The system was tested on a sample wood production operation in Çınarpınar Forest Enterprise Chief of Kahramanmaraş Forest Enterprise Directorate. In the study, productivity analysis of chute system was performed and its ecological impacts were evaluated. During <b>controlled</b> <b>sliding</b> of logs downhill, the highest productivity (10. 01 m 3 /hour) was reached in the fourth chute system characterized as 36 m in length and 70 % ground slope. One of the main factors that affected the productivity of chute system was the <b>controlled</b> <b>sliding</b> time of the logs.

A 70 -year-old man, suffering from chronic atrophic gastritis, underwent to a gastric biopsy and received a diagnosis of gastric cancer. In the absence of any clinical evidence of gastric cancer, a specimen mix-up was suspected. LCM was used to retrieve gastric cells from the histologic slide, classified as gastric carcinoma, and suspected to be mislabelled. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells, and a total of 16 different genetic loci were analyzed, using an identity test.

40|$|A new serologic {{test for}} {{antibodies}} to Toxoplasma is described, {{which is based}} upon inhibition of specific staining with fluorescent antibody. In performing the test, a mixture of the test serum and known fluorescein-labelled antiserum is added to a dried smear of toxoplasms for 1 hour at 37 °C.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{confirm or}} deny the {{reported}} sensitivity of the AutoPap(r) Primary Screening System (AutoPap) (TriPath Imaging Inc., Burlington, North Carolina, U. S. A.) in a moderate-sized laboratory and to determine performance characteristics for the "clinically high risk" (CHR) patient population. STUDY DESIGN: Archives were searched for low and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, HSIL), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and cancer (Ca) with follow-up biopsies demonstrating a lesion of at least the reported Pap smear's severity. Smears fulfilling these criteria and a matched normal, <b>control</b> <b>slide</b> from the same day of preparation were subjected to evaluation on the AutoPap. Two hundred eighty-three smears from 254 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study, including 80 LSIL, 178 HSIL, 5 AIS and 20 Ca. Specific criteria established CHR status. Fisher's exact test was applied to determine AutoPap performance differences for non-CHR and CHR populations. RESULTS: AutoPap successfully classified as "Review" all cases as follows: 91. 2 % LSIL (73 / 80), 96. 6 % HSIL (172 / 178), 100 % AIS (5 / 5), and 100 % Ca (20 / 20). Fisher's exact P values, pLSIL= 3 D 1. 00 and pHSIL+= 3 D. 411, confirmed statistically equivalent performance. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the sensitivity data reported in the Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling of the AutoPap and indicated no statistically significant differences in performance characteristics in a CHR population when compared to patients without CHR status for all grades of abnormality examined...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} the degree of CD 10 expression in the stromal cells of phyllodes tumour and tumour grading. Methods: A total of 61 cases of mammary phyllodes tumours over the past 11 years were searched from histopathology files, University Malaya Medical Centre. The paraffin blocks were retrieved and 4 &# 956;m thick slides were prepared and stained using an antibody against CD 10 with the envision method. Fibroadenoma case was used as a <b>control</b> <b>slide</b> and breast myoepithelium as the internal control. Each stained slides was independantly and semiquantitatively analysed for the intensity and percentage of the stromal cells stained. The staining intensity was graded as negative (no staining), mild, moderate and strong if the staining was much weaker, slightly weaker and same intensity as that of the myoepithelium, respectively. The tumour was considered positive for CD 10 if the staining intensity is moderate to strong in 20 % or more of the stromal cells. Results: 21 (44. 7 %) of 47 benign phyllodes tumour, 5 (83. 3 %) of 6 borderline phyllodes tumour and all 8 cases (100 %) of malignant phyllodes tumour showed positive expression for CD 10 immunostain. Conclusions: There was a significant increase in CD 10 expression in the stromal cells as the lesions progressed from benign to borderline and malignant phyllodes tumour.

40|$|Fur mites are a {{persistent}} problem in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. We conducted several studies to evaluate fur mite diagnostic methodologies {{and interpretation of}} results. Retrospective analysis of test results from sentinel mice exposed to soiled bedding collected from colonies infested with Myobia musculi and Myocoptes musculinus revealed the skin scrape test to be more reliable than pelt examination, provided that both the head and dorsal thoracolumbar regions were sampled. To assess their diagnostic accuracy, 3 commercial laboratories were sent positive control slides containing mites, mite parts, or eggs in sets of slides containing diagnostic skin scrapings in varying ratios. Laboratory B correctly identified the positive <b>control</b> <b>slide.</b> Laboratory A identified 1 of 3 positive control slides, whereas laboratory C failed to identify both positive control slides submitted.

Limited dyed hair was still present at 8 mo; therefore, finding eggs or egg casings many months after treatment cessation does not necessarily imply treatment failure.

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} screen for Chlamydia trachomatis {{infection}} by direct fluorescein antibody (DFA) method in a high-risk population, registered female sex workers (FSWs) in Ankara, Turkey, to investigate {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using this method in a routine screening program of the FSW population. Materials and Methods: All registered FSWs (n = 152) in Ankara were enrolled in the study. None of them were showing any genital signs or symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Endocervical swabs were collected and examined for C. trachomatis by DFA method (Fluorotect Chlamydia, Omega Diagnostics, UK). Cellular adequacy of the specimens was examined for the presence of at least five columnar epithelial cells per X 400 field. A positive diagnosis was made when fixed and stained specimens showed at least 10 chlamydial bodies under the fluorescein microscope. A positive <b>control</b> <b>slide</b> was also stained and examined on each study day. Results: Of the 152 specimens, only 112 (73. 7 %) were adequate; it was not possible to obtain adequate specimen from the remainder of the women because the cervical os was too tight to insert the swab. Of the 112 adequate specimens, 3. 6 % (4 / 112) were positive for C. trachomatis serotype-specific major outer membrane proteins (MOMP), based on DFA method. Conclusions: C. trachomatis infection rate of 3. 6 % was relatively low in this group of women compared to a priori expectations, yet still remarkable. A significant level of “inadequacy ” in obtaining endocervical specimens (in 26. 3 % of FSWs) could have limited the external validity of the prevalence rate estimation in this population and the practicality of DFA use for C. trachomatis screening. C. trachomatis screening should be integrated in the STI control program for sex workers in Turkey. However, further research is warranted to optimize the method to be used in screening and/or diagnosis in such high-risk groups.
