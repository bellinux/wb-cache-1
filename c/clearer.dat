50|$|<b>Clear</b> Creek ISD {{was formed}} in 1948 when the districts of Kemah, League City, Seabrook, and Webster were consolidated, {{deriving}} its name from nearby <b>Clear</b> Creek, which forms <b>Clear</b> Lake, {{one of the few}} natural lakes in Texas. CCISD continued operating Webster High School until <b>Clear</b> Creek High School opened in 1957. The district opened <b>Clear</b> Lake High School in 1972, <b>Clear</b> Brook High School in 1989, <b>Clear</b> Springs High School in 2007, and <b>Clear</b> Falls High School in 2010.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, then-zoo {{director}} Jeff Williamson merged some {{departments of}} the zoo {{in a business}} move that was intended to provide a <b>clearer</b> direction for zoo operations. Many of the zoo's approximately 350 volunteers interpreted the merger as an elimination of volunteer training efforts. As a result, {{more than half of}} them left the zoo by 1999.|$|E
5|$|In January 1972, the State Committee for Cinematography {{requested}} editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These {{included a}} more realistic film with a <b>clearer</b> image {{of the future and}} deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are <b>clearer</b> and more delicate.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{modified}} aerosol generator, white mice and calves {{were exposed to}} aerosols of viable Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella haemolytica and the clearance of the inhaled organisms by the lungs of the experimental animals was measured. Fifty-seven percent of inhaled S. aureus were <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the mouse lungs, 79 % were <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 93 % were <b>cleared</b> in eight hours. Fifty-six percent of inhaled P. haemolytica were <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the mouse lungs, 76 % were <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 93 % were <b>cleared</b> in eight hours. Seventy percent of inhaled S. aureus were <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the calf lungs, 90 % were <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 95 % were <b>cleared</b> in eight hours. Seventy-five percent of inhaled P. haemolytica were <b>cleared</b> in two hours by the calf lungs, 90 % were <b>cleared</b> in four hours and 92 % were <b>cleared</b> in eight hours...|$|R

5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became <b>clearer.</b> Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{relationships}} between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur {{relationships in the}} past have included limited data and were highly contradictory.

Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became <b>clearer.</b> The {{group was}} defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than Allosaurus or Sinraptor by Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus in the carcharodontosaurid {{subfamily}} Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and Stephen L. Brusatte united Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, and Tyrannotitan in the tribe Giganotosaurini. Giganotosaurus {{is one of the}} most complete and informative members of Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{returned}} to the custom in his 1804 work Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times. Here he provided a <b>clearer</b> discussion than before, making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured the local area from Christmas until after Twelfth Day, {{and that they were}} given food or money to leave the householders alone.|$|E
40|$|Intrahepatic <b>clear</b> cell {{bile duct}} adenoma is {{extremely}} rare, with only 3 previous cases {{reported in the}} literature. The cause of cytoplasmic <b>clearing</b> in <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma has not been previously investigated. Distinguishing <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma from other <b>clear</b> cell tumors, particularly <b>clear</b> cell cholangiocarcinoma, can be challenging. Previous studies have shown loss of CD 10 expression and focal CD 56 expression in cholangiocarcinoma. Expressions of CD 10 and CD 56 have not been previously studied in <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma. A 37 -year-old morbidly obese woman {{was diagnosed with a}} 2. 8 [*]cm intrahepatic <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma following segmental hepatic resection. Histochemical analysis of the tumor suggested the cause of cytoplasmic <b>clearing</b> in the neoplastic cells to be mucin and not glycogen or lipid. On immunohistochemical staining, the neoplastic cells demonstrated staining for CK 7, CA 19 - 9, polyclonal CEA, CD 10 (apical), CD 56 (focal), and vimentin. Ki- 67 highlighted less than 2 % of tumor cell nuclei. This is the first report to study the etiology of cell <b>clearing</b> in <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma. Expression of CD 10 in <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma may help distinguish <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma from <b>clear</b> cell cholangiocarcinoma...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between forest <b>clearing</b> or tree <b>clearing,</b> whereby the trees, including the stumps are <b>cleared,</b> and stump or root <b>clearing</b> where {{the trees are}} first felled and the stumps removed subsequently.|$|R
50|$|Computers {{have been}} {{performing}} the payment <b>clearing</b> that once required paper processing. The <b>Clearing</b> House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) began operation in 1970. The New York Automated <b>Clearing</b> House (NYACH) followed in 1975 {{and became the}} Electronics Payment Network in 2000. The <b>Clearing</b> House Electronic Check <b>Clearing</b> System (CHECCS) was added in 1992.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a {{recording}} contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood resulting in shorter, faster songs with <b>clearer</b> production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits, ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder. This becomes <b>clearer</b> when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, father to both Lorenzo the Elder and Cosimo de' Medici. Thus {{the kings of}} France from Louis XIII and on, are descended from the 'cadet' branch, confirming that Gian Gastone was not the last Medici.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to <b>clearer</b> skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
30|$|<b>Clear</b> cell {{carcinoma}} is generally thought to originate from ovary and kidney [1]. <b>Clear</b> {{cell carcinoma}} of the ovary is composed of glycogen-containing <b>clear</b> cells and hobnail cells [1, 2]. <b>Clear</b> cell {{carcinoma of the}} ovary also shares many similarities with renal <b>clear</b> cell carcinoma [3]. Primary renal cell carcinoma is sometimes implanted to the ovary or peritoneum [4]. Additionally, <b>clear</b> cell cholangiocarcinoma [5] and peritoneal <b>clear</b> cell carcinoma [6, 7] were also rarely reported. Although recent genomics research will reveal the difference of these carcinomas, differential diagnosis of the primary site is difficult.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clear</b> {{was born}} in Wegberg, Germany, to a Dutch mother, Maria Helena Peters, and Robert James <b>Clear,</b> a Senior Aircraftman (SAC) in the Royal Air Force; <b>Clear's</b> father was {{stationed}} in Germany {{at the time of}} Marc <b>Clear's</b> birth. After moving {{back and forth between the}} United Kingdom (UK) and Germany, the <b>Clear</b> family settled in the Netherlands, where <b>Clear's</b> father became a computer operator for a Dutch car firm. <b>Clear's</b> family moved once more during his youth and eventually settled in Sittard, in the Dutch province of Limburg.|$|R
50|$|In histology, a <b>clear</b> cell is a {{cell that}} shows a <b>clear</b> {{cytoplasm}} when stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Normally, <b>clear</b> cells are secretory cells in the epithelium, and {{are one of the}} components of eccrine sweat glands. A <b>clear</b> cell's plasma membrane is highly folded, more so on the apical and lateral surfaces. The cytoplasm of <b>clear</b> cells contains large amounts of glycogen and many mitochondria. Melanocytes appear as <b>clear</b> cells when in the stratum basale of the skin, and Langerhans' cells appear as <b>clear</b> cells in the stratum spinosum.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is <b>clearer</b> as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the UK National Consumer Council (NCC, now Consumer Focus) {{called on}} the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to {{investigate}} Apple's EULA, claiming Apple's EULA, and those of multiple other technology companies, misled consumers and infringed legal rights. The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others. The OFT determined the licensing agreements were unfair and Apple agreed to improve its terms and conditions to make them <b>clearer</b> and fairer to consumers.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with <b>clearer</b> figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although {{this might have been}} {{as a result of the}} story being set underground.|$|E
