40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1997 The {{research}} questions {{on which this}} study are based are to do with issues about whether students at different ages can successfully study and learn {{together in the same}} class. The particular ages under examination in this study are those corresponding to Year 9 and 10 students. These students were studied to determine if they belonged to separate groups. The adolescent and social psychology literature explored suggested that the two year levels contained individuals of widely differing developmental levels and thus the research was designed to see how the vertical grouping (composite) of Year 9 and I 0 classes effected the learning of the students. Via a Case Study design {{it was found that the}} internal interactions between individuals within single year level classes were different to those found in the <b>composite</b> <b>class.</b> (n the Year 9 class studied the students tended to only work with a select group of their friends whereas in the Year 10 class the students seemed to form an united and congenial group. The <b>composite</b> <b>class</b> was found to be composed of two distinct sub groups, a Year 9 group and a Year 10 group, each reflecting the characteristic interactions of their particular year level. Group work was used as a method of facilitating the communication between the two year levels in the <b>composite</b> <b>class.</b> This methodology did produce some positive results with increased communication between the two sub-groups at the completion of the research. During the research it was noted that group work has to be carefully structured and monitored if it is to have positive results. Webb (1982 a) found that if students in groups ask questions and do not receive answers then this structure in fact can be detrimental, to their achievement. The effect of non-responsive communication within small group work could be further studied to ensure that this method of promoting cooperation in composite classes is effective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to try to get an {{understanding}} of the underlying causes and reasons that students starting in seventh grade junior high school seek out a particular group, and the extent to which they do so. The work is based on the questions: How do students perceive the meeting with their prospective bench-companion in a new <b>composite</b> <b>class?</b> What should a teacher consider when it comes to bench placement in a new <b>composite</b> <b>class?</b> Do the students change, and if so to what extent, friends when they start high school? What are the factors that affect/have affected the students' choice of friends? How large a role does the school play for pupils relationships? What thoughts and feelings do the students have regarding new encounters? I have conducted in-depth interviews with six adolescents in grade seven as the basis for the understanding of how students relate to group selection and group affiliation, and I have then compared this material with previous research on the subject. Furthermore I have availed myself of literature in social- and group psychology. The conclusion which has emerged is that the most important component of a group-process is the sense of solidarity and security, and the results show that students largely retain their old relationships rather than adding new, when they start high school. Hence the teacher plays an important role in ensuring that any imbalance in the group is offset and make sure that nobody is excluded, but also to help make room for new groups and be aware of the sensitive and responsive phase of life that the young people are in...|$|E

40|$|Object {{versions}} {{are a key}} feature of object-oriented database evolution. The applications targeted by OODBs (such as CAD or CASE applications) need to manipulate complex objects, i. e objects linked to other objects by dependence relations (composition, inheritance, association, etc.) and, consequently, complex object versions. This paper investigates the existing approaches in complex object version management through version propagation, i. e the automatic creation or destruction of groups of linked object versions. The main issues of version propagation are underlined: limitation of the scope, version referencing and ambiguous propagation cases management. The paper then presents the authors’ approach: a user-customizable multi-strategy version propagation model in which the propagation capabilities, called strategies, can be declaratively described by means of rules and associated with each relation, according to its semantics. A comprehensive example of <b>composite</b> <b>class</b> and instance version propagation illustrates {{the capabilities of the}} model...|$|E

This video was then shown to a group of students in a parallel class who were given the same prediction tasks. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated that {{no significant differences were found}} between groups in their predictions. Both groups gave a range of responses consistent with a variety of strategies, including clear examples of probabilistic reasoning. It was therefore concluded that the use of a video has the potential to be a useful tool into probability research.

40|$|Abstract. Model {{composition}} can {{be viewed}} in model-driven engineering as an operation where a set of activities should be performed to merge two input models into a single output model. The latter aggregates syntactical and semantic properties from the original models. However, given the growing heterogeneity of model composition strategies, it is particularly challenging for designers to objectively assess them given a particular problem at hand. The key {{problem is that there}} is a lack of canonical set of indicators to quantify harmful properties associated with the output models, such as composition conflicts and modularity anomalies. This paper presents an inquisitive study in order to capture an initial set of metrics for assessing and comparing model composition strategies in two case studies. We apply a number of metrics to quantify different conflict types and modularity properties arising at <b>composite</b> <b>class</b> models produced with override and merge-based strategies. We have observed that some of the quantitative indicators were effective to pinpoint when a model composition strategy is not properly chosen. In some cases, the output models exhibited non-obvious undesirable conflicts and anti-modularity factors...|$|E

The intervention was designed to promote the students ’ engagement in verbal interactions.

Students showed a gain in the mean amount of cognitive talk and higher cognitive talk after the intervention. There have been questions raised about the prevalence and effectiveness of teaching and learning in the New Zealand classroom by using small groups in a collaborative learning situation (Education Review Office (ERO), 2000). This concern has also been raised in response to New Zealand’s results in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study- Repeat (1998) that showed no significant improvements in mathematics achievement by New Zealand students during a period when a new mathematics curriculum advocating group work had been introduced as mandatory in 1993. The results also showed that countries which seldom used small groups achieved more highly than New Zealand students. The ERO report recommended a closer examination of small grou...|$|E

Based on these changes, the possibility of schools and individual teachers to form territorial identity of pupils and local residents comes to the fore.
