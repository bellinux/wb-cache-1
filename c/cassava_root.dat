A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.

40|$|The {{traditional}} retting of <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> {{occurs in}} ponds or in backwaters. The medium pH is slightly acidic (pH 5. 54) {{and the pressure}} of dissolved oxygen is very low (pO 2 1. 96). The fermentation of <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> lasts for three days in the rainy season (October to April) with an average temperature of 26 °C, but it is longer, 5 - 6 days, in the dry season (May to September) with an average temperature of 23 °C.

40|$|Fresh <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> {{deteriorate}} fast after harvesting. This {{puts them}} at a disadvantage {{when compared to other}} fresh foods that are not so perishable. This short shelf-life, lust two to three days, is the main reason why consumers have been turning away from fresh cassava. But this trend is being reversed in Colombia where farmers have found a simple method of extending its shelf-life. Several years ago scientists at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in Colombia, found that <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> did not deteriorate so quickly if they were kept in air tight bags. But this was counteracted by the rapid growth of fungi and bacteria which proliferated in the higher temperatures inside the bag. It was the roots with the fungicide thiabendazole, before they were put into bags, <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> can be kept fresh for two weeks or more. If this technique is to be effective, the <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> must be treated within a few hours of harvesting. Because this is too short a time in which to transport the cassava to a central processing site, the farmers themselves, or their cooperatives, have to undertake the treatment process. They are therefore better placed to deal directly with retailers. Cutting out the wholesaler means better prices to the farmers {{despite the fact that the}} treated cassava is selling at a lower price than untreated fresh cassava.

40|$|Abstract: Cassava {{is a major}} staple that {{supplies}} more than 50 % of daily energy to more than 200 million persons in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). <b>Cassava</b> <b>roots</b> {{are known to be}} low in micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc. Micronutrient deficiencies threaten the lives of millions of poor households and those located in remote rural areas of SSA often not targeted by fortification programmes. This paper presents results from an ex-ante evaluation of nutrition and health benefits of increased vitamin A status of <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> through biofortification for at-risk-target-groups using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach. Results showed that Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causes an annual loss of about 553, 000 years of “healthy ” life in Nigeria with children constituting more than forty percent. Biofortified cassava would reduce VAD by 4. 42 %, 11. 73 %, and 3. 14 % for children, pregnant women, and lactating women respectively in the pessimistic scenario. Results for the optimistic scenario are 28. 79 %, 76. 39, and 20. 45 % respectively. The biofortification of <b>cassava</b> <b>roots</b> would result in annual gains of about 33, 000 years of “healthy”life and avert 166 child deaths per year for the pessimistic scenario and about 220, 000 years life and 1272 child deaths per year for the optimistic scenario. In economic terms, such a programme would bring gains amounting to about $ 10 million per year, which Biofortification, DALYs, Economics, Health, corresponds to an internal rate of return (IRR) as high as 92. 4 % in the pessimistic scenario.
