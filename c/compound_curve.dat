500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E

[...] The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> and blended much more with the line of the hood.

2500|$|The 1961 Oldsmobile body design {{represented}} the after-effect of the 1958 recession. [...] While wheelbases {{remained the same}} as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly – a trend seen throughout all of GM's marques. [...] Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design. [...] At the bottom of the rear quarters, a [...] "skeg" [...] - a downward fin - jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. [...] For 1961, GM retired the <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield. [...] Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled [...] "A" [...] pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961–62, at the outboard base of the windshield.|$|E

50|$|Charles Eames and {{his wife}} Ray Kaiser Eames moved to Venice Beach, CA in 1941. Charles {{took a job as}} a set painter for MGM Studios to support them. Ray, {{formally}} trained as a painter and sculptor, continued experiments with molded plywood designs in the spare room of their apartment. In 1942 Charles left MGM to begin making molded plywood splints for the U.S. Air Force. The splints used <b>compound</b> <b>curves</b> to mimic the shape of the human leg. The experience of shaping plywood into <b>compound</b> <b>curves</b> contributed greatly to the development of the LCW.|$|R

50|$|The {{composite}} <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> fuselage {{was chosen}} {{to reduce the number}} of stiffeners and stringers needed. The design used an unusual seating position where one rear seat faced forward and one aft to maximize interior space. The fuselage was built with similar construction methods to Glasair aircraft. The aircraft was only produced in kit form with five main packages that included pre-cut ribs, pre-welded steel assemblies, and a spar prebonded to the upper wing surface.|$|E
50|$|Near to its {{northern}} terminus, the motorway splits into two branches. The construction of this three-way interchange required {{the removal of}} about 900,000 cubic metres of material, mostly rock. The motorway bends through more than 90 degrees, on a <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> partly of 520.8 m and partly of 694.5 m radius. One branch heads in a north-easterly direction, flowing into the A90 at its end, numbered junction 11. (This branch was formerly the M85 motorway, until the A85 was renumbered as A90.) The other branch forms part of the western bypass of Perth, and meets the A9 at its end, numbered junction 12. The gradient is 4.57% uphill and 5.65% downhill on this section. The slip roads forming this branch merge with shared priority to allow HGVs to maintain momentum on the steep upgrade.The Broxden to Muirmont slip road at {{the centre of the}} interchange has a radius of 136.4 m, necessitating maximum superelevation of 7%.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1959 (on sale by October), the new Suzulight TL was introduced, {{replacing}} the SF. Only available with a split folding rear seat {{and a large}} tailgate opening to the side, its layout was far ahead of its time. With rear seats folded, the TL could take [...] or 300 kg, fifty per cent more than the SL {{had been able to}} accommodate and with higher comfort for the occupants. Suzuki took full advantage of 12-inch wheels having become available and produced a modern glassy design with one wheel at every corner, very reminiscent of the Mini introduced two months earlier (see size comparison on right). The design, by Tadaaki Mizuki, was the result of trying to save space while using a minimum number of <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> pressings.

50|$|The station {{opened in}} 2014 and {{replaced}} a nearby depot and train platforms used by Amtrak and Metrolink. The steel-framed building’s entrance is a 120 ft. The structure has a <b>compound</b> <b>curved</b> shell that {{is covered with}} air-filled plastic pillows through which sunlight illuminates the interior. The arched roof is illuminated with multicolored lights visible from the surrounding area.|$|R
50|$|Expanded metal is {{also used}} by artists, {{especially}} sculptors, who use the material to form complex 3-dimensional surfaces and <b>compound</b> <b>curves</b> which can then be covered with plaster, clay, or other materials.

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{part of the}} huts {{is given}} an ancient appearance whereas the interior of each hut has rectangular space (for housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, administration offices and studio spaces), where all amenities feature modern technology. The space within each hut was achieved by discarding the central pillar, a deviation from the traditional Kanak hut design. In the circular design of the hut’s shells, the height to diameter ratio was reduced giving more space, which also resulted in greater dynamic ventilation, as was corroborated by wind tunnel tests. The cases have giant curved ribs or staves, which are made of iroko slats and steel connections and which also act as climate control devices. The outer ribs are a curved assembly of slats, which are joined to a straight vertical rib that together form part of the case structure. The staves are designed {{in such a way}} that the individual pieces appear as if they are woven together. The roof is made of corrugated aluminium sheets. It has a double roof system, which contributes to the play of shadows. The bottom of the wall, formed by the arc of the staves, has special louvers, called nacos. The nacos open and close in tandem automatically by computer control calibrated to the speed of the wind. The double roof system also allows air to pass through the roof unchecked. During the monsoon season, the winds that blow over the cases are very strong, the <b>compound</b> <b>curve</b> of the cases resists the wind, with the nacos facilitating this action further by allowing air to pass directly through the cases.|$|E
