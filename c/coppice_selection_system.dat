Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is pollarding. Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: simple coppice, coppice with standards, and the <b>coppice</b> <b>selection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the {{dynamics of}} Etna birch stands (Betula aetnensis Rafin) following the cessation of silvicultural activities in the Etna Regional Park (Sicily). We investigated forest structure, natural regeneration, vegetation and deadwood in different forest types. Our findings highlighted three different dynamics for birch populations: stable birch stands in the high mountain area which might represent an edapho-climax forest; progressive dynamic birch stands in the intermediate mountain area, showing a gradual depletion of birch and a concomitant replacement with monospecific stands (calabrian pine, beech, oaks) or mixed ones (with birch); pure birch stands (typical) that tend to be regressive - especially under stressful conditions - and to be replaced by xerophilous grasslands. Following the cessation of coppicing and with stand ageing, the stumps transformation into more homogeneous stand structures have been increasing. Within the context of protected areas the restoration of <b>coppice</b> <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> (with appropriate adaptations) could help to maintain the traditional forest landscape, acting as a silvicultural technique with low environmental and landscape impact...|$|E

First, 100 circular sample plots has been selected by use of random systematic inventory. Then into the each plots nine micro-plots defined. The results of one way analysis of variance, multiple ranges Tukey-HSD test and Chi square test of seedling showed that there is significant difference in the level of 0. 05 between mean of seedlings number, mean of carpinus seedlings number, percent of the health, shining, even and vertical seedlings in tree selection and group <b>selection</b> <b>systems.</b> So in the establishment of natural regeneration the quantity and quality of natural regeneration in tree <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> is more desirable than group <b>selection</b> <b>system.</b> In the bigger cutting sites the stand comes out of climax conditions and in the result it will reduce the establishment percent of original species regeneration.

For example, the frequently selected large-subunit F 345 I mutant of Synechococcus PCC 6301 Rubisco showed a 7 -fold improvement in the functional expression in E. coli but a 17 % decrease in its carboxylation catalytic efficiency (Mueller-Cajar and Whitney, 2008).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was firstly, to {{investigate}} if the current <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> mirrors the task of international deployment and voluntariness. Secondly, to investigate if and how non-cognitive assessments of personality and resilience, individual aspects that seem underrepresented in the current <b>selection</b> <b>system,</b> may increment validity to the current <b>selection</b> <b>system.</b> Since 2012 the Swedish Armed Forces is an All-volunteer Force where {{young men and women}} voluntarily can apply for a military service. In contrast to conscription, military service today includes compulsory international deployments with different demands on the personnel’s range of possible abilities and skills as well as selection process—yet the current <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> may not sufficiently correspond to the changes. The thesis comprises four studies (Study I-IV) with relevant military samples, and aside from Study I, a validation of a short version personality questionnaire (PQ) being used in two of the subsequent studies, Study II-IV had a longitudinal design. Study II shows that the former <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> lacked prognostic value of soldiers’ performance during international deployment, and their ability to readjust at homecoming. Additionally, Study II shows that non-cognitive assessments can be used as predictors for readjustment. Study III indicates that international deployment {{does not need to be}} harmful for the psychological well-being and that good health seems to be a stable factor across time and situations. Thus, selection of “good health” and resilience may prove fruitful. Study IV suggests that high motivation to serve may have serious consequences for selection decisions and, in the long run, the recruits’ psychological well-being. In sum, this thesis suggests that the current <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> needs adaption to the task of repeated international deployments and to the voluntary applicant pool, and that non-cognitive assessment may increment validity. Since the end of the Cold War the Swedish Armed Forces has undergone several changes regarding both task and personnel system. The task of national security does not only entail territorial defense but also international operations worldwide. In addition, the soldiers are no longer conscripts but young men and women who have volunteered to secure and uphold peace and democratic values. The {{purpose of this}} thesis was twofold: firstly, to investigate if the current <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> mirrors the recent refocus on international operations and voluntariness; secondly, to see if and how non-cognitive assessments of personality, health, and resilience increment validity to the current <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> in identifying individuals suitable for repeated international deployments. This work was guided by a series of tentative questions regarding both the <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> in particular, but also international deployments in general.

In <b>selection</b> <b>systems,</b> many different parameters {{can be changed}} in attempt to make the process more effective and efficient, {{and it is not}} feasible to use empirical evaluation to compare all feasible systems. There have been some studies that have examined the effects of a set of parameters by fixing the rest of them, using a mathematical approach (Finney, 1961, 1966; Young 1974, 1976). Martin and McBlair (1991) have doubted the practical applicability of their results, arguing that a complex system has to be observed as a whole rather than analysing its parts separately. Martin and McBlair (1991) have proposed that a simulation of the system is needed to permit a comprehensive examination of multistage <b>selection</b> <b>systems.</b> Moretti and Faveri (1983) used a computer simulation to generate sugar cane clones and concluded that even a simple model, such as the one they used, is able to reproduce similar results to those observed in real popUlations. However, the model was not further employed to simulate a <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> as a whole but rather to analyse a portion of parameters that affect results from selection. Therefore, despite the potential usefulness of simulation of <b>selection</b> <b>systems,</b> there is little evidence of comprehensive investigation, and no evidence of an attempt to optimise such systems using mathematical techniques of optimisation.

The quantitative portion of this study examined the relationship between the use of a particular student <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> and stakeholder perceptions of a school’s educational environment, while the qualitative portion examined the stakeholder perceptions of student <b>selection</b> <b>systems.</b> 	In order to accomplish these goals student scores on AP examinations from the 2010 - 2011, 2011 - 2012, and 2012 - 2013 academic school years were collected from high schools across the state of Georgia. Based on the analysis of course-level AP examination data, it was determined that there was strong evidence of a statistically significant positive relationship between student academic achievement and the use of a closed enrollment student <b>selection</b> <b>system.</b> 	The qualitative portion of the study involved interviews with students, teachers, and AP coordinators. The interviews were examined for information concerning stakeholder perceptions related to the effectiveness of student <b>selection</b> <b>systems</b> and their relationship to a school’s educational environment. After reviewing the qualitative data, it became apparent that the use of a closed student <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> could not explain the totality of a <b>selection</b> <b>system’s</b> possible impact. Four important factors emerged: the need to consider the choice of a student <b>selection</b> <b>system</b> in concert with the basic organizational vision school stakeholders have for the school and its AP program, a need to involve all organizational stakeholders in the course selection process, the establishment of strong, positive relationships between students and teachers, and a need to make certain that students receive academically rigorous preparation before entering the AP program. 	This led to the creation of four recommendations for action aimed at informing school leaders about possible practices that might help increase student academic achievement in AP courses. The four recommendations were to involve all stakeholders in the course-selection process, to establish strong, positive relationships between students and teachers, to insure that students receive academically rigorous preparation, and to create bridging opportunities for academically unprepared students...|$|R
