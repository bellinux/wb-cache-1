25|$|Proteins {{are made}} of a chain of 20 {{different}} types of amino acid molecules. This chain folds up into a <b>compact</b> <b>shape,</b> rather like an untidy ball of string. The shape of the protein {{is determined by the}} sequence of amino acids along its chain and it is this shape that, in turn, determines what the protein does. For example, some proteins have parts of their surface that perfectly match the shape of another molecule, allowing the protein to bind to this molecule very tightly. Other proteins are enzymes, which are like tiny machines that alter other molecules.|$|E

Brachyceran flies are of medium to large size and <b>compact</b> <b>shape.</b> They have large compound eyes, well developed wings, and generally fly during daytime seeking food and mates.

However, in contrast to nematoceran flies which have larvae always non-parasitic and living in the general habitat, some species of brachyceran flies are parasitic in their larval stage [...] whilst the adults that develop from these larvae are non-parasitic. This parasitism by brachyceran larvae causes the disease myiasis.|$|E

40|$|The mass {{asymmetry}} in the fission of U- 236 at low {{excitation energy}} is clarified by {{the analysis of}} the trajectories obtained by solving the Langevin equations for the shape degrees of freedom. It is demonstrated that the position of the peaks in the mass distribution of fission fragments is determined mainly by the saddle point configuration originating from the shell correction energy. The width of the peaks, on the other hand, results from the shape fluctuations close to the scission point caused by the random force in the Langevin equation. We have found out that the fluctuations between elongated and <b>compact</b> <b>shapes</b> are essential for the fission process. According to our results the fission does not occur with continuous stretching in the prolate direction, similarly to that observed in starch syrup, but is accompanied by the fluctuations between elongated and <b>compact</b> <b>shapes.</b> This picture presents a new viewpoint of fission dynamics and the splitting mechanism.

2500|$|The exact {{chemical}} composition and the sequence {{in which these}} units are arranged is called the primary structure, {{in the case of}} proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic <b>compact</b> <b>shapes</b> (see also [...] "protein folding" [...] as well as secondary structure and tertiary structure), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. Structural biology is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.|$|R
2500|$|In {{any given}} layer of a star, {{there is a}} {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below {{and the weight of}} the material above pressing inward. [...] The isotropic gravitational field compresses the star into the most <b>compact</b> <b>shape</b> possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an oblate spheroid up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star Vega, which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid, and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but [...] or oviform, with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable.|$|E
60|$|They {{were not}} a large family, and their pursuits and habits were very simple; yet the summer was lapsing toward the first pathos of autumn before they found {{themselves}} all in such case as {{to be able to}} take the day's pleasure they had planned so long. They had agreed often and often that nothing could be more charming than an excursion down the Harbor, either to Gloucester, or to Nahant, or to Nantasket Beach, or to Hull and Hingham, or to any point within the fatal bound beyond which is seasickness. They had studied the steamboat advertisements, day after day, for a long time, without making up their minds which of these charming excursions would be the most delightful; and when they had at last fixed upon one and chosen some day for it, that day was sure to be heralded by a long train of obstacles, or it dawned upon weather that was simply impossible. Besides, in the suburbs, you are apt to sleep late, unless the solitary ice-wagon of the neighborhood makes a very uncommon rumbling in going by; and I believe that the excursion was several times postponed by the tardy return of the pleasurers from dreamland, which, after all, is not the worst resort, or the least interesting--or profitable, for the matter of that. But at last the great day came,--a blameless Thursday alike removed from the cares of washing and ironing days, and from the fatigues with which every week closes. One of the family chose deliberately to stay at home; but the severest scrutiny could not detect a hindrance in the health or circumstances of any of the rest, and the weather was delicious. Everything, in fact, was so fair and so full of promise, that they could almost fancy a calamity of some sort hanging over its perfection, and possibly bred of it; for I suppose that we never have anything made perfectly easy for us without a certain reluctance and foreboding. That morning they all got up so early that they had time to waste over breakfast before taking the 7.30 train for Boston; and they naturally wasted so much of it that they reached the station only in season for the 8.00. But there is a difference between reaching the station and quietly taking the cars, especially if one of your company has been left at home, hoping to cut across and take the cars at a station which they reach some minutes later, and you, the head of the party, are obliged, at a loss of breath and personal comfort and dignity, to run down to that station and see that the belated member has arrived there, and then hurry back to your own, and embody the rest, with their accompanying hand-bags and wraps and sun-umbrellas, into some <b>compact</b> <b>shape</b> for removal into the cars, during the very scant minute that the train stops at Charlesbridge. Then when you are all aboard, and the tardy member has been duly taken up at the next station, and you would be glad to spend the time in looking about on the familiar variety of life which every car presents in every train on every road in this vast American world, you are oppressed and distracted by the cares which must attend the pleasure- seeker, and which the more thickly beset him the more deeply he plunges into enjoyment.|$|E

40|$|Visualization of 2 D point clouds {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic yet one of the most {{important}} problems in many visual data analysis tasks. Point clouds arise in many contexts including scatter plot analysis, or the visualization of high-dimensional or geo-spatial data. Typical analysis tasks in point cloud data include assessing the overall structure and distribution of the data, assessing spatial relationships between data elements, and identification of clusters and outliers. Standard point-based visualization methods do not scale well with respect to the data set size. Specifically, as the number of data points and data classes increases, the display quickly gets crowded, making it difficult to effectively analyze the point clouds. We propose to abstract large sets of point clouds to <b>compact</b> <b>shapes,</b> facilitating the scalability of point cloud visualization with respect to data set size. We introduce a novel algorithm for constructing <b>compact</b> <b>shapes</b> that enclose all members of a given point cloud, providing good perceptional properties and supporting visual analysis of large data sets of many overlapping point clouds. We apply the algorithm in two different applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique for large point cloud data.
