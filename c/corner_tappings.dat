40|$|The {{time-averaged}} Navier-Stokes' partial {{differential equations}} {{have been used}} in the mathematical modelling of fluid flow for steady, incompressible non-cavitating, high Reynolds number turbulence through an orifice plate. The model developed for orifice plates was based on a particular closed form turbulent model: the k-ε two equation model developed at Imperial College, London and embodied in the TEACH-T finite difference computer code. A basic model for axisymmetric flow through an orifice meter was developed by appropriate modification of the TEACH-T program to incorporate orifice plate geometry, upstream/downstream distances, Reynolds number, inlet velocity profile and the calculation of output quantities of interest such as discharge and pressure loss coefficients. The model vas tested for convergence and general adequacy on an orifice of diameter ratio β=. 7 in a 4 inch pipe line and at a Reynolds number of 105. Quantitative tests were then conducted on thin orifice plates in the range. 3 β. 7. Results were compared with those from BSI 1042 for discharge coefficients (flange, D-D/ 2 and <b>corner</b> <b>tappings)</b> and published results for pressure loss coefficients. The results show that the discharge coefficients predictions are within 3...|$|E
40|$|ISO 5167 - 2 : 2003 {{specifies}} {{the geometry}} and {{method of use}} (installation and operating conditions) of orifice plates when they are inserted in a conduit running full to determine the flow-rate of the fluid flowing in the conduit. It also provides background information for calculating the flow-rate and is applicable {{in conjunction with the}} requirements given in ISO 5167 - 1. ISO 5167 - 2 : 2003 is applicable to primary devices having an orifice plate used with flange pressure <b>tappings,</b> or with <b>corner</b> pressure <b>tappings,</b> or with D and D/ 2 pressure tappings. Other pressure tappings such as vena contracta and pipe tappings have been used with orifice plates but are not covered by ISO 5167 - 2 : 2003. ISO 5167 - 2 : 2003 is applicable only to a flow which remains subsonic throughout the measuring section and where the fluid can be considered as single phase. It is not applicable to the measurement of pulsating flow. It does not cover the use of orifice plates in pipe sizes less than 50 mm or more than 1 000 mm, or for pipe Reynolds numbers below 5 000...|$|R
50|$|Flow rates {{through an}} orifice plate can be {{calculated}} without specifically calibrating the individual flowmeter {{so long as the}} construction and installation of the device complies with the stipulations of the relevant standard or handbook. The calculation takes account of the fluid and fluid conditions, the pipe size, the orifice size and the measured differential pressure; it also takes account of the coefficient of discharge of the orifice plate, which depends upon the orifice type and the positions of the pressure tappings. With local pressure <b>tappings</b> (<b>corner,</b> flange and D+D/2), sharp-edged orifices have coefficients around 0.6 to 0.63, while the coefficients for conical entrance plates are in the range 0.73 to 0.734 and for quarter-circle plates 0.77 to 0.85. The coefficients of sharp-edged orifices vary more with fluids and flow rates than the coefficients of conical-entrance and quarter-circle plates, especially at low flows and high viscosities.|$|R
