50|$|In 1980 and 1981, Collazo, having {{qualified}} as an FMC practitioner, created and filed the Pacific Coast European Conference Tariff FMC-18. That technical correlation of <b>commodity</b> <b>classification</b> {{systems for the}} Brussel's BTN and the United Nation's SITC in FMC-18 provided the private sector technical contribution needed to facilitate a successful implementation of the United States objectives via the CCC and the ITC processes for the creation and adoption of a harmonized international trade <b>commodity</b> <b>classification</b> system. Today, these tariff and <b>commodity</b> <b>classification</b> systems are known as the Harmonized System (HS) for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The HS is the international standard for reporting goods to customs and other government agencies.

Furthermore, the order stated that, [...] "the software shall not be considered or treated as 'technology'" [...] in the sense of Export Administration Regulations. The Commodity Jurisdiction process was replaced with a <b>Commodity</b> <b>Classification</b> process, and a provision was added to allow export of 56-bit encryption if the exporter promised to add [...] "key recovery" [...] backdoors by the end of 1998. In 1999, the EAR was changed to allow 56-bit encryption and 1024-bit RSA to be exported without any backdoors, and new SSL cipher suites were introduced to support this (RSA_EXPORT1024 with 56-bit RC4 or DES).

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how the statistical architecture of Canada's System of National Accounts can be utilized {{to study the}} size and composition of a specific economic sector. For illustrative purposes, the analysis focuses on the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, and hence, {{on the set of}} technology-producing industries and technology outputs most commonly associated with what is often termed the high-technology economy. Using supply and use tables from the input-output accounts, we develop integrated ICT industry and <b>commodity</b> <b>classifications</b> that link domestic technology producers to their principal commodity outputs. We then use these classifications to generate a series of descriptive statistics that examine the size of Canada's high-technology economy along with its underlying composition.

To this purpose, we construct a novel, comprehensive and extremely detailed dataset, which contains product-level information on foreign trade and domestic production for 25 EU countries over 1995 - 2007. Using these data, we identify new domestic goods and new imported inputs, controlling for all changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>classifications</b> over time. We then show that new imported inputs substantially boost the introduction of new domestic products. We also show that this effect is directly proportional to the quality of new imported inputs and inversely related to their price (conditional on quality).

To this purpose, we assemble a novel data set covering 25 European countries over 1995 – 2007 and containing information on domestic production and bilateral trade for the universe of goods.

We organize the empirical analysis around a version of the endogenous growth model with expanding variety, in which inputs are allowed to be heterogeneous in terms of quality. In line with this framework, we find three main results. First, new imported inputs have a strong positive effect on product creation in Europe. Second, they work through a combination of mechanisms, allowing countries to benefit from both wider and better sets of intermediate products. Finally, new imported inputs give a substantial boost to output growth in manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the Spanish {{contribution to the}} consumption part of the DEMPATEM project. The paper is organized in five Sections and three Appendixes. Section I describes the main data source, the Encuestas de Presupuestos Familiares (EPF) collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) in 1973 - 74, 1980 - 81 and 1990 - 91. Measurement problems in relation to household expenditures and incomes are discussed. Section II presents the evolution of consumption expenditure patterns at current prices using two <b>commodity</b> <b>classifications.</b> The first one, fully described in Appendix A, classifies all commodities into 8 goods and 12 services. In the second one, used for international comparisons in the DEMPATEM project, expenditures in housing, health, education and durable goods are excluded from total household expenditures. In the Spanish case, the magnitude to be explained by econometric methods is the change in budget shares of 8 non-durable goods and 9 services between 1980 - 81 and 1990 - 91. Section III {{is devoted to the}} introduction of a number of potential explanatory factors, including a) demographic and other household characteristics, b) income (or household expenditures) effects, c) changes in household expenditures inequality, d) changes in relative prices holding quantities demanded constant, referred to as the Baumol effect as in Blow et al.

Sector IV contains a discussion of the estimated budget elasticities for the 17 commodities in 1980 - 81 and 1990 - 91, the explanation of the increase in the services share over the period, and the comparison of this magnitude between Spain and the U. S. in 1980 and 1990. Appendix B describes how the Baumol effect has been constructed in the Spanish case, while regression results for the 17 Engel curve system are relegated to Appendix C.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{continental-scale}} kriging on the African continent using the gold-bearing commodities of the Gondwana Geoscience Indexing Database. The mineral layer contains over 20 000 commodities, each containing information on its ordinal interval size value. Boundaries between class intervals across the database are, however, not uniform. We perform spatial interpolation on a continental scale using the commodity gold as the binary variable. First, we select an appropriate distance metric {{in order to}} krige on an essentially spherical surface. We use this metric to implement a valid covariance function. Second, the ordinal size classes of the commodities are combined into a unique size classification. In addition, the <b>commodity</b> size <b>classification</b> {{is used as a}} proxy for data reliability and is incorporated by using a weighted variogram. The geology is used to stratify Africa into geologically homogeneous strata, leading to stratified kriging. The best model in each stratum is used to produce a map of gold commodities of Africa including the spatial uncertainties.

40|$|Experimental {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a single cartoned, unexpanded Group A plastic commodity to evaluate an approach to <b>commodity</b> <b>classification</b> in complex fuel geometries. The approach is based on comparing the chemical energy released during the combustion process with the energy required to vaporize the fuel. The ratio of these two quantities is often called the mass transfer number, B-number or Spalding number. The Group A commodity tested was essentially a three-dimensional cardboard box subdivided by cardboard placeholders for individual unexpanded polystyrene cups. Experiments consisted of burning the front face of a single box with all remaining faces uniformly insulated. Measurements of gas temperatures, mass-loss rate and heat flux from the flame were used to calculate a modified B-number, which includes consideration {{of the role of}} radiant heat transfer.

40|$|Two {{objectives}} of international commodity policy {{have been to}} reduce instability in exporter's earnings and importer's prices through international (buffer stock) agreements and to encourage further processing of domestically produced commodities by developing countries. However, it appears that {{little attention has been}} given to potential interrelations between these objectives. Using the World Bank's <b>commodity</b> processing <b>classification</b> scheme this study shows that a major structural shift occurred from the mid- 1960 s to late 1980 s in the composition of developing countries'exports toward most processed commodities, and this change was reflected to varying degrees in all major developed country import markets. However, the developing countries actually responsible for the further processing often were not major producers of the primary commodity. This finding suggests that internal constraints to commodity processing may often be more important than external barriers like escalating tariffs. This study also established that the shift resulted in developing countries receiving considerably more stable agricultural materials and ores and metals export prices [...] {{and to a lesser extent}} prices for foodstuffs [...] as well as more favorable long-term price changes.
