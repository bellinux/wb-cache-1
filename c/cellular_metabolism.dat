5|$|The most {{prominent}} roles of mitochondria are {{to produce the}} energy currency of the cell, ATP (i.e., phosphorylation of ADP), through respiration, and to regulate <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The central set of reactions involved in ATP production are collectively known as the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle.

5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products of <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism.</b> In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which {{filter out}} the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism</b> through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{an adverse}} early-life {{environment}} {{has been linked}} to an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome, the molecular mechanisms underlying altered disease susceptibility as well as their relevance to humans are largely unknown. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that these effects operate within the normal range of birth weights and involve mechanisms of developmental palsticity rather than pathology. Method: To explore this further, we utilised a non-human primate model Macaca fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque) which shares with humans the same progressive history of the metabolic syndrome. Using microarray we compared tissues from neonates in the average birth weight (50 - 75 th centile) to those of lower birth weight (5 - 25 th centile) and studied the effect of different growth trajectories within the normal range on gene expression levels in the umbilical cord, neonatal liver and skeletal muscle. Results: We identified 1973 genes which were differentially expressed in the three tissue types between average and low birth weight animals (P < 0. 05). Gene ontology analysis identified that these genes were involved in metabolic processes including <b>cellular</b> lipid <b>metabolism,</b> <b>cellular</b> biosynthesis, cellular macromolecule synthesis, <b>cellular</b> nitrogen <b>metabolism,</b> <b>cellular</b> carbohydrate <b>metabolism,</b> <b>cellular</b> catabolism, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of molecular functions, biological adhesion and development...|$|R

5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism,</b> possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism</b> was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism</b> or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E

However, genome-wide transcriptome patterns throughout maize endosperm development have not been comprehensively investigated to date. Accordingly, we performed a high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the maize endosperm transcriptome at 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after pollination (DAP). We {{found that more than}} 11, 000 protein-coding genes underwent alternative splicing (AS) events during the four developmental stages studied. These genes were mainly involved in intracellular protein transport, signal transmission, <b>cellular</b> carbohydrate <b>metabolism,</b> <b>cellular</b> lipid <b>metabolism,</b> lipid biosynthesis, protein modification, histone modification, <b>cellular</b> amino acid <b>metabolism,</b> and DNA repair. Additionally, 7, 633 genes, including 473 transcription factors (TFs), were differentially expressed among the four developmental stages. The differentially expressed TFs were from 50 families, including the bZIP, WRKY, GeBP and ARF families. Further analysis of the stage-specific TFs showed that binding, nucleus and ligand-dependent nuclear receptor activities might be important at 5 DAP, that immune responses, signalling, binding and lumen development are involved at 10 DAP, that protein metabolic processes and the cytoplasm might be important at 15 DAP, and that the responses to various stimuli are different at 20 DAP compared with the other developmental stages.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism,</b> growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the nitric oxide levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions.

This is exactly how pathogens such as MRSA can become antibiotic-resistant (or how HIV can become drug-resistant), and the same reason why crop blights and pests can become pesticide-resistant. This evolution is why cancer recurrences will have cells that have acquired cancer-drug resistance (or in some cases, resistance to radiation from radiotherapy).|$|E

Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the <b>cellular</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Certain man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.|$|E
