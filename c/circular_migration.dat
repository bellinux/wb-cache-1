25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{may also}} {{perpetuate}} existing inequalities. A worker’s social class predicts {{the work that}} he or she will qualify for, and those who are most successful in their home country are most able to continue to be successful by improving the economic and social situation of their household. The optimistic “win-win-win” discourse can often overlook the many costs involved in <b>circular</b> <b>migration,</b> as well as the difficulty that exists in implementing policies specifically for <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century, a {{great deal}} of <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> existed between the United States and Mexico. In general, this {{movement}} was seasonal migration spurred by the agricultural sector, and border crossings were frequently undocumented {{due to the lack of}} a border patrol. From 1942 to 1964, the Bracero Program facilitated the temporary migration of more than 4 million workers, often for multiple contracts that allowed for them to return repeatedly to the United States. Following this, the United States shifted towards stricter border control and began to grant fewer visas, disrupting the trend of <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> Because of the risks associated with illegal immigration, many former circular migrants began to settle permanently in the United States, though <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> is still a common phenomenon in U.S.-Mexico immigration relations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in international development, and policy initiatives have the potential to aid in this development. Many policy makers from both national and international institutions are advocating for policies that make the movement of migrant workers between their home and host countries easier. Ideally, established <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> systems facilitated and protected by the law would allow for the “triple-win” scenario that benefits countries of origin, countries of destination and the migrants themselves. The International Organization for Migration advocates that destination countries should provide mechanisms that promote repeat and regular <b>circular</b> <b>migration,</b> while also providing incentives to return to their same job. There are several possible measures that would increase the ease and impact of <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> The provision of legal residential status and flexible work visas would likely allow for increased <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> between countries. Giving returning migrants priority for residency permits for additional temporary employment over first-time migrants would make it easier for circular migrants to obtain official legal status, which has shown to be beneficial for migration. In addition, long-term multi-entry visas provided to return migrants would encourage multiple and repeated trips. Furthermore, one of the most simple policy recommendations is that governments should promote the free movement of individuals within the borders of their own countries. Lastly, in an effort to combat brain drain, the World Bank has called for developed countries to pay a tax to developing countries in order to make up for the loss of human capital.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background : In this dissertation, I model HIV {{transmission}} in {{two different}} populations: circular migrants in South Africa, and {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) in Southern California. Objectives : One objective of the <b>circular</b> <b>migrations</b> (Chapter 2) project is to compare compartmental and network models in how they explain the dynamics of a system in which some individuals engage in <b>circular</b> <b>migrations.</b> Another goal is to understand the role such movement patterns play in HIV transmission, given the critical interaction between acute infection and rate of movement. In the population of MSM in Southern California, I model post-diagnosis behavior change (PDBC). The objective in Chapter 3 is to quantify the population-level effects of individual-level PDBC. A second objective (Chapter 4) is to compare various strategies for early diagnosis in terms of how many new infections they produce over a 10 -year period. Methods : The compartmental models in Chapter are developed using ordinary differential equations (ODE's) and the network models are derived from the exponential random graph models (ERGM's). Epidemiological studies on <b>circular</b> <b>migrations</b> in the KwaZulu-Natal province conducted over the past decade provide the necessary motivation. The models on PDBC in Chapters 3 and 4 are based on ERGMs. The behavioral components of these models are parameterized primarily using the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP). Several other studies are used to model the various biological and demographic components of these models (details in Appendix F). Results : In Chapter 2, I find that compartmental models do not show any impact of the frequency of migrations on HIV prevalence. Under suitable assumptions, network models show that "frequent" migrations (that take place at intervals shorter than the window of acute infection) produce a larger epidemic than infrequent migrations. In Chapter 3, I find that if there were no PDBC, HIV prevalence in Southern California MSM would be higher by about a third. In Chapter 4, I find that individual testing strategies where people test based on the number of partners or time since last test work better than other strategies I consider. Discussion : Chapter 2 is a largely theoretical study, parameterized by qualitative descriptions of data. While the question of the precise impact of <b>circular</b> <b>migrations</b> on HIV transmission is still an open one, and likely contingent upon specific behavioral components in particular populations where <b>circular</b> <b>migrations</b> are practiced. However, our...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of the current {{economic}} crisis on migration flows is not a trivial issue due to the interplay of several determinants. So far, there is little statistical evidence on the nature and magnitude of this impact and only hypotheses and scenarios can be advanced. This paper aims to fill this gap by trying to assess the effects of the crisis on migration flows between North African countries and Italy. By using up-to-date empirical data and statistics, we find evidence of a twofold trend during 2008 : 1) labour migration flows have slightly decreased; 2) undocumented migration has instead increased. Beyond economic factors, several explanations are provided to describe these dynamics. Finally, policy implications and potential solutions are discussed, by focusing in particular on the role of <b>circular</b> <b>migrations...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>{{migration}}</b> or repeat {{migration is}} the temporary and usually repetitive movement of a migrant worker {{between home and}} host areas, typically {{for the purpose of}} employment. It represents an established pattern of population mobility, whether cross-country or rural-urban. There are several benefits associated with this migration pattern, including gains in financial capital, human capital, and social capital. There also costs associated with <b>circular</b> <b>migration,</b> such as brain drain, poor working conditions, forced labor, and the inability to transfer acquired skills to home economies. Socially, there are strong connections to gender, health outcomes, development, poverty, and global immigration policy.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of female {{circular}} migrants has increased rapidly. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, South Africa's internal policies only permitted men to legally migrate to the city. This influx control was lifted in 1986, thus paving the way for women to begin migrating to urban areas. However, the change first affected permanent migration patterns, as female <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> did not begin to increase substantially until over a decade later, mostly due to changing economic conditions. Overall, mobility in South Africa is high and continues to grow, as <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> is carried out to look for work and raise children in areas with better schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> and its {{relation}} to development is especially relevant today. First, understanding the importance of transnationalism and the temporary and repetitive movement of migrants between countries has facilitated new thinking, specifically with regards to remittances and organized labor schemes. Second, the “win-win-win” discourse is being considered seriously as a potential option for development to provide benefits for all parties involved. Third, in the current political climate many parts of the developed world are against migration, so <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> is an option that policy makers believe is more in touch with public opinion. Lastly, advances in technology have enabled government officials to monitor migrants as they move between their home and host countries.|$|E
30|$|Seasonal worker {{programmes}} {{are often}} advocated {{for having the}} potential of creating triple wins for the migrants, their countries of origin, and the destination countries (Ramasamy et al., 2008). These triple wins are created as <b>circular</b> seasonal <b>migration</b> can address labour shortages in agricultural sectors, provide migrants with income opportunities, and ideally have a development impact on the countries of origin.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{population and the}} environment holds {{an important role in}} research on the linkages between human society and ecological systems. Recent studies on population and the environment have turned research focus toward the more dynamic factor of population processes – migration. The mediating factor approach to population and environment provides a basic theoretical model for understanding the complex {{relationship between}} migration and the environment. Thus far, few studies have been conducted on the environmental impacts of <b>migration</b> particularly <b>circular</b> labor <b>migration</b> in the rural communities from which migrants originate. The increasing rural-to-urban labor migration in China since the early 1980 ’s has formed the largest population flow in world history. The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation research project is to obtain {{a better understanding of how}} this large-scale <b>circular</b> labor <b>migration</b> movement impacts the rural environment through sociocultural and economic mediating factors. Major intervening variables identified in recent literature on environmental effects of migration revolve around rural livelihoods and community development. A comprehensive conceptual framework was developed in this study that incorporated the rural livelihood...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is focused on new {{migration}} tendencies of retired guest workers. This paper represents one part of a study conducted during 2014 in eastern Serbia and Vienna regarding life strategies of retired labor migrants. In domestic (Serbian) social sciences this subject was neglected, but recently it has attracted global social scientific attention with an idea of interdisciplinary merge of migration and age studies. To the day, global literature has only covered retired migrant laborers return to their home countries, but recent studies show changes in migration tendencies of retired laborers of many different nationalities, who have spent their work age in Western Europe. These new migration patterns were called “oscillatory movement” or as a new, alternative “third option”. They are only a form of seasonal and <b>circular</b> <b>migrations</b> which present the most dominant fashion of modern migrant mobility in Europe. Therefore we wanted to see what is the situation with labor migrants from Serbia – do they return to Serbia once they retire or not, and what are their reasons for choosing to live on “two addresses”.

25|$|In South Africa, <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{exists in}} part because of the {{population}} mobility associated with Apartheid. Cheap labor for men existed primarily in mines and industry in urban areas, pulling men from rural areas around the country. However, their family members who were unemployed were legally bound to remain their rural villages, thus establishing a pattern of <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> that continues to this day. These mining and industrial centers attract workers from rural areas within South Africa, as well as rural areas in neighboring countries. There is a minimum of 2.5 million legal migrants, though the number of undocumented workers is likely very high. 55% of households in 2001 had at least one temporary migrant.|$|E
25|$|Human capital mostly {{involves}} {{the flow of}} skilled labor. Host countries view the <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> of highly skilled and educated migrants as positive, while low-skilled labor is often viewed more negatively. <b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> also allows for the international mobility of labor for shortages in specific sectors in developed countries with the surpluses present in developing countries. The skills that workers acquire while abroad may then benefit the home country upon return. Origin countries seek to increase their access to the labor markets of wealthier countries in hopes of reducing unemployment, increasing remittances, and retaining access to skilled nationals who work abroad. The networks that these skilled laborers establish can greatly benefit the home country, contributing to the social capital. Social capital also involves social remittances, non-material entities such as ideas and practices learned.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is {{the freedom of the}} migrants. Some scholars have questioned whether these workers are moving into a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of <b>circular</b> labor <b>migration</b> {{and its effect on}} subsistence agriculture among the Iban of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Based on lengthy field research, it focuses on the intersection of Iban economy, demography, and social organization, including the nature of male labor migration, household composition, the labor exchange system, {{the role of women in}} farming and in Iban society generally, and the nature of forest-fallow farming. In this remote area of Indonesian Borneo, Iban subsistence revolves around the cultivation of rice in hill, floodplain, and swamp swiddens. Hill swiddens, cut from long-fallowed forest, are particularly important. In addition, cash cropping, especially of rubber, supplements subsistence farming. However, the lack of good prices and local markets for cash crops results in high frequencies of male wage-labor <b>migration.</b> <b>Circular</b> labor <b>migration</b> refers to a pattern in which people seek work away from home but return after months or years. Among these Iban men, it is largely international, to jobs they find across the border in Malaysia and Brunei. There the wages are higher and the currencies more stable, and men’s earnings can be quite substantial by Indonesian standards. Wages are used to pay for consumer goods, subsistence foods when crops fail, and schooling for children and younger siblings. Chronic male absence negatively affects the home community in a number of ways, including increased workloads on women in farming and domestic activities. However, as this study shows, women are more involved in agriculture regardless of the presence of men, and the absence of men does not negatively affect a household’s ability to produce sufficient rice for itself. Likewise, male absence does not lead to male-poor households farming shorter (and less labor-demanding) fallows, which have been assumed to result in poorer yields. Factors that account for this situation include the widespread use of chainsaws in felling forest for farming, a functioning labor exchange system, household structure and composition, and women’s control of their reproduction...|$|R
25|$|The <b>circular</b> {{patterns}} of <b>migration</b> {{can be divided}} into several categories: seasonal migration, non-seasonal low-wage labor, and the movement of professionals, academics, and transnational entrepreneurs. Of these, seasonal migration is the most familiar between high-income and low-income countries. Although it is mostly related to the agricultural sector, in can also apply to other industries that vary by season, such as tourism, landscaping, and construction.|$|R
25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} <b>circular</b> <b>migration,</b> instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E
25|$|For Puerto Rican women, <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{is often}} {{affected}} by familial and marital status. Single women and mothers, or {{women who have}} recently experienced a change in marital status, such as divorce, {{are more likely to}} migrate to the United States than those women in stable and/or large families. Additionally, once women migrate to the United States {{they are less likely to}} return to Puerto Rico than men.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> Modern forms of {{transport}} and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced the time and money necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return home more frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are especially important to the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, the best way to get jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E
40|$|African {{political}} geographies {{have been}} {{overlooked in the}} discussion of internal migration and urbanization. Yet institutional changes since the early 1990 s altered the practices of acquiring and keeping power across Africa, and it is now possible to address how rural and urban areas have changed as a result. In this article, the focus is on how political practices interact with <b>circular</b> internal <b>migration</b> flows. “Democratic” practices depend on the manipulation of rural spatial clustering and migration, but modern political institutions effectively disenfranchise urban and migrant voters, resulting in the continued reproduction and exacerbation of spatial inequalities. Further, these are responsible for the poor conditions of urban areas, the proliferation of rural bias across states, and limited support for urban political identities and programmatic change...|$|R

We illustrate how in the southern Yucatán, <b>circular</b> transnational <b>migration</b> alters pasture, maize and chili production in a peasant field–forest system. Gender norms condition the land-use decisions of migratory households to keep women out of agricultural fields, but in turn may be modified in unexpected ways. With men’s migration, more women assume aspects of land management, including in decision-making and supervision of hired farm labor. In comparison, in Vermont a largely male migrant labor force helps maintain an idealized, pastoral landscape with gender deeply embedded in how that labor is constructed and managed...|$|R
25|$|According to {{demographer}} Pini Herman, this <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{has been}} an economic boon to Israel. Israel {{does not have the}} technological, academic, and other infrastructural resources to absorb its disproportionate number of highly trained and skilled population, second only to the United States. As a result, many Israelis have worked overseas for extended periods of time. Upon their return, they have often attracted or repatriated with them to Israel new infrastructure, such as that provided by companies like as Intel, Google, Microsoft, and IBM.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with <b>circular</b> <b>migration.</b> One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, they may not be able to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. <b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} {{is able to}} maintain transnational lives. Those who have secure residential status in both the home and host countries {{are better able to}} travel between the two without concern for legal status. In terms of who migrates, circular migrant workers {{are more likely to be}} male, have primary education, and come from more rural and less developed areas. Education, gender, age, and the reasons for return from the first migration all affect the choice of migration form. In addition, <b>circular</b> <b>migration</b> rates are high among the poor.|$|E

This notion of a “new mantra” assumes that: (a) migrant remittances can {{have a major impact on}} the economic development of countries of origin, (b) migrants also transfer home skills and attitudes—known as “social remittances” that support development, (c) “brain drain” is being replaced by “brain circulation,” which benefits both sending and receiving countries, (d) temporary (or <b>circular)</b> labor <b>migration</b> can stimulate development, (e) migrant diasporas can be a powerful force for development through the transfer of resources and ideas and (f) economic development will reduce out-migration (Castles 2009 : 457 – 458).|$|R

25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> {{has also}} been {{connected}} with the current spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is partly because migrants can {{have a difficult time}} moving to new environments, as they lack the natives’ resistance to local diseases and infections. Many migrants are also at greater risk of becoming sick because of the marginal conditions in which they live. However, as described above, the majority of the attention has been on circular migrants as disease carriers. Contact with migrant workers places their rural partners at greater risk for acquiring STDs. Due to the nature of their work, circular migrants are gone from home often and for great lengths of time, which can disrupt the balance of their family and sex lives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>migration</b> is also {{connected}} to health issues around the world. First, many circular migrants work {{in situations where}} they are more vulnerable to contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Several factors seem to create the perfect storm for the spread of diseases such as HIV. Many times, migrants are young, isolated, lonely, and have cash, which may lead them to sex and drugs. Evidence supports the idea that circular migrants become ill while working in urban areas and return home to die with their families. In addition to their personal elevated risk of contracting and dying from STDs, they are also at risk of spreading the diseases to their home communities upon return. Circular migrants make up a substantial proportion of those dying from HIV/TB, and that number continues to increase dramatically.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{temporary}} labor {{programs in the}} United States are subject to abuse.

Because of the lack of regulation, enforcement, and supervision in both Mexico and the United States, many migrants are exploited in the process of moving locations. Often, a migrant will purchase a visa for a particular job from a recruiter, only to cross the border and be forced to work in a different position or in poor working conditions with insufficient pay.
