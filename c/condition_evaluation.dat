40|$|Active {{object-oriented}} database systems are especially {{useful in the}} area of nonstandard applications in order to implement an event-driven and constraint -driven system environment. Several approaches exist in literature integrating active concepts into {{object-oriented database}}s. For most systems, their knowledge model is based on Event/Condition/Action rules, and their execution model is based on coupling modes, specifying the temporal relationships between rule triggering and <b>condition</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and between <b>condition</b> <b>evaluation</b> and action execution, respectively. The expressive power of coupling modes, however, is insufficient for specifying certain execution semantics required by nonstandard applications. The system TriGS (=Trigger system for GemStone TM) fills this gap. Instead of exploiting coupling modes TriGS uses an event specification mechanism not only for defining the points in time for rule triggering but also the points in time for <b>condition</b> <b>evaluation</b> and action e [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Although eating desires can {{be easily}} learned, their {{extinction}} appears more difficult. The present two-session study aimed to investigate the role of eating expectancies in the short and longer-term extinction of eating desires. In addition, the relationship between eating desires and <b>conditioned</b> <b>evaluations</b> was examined to test whether they might share a similar mechanism. It was hypothesized that the short-term extinction of eating desires would be more successful after the disconfirmation of eating expectancies (instructed extinction or IE), while resulting in worse longer-term extinction because omission of the food reward during extinction is not surprising. In contrast to the hypotheses, {{it was found that}} IE had no effect on the short-term and longer-term extinction of eating desires. Eating desires correlated with <b>conditioned</b> <b>evaluations</b> only to some extent. It is concluded that eating expectancies do not mediate the short-term extinction of conditioned eating desires. In addition, their longer-term extinction {{does not appear to be}} facilitated by a greater violation of eating expectancies. This suggests that it might not be necessary to focus on expectancy violation in cue exposure therapy to reduce eating desires...|$|R

The current <b>Condition</b> <b>evaluation</b> of equipment lacks of the state level, and a single test data can’t reflect the change of equipment’s state.

Firstly, use analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to establish a hierarchical structure model of equipment and divide the qualified state into 4 grades. Then respectively compare the test data with the last test value, historical test mean value and standard value. And the triangular fuzzy function to calculate the index membership degree, combined with D-S evidence theory to fuse information from multiple sources, to achieve such equipment real-time state assessment. Finally, the model is used to a servo mechanism. The result shows that this method has a good performance in <b>condition</b> <b>evaluation</b> for the storage equipmen...|$|E
