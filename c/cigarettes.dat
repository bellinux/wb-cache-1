On average, Bond smokes sixty <b>cigarettes</b> a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 <b>cigarettes</b> a day.|$|E

However, <b>cigarette</b> excise have a big portion in Indonesia’s income and of <b>cigarette</b> industries have a significant multiplier towards agriculture and other sectors, especially to Central Java as one of <b>cigarette</b> producers region. This research aims to analyze the change of excise in <b>cigarette</b> consumption and its impact to Central Java’s output and household income. The first step is to analyze the impact of change in <b>cigarette</b> excise in <b>cigarette</b> consumption using panel data econometrics Fixed Effect Model (FEM) method during the period of 2009 - 2013 between 35 regencies/cities in Central Java. The second step is to analyze the impact of <b>cigarette</b> consumption in Central Java’s output and sectoral household income. The estimation is done using the 2013 Input-Output (I-O) table of Central Java with 87 sectors classification. Besides the impact analysis, this research also analyzes prime sectors with high linkages with <b>cigarette</b> industries and other sectors in Central Java’s economy. The result shows that national income and <b>cigarette</b> excise have anegative impacts in household’s <b>cigarette</b> consumption. The increase in <b>cigarette</b> excise will reduce <b>cigarette</b> consumption, dan furthermore, will reduce output and sectoral household income.

40|$|Background Several US jurisdictions {{have adopted}} {{policies}} prohibiting pharmacies from selling tobacco products. Little {{is known about}} how pharmacies contribute to total <b>cigarette</b> sales. Methods Pharmacy and total <b>cigarette</b> sales in the USA were tabulated from AC Nielsen and Euromonitor, respectively, for the years 2005 e 2009. Linear regression was used to characterise trends over time, with observed trends extrapolated to 2020. Results Between 2005 and 2009, pharmacy <b>cigarette</b> sales increased 22. 72 % (p 0. 004), while total <b>cigarette</b> sales decreased 17. 43 % (p 0. 015). In 2005, pharmacy <b>cigarette</b> sales represented 3. 05 % of total <b>cigarette</b> sales, increasing to 4. 54 % by 2009. Extrapolation of these findings resulted in estimated pharmacy <b>cigarette</b> sales of 14. 59 % of total US <b>cigarette</b> sales by 2020. Conclusions <b>Cigarette</b> sales in American pharmacies have risen in recent years, while <b>cigarette</b> sales nationally have declined.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} for the generation of <b>cigarette</b> smoke, the combustion mechanism of a burning <b>cigarette</b> during a puff was investigated by focusing on air transfer. In particular, the air flow distribution outside a burning <b>cigarette</b> was observed and related to the aerodynamic effects of the <b>cigarette</b> paper and the puffing rate. The air flow rate was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), using olive oil droplets as the tracer particles. It was found that air does not flow into {{the tip of the}} burning <b>cigarette</b> and that the air flow was concentrated at the region - 2 to 2 mm around the <b>cigarette</b> paper char-line. This behavior was independent of the <b>cigarette</b> paper basis weight.

40|$|The world’s natural {{environment}} is degrading, and human behavior {{is a leading}} cause. Therefore, {{in order to address}} environmental problems {{it is important to understand}} the factors driving environmentally degrading behaviors and subsequently design behavioral interventions to alter undesirable behaviors. One environmental issue of particular concern is toxins leeching from trash. Specifically, <b>cigarette</b> butts are of concern due to their prevalence in the environment. <b>Cigarette</b> butt discarding behavior is affected by personal attributes, but data regarding which personal attributes and how these affect discarding behavior is lacking. This thesis seeks to understand <b>cigarette</b> butt disposal on public beaches by exploring “what influences smokers to improperly discard <b>cigarette</b> butts when visiting a public beach?” A mixed mode design utilized quantitative and qualitative data to study improper <b>cigarette</b> butt disposal. A questionnaire was designed to test theories related to place attachment, environmental attitudes, habits, and environmental awareness as predictors of improper <b>cigarette</b> butt disposal. A qualitative inquiry further explored the phenomenon of <b>cigarette</b> butt littering from the participant’s point of view. Environmental attitudes, environmental awareness, and habits were significant predictors of improper <b>cigarette</b> butt disposal behavior. Interviews illustrated that “improper disposers” experienced themes involving uncertainty that <b>cigarette</b> butts are litter, a lack of knowledge, problems with <b>cigarette</b> receptacles currently in place, the requirement of a conscious choice about how to discard a “butt,” and statements that contradicted the behavior observed. Interviews with “proper disposers” illustrated themes that <b>cigarette</b> butts are litter, awareness of social constructs, cumulative effects of <b>cigarette</b> butts on the beach, minimal obstacles to discarding properly, and feelings of personal responsibility. Recommendations for decreasing improper <b>cigarette</b> butt disposal include: promoting pro-environmental attitudes, altering habitual improper discarding behaviors, promoting environmental awareness of how <b>cigarette</b> butts negatively impact the environment, minimizing barriers to proper discarding, increasing place attachment, and changing policies about <b>cigarette</b> receptacles on beaches.
