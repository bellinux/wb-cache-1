40|$|We {{retrospectively}} studied 132 {{patients with}} dermatomyositis; 84 had idiopathic, 30 paraneoplastic, 5 juvenile and 13 amyopathic {{forms of the}} disease. The commonest features were macular erythema, heliotropic erythema and Gottron's papules. Flagellate erythema occurred in 5 % of patients with idiopathic dermatomyositis and correlated with the disease activity. Necrotic lesions were also found in this group of patients but did not always signal malignancy. The prevalence of malignancy was high (23 %). Raynaud's phenomenon occurred in 10. 6 % of patients, also in those with malignancy. Dysphagia, interstitial lung disease and arthralgias affected 20 %, 8 % and 40 % of patients, respectively. Anti-Jo- 1 antibodies were found in 5 % of patients with idiopathic dermatomyositis and low titre ANA in 1 / 3 of patients. ANA did not correlate with the disease activity.

40|$|Few trial-based {{assessments}} of ruxolitinib {{in patients with}} lower-risk myelofibrosis (MF) have been conducted, and no studies have made such assessments in a real-world population. We assessed changes in spleen size and constitutional symptoms during ruxolitinib treatment using a retrospective, observational review of anonymized US medical record data of patients diagnosed with IPSS low-risk (n= 25) or intermediate- 1 -risk (n= 83) MF. The majority of patients were male (low risk, 60 %; intermediate- 1 risk, 69 %). Most patients (92 % and 77 %) were still receiving ruxolitinib at the medical record abstraction date (median observation/exposure time, 8 months). The proportion of patients with moderate or severe palpable splenomegaly (≥ 10 [*]cm) decreased from diagnosis (56 %) to best response (12 %). Fatigue was reported in 47 % of patients and {{was the most common}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom.</b> For most symptoms in both risk groups, shifts in the distribution of severity from more to less severe from diagnosis to best response were observed. Both patients with low-risk and intermediate- 1 -risk MF experienced a substantial decrease in spleen size with ruxolitinib treatment in real-world settings. For most symptoms examined, there were distinct improvements in the distribution of severity during ruxolitinib treatment. These findings suggest that patients with lower-risk MF may benefit clinically from ruxolitinib treatment...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} viral aetiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Southern European countries. Hereby we report the main findings of a survey conducted in the area of Rome during the 2004 - 2005 winter season. ILI cases were defined as individuals with fever > 37. 5 degrees C and at least one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> and one respiratory symptom, recruited during the survey period. Influenza and other respiratory viruses were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on throat swabs. Basic individual information was collected through a standard form. Of 173 ILI cases enrolled, 74 tested positive for one virus, and two tested positive for two viruses. Overall, 33. 5 % of the cases were positive for influenza viruses, 5. 2 % for adenoviruses, 3. 5 % for parainfluenza viruses, 1. 7 % for coronaviruses, and 1. 2 % for the respiratory syncitial virus. The proportion of influenza virus detection was higher in the 'high influenza activity' period. The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups, influenza viruses being more likely to be detected in younger patients. Viral pathogens were identified in less than 50 % of ILI cases occurred during a high activity influenza season. The detection of other than influenza viruses was sporadic, without evidence of large outbreaks due to specific agents...|$|E

40|$|Background: With the {{development}} of new antiviral agents for influenza, the urge for rapid and reliable diagnosis of influenza becomes increasingly important. Respiratory virus infections are difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds General practitioners (GPs) however still depend on their clinical judgement, Aim: To evaluate the importance of clinical symptoms in the diagnosis of influenza virus infection, Design of study: A multicentre questionnaire study. Setting: Eighty-one patients from 14 general practices. Method: Patients with fever and at least one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> and one respiratory symptom were included. A questionnaire with the medical history and clinical symptoms was, completed and a combined nose-throat swab was taken. Virus culture, rapid culture, and polymerase chain reaction (FCR) amplification, were performed on each specimen, Multivariate analysis was used to obtain the best predictive model, Results By using FCR, an increase was seen in the detection of the viral pathogens compared with the results of culture. in 42 out of 81 patients PCR was positive for influenza. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 75 % was observed for the combination of headache at onset, feverishness at onset, cough, and vaccination status during the period of increase influenza activity. Criteria used by the ICHPPC- 2 resulted in a PPV of 54 %. The PPV for diagnosis made by the GP was 76 %. Conclusion: Although influenza is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, the GPs in this study were able to diagnose influenza as such more accurately on their judgement than by the other criteria...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the role of picornavirus in flu-like episodes (temperature of > or = 38. 0 degrees C plus one respiratory and one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom)</b> among otherwise healthy adults enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized oseltamivir treatment study. Combined nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline for influenza cultures and picornavirus reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. In addition, acute- and convalescent-serum samples were obtained for serological studies of common respiratory pathogens. From a total of 719 subjects enrolled in the clinical trial within 36 h of the onset of symptoms, 475 (66 %) had evidence of recent influenza A or B virus infections by means of culture and/or serological testing. Of the 244 remaining patients, 36 (15 %) presented a seroconversion for at least one of the common respiratory viruses or atypical pathogens. An RT-PCR assay for the picornavirus 5 " noncoding region (NCR) was positive in a subset of 15 (19 %) of 78 patients with flu-like illnesses of undetermined etiology. Sequence analysis of the picornavirus 5 " NCR amplicons revealed that 14 (93 %) of them had greater homology to rhinoviruses, whereas 1 (7 %) was related to enteroviruses. Interestingly, median total symptom scores and oral temperatures of picornavirus-positive patients (n = 15) and placebo-treated influenza virus-positive patients (n = 161) were similar over a 3 -week period. We conclude that, among the influenza virus-negative preselected cases of this study, rhinoviruses were relatively frequent pathogens associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms...|$|E

Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital. the ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue). DFA and RT-PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61. 8 % resulted positive. the respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus. ILI was reported for 240 / 420 patients (57. 1 %), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30. 9 % and 19. 6 %, respectively. Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the influenza season. These findings highlight the implications of other viruses in ILI etiology and suggest that during the influenza season, this clinical overlap must be considered in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients.

Methodology: 7, 163 systemically unwell children were recruited in primary care. Urine samples were collected and {{a wide range of}} presenting symptoms and signs were recorded to identify which, if any, could predict a urinary tract infection. Findings: Half of laboratory-confirmed UTIs were missed at first contact in primary care. Samples obtained using Newcastle nappy pads were 6 {{times more likely to be}} contaminated. The clinical algorithms discussed here improve clinicians’ ability to determine UTI from other causes of constitutional illness. Conclusions:•Urine samples should be collected using the ‘clean catch’ method whenever possible•Presence/absence of fever is not diagnostic for UTI in this age group in primary care•Symptoms and signs can be used to help decide which children to obtain a urine sample from•Dipstick testing of urine improves the targeting of antibiotic treatmentIt is well recognised that the diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection’s (UTIs) in young, pre-verbal, children is challenging and may mean some are not actually either suspected or diagnosed. Missed diagnosis can lead to immediate suffering and possible serious long term health problems. The DUTY study was undertaken to help clinicians recognise when to consider attempting to collect a urine sample and when to consider treatment. It also found because of the way the project was run a difference in both UTI positivity Symptoms and Signs and the presence of contamination between nappy pad urine collection and clean catch collection. The study recruited in Primary Care and as such the results are not directly comparable to any earlier studies. Children were eligible if presenting with any acute illness of less than 28 days’ duration, where the illness was associated with: (a) at least one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> or sign identified by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as a potential marker for UTI, i. e. : fever, vomiting, lethargy/malaise, irritability, poor feeding and failure to thrive; and/or (b) at least one urinary symptom identified by NICE as a potential marker of UTI, ie :abdominal pain, jaundice (children < 3 months only), haematuria, offensive urine, cloudy urine, loin pain, frequency, apparent pain on passing urine and changes to continence. In the clean catch group the parent-reported index tests associated with a UTI were: pain/crying while passing urine, smelly urine, previous UTI and, notably, absence of severe cough. For pain/crying while passing urine and smelly urine the higher these index items were scored, the more severe the UTI proved to be. Analysis of the dipstick results showed that leukocytes, nitrites and blood were strongly associated with UTI. In the nappy pad group parent-reported smelly urine, darker urine, female gender and the absence of a nappy rash were independently associated with UTI. As with the clean catch group, there was evidence for graded associations in the first two items. On dipstick testing these urines, the presence of leukocytes and nitrites (but not blood) were independently associated with UTI. Contamination was x 6 more likely in this group in comparison to the clean catch group. In conclusion urine samples should be collected using the ‘clean catch’ method whenever possible. Presence/absence of fever is not diagnostic for UTI in this age group in primary care. Symptoms and signs to be considered when deciding whether to collect urine These can be used for deciding which children to urine sample (step 1) and dipstick results to improve specificity for antibiotic treatment (step 2). </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Castleman’s Disease is a {{very rare}} medical disease and the {{presence}} of this condition in the pleura is even rarer and there are only few reported cases. The presence of symptoms is also unusual and has been mostly described in multicentric cases of castleman’s disease instead of solitary lesions (unicentric castleman). We report a case of unicentric pleural castlema’s disease with presence of <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Methods. A 36 -year-old male without any significant past medical history who presented to the emergency due to an incidental large pleural effusion seen in chest radiograph, but referring chronic <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms</b> consistent of significant weight loss and chronic cough. Results. Chest computed tomography revealed a mass and several attemps with minimally invase approach failed to identify the lesion. The mass was excised through VATS but due to its significant vascularity, it had to be converted to open thoracotomy. Conclusion. The treatment of unicentric lesions is mainly complete surgical excision and the prognosis is excellent with some chances of recurrence. There are less than one dozen of reported pleural castleman reported in the literature. This case evidence than unicentric lesion may exhibit <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms</b> and confirmed than lesions above 5 cm can be removed by VATS but the chances for conversion to an open thoracotomy are high...|$|R
