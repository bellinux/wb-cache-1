For 10 objects, the circumstellar emission has been spatially resolved. The large outer disk radii derived suggest that the emission at this wavelength is mostly optically thin. The millimetre spectral energy distributions are characterised by spectral indices alpha = 2. 3 to 3. 2. After accounting for contribution from free-free emission and <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> optical <b>depth,</b> we determine dust opacity indices beta in the range 0. 5 to 1. 6, which suggest that millimetre-sized dust aggregates {{are present in the}} circumstellar disks.

40|$|The bollard pull of a tug, {{offshore}} {{supply vessel}} or fishing boat {{is an important}} parameter from a contractual and commercial point of view. The bollard pull {{is defined as the}} mean exerted force at zero speed for a certain period of time. For the determination of the bollard pull the ITS 2002 Bollard Pull Trial Code is currently the standard [1]. In this Code are described the bollard pull trial conduct, the criteria and the corrections on the measured bollard pull for non-ideal conditions. The completeness and corrections applied in this Code, however, are disputable. A first exploration with systematic model tests to determine the corrections of varying water depth and distance to the quay on the measured bollard pull was conducted at MARIN in November 2013 [2]. The measured corrections were compared with the current Code. <b>Corrections</b> <b>for</b> tow line length and water depth according to the Code can be as high as 14 %. The model tests resulted in significantly lower <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> water <b>depth</b> and tow line length as illustrated in the figure below. In the ITS 2002 Bollard Pull Trial Code is also stated that the aim is to start a discussion regarding bollard pull with an internationally accepted bollard pull as the ultimate goal. However, this has never resulted in a final standard. Currently, the bollard pull determination is interpreted differently even by Classification Societies. With the Bollard Pull Standard JIP the relevant parameters that can be of influence on the bollard pull will be investigated. The aim is to develop an improved method for the bollard pull trial and bollard pull determination which is generally accepted by all parties involved...|$|R

We have seen several isolated radio flares of varying magnitudes (20 - 50 mJy) and durations (6 - 35 min) and we model them as due to adiabatically expanding synchrotron emitting clouds (synchrotron bubbles) ejected from the accretion disk. By applying this model, we provide a new method to estimate the electron power-law index p, hence the spectral index, from single frequency radio observations. This method does not require <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> the optical <b>depth</b> time delay effects which may be important {{in the case of}} optically thick radio emission.

40|$|Irrigas is a water tension {{measuring}} system {{made out of}} a porous cup (sensor), connected to a gas pressurizing/measuring device by a flexible tube. Water tension (T) is obtained from the equation T=Td-p or T=Ts-p, where Td is the sensor desorption critical water tension (bubbling beginning), Ts is the sensor sorption critical water tension (bubbling ceasing) and p is the applied gas pressure. Differently from conventional tensiometers, the irrigas porous cup cavity is filled with air. This characteristics makes the irrigas system nearly maintenance free and also eliminates the need of making hydrostatic pressure <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> sensor <b>depth.</b> The system was tested both in the desorption and sorption modes. In the first case the Richards pressure chamber was used to adjus) t the soil water tension which makes the porous cup air permeable. The water tension thus obtained was always practically equal to the Td values measured by the bubbling method, observation that is a physical validation of the barrel immersion technique for irrigas usage for irrigation management. Important for instrument dimensioning, porous cup water loss {{as a function of}} water tension measured from zero to Td was diminutive, increased with the soil water tension and was smaller in higher Td porous cups. In the sorption mode, functioning as a gaseous tensiometer, driven by a steady air-flow source, irrigas sensors yielded, directly, water tension readings ranging from zero to Ts. For irrigation scheduling purposes, commercial irrigas water tension systems can be selected according to crop critical water tension requirements...|$|R
40|$|Sea ice {{freeboard}} {{derived from}} satellite altimetry {{is the basis}} for the estimation of sea ice thickness using the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. High accuracy of altimeter measurements and freeboard retrieval procedure are, therefore, required. As of today, two approaches for estimating the freeboard using laser altimeter measurements from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), referred to as tie points (TP) and lowest-level elevation (LLE) methods, have been developed and applied in different studies. We reproduced these methods for the ICESat observation periods (2003 – 2008) in order to assess and analyse the sources of differences found in the retrieved freeboard and corresponding thickness estimates of the Arctic sea ice as produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Three main factors are found to affect the freeboard differences when applying these methods: (a)  the approach used for calculation of the local sea surface references in leads (TP or LLE methods), (b)  the along-track averaging scales used for this calculation, and (c)  the <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> lead width relative to the ICESat footprint and <b>for</b> snow <b>depth</b> accumulated in refrozen leads. The LLE method with 100  km averaging scale, as used to produce the GSFC data set, and the LLE method with a shorter averaging scale of 25  km both give larger freeboard estimates comparing to those derived by applying the TP method with 25  km averaging scale as used for the JPL product. Two factors, (a)  and (b), contribute to the freeboard differences in approximately equal proportions, and their combined effect is, on average, about 6 – 7  cm. The effect of using different methods varies spatially: the LLE method tends to give lower freeboards (by up to 15  cm) over the thick multiyear ice and higher freeboards (by up to 10  cm) over first-year ice and the thin part of multiyear ice; the higher freeboards dominate. We show that the freeboard underestimation over most of these thinner parts of sea ice can be reduced to less than 2  cm when using the improved TP method proposed in this paper. The <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> snow <b>depth</b> in leads and lead width, (c), are applied only for the JPL product and increase the freeboard estimates by about 7  cm on average. Thus, different approaches to calculating sea surface references and different along-track averaging scales from one side and the freeboard corrections as applied when producing the JPL data set from the other side roughly compensate each other with respect to freeboard estimation. Therefore, one may conclude that the difference in the mean sea ice thickness between the JPL and GSFC data sets reported in previous studies should be attributed mostly to different parameters used in the freeboard-to-thickness conversion...|$|R

P(0) (counts per second) is the value of the plasma {{clearance}} curve P(t) at time zero, and it can be obtained by back extrapolation using a mono-exponential fit to P(t). The range used for this exponential fit was chosen to be identical with the combined extent of the individually determined LU segments. In an independent study [8], this choice of fitting range for the mono-exponential method has been shown to yield optimal results. The injected dose [ID] (counts per second) was estimated from the whole body count rate averaged over the first minute of the study and corrected for any residual activity in the region of the injection site. The detection sensitivity of activity from both the kidneys and the injected dose were considered equal, and no <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> renal <b>depth</b> was applied. This approximation was felt to be justified on account of the small scale of the animal model and the consistency of both size and anatomy within the sample population studied. The calculation of FUR was performed {{with the aid of a}} user-written renal curve analysis software program (Renalcurve V 3.0 B 1) made available by Hermes Medical Solutions (Stockholm, Sweden/London, UK). A feature of this program is that the theoretical relationship between the linear segment of the PR plot and the plateau level of the renal impulse retention function [IRF] is utilized to identify the LU segments. The IRF is obtained by deconvolution analysis using a constrained least square method. In order to improve the robustness of the linear fit to the LU segments, an estimate of the expected intercept is calculated from the IRF and included in the fitting process as an additional data point. The resultant values for FUR were expressed in units of percent injected dose per minute. In order to test for possible dependence of the FUR values on the ROI size or position, the image data from a subset of eight kidneys were re-analyzed independently.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} high optical depth on the HI saturation observed in the Perseus molecular cloud by using Arecibo HI emission and absorption measurements toward 26 radio continuum sources. The spin temperature and optical depth of individual HI components are derived along each line-of-sight, enabling us to estimate the <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> high optical <b>depth.</b> We examine two different methods <b>for</b> the <b>correction,</b> Gaussian decomposition and isothermal methods, and find that they are consistent (maximum correction factor ~ 1. 2) likely due to the relatively low optical depth and insignificant contribution from the diffuse radio continuum emission for Perseus. We apply the correction to the optically thin HI column density on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and find that the total HI mass increases by ~ 10 %. Using the corrected HI column density image and far-infrared data from the IRIS Survey, we then derive the H 2 column density on ~ 0. 4 pc scales. For five dark and star-forming sub-regions, the HI surface density is uniform with Sigma_HI ~ 7 - 9 solar mass/pc 2, {{in agreement with the}} minimum HI surface density required for shielding H 2 against photodissociation. As a result, Sigma_H 2 /Sigma_HI and Sigma_HI+Sigma_H 2 show a tight relation. Our results are consistent with predictions for H 2 formation in steady state and chemical equilibrium, and suggest that H 2 formation is mainly responsible for the Sigma_HI saturation in Perseus. We also compare the optically thick HI with the observed "CO-dark" gas, and find that the optically thick HI only accounts for ~ 20 % of the "CO-dark" gas in Perseus.

40|$|Geothermal low {{enthalpy}} heat in non-magmatic {{areas can}} be produced by pumping hot water from aquifers at large depth (> 1 km). Key parameters for aquifer performance are temperature, depth, thickness and permeability. Geothermal exploration in the Netherlands can benefit considerably from the wealth {{of oil and gas}} data; in many cases hydrocarbon reservoirs form the lateral equivalent of geothermal aquifers. In the past decades subsurface oil and gas data have been used to develop 3 D models of the subsurface structure. These models have been used {{as a starting point for}} the mapping of geothermal reservoir geometries and its properties. A workflow was developed to map aquifer properties on a regional scale. Transmissivity maps and underlying uncertainty have been obtained for 20 geothermal aquifers. Of particular importance is to take into account <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> maximum burial <b>depth</b> and the assessment of uncertainties. The mapping of transmissivity and temperature shows favorable aquifer conditions in the northern part of the Netherlands (Rotliegend aquifers), while in the western and southern parts of the Netherlands aquifers of the Triassic and Upper Cretaceous / Jurassic have high prospectivity. Despite the high transmissivity of the Cenozoic aquifers, the limited depth and temperature reduce the prospective geothermal area significantly. The results show a considerable remaining uncertainty of transmissivity values, due to lack of data and heterogeneous spatial data distribution. In part these uncertainties may be significantly reduced by adding well test results and facies parameters for the map interpolation in future work. For underexplored areas this bears a significant risk, but it can also result in much higher flowrates than originally expected, representing an upside in project performance...|$|R
