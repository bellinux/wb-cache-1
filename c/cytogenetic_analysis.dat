25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the Chironomidae {{often goes}} unnoticed {{because they are}} notoriously difficult to identify and ecologists usually record them by species groups. Each morphologically distinct group comprises a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species {{that can only be}} identified by rearing adult males or by <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the polytene chromosomes. Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Balbiani in 1881. They form through repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division, resulting in characteristic light and dark banding patterns which can be used to identify inversions and deletions which allow species identification.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} often {{involves}} multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human retinoblastoma {{is a well}} studied example of a cancer type where mitotic nondisjunction can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, can be detected by <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>analysis</b> in many cases of retinoblastoma. Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic nondisjunction. By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, McClintock was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9. [...] This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton; they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.|$|E

40|$|A parosteal {{osteosarcoma}} of the distal femur with a typical radiographic and macroscopic appearance is reported. On histology the tumour {{was dominated by}} large numbers of osteoclast-like giant cells in a fibro-osseous background and islands of immature bone. Most of the neoplastic bone lacked osteoblastic rimming. There was no spatial relationship between the giant cells and areas of haemorrhage. Signs of 'dedifferentiation' were lacking. <b>Cytogenetic</b> a <b>analysis</b> revealed telomeric associations which are frequently found in giant cell tumours of bone. Parosteal osteosarcoma may, on histological appearances, hardly be recognizable as malignant. In addition, unusual changes such as abundant giant cells may be misleading {{in the absence of}} clinico-pathological correlation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cytological and {{cytogenetic}} {{studies were}} performed on nucleated fetal cells present in chorionic villus transport medium. The erythroblastic origin of these cells was shown. Fetal erythroblasts in spontaneous mitosis were frequently observed; chromosome counts were obtained from them but poor quality often prevented banded <b>analysis.</b> <b>Cytogenetic</b> study of erythroblast metaphases can be useful as an additional diagnostic aid in cases of mosaicism with aneuploid cell lines...|$|R
500|$|After her year-long {{temporary}} appointment, McClintock {{accepted a}} full-time research position at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. There, she was highly productive and continued {{her work with}} the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, using it to substitute for X-rays {{as a tool for}} mapping new genes. In 1944, in recognition of her prominence in the field of genetics during this period, McClintock was elected to the National Academy of Sciences—only the third woman to be elected. That same year, she became the first female president of the Genetics Society of America; she was elected its vice-president in 1939. In 1944 she undertook a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>analysis</b> of Neurospora crassa at the suggestion of George Beadle, who used the fungus to demonstrate the one gene–one enzyme relationship. He invited her to Stanford to undertake the study. She successfully described the number of chromosomes, or karyotype, of N. crassa and described the entire life cycle of the species. Beadle said [...] "Barbara, in two months at Stanford, did more to clean up the cytology of Neurospora than all other cytological geneticists had done in all previous time on all forms of mold." [...] N. crassa has since become a model species for classical genetic analysis.|$|E

40|$|Insertional translocations {{in which}} a {{duplicated}} region of one chromosome is inserted into another chromosome are very rare.

40|$|We {{report on}} the <b>cytogenetic</b> and {{molecular}} <b>analysis</b> of a malignant melanoma of the sob parts (MMSP). A t(12; 22) (q 13;q 12) was found as the only structural chromosomal change, and this provides additional support for {{the important role of}} this translocation in MMSP development. Molecular analysis revealed in frame fusion between exon 10 of the Ewing's sarcoma oncogene (EWS) and codon 110 of ATF- 1. In previously analyzed MMSPs, junctions were observed between EWS exon 8 and ATE-I codon 65. The present data thus indicate that, as in Ewing's sarcoma, different fusion proteins can occur in MMSP. The presence of the EWS/ATF- 1 fusion gene in the tumor cells was demonstrated by dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase nuclei. Our data provide additional support for the specific association of the t(12; 22) and the resulting EWS/ATF- 1 gene fusion in MMSP. This particular genetic aberration, therefore, serves as a strong diagnostic marker for MMSP. We conclude that detection of the t(12; 22) by <b>cytogenetic</b> or molecular <b>analysis</b> is useful in establishing or confirming the diagnosis of MMSP. status: publishe...|$|R

He had one paternal and one maternal X chromosome at the marker DXS 1053. Based on our data, we would suggest that chimaerism arose {{as a result of}} postzygotic fusion of two embryos.

An allopatric species of Lepilemur, L. septentrionalis, has been created recently {{on the basis of}} cytogenetic distinctions (Rumpler & Albignac, 1975). L. septentrionalis is shown here to be significantly smaller than the morphologically similar L. dorsalis in thirty-four of thirty-seven linear cranial dimensions, but significantly larger in interorbital breadth (lacrimale-lacrimale).

The mother was ascertained through a history of recurrent abortion and is phenotypically normal. The translocation in both subjects was studied by <b>cytogenetic</b> and DNA <b>analysis</b> {{and appears to be}} a true dicentric isochromosome.
