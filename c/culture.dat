5|$|The Prague <b>culture</b> {{developed}} over {{the western part of}} the Slavic expansion within the basins of the middle Dnieper River, Pripyat River and upper Dniester up to the Carpathian Mountains and in southeastern Poland, i.e., the upper and middle Vistula basin.

The Prague <b>culture</b> very likely corresponds to the Sclaveni referred to by Jordanes, whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources. The Penkovka <b>culture</b> people inhabited the southeastern part, from Seversky Donets to the lower Danube (including the region where the Antes would be), and the Kolochin <b>culture</b> was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka <b>culture</b> (the upper Dnieper and Desna basins).
