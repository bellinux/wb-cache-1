5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (<b>caprylic</b> and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{methodology}} for hyperimmune horse plasma fractionation, based on <b>caprylic</b> acid precipitation, is described. Optimal conditions for fractionation were studied; the method gives best results when concentrated <b>caprylic</b> acid {{was added to}} plasma, whose pH had been adjusted to 5. 8, until a final <b>caprylic</b> acid concentration of 5 % was reached. The mixture was vigorously stirred during <b>caprylic</b> acid addition and then for 60 min; afterwards the mixture was filtered. Non-immunoglobulin proteins precipitated in these conditions, whereas a highly enriched immunoglobulin preparation was obtained in the filtrate, which was then dialysed to remove <b>caprylic</b> acid before the addition of NaCl and phenol. Thus, antivenom was produced after a single precipitation step followed by dialysis. In order to compare this methodology with that based on ammonium sulfate fractionation, a sample of hyperimmune plasma was divided into two aliquots which were fractionated in parallel by both methods. It was found that <b>caprylic</b> acid-fractionated antivenom was superior in terms of yield, production time, albumin/globulin ratio, turbidity, protein aggregates, electrophoretic pattern and neutralizing potency against several activities of Bothrops asper venom.

However, {{little is known about}} the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and MCT on intestinal inflammation. In this study we examined whether <b>caprylic</b> acid, one of the MCFAs, and MCT suppress IL- 8 secretion by differentiated Caco- 2 cells. We found for the first time that <b>caprylic</b> acid and MCT suppress IL- 8 secretion by Caco- 2 cells at the transcriptional level when precultured together for 24 h. We also tried to clarify the mechanism of IL- 8 gene inhibition by examining the activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and found that <b>caprylic</b> acid did not modulate their activation. The result of dual-luciferase assay using Caco- 2 cells transfected with IL- 8 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid revealed that <b>caprylic</b> acid inhibited the activation of IL- 8 promoter. Similar results were observed when cells were precultured with the well-known potent histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We examined the state of H 4 acetylation in IL- 8 promoter using the technique known as chromatin immunoprecipitation (Chr-IP). TSA rapidly induced H 4 acetylation in IL- 8 promoter chromatin, whereas <b>caprylic</b> acid did not.

40|$|Dermatophilus congolensis is a gram {{positive}} bacterium {{which causes}} a skin disease {{in a wide}} range of animals including man. This disease is called dermatophilosis, commonly known as rain rot. Dermatophilosis causes extensive damage within the animal industry, including loss of days at work, reduction in milk yield, and deterioriation of hide and meat quality. This disease requires quick diagnostic tools and sustainable treatment to avoid economic losses. ^ The 1029 bp DNA segment of the alkaline ceramidase gene of D. congolensis was targeted to develop a species-specific PCR to speed up the diagnostic and treatment process to minimize economic losses. The PCR is sensitive, specific and detects as low as 50 × 10 - 3 µg of D. congolensis DNA within 4 hours. This PCR has potential clinical application for rapid diagnosis of dermatophilosis. ^ <b>Caprylic</b> acid is a medium chain fatty acid that contains 8 carbons in its structure. <b>Caprylic</b> acid and its derivatives, namely monocaprylin and sodium caprylate, are naturally occurring and proven to be potential alternatives for traditional antimicrobials. This research indicated that minimum inhibitory concentrations of <b>caprylic</b> acid, monocaprylin and sodium caprylate on D. congolensis were 7. 5 mM, 2. 5 mM, 15 mM respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations of <b>caprylic</b> acid, monocaprylin and sodium caprylate on D. congolensis were 15 mM, 5 mM and 70 mM respectively. Electron microscopy experiments indicated that <b>caprylic</b> acid disrupts the plasma membrane of the bacteria. These compounds could potentially be used to treat D. congolensis infection. ^ NMR experiments were conducted to study the interaction of the D. congolensis membrane with <b>caprylic</b> acid. These NMR experiments indicated that <b>caprylic</b> acid binds to aromatic amino acids on the surface membrane proteins of D. congolensis. However it was not clear how these compounds exert their antibacterial action on D. congolensis. Elucidation of the antimicrobial mechanisms was attempted through a proteomic approach. It was found that <b>caprylic</b> acid down-regulates RNA polymerase B, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins. Down regulation of RNA polymerase B disrupts the transcriptional mechanism, and down regulation of superoxide dismutase renders the cell vulnerable to oxidative damage. ^ Species specific PCR to detect D. congolensis is very sensitive, specific and could be potentially used to detect D. congolensis, however further research is needed to ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of this PCR with clinical samples from the infected animals. <b>Caprylic</b> acid exerts its antimicrobial action on D. congolensis by disrupting the plasma membrane and inhibiting various cellular pathway by inhibiting the production RNA polymerase B, super oxide dismutase and heat shock proteins. Results of this research indicate that <b>caprylic</b> acid and its derivatives have the potential as alternatives to antibiotics currently in use. In vivo efficacy of <b>Caprylic</b> acid and its derivatives needs to be studied in order to use these compounds to their full potential. ...|$|E
40|$|Early adverse {{reactions}} {{occur in a}} number of patients treated with heterologous antivenoms and have been associated with anticomplementary activity (ACA). In order to reduce the ACA of equine whole IgG antivenoms produced by <b>caprylic</b> acid fractionation, three different fractionation protocols were compared: (a) routine <b>caprylic</b> acid fractionation; (b) <b>caprylic</b> acid fractionation followed by β-propiolactone treatment; and (c) <b>caprylic</b> acid fractionation followed by ion-exchange chromatography using a quaternary ammonium membrane. The three protocols yielded products with similar physicochemical characteristics and anti-Bothrops asper venom antibody titers, except that ion-exchange purified antivenom had a lower protein concentration. Antivenoms fractionated by using β-propiolactone or filtration through quaternary ammonium membrane had a significantly reduced in vitro ACA. A preparation of <b>caprylic</b> acid-fractionated antivenom was heated in order to induce the formation of protein aggregates; however, its ACA was similar to non-heated antivenom. None of the antivenoms affected the hemolytic activity of serum complement in rabbits after a bolus intravenous administration. It is concluded that (a) β-propiolactone and quaternary ammonium membranes significantly reduce in vitro ACA of <b>caprylic</b> acid-fractionated equine antivenom, and (b) the validity of in vitro ACA as a predictor of EAR needs to be reexamined in clinical and experimental studies, since it may not adequately predict in vivo complement activation by antivenoms.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 biofilms were disrupted by rhamnolipids at concentrations between 0 · 5 and 0 · 4 g l(- 1) and with SDS at 0 · 8 g l(- 1). The combination of rhamnolipids 0 · 4 g l(- 1) and <b>caprylic</b> acid at 0 · 1 g l(- 1) showed a remarkable effect on biofilm disruption and cell killing. After 30 min of treatment most of the biofilm was disrupted and cell viability was significantly reduced.
