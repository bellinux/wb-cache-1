40|$|Different {{components}} of global change can have interacting effects on biodiversity {{and this may}} influence our ability to detect the specific consequences of climate <b>change</b> through biodiversity <b>indicators.</b> Here, we analyze whether climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> can be affected by land use dynamics that are not directly determined by climate change. To this aim, we analyzed three community-level <b>indicators</b> of climate <b>change</b> impacts {{that are based on}} the optimal thermal environment and average latitude of the distribution of bird species present at local communities. We used multiple regression models to relate the variation in climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> to: i) environmental temperature; and ii) three landscape gradients reflecting important current land use change processes (land abandonment, fire impacts and urbanization), all of them having forest areas at their positive extremes. We found that, with few exceptions, landscape gradients determined the figures of climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> as strongly as temperature. Bird communities in forest habitats had colder-dwelling bird species with more northern distributions than farmland, burnt or urban areas. Our results show that land use changes can reverse, hide or exacerbate our perception of climate change impacts when measured through community-level climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators.</b> We stress the need of an explicit incorporation of the interactions between climate change and land use dynamics to understand what ar...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a general {{framework}} for change detection in a time series of radar images, for an operational purpose and in the context of environmental monitoring. The change detection procedure is turned into the framework of detecting a random signal into the noise; the detection of this signal leads to the detection of a change in the time series. This framework is based on a non-parametric detection method that assume a sparse representation of the data. When using radar images, the speckle noise invalidates the hypothesis of sparsity. Then a pre-processing technique is required to provide highly sparsifiable representation of data, whatever the initial noise characteristics. The paper focuses on the <b>change</b> <b>indicator,</b> based on recursive median filtering, yielding a piecewise regular representation of a scene obtained by spreading the statistically most reliable pixel values over the image. The recursive median filtering leads to simple <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> that are more efficient than the Kullback-Leibler <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> when using small analysing sliding window. Furthermore, it induces an simple extension to perform progressive change characterization through a multitemporal filtering approach.

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} requires accurate and up-to-date information, which can nowadays be obtained using digital earth observation technology. This paper introduces a modified change vector analysis (mCVA) approach and conceptually contrasts it against traditional CVA. The {{results of a}} comparative study between this change detection algorithm and three other widely used change detection algorithms: standardized differencing, ratioing and selective principal component analysis are summarized. Landsat Thematic Mappper (TM) imagery and detailed change maps of a forested area in Northern Minnesota were used. <b>Change</b> <b>indicators</b> (vegetation indices) were grouped into three conceptually independent categories corresponding to soil, vegetation and moisture characteristics. Change periods of two, four and six years were considered. All change detection outputs were multidimensional and of a continuous nature, and could therefore be subjected to a supervised maximum likelihood algorithm using identical data training sets. Change extraction accuracies were determined by computing overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients of agreement against independent reference datasets. The mCVA outperformed the three other change detection methods in all cases, and we have shown {{that there is a}} clear advantage in running mCVA with three <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> inputs where each input comes from a different <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> category. Further validations with more detailed reference data are needed to improve this method and test its performance for other types of change events. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} the urbanization process from multitemporal SPOT 5 panchromatic images is presented. The analysis is performed by unsupervised change detection between built-up presence indicators extracted {{separately from the}} scenes. The obtained index has an effective resolution which is coarser than the Ground Sample Distance, thus allowing a good spatial match between the indicators. Then, a local Mixed Information <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> is employed in order to capture the non-linear temporal behaviors. A region-based approach is developed in synergy with the local Mixed Information in order to process consistently large scenes which may be affected by regional distortions. Experiments are conducted on SPOT 5 scenes acquired in 2003 and 2008 which cover a suburban area (45 × 45 km^ 2) {{of the city of}} Tangshan in China.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} is aimed at finding a basis for systematic knowledge acquisition. More specifically, it attempts to introduce, knowledge acquisition by measurement: a method thatallows objective evaluation of empirical observations. Measurement {{has proven to be}} a significant tool to acquire, evaluate, and upgrade knowledge in some knowledge domains. In other domains,such as the domain of building change, measurement is barely subject of study. Building change knowledge acquisition by measurement seems to become a significant subject of study for several reasons: (i) increase our objective knowledge of previous building changes, (ii) allow systematic monitoring of present changes, and (iii) assist decisions planning for change in new buildings. In current studies, questions such as what were required changes, what were the building elements that fulfilled a change, how often did a building change, and what were the costs related to a change, often get no systematic or objective answers. Hence, to overcome that, I am concerned with finding a method that is to answer the following questions: 1) What is the domain of building change, 2) Is a method of knowledge acquisition by measurement adequate to represent buildingchanges, 3) Can empirical observations of building change be systematically represented and objectively evaluated using this method, and 4) How can this method be applied to assist theunderstanding of previous changes, the control of present changes, and assist planning for building change. The method introduced is based on three modules: (i) domain of building change, (ii) modelling this domain, and (iii) measurement. These three modules enable the formulation of the measurement of building change, namely the <b>change</b> <b>indicator.</b> Multiple <b>change</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as cost <b>change</b> <b>indicator,</b> or occurrence <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> can measure empirical observations ofbuilding change. Sequential steps that lead to the development of this method start by section 1, where the domain of building change is specified. In section 2 this domain is modelled, and in section 3, knowledge acquisition by measurement method is introduced. A case study, shows how empirical building changes can be measured is explained in section 4. In section 5, three possible applications are introduced, and in section 6, I explain how a computerized prototype would enhance the efficiency of using such applications.

The main objective {{was to determine the}} rural household’s perception to climate change in the state and the specific objective was to determine the direction of change of the climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> (whether increasing, decreasing or constant). Multistage sampling procedure was used in random selection of local government areas, communities and rural households for the research study. Two hundred and seventy eight respondents were utilized for this research study. Data for this study were obtained using structured questionnaire survey and also annual mean time series data from Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) that include the following; temperature and rainfall were collected. Descriptive statistic was used to analyze the respondents’ socio-economic characteristics, climate change awareness and perception to climate change and direction of change in the state. Rural farming households noticed increase changes in climate variables and events like early rains not sustained, crops smothered by excessive heat, crops are planted and replanted, irregular rainfall pattern, delayed onset of rainfall, shorter raining season, floods, coastal erosion and higher temperature. The rural farming households’ perception to the cause of direction of change of climate <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> that is increasing in the state believes that it is a natural occurrence by God or gods. The study therefore recommends climate change awareness campaign with science-based data should be the beginning for policy making and implementation targeted at effective dissemination of climate change information to the rural farming households.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{a system for}} multi-scale change {{detection}} with automatic scale selection is proposed. The generation of the multi-scale data set is performed based on the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA). The set of scales used by FNEA are optimally selected from the scale domain ensuring that the selected levels present a good enough representation of the scale domain. A pattern search module is used to select good enough set of scales with the least redundancy. The change detection is performed on each scale individually. For each individual object in a specific scale <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> are extracted for the pixels corresponding to this object in the base-scale images. After extracting the <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> for each scale, the extracted indicators are thresholded to obtain a per-scale binary change map. To obtain the final change map, a scale-driven fusion of all the extracted change maps is performed. The fusion is based on detecting for each pixel the preferred scale to obtain its change information. The best scale for an object is the scale where the object area keeps static/almost static while moving from one scale to the next scale(s). The proposed system proves advantageous over other change detection systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{similarity}} measure for automatic change detection in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images. This measure {{is based on the}} evolution of the local statistics of the image between two dates. The local statistics are estimated by using a cumulant-based series expansion, which approximates probability density functions in the neighborhood of each pixel in the image. The degree of evolution of the local statistics is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analytical expression for this detector is given, allowing a simple computation which depends on the four first statistical moments of the pixels inside the analysis window only. The proposed <b>change</b> <b>indicator</b> is compared to the classical mean ratio detector and also to other model-based approaches. Tests on the simulated and real data show that our detector outperforms all the others. The fast computation of the proposed detector allows a multiscale approach in the change detection for operational use. The so-called multiscale change profile (MCP) is introduced to yield change in- formation {{on a wide range of}} scales and to better characterize the appropriate scale. Two simple yet useful examples of applications show that the MCP allows the design of <b>change</b> <b>indicators,</b> which provide better results than a monoscale analysis...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} the results of my econometric model of the causes of Indigenous poverty in urban NSW. The model is based on an indicator framework for analysing Indigenous disadvantage developed by the Productivity Commission (2003), in which headline indicators identify multiple areas of disadvantage and strategic <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> represent possible causes of disadvantage which can be targeted by policy makers. The impact on headline <b>indicators</b> of strategic <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> and other possible causal variables is estimated by a system of simultaneous equations using data from the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). A variety of econometric techniques have been employed including the use of replicate weights, due to the complex survey design of NATSISS, and bivariate probit and control function approaches to control for endogeneity bias. Estimation results are discussed in terms of the significance and marginal effects of explanatory variables on each headline indicator of Indigenous disadvantage. The results demonstrate the key causes of Indigenous disadvantage and the interdependence of indicators. The econometric evidence offers insights for the final chapter of my thesis, in which contemporary policies are evaluated in terms of their expected impact on Indigenous poverty in urban NSW. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{evolution}} of labour-market performance in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the last decade, considering the robustness of the claims made in an important OECD follow-up study. Design/methodology/approach – The paper sets up an empirical framework calibrated on an important OECD follow-up study, and suggests some ways in which the impact of unobserved heterogeneity and outliers on policy estimates can be treated in a cross-section framework. The framework applies to the data for 30 OECD countries. Findings – The paper finds that changes in labour-market performance are inversely linked to lagged unemployment. Changes in the share of construction workers are also significant even in the presence of various kinds of policy <b>change</b> <b>indicators.</b> As far as the latter are concerned, the results highlight the role of unemployment benefits and, especially, active labour-market policies. Research limitations/implications – The kind of policy <b>change</b> <b>indicators</b> used do not allow the adoption of panel data techniques. Practical implications – An important policy role seems to emerge for unemployment benefit reforms and, even more so, active labour-market policies. The evidence also supports the contention that the construction sector is important for labour-market performance. Originality/value – The paper brings to the fore novel evidence about cross-country labour-market performance at a time when this issue is of high interest for citizens and policy-makers. ...|$|R
