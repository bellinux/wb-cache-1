Hultgren Department of Education Policy Studies <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> nursing <b>faculty</b> {{members are}} essential to the continuation and growth of the profession of nursing. Every loss of a nursing faculty member represents an even greater loss to the practice of nursing within the health care system. Previous research has documented the serious and inter-related shortage of both nursing professionals and nursing faculty. This phenomenological study explores the underlying themes leading to the decisions made by nursing educators to leave the practice of teaching, and presents strategies for preserving and strengthening the position of nursing <b>faculty</b> within the <b>community</b> <b>college.</b> The guiding question for this inquiry is: "What is the lived experience of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> nursing <b>faculty</b> who leave the profession of teaching?" Text for this study comes from narrative sources such as reflective writings and one-on-one conversations with six former full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> nursing <b>faculty</b> members. In chapters two and three, I turn to the literature and am guided by the phenomenological philosophers such as Heidegger, Gadamer, and Casey. Nursing leaders and their work provide me with grounding for the study and to help me to draw out the phenomenon for investigation. The six research activities of van Manen provide the methodological framework for the research. Chapter four is a meeting place for those who tell their stories. The nursing faculty members who offer up their stories journey with me as I explore the meanings of their experiences. These conversations help to unravel the experiences of being a teacher of nurses and offer a place for their voices to be heard. Several themes that were uncovered showed a lack of a welcoming into teaching, unrealistic workload expectations and work-family conflict. Using the metaphor of sheltering walls, the study explores the needs of nursing faculty members to find, claim and maintain an appropriate dwelling place in order to sustain professional growth and well-bring. Pedagogical insights serve as a challenge to nurse educators to fortify the bonds of community within nursing education programs. Program administrators and faculty alike must accept the responsibility to look beyond what is most apparent, communicating awareness of individual and common needs and strengths in order to continue to enrich the lives of their students and of each other...|$|R

Procedures The statistical and subjective data for this study were obtained from two major sources. (1) A statistical questionnaire was developed to identify and obtain the present faculty involvement and the "desired" faculty involvement in policy formulation in three selected public <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> of Oregon and was distributed to <b>community</b> <b>college</b> administrators and full-time teaching faculty, and (2) A personal on-campus visitation and interview was conducted by the writer with each respondent to obtain additional subjective data pertaining to faculty involvement. Findings Statistical data indicated that within the present <b>community</b> <b>college</b> organizational structure, <b>faculty</b> do have opportunity to be involved in and to become more involved in policy formulation. Subjective data supported the statistical findings and also revealed that faculty are in the process of changing from their "traditional" no-involvement role to one of becoming increasingly more active in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> governance. Recommendations The study recommends that changes be made in the internal organizational pattern of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> operations if <b>faculty</b> are to be further involved and are to realize their potential in more meaningful policy formulation. The <b>community</b> <b>college</b> is on the "cutting edge" of education and because of this, must help to modify or change the "traditional" beliefs in education that have tended to hinder and to slow down the progress of and to cloud over the creative thoughts and deeds of educational personnel.

40|$|Many women faculty {{build their}} {{academic}} {{careers in the}} <b>community</b> <b>college</b> environment but are reluctant to consider, and face barriers to pursuing, the presidency in those same environments. The percentage of women presidents in Maryland two-year colleges has been increasing since 1989 and has been {{above the national average}} of women presidents in associate's institutions since 1998. This study is about the collective presence of women presidents in the 16 Maryland <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> using embedded units of analysis. Utilizing feminist standpoint theory and Bolman and Deal's four organizational frames, this exploratory case study examined the factors that contributed to the comparatively high numbers of women presidents at Maryland <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> The methods used included interviews, analysis of trend data, and analysis of archival documents. The findings from this study suggest that the comparatively high number of women <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents in Maryland was the result of several interrelated factors that mitigated or removed gendered barriers for women academic leaders who were pursuing <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidencies in Maryland. Significant factors related to each of this study's conceptual frameworks contributed to the high number and increasing appointments of women <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents in Maryland between 1989 and 2012. First, Maryland's abundant labor market, educational attainment trends among women, pipeline of potential women applicants in Maryland <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> (<b>faculty,</b> chief officers) and geography (proximity between <b>community</b> <b>colleges)</b> proved to be strong structural factors. Second, national and regional leadership development opportunities, intentional and pervasive mentoring of women <b>community</b> <b>college</b> leaders at Maryland <b>community</b> <b>colleges,</b> and non-traditional approaches to presidential searches by Maryland <b>community</b> <b>college</b> boards of trustees were strong human resource factors, particularly between 1989 - 2006. At the same time, strong alliances among women legislators, political activists, and higher education leaders between 1989 and 2006 proved to be significant political factors. Additionally, Maryland's perceived progressive state politics and MACCs collaborative organizational structure were strong cultural factors that attracted women <b>community</b> <b>college</b> academic leaders from outside the state and provided a collective <b>community</b> <b>college</b> culture that supported the development of women presidents and academic leaders in Maryland <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> Finally, women <b>community</b> <b>college</b> academic leaders' agency (personal and collective) around balancing family (gendered work norms), pursuing critical experiences in preparation for the presidency (career aspirations), and owning collaborative and constructive leadership orientations (gendered leadership norms) were strong feminist/gendered factors that contributed to this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 125 - 132) Public {{funding for}} community colleges has been steadily declining since the peak of funding in the 1970 s (Brightman, 1989). Surviving the constant threats of budgetary cuts has been a key motivating factor {{for community colleges}} to embrace academic entrepreneurialism. I examined the academic entrepreneurial pursuits of one California Community College (CCC) to understand those factors that encourage <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> to pursue academic entrepreneurial solutions. The purpose of this qualitative study is to examine factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Specifically, I investigated three categories of factors that influence academic entrepreneurialism: individual, institutional, and environmental. Individual factors include demographic and background characteristics, including age, race, gender, academic training, and previous professional careers. Institutional factors include program offerings available for students, institutional reputation and history, institutional policies and practices, and academic and administrative leadership. Environmental factors relate to the peer influences of a campus that encourages academic entrepreneurial behavior of faculty. The significance of this study lies {{in the identification of}} factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty,</b> ultimately supporting institutional efforts to augment funding. I investigated individual, institutional, and environmental factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Accordingly, the research questions identify key factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> and explain how they facilitate faculty to engage in academic entrepreneurialism. The research questions that I evaluated in this study are: What individual, institutional, and environmental factors influence <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> to engage in academic entrepreneurialism? What is the relationship between faculty background, institutional, and environmental characteristics and the frequency and quality of academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty?</b> I found that all three factors are essential elements of academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Individual, institutional, and environmental factors consist of people who are all pursuing their self-interest. This follows the tenets of rational choice theory as the study finds that self-interest influences faculty academic entrepreneurialism. The study argues that changes to institutional policies are the key determining factor to encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Institutional policies determine how a college functions and understands the interrelationship between individual, institutional, and environmental factors. Encouraging academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> requires institutional policies that focus on the fundamental issue: recruiting, retaining, and evaluating <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> The study offers suggestions for how to influence institutional policies that in turn encourage faculty academic entrepreneurialism by addressing the following areas: faculty job descriptions, faculty job announcements, evaluating faculty levels of academic entrepreneurialism, and offering entrepreneurial faculty financial incentives...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Background: Previous studies {{suggested}} that the professional identity of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> is less than clearly articulated. Lack of clarity with regard to professional identity may have impacts {{in a number of}} areas, including recruitment, professional development, and the overall reputation of community colleges. Purpose: To examine how <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> members articulate their professional identity and how the discourse around that professional identity affects the social reality of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> members. Setting: Interviews were conducted at “typical case” community colleges in Washington and Oregon: institutions with an annual full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment of between 3, 000 and 10, 000 FTE, with a mission mix in which academic transfer students formed the largest percentage of annual enrollments, followed by career and technical education, and then pre- college programs. Subjects: Fifteen faculty members were interviewed at three community colleges. Faculty members were full-time, tenured teaching faculty. Research Design: Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured question matrix; the question matrix was designed to elicit responses related to elements of social identity theory. Data Collection and Analysis: Face to face interviews were conducted on college campuses. Audio recordings were collected, transcribed, then coded using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Coded excerpts were grouped into prominent themes. Findings: Five primary themes were identified from the interview data. • Participants became <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> members through an accidental or unexpectedly changed career path. • Teaching was the most salient role feature for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> • Being involved in a significant committee, professional development project, or other work group was often cited as a marker of professional identity development. • Autonomy, freedom, and flexibility were prominent values attached to the professional roles. • <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> articulated a strong sense of mission; however, that sense of mission tended to vary between three values—a traditional academic paradigm, a workforce development paradigm, and a social justice/student empowerment paradigm. Conclusions: While teaching was the most salient role feature for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty,</b> most had little or no professional training for that role. In addition, the accidental career path that most faculty members experienced may contribute to a sense of luck or randomness that prohibits serious self-examination of the professional role. The strong value placed on autonomy and flexibility by <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> members may also inhibit examination of the professional identity. The social identity constructed by the discourse of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> seemed weakly defined from the perspective of social identity theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the information literacy dispositions that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> find important to their disciplines and therefore, to their students. The study examined who <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> members believe is responsible for teaching various information literacy concepts. The study analyzed <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> responses related to information literacy skills. Research was conducted in accordance with the Association of College and Research Libraries’ information literacy framework and measured the importance of specific information literacy skills from the perception of faculty. A cross sectional design used quantitative survey methods modeled after Gullikson’s significant research on faculty perceptions. The study results indicate that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> view all information literacy dispositions as important, and implementing information literacy concepts is a shared responsibility between <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> and librarians. Subtle variances between different categories of survey respondents were recorded. The findings may be used to shape recommendations to improve, evaluate, and implement information literacy at the community college level. Community colleges need to adopt information literacy as an institutional goal while providing financial support and policies that encourage partnerships between librarians and faculty, require assessment of information literacy initiatives. An assessment of student information literacy skills is also warranted with consideration of the needs and limitations of students, faculty and programs in order for information literacy programs to be successful...|$|E
