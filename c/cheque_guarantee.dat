50|$|In 2001, {{with the}} {{abolition}} of Eurocheques in Germany and other European countries, the <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> system also ended in those countries and many retailers stopped accepting cheques altogether. In 2011 {{after many years of}} decline, the Payments Council ended the UK <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> system, leaving Ireland as the last country to still operate a <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card scheme.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980 <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{cards were}} often {{combined}} with ATM cards for convenience. Usage of <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> system declined significantly during the 1990s {{with the introduction}} of debit cards.|$|E
5000|$|UBA is {{the first}} Nigerian Bank to {{introduce}} a <b>Cheque</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Scheme - the first <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card {{in the history of}} innovative banking services by any Bank in Nigeria, known as UBACARD in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|A cashier's {{check or}} cheque is a <b>cheque</b> <b>{{guaranteed}}</b> by a bank, {{drawn on the}} bank's own funds and signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks are treated as guaranteed funds because the bank, rather than the purchaser, is responsible for paying the amount. They are commonly required for real estate and brokerage transactions.|$|R
50|$|Insurance is {{restricted}} to registered member institutions, and covers only the first $100,000 in very specific categories of accounts, such as savings accounts and <b>chequing</b> accounts, <b>guaranteed</b> investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money orders, travellers' cheques and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, {{there were}} 1.4 million valid <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards in Ireland; however, just 45% of debit cards and 39% of ATM cards held the <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> function. The Irish <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme covered sums {{of up to}} €130 per cheque. In 2010, the average value of a written cheque was €5,000, and only 1.5% of all cheques were used in {{conjunction}} with a guarantee card. Between 2007 and 2010, cheque usage decreased by 30%. In lights of these statistics, the Irish Paper Clearing Company announced in December 2010 that Ireland <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card scheme would cease on 31 December 2011 thus bringing the last such scheme in the world to an end.|$|E
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of debit cards there was a rapid decline {{in the use of}} <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards and these facilities were generally phased out in the countries that operated them during the 2000s. The Irish <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme officially ended on 31 December 2011, ending the last such scheme in existence.|$|E

5000|$|The UK Payments Council from 30 June 2011 {{withdrew the}} {{existing}} <b>Cheque</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Card Scheme in the UK. [...] This service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at point of sales up {{to a certain}} value, normally £50 or £100, when signed in front of the retailer with the additional <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card. This was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of debit cards.|$|E
50|$|Historically, bank cards {{have also}} served {{the purpose of}} a <b>cheque</b> <b>{{guarantee}}</b> card, a now almost defunct system to guarantee cheques at point of sale.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} move of the Payments Council, in 2009, was {{to agree to}} a target of 2018 for the closure of cheque {{clearing}} in the UK. It also announced that the <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card scheme would end in June 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Debit cards {{can also}} allow instant {{withdrawal}} of cash, {{acting as the}} ATM card, and as a <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card. Merchants can also offer [...] "cashback"/"cashout" [...] facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. Merchants usually do not charge a fee for purchases by debit card.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the select}} committee, Ruffley has opposed the Payments Council's plans to {{withdraw}} personal cheques by 2018, {{saying that it}} 'scared the pants off Middle England', accusing the Council of 'rank incompetence', and calling for the Council's chairman to resign. [...] He has also criticised the withdrawal of <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards in July 2011, saying that the public were not given sufficient warning.|$|E
50|$|Laser was {{launched}} by the Irish banks in 1996 {{as an extension of}} the existing ATM and <b>Cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card systems that had existed for many years. When the service was added, it became possible to make payments with a multifunctional card that combined ATM, cheque and debit card and international ATM facilities through MasterCard Cirrus or Visa Plus and sometimes the British Link ATM system. Their functionality was similar to the British Switch card.|$|E
50|$|Check {{verification}} {{services have}} been most common in the United States, in Europe a <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> system operated {{for a number of}} years that could be used by merchants until the usage of cheques declined to the point where it was no longer necessary. Outside the US the decline in check usage in favour of debit cards and credit cards has meant that cheques are rarely accepted by merchants anymore and so cheque verification services have not been needed.|$|E
50|$|In 1969 <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{cards were}} {{introduced}} in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honoured when used at a point of sale. The drawer would sign the cheque {{in front of the}} retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number {{on the back of the}} cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by debit cards, starting in the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|Barclays {{were the}} only major British {{clearing}} bank not to issue <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards, instead allowing its customers to guarantee cheques with their Barclaycard (on the basis that if a customer was creditworthy for a Barclaycard they were also good for issuing cheques). This practice ended in 1985, {{with the introduction of}} relaxed lending rules, and the introduction of the debit card Barclays Connect, however, it was still possible to guarantee Barclays Bank cheques using a Barclaycard well into the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|An {{identification}} card issued by a retailer allowing the holder to tender payment by check. Such cards were commonly issued in the United States by supermarkets and other retailers before {{the widespread use}} of debit cards. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, such cards were known as <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards. In the United States, the term check card was first coined by H. Robert Heller, then the President of VISA Inc. to indicate to users that it could be used just like a check.|$|E
5000|$|Switch was {{launched}} in 1988 by Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland as a multifunction <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> and cash card. The brand was merged with Maestro, an international debit card brand owned by MasterCard, in late 2002. This merger {{was referred to as}} the [...] "penguin wedding," [...] due to its distinctive advertisements of penguins in different international settings created by Joel Veitch. Since then, Switch has been out of circulation and banks migrated customers from Switch to Maestro.|$|E
50|$|Eurocheques were {{particularly}} popular in German-speaking countries, {{where they were}} often issued as standard domestic cheques. They usually had {{to be accompanied by}} a <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card in order to be accepted in payment at a point of sale. The Eurocheque guarantee card also had the functionality of an ATM card. In some countries, such as Austria and Germany, virtually all Eurocheque cards were co-branded with the logo of the respective domestic debit card system and were actually debit cards. After its phase-out, virtually all of these Eurocheque cards were replaced by Maestro cards. Therefore, Maestro is very often considered to be the successor to the Eurocheque system.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the scheme}} was first trialled in 1965 and fully {{introduced}} in 1969, with {{a limit of}} £30. The limit was increased to £50 in 1977 and then to £100 or £250, at the bank's discretion, in 1989. [...] the scheme was only used to guarantee 7% of the 1.4 billion cheques issued each year, a figure which itself is declining due to the popularity of other means of payment such as debit cards. The Payments Council therefore announced a decision in September 2009 to withdraw the <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme on 30 June 2011, and the scheme has now been closed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{card was}} {{essentially}} an abbreviated portable {{letter of credit}} granted by a bank to a qualified depositor {{in the form of}} a plastic card that was used in conjunction with a cheque. This allowed retailers to accept cheques and providing that the retailer wrote the card number on the back of the cheque, it was signed in the retailer's presence, and the retailer verified the signature on the cheque against the signature on the card, then the cheque could not be stopped and payment could not be refused by the bank. This arrangement worked only for cheques drawn on an account provided by the bank that issued the card and could result in an overdraft with penalty interest.|$|E
5000|$|In Ireland, Laser, {{which was}} co-branded with Maestro, has been {{replaced}} by Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard. The Laser debit card has been phased out by all banks and ceased to operate from March 2014. Irish Laser cards carried Maestro co-branding from 2008 onwards. They were intended to be used with chip and PIN POS systems. The chip on the card was programmed with two applications, one for Laser and one for Maestro. POS transactions were normally processed over the Laser network in Ireland and the Maestro network when the card was used abroad. Some POS terminals prompted users to manually select Laser or Maestro before completing the transaction. Laser cards could be processed as Maestro in most POS terminals worldwide for chip and PIN or swipe and sign transactions (where still accepted). Internet and telephone-based retailers, however, needed to be set up specifically to accept Irish Laser/Maestro cards. Transactions made with these cards were often secured by MasterCard's SecureCode system to verify the cardholder's identity. These cards were usually multi-functional and operated as a debit card as well as an ATM Card which could be used for accessing ATMs. Some banks also allowed customers to use their cards to deposit or withdraw money over the counter or at An Post post offices using their debit card and PIN. Historically the cards often contained a <b>Cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> card function indicated by a hologram. This scheme was shut down in 2011. Foreign-issued Maestro cards are still accepted in Ireland in ATMs and by many POS machines. However, acceptance of Visa and MasterCard debit/credit cards is more reliably universal at POS terminals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{deception}} must be {{the operative}} cause of the obtaining of property, {{and this is a}} question of fact for the jury to decide, requiring proof that the victim would not have acted in the same way had they known the truth. In R v Laverty although the defendant put new number plates and a new chassis number on a car, the victim bought the car because he thought Laverty was the owner. There was no proof that the false identification plates were the cause of the obtaining. This would suggest that if the victim admits not caring whether the defendant's representation was true or false, an acquittal must follow. But, in Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Charles, a causal link was implied even though the victim admitted not considering {{the question of whether the}} bank would or would not honour the cheque. Similarly, in R v Talbott (1995) CLR 396 the defendant gave false details and obtained housing benefit. She was actually entitled to the benefit, but causation was established by the fact that the benefit officer would not have paid her if she had known the defendant was lying. This [...] "constructive" [...] deception is necessitated because many shop assistants and officials may be personally indifferent as to whether the defendant is honest or not. To clarify this aspect of the law, the Law Commission recommend the introduction of a specific offence to cover the use of <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> and payment cards to remove the need for any implied representation to affect the mind of the particular person accepting the use of the card. This would identify the bank as the true victim.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques {{are still}} popular, partly because cheques remain {{free of charge}} to {{personal}} customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods, including electronic methods. The vast majority of retailers in the United Kingdom and many in France have not accepted cheques {{as a means of}} payment for several years, and <b>cheque</b> <b>guarantee</b> cards are no longer issued. For example, Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at its UK petrol stations. This was soon followed by other major fuel retailers, such as Texaco, BP, and Total. Asda announced in April 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in the London area, and Boots announced in September 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in Sussex and Surrey. Currys (and other stores in the DSGi group) and WH Smith also no longer accept cheques. Cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past, or at most, a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due (for example, music teachers, driving instructors, children's sports lessons, small shops, schools). The UK Payments Council announced in December 2009 that cheques would be phased out by October 2018, but only if adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. Concerns were expressed, however, by charities and older people, who are still heavy users of cheques, and replacement plans were criticized as open to fraud. [...] It was therefore announced by the UK Payments Council in July 2011 that the cheque would not be eliminated. 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth £472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom in 2016 according to Payments UK.|$|E
