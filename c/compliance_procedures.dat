The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time.

The introduction of pre-filled tax returns clearly simplifies the tax <b>compliance</b> <b>procedure.</b> Before the introduction of pre-filled tax returns for personal income taxpayers in Slovenia, tax legislation was also modified. This paper presents the results of research into the compliance costs for personal income taxpayers before and after the simplification of the <b>compliance</b> <b>procedure</b> in Slovenia, irrespective of tax legislation itself not being simplified. The results indicate that pre-filled tax returns reduce compliance costs for personal income taxpayers by around 73 %. Nevertheless, this is only a tentative estimate, since several assumptions are taken into account. compliance costs, personal income tax, pre-filled tax return, Slovenia...|$|R

Next, the effects of rationales (statements that describe why a child should comply with a caregiver-delivered instruction) were evaluated.

In Experiment 2, 3 additional participants received more practical rationales immediately before the therapist’s instruction. The results indicate that rationales were ineffective for all 6 children. A guided <b>compliance</b> <b>procedure</b> increased <b>compliance</b> for 1 child; contingent access to preferred items with or without response cost increased compliance for the other participants.
