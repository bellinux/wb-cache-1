2500|$|In 1789, {{due to a}} lack {{of trade}} in the Darlington flax mills, Murray and his family moved to Leeds to work for John Marshall, who was to become a {{prominent}} flax manufacturer. John Marshall had rented a small mill at Adel, for the purpose of manufacture but also to develop a pre-existing flax-spinning machine, with the aid of Matthew Murray. After some trial and error, to overcome the problem of breakages in the flax twine during the spinning of the flax, sufficient improvements were made to enable John Marshall to undertake the construction of a new mill at Holbeck in 1791, Murray was in charge of the installation. The installation included new flax-spinning machines of his own design, which Murray patented in 1790. In 1793 Murray took out a second patent on a design for [...] "Instruments and Machines for Spinning Fibrous Materials". His patent included a <b>carding</b> <b>engine</b> and a spinning machine that introduced the new technique of [...] "wet spinning" [...] flax, which revolutionised the flax trade.|$|E
50|$|Sir Richard Arkwright (22 December 1732 - 3 August 1792) was an English {{inventor}} and {{a leading}} entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution. Although his patents were eventually overturned, he is credited with inventing the spinning frame, which following the transition to water power was renamed the water frame. He also patented a rotary <b>carding</b> <b>engine</b> that transformed raw cotton into cotton lap.|$|E
50|$|He married Sarah Moss on 23 February 1747, at Leigh Parish Church. Five {{years after}} his marriage, he became {{interested}} in cotton-spinning machinery and between 1763 and 1764, he worked to produce a spinning engine with John Kay, a clockmaker, who was a close neighbour of his at the time. Between 1766 and 1767 he discovered the method of spinning by rollers similar to that patented by Lewis Paul and John Wyatt and employed John Kay {{to help him with}} the construction of the mechanism.It is undisputed that he invented a perpetual <b>carding</b> <b>engine</b> in 1773, and invented an improved double spinning jenny.|$|E
50|$|When David Bremner {{collated}} his {{survey of}} the Industries of Scotland in 1869, it had five sets of <b>carding</b> <b>engines</b> and employed around 300 people.|$|R
500|$|The Cambrian Mirror {{reported}} that, [...] "There are {{now more}} than 40 <b>carding</b> <b>engines,</b> 18 fulling mills, and nearly 35,000 spindles, constantly in operation in the town and neighbourhood, affording considerable employment to a number of men, who weave the flannel at their own dwellings.|$|R
50|$|The mule frames were {{provided}} by John Hetherington and Sons Ltd. On startup here were 86,868 mule spindles spinning medium counts from American cotton, that was 40's twists and 65 wefts. By 1903, this had increased to 93828, and by 1920, 22,000 doubling spindles had been added.In order to run these spindles in the spinning rooms, the cotton had to be prepared using openers, scutchers, <b>carding</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From {{approximately}} 1748 to 1754, Pinsley Mill in Leominster {{was home}} to one of the Paul-Wyatt cotton mills, the first four cotton mills in the world, employing the spinning machines of Lewis Paul and John Wyatt. The mill was financed by Lancashire native Daniel Bourn, and was partly owned by other men from Lancashire. Bourn introduced his own version of the <b>carding</b> <b>engine</b> to work at this mill, and of the four Paul-Wyatt mills, {{it may have been the}} most successful, as shortly after the fire that destroyed the mill, it was reported that the cotton works [...] "had been viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them." ...|$|E
50|$|Brügelmann {{obtained}} {{a model of}} the Waterframe in 1783. He had already worked unsuccessfully for six years with experts from Siegerland to discover the workings of an Arkwright Carding machine: this made the sliver that was needed for the waterframe. It is unclear whether he got a model of this too, family papers suggest that he smuggled a spinner from Cromford over to Germany, with a collection of the parts needed to reconstruct the <b>carding</b> <b>engine.</b> In a letter to Prince-Elector Karl Theodor of the Palatinate and Bavaria he wrote he had a friend in England who had sent him the parts needed. Though it is possible that he worded this letter carefully, not leaving himself open to charges of Industrial espionage.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhibits}} {{were arranged}} {{to tell the}} story of wool manufacturing. The design was organized around a modular system of floor-to-ceiling posts and panels. The use of silk screens and photographic blow-ups, along with the use of color filled the galleries. The contents of the exhibit illustrated the transition from hand to machine technology in wool manufacturing. A ‘before’ and ‘after’ example was used at each stage in cloth production, from sheep-shearing to cloth-dyeing. The materials shown included artifacts, text blocks, illustrations, models, and replicas. Illustrations outnumbered the 3-dimensional objects by a ratio of 2 to 1. The exhibit contained less than 2 dozen artifacts that illustrated significant developments in textile technology. Among the machines on display were a wool picker, a double cylinder <b>carding</b> <b>engine,</b> a 200 spindle spinning jack, a two-harness plain loom, an automatic bobbin-changing dobby loom and a shearing machine.|$|E
50|$|The union {{represented}} {{a wide range}} of workers in the textile industry, and did not discriminate on the basis of occupation or skill. The core of the union's membership were the strippers and grinders, skilled adult male mechanics, who maintained the <b>carding</b> <b>engines.</b> Almost all strippers and grinders were union members. The CWA also organised less skilled female ring spinners and other mill operatives. From 1904 onwards the only members required to have completed an apprenticeship were the strippers-and-grinders.|$|R

50|$|Raw cotton bales were {{unloaded}} from carts at {{the ground}} floor loading bay. The opening and cleaning machines broke the bales down and prepared the cotton into 'lap' form which {{was taken to the}} third and fourth floor carding rooms, housing three rows of <b>carding</b> <b>engines,</b> over 130. <b>Carding</b> machines disentangle the cotton fibres to produce a long continuous 'sliver'. Sixteen drawing frames, sometimes called lantern frames, straightened the fibres and pulled the 'slivers' into 'rovings' putting in a slight twist so they were ready for spinning. The rovings were coiled into large cans which were taken to the first and second floor.|$|R
50|$|Shudehill is in {{the centre}} of Manchester, near its highest point. Shudehill Mill was built between Miller Street and Angel Street {{to the north of}} Rochdale Road; its site is now a car park. The River Irwell and Mersey had been made navigable to Manchester in the 1720s opening the way for {{importing}} raw cotton and exporting finished cloth and the Bridgewater Canal brought coal from the Worsley Navigable Levels to the Castlefield Basin after 1761. Arkwright had patented a water frame to spin cotton, and in 1775 patented a mechanical <b>carding</b> <b>engine.</b> He took out a second patent that year for drawing and roving. All the pieces were in place for a large automated spinning mill to be built in Manchester. Shudehill Mill, a watermill, was next to a stream, but derived its power from cycling water between two storage ponds, a steam pump was used to replenish the upper pond from the lower.|$|E

5000|$|Lewis Paul {{had invented}} a machine for carding in 1748. Richard Arkwright made {{improvements}} to this machine and in 1775 {{took out a}} patent for a new <b>carding</b> <b>engine,</b> which converted raw cotton buds into a continuous skein of cotton fibres which could then be spun into yarn. Arkwright and John Smalley set up a small horse-driven factory at Nottingham. Needing more capital to expand, Arkwright partnered with Jedediah Strutt and Samuel Need, wealthy hosiery manufacturers, who were nonconformists. In 1771, the partners built the world's first water-powered mill at Cromford, employing 200 people mainly women and children. Arkwright spent £12,000 perfecting his machine, which contained the [...] "crank and comb" [...] for removing the cotton web from carding engines. He had mechanised all the preparatory and spinning processes, {{and he began to}} set up water-powered cotton mills as far away as Scotland. His success encouraged many others to copy him, so he had great difficulty in enforcing the patent he was granted in 1775. His spinning frame was a significant technical advance over the spinning jenny of James Hargreaves, in that very little training was required of his operatives, and it produced a strong yarn suitable for the warp of the cloth. Samuel Crompton was later to combine the two to form the spinning mule.|$|E
50|$|The {{local farmers}} would sell their fleeces to the mill, which would wash, card, comb and spin the wool into yarn and then weave it into blankets.The mill was powered by {{water from the}} local stream.In an unusual design, the water wheel is inside the building.The large iron {{overshot}} wheel probably dates to the later part of the 19th century.The water wheel drove hammers that beat the woven cloth to clean and soften it.Later the water wheel drove leather belts that powered the <b>carding</b> <b>engines</b> and looms. This equipment has been preserved in the old section of the mill.|$|R

50|$|John Kennedy {{was born}} in 1769 in Knocknalling, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. In 1784 he moved to Chowbent, near Leigh in Lancashire, to be apprenticed to William Cannan, {{the son of a}} {{neighbour}} of the Kennedys. His training covered the manufacture of textile machinery including <b>carding</b> <b>engines,</b> jennies, and water frames. On the completion of his apprenticeship in 1791, he moved to Manchester and went into a long-lasting partnership with James McConnel, a nephew and former apprentice of Cannan, to manufacture textile machinery and undertake cotton spinning. Benjamin and William Sandford provided the financial backing. Kennedy was a skilled and inventive engineer and is credited with devising a crucial improvement to fine-spinning machinery, called double speed, which enabled much finer thread to be manufactured.|$|R

However, the concentrations of medium and fine sized dust particles were not always reduced and were actually increased in some places. In one mill, when the new control system had been running for three years, there was found to be no reduction in the prevalence of non-specific chest symptoms, and there was {{an increase in the number}} of those with chest tightness on Mondays, a symptom characteristic of byssinosis. Evidence is given of a similar failure to reduce the dust sufficiently in three other mills where the same exhaust system is installed...|$|R

50|$|The {{partnership}} between Benjamin Wright and Ralph Bagley {{was based on}} friendship as well as business acumen. In the mid-1860s, the textile industry in Lancashire was undergoing one of its periods of rapid growth. The American Civil War that started in 1861, and caused the Lancashire Cotton Famine cotton towns, ended in 1865. Despite the famine {{during the first half}} of the decade, recovery afterwards was rapid and the cotton industry responded with a period of exuberant growth. For anyone with the necessary skills, knowledge and acceptance of risk, this was a time when entering into business was relatively easy. Budding entrepreneurs could rent 'space and power' from a mill owner operating as a commercial landlord. In many cases the entrepreneur would rent a floor of a mill which was served by line shafting powered by a steam engine somewhere else in the building. The floor might already have machinery (spinning mules, <b>carding</b> <b>engines</b> or looms) installed or he might have approached a cotton machinery manufacturer who would rent or lease the machinery to him. If up-front cash was a problem, the banks were likely to oblige with a loan.|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} centuries saw {{the growth}} of weaving and flannel production. This was essentially a cottage industry, and the local products were sent to market in Shrewsbury. Towards {{the end of the}} 18th century, Llanidloes was the largest producer in Montgomeryshire, but after about 1810, with the introduction of factories, which brought all the processes under one roof, Newton gradually overtook Llanidloes as the main centre. Some of the three-storey houses with brick façades of this period would have housed weaving lofts on the upper storey Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of 1833 noted that there were forty <b>carding</b> <b>engines,</b> eighteen fulling mills and thirty-five thousand spindles [...]. affording considerable employment in Llanidloes. But the new technology was far from profitable, and the factory system led to increasing unrest, which culminated in the Chartist riots in 1839. Newtown, connected to the Montgomeryshire Canal in 1819, soon became the centre of the flannel industry in Wales with the opening of its Flannel Exchange in 1832. Llanidloes followed suit in 1838 when former Public Rooms in Great Oak Street were built by a local consortium as a Flannel Exchange; but this only lasted a few years, although Llanidloes flannel was regarded as of the better quality. Some owners, particularly Thomas Jones, who owned the Cambrian and Spring Mills, struggled to promote the Llanidloes flannel industry, but by 1913 the last mill had closed.|$|R
