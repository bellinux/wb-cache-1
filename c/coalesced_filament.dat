40|$|The next {{generation}} of high field magnets for fusion and accelerator applications requires the development of Nb 3 Sn strand with significantly higher critical current densities. Our recent work has shown that when the specific pinning force is normalized to the grain boundary density (the primary pinning site in this material), a strong increase in pinning force is observed for high Sn content strand, suggesting a strong compositional dependency for pinning in this material. In this study we use advanced FESEM techniques to quantify the compositional and microstructural variations to a sub- 100 nm level. A stepped compositional and microstructural variation was observed across a bronze-processed Nb 3 Sn filaments with sharp interfaces for both Cu(Sn) -Nb 3 Sn and Nb 3 Sn-Nb. Microstructural variation was observed {{on the scale of}} the original filaments in high Sn, MJR but not across the <b>coalesced</b> <b>filament</b> mass. A very high microstructural uniformity was observed in a PIT monofilament. Thus a major influence of Sn appears to be exerted through its influence on the composition gradient...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} laser beams carrying phase singularity in media with cubic-quintic nonlinearity is studied. In such media {{can be generated}} not only localized vortex solitons but also a novel kind of stable nonlocalized optical vortices. Stability in the defocusing regime is confirmed numerically. In the focusing regime such a vortex breaks into filaments. Dynamics of a singular Gaussian beam is investigated. Numerical simulations show a new behavior of the supercritical Gaussian beam which first breaks into <b>filaments</b> <b>coalescing</b> after. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|In this work, {{the genes}} that encode the FliM and FliN {{proteins}} of Rhodobacter sphaeroides were characterized. These genes {{are part of a}} large flagellar gene cluster in which six additional open reading frames encoding products homologous to FliL, FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, and FlhB proteins from other bacteria were identified. The inactivation of the fliM gene gave a nonflagellate phenotype (Fla 2), suggesting that FliM is required for flagellar assembly. Complementation analysis of this fliM mutant indicated that fliM and fliN transcription starts beyond the 5 * end of fliK and terminates after fliN. Flagellar rotation alternates between the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions in some peritrichous species, like Escherichia coli. When flagella rotate in the CCW direction, the <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce</b> in a bundle that acts as a propeller to push the bacterial cell body in a linear trajectory known as smooth swim. When the flagella reverse their direc-tion of rotation, the bundle flies apart and the bacteria tumble; tumbling occurs every 2 to 5 s. In the presence of an attractant, the tumble frequency decreases and bacteria swim in the fa...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the membrane of cell organelles appearing in the atypical spermatid of Cipangopaludina malleata Reeve has been studied in thin sections by an electron microscope. The porous structure has been revealed in {{the wall of the}} flattened sacculus consisting the Golgi complex. The walls are calculated 35 A thick. The mitochondria consist of a small number of tubules and an osmiophilic matrix. The mitochondria represent a complex system of tubules projected from the inner layer of the limiting membrane, and the tubules consist of double dense mcmbrans involving a less dense interspace. The mitochondria aggregated along the developing tail <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce</b> to form an elongated mass of relatively large size. The limiting membrane of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum appears apparcntly to be a single layer, which makes its appearance in the area where the tail filaments devlop. The smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum is bordcrcd by a double layercd membrane consisting two opaque layers with a less opaque interspace. The vesicles containing dense granules, which represent the smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, migrate to the cell periphery. The smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum scems to function as an intraccllular conductor. 博士（医学）・第 88 号・昭和 36 年 2 月 7...|$|R
40|$|The non-Cu {{critical}} current density of Nb 3 Sn strands {{has been pushed}} towards 3000 A/mm (12 T, 4. 2 K) by increasing the Sn content and reducing the interfilamentary Cu. We compare the susceptibility to A 15 filament breakage (under 0. 5 % bend strain) of the new high-J c internal Sn conductor geometries with both high-J c Powder-in-Tube (PIT) and low hysteresis loss distributed filament ITER designs. In all but the PIT designs, there was significant filament breakage on the tensile side of the strand cross-section with little if any evidence for cracking on the compressive side. Where there is significant inter-filamentary Cu remaining after reaction the highest frequency of A 15 filament breakage is observed {{at the edges of}} the filament packs. This suggests that the breakage is most likely to occur where filaments receive less mechanical support from the filament-Cu matrix. In very high J c strands, where individual Nb <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce</b> into large A 15 tubes during reaction, breakage can occur across the entire sub-element. In the PIT design composite, filament breakage did not occur at 0. 5 % bend strain. At 0. 6 % bend strain the PIT filaments cracked in both the tensile and compressive regions...|$|R
40|$|A cold {{electron}} beam propagating through a background plasma {{is subject to}} filamentation process due to theWeibel instability. If the initial beam radius is large compared with the electron skin depth and the beam density is {{much smaller than the}} background plasma density, multiple filaments merge many times. Because of this non-adiabatic process, the beam perpendicular energy of initially cold beam grows until all <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce</b> into one pinched beam with the beam radius much smaller than initial radius and smaller than the electron skin depth. It was shown through particle-in-cell simulations that a significant fraction of the beam is not pinched by the magnetic forces of the pinched beam and fills most of the plasma region. The resulting {{electron beam}} energy distribution in the perpendicular direction is close to a Maxwellian for the bulk electrons. However, there are significant departures from a Maxwellian for low and high perpendicular energy (deeply trapped and untrapped electrons). An analytical model is developed describing the density profile of the resulting pinched beam and large low-density halo around it. Based on this analytical model, a calculation of the energy transfer from the beam longitudinal kinetic energy to the transverse beam kinetic energy, the self-magnetic field, and the plasma electrons is performed. Results of analytical theory agree well with the particle-in-cell simulations results. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent fluid flows {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a superior means of diluting ini-tial concentrations of scalars due to rapid stirring. Conversely, experiments {{have shown that the}} structures responsible for this rapid dilution can also aggregate ini-tially distant reactive scalars and thereby greatly enhance reaction rates. Indeed, chaotic flows not only enhance dilution by shearing and stretching, but also organize initially distant scalars along transiently attracting regions in the flow. To show the robustness of this phenomenon, a hierarchical set of three numerical flows is used: the periodic wake downstream of a stationary cylinder, a chaotic double gyre flow, and a chaotic, aperiodic flow consisting of interacting Taylor vortices. We demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures, as identified by ridges in finite time Lyapunov expo-nents, are directly responsible for this coalescence of reactive scalar filaments. When highly concentrated <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce,</b> reaction rates can be orders of magnitude greater than would be predicted in a well-mixed system. This is further supported by an idealized, analytical model that was developed to quantify the competing ef-fects of scalar dilution and coalescence. Chaotic flows, known for their ability to efficiently dilute scalars, therefore have the competing effect of organizing initially distant scalars along the LCS at timescales shorter than that required for dilution, resulting in reaction enhancement.

40|$|That rising bubbles may {{significantly}} affect magma mixing paths {{has already been}} demon strated by analogue experiments. Here, for the first time, bubble-advection experiments are performed employing volcanic melts at magmatic temperatures. Cylinders of basaltic glass were placed below cylinders of rhyolite glass. Upon melting, interstitial air formed bubbles that rose into the rhyolite melt, thereby entraining tails of basaltic liquid. The formation of plume-like filaments of advected basalt within the rhyolite was characterized by microCT and subsequent high-resolution EMP analyses. Melt entrainment by bubble ascent {{appears to be an}} efficient mechanism for mingling volcanic melts of highly contrasting compositions and properties. MicroCT imaging reveals bubbles trailing each other and multiple <b>filaments</b> <b>coalescing</b> into bigger ones. Rheological modelling of the filaments yields viscosities of up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than for the surrounding rhyolitic liquid. Such a viscosity contrast implies that bubbles rising successively are likely to follow this pathway of low resistance that previously ascending bubbles have generated. Filaments formed by multiple bubbles would thus experience episodic replenishment with mafic material. Inevitable implications for the concept of bubble advection in magma mixing include thereby both an acceleration of mixing because of decreased viscous resistance for bubbles inside filaments and non-conventional diffusion systematics because of intermittent supply of mafic material (instead of a single pulse) inside a material. Inside the filaments, the mafic material was variably hybridised to andesitic through rhyolitic composition. Compositional profiles alone are ambiguous, however, to determine whether single or multiple bubbles were involved during formation of a filament. Statistical analysis, employing concentration variance as measure of homogenisation, demonstrates that also filaments appearing as single-bubble filaments are likely to have experienced multiple bubbles passages. In cases where bubbles have been essential for magma mixing, standard diffusion analysis may thus be inadequate for constraining timescales. However, data analysis employing concentration variance relaxation permits the distinction of conventional single-pulse filaments from multiple bubble ascent advection in natural samples, demonstrating yet another powerful application of this novel petrological tool...|$|R
40|$|Using {{specific}} anti-β keratin {{and general}} anti-α keratin antibodies, keratins {{were located in}} the epidermis of the alligator during the final developmental stages by ultrastructural and immunocytochemical methods. The maturation of the bilayered periderm (= embryonic epidermis) coincides with the disappearance of cell organelles, including the 25 – 35 -nm-thick coarse <b>filaments,</b> and the <b>coalescing</b> of α-keratin <b>filaments</b> into a compact mass. The plasmalemma of peridermal cells forms a 15 – 25 -nm-thick electron-dense corneous envelope. These changes start at stage 25, about 3 weeks before hatching, and continue until hatching when the embryonic epidermis is shed. Immature β-keratogenic cells beneath the embryonic epidermis accumulate immunolabelled β-filaments which are packed into thin, electron-pale β-keratogenic cells in the corneous layer. Together, electron-pale and electron-dense materials form a compact 3 – 4 -nm filament pattern of β-keratin. Melanosomes from epidermal melanocytes, incorporated into β-cells, give rise to the banded skin pattern of hatchlings. β-keratin production is much reduced in the hinge regions, where many α-filaments remain packed together with lipid droplets or mucous granules into thinner, more electron-dense, α-cells. The keratinaceous material of the α-cells is mostly concentrated along the cell membrane, while the lipid/mucous material remains centrally located, as in sebokeratinocytes of the apteric areas of avian skin. Some lipid and mucus is also incorporated into typical β-cells of the outer scale surface, so that lipids {{are part of the}} fully keratinized hard keratin layer of the alligator. Lipids within β-cells of outer scale surfaces and α-cells of the hinge region are probably responsible for limiting water loss and ion movements across the skin. Neither typical mammalian keratohyalin granules nor lepidosaurian keratohyalin-like granules were detected anywhere in alligator epidermis. The combination of anti-β and anti-α keratin antibodies revealed different distributions of β- and α-keratins. In late embryonic stages (25 – 26 to hatching), β-keratin occurs only in the upper suprabasal cells, in prekeratinized and keratinized layers, whereas α-keratin bundles (tonofilaments) remain only in the lowest layers. The cross-reactivity of the β-antibody, produced against a chick scale keratin, further shows that avian and crocodilian hard (β) keratins share common antigenic sites, reflecting a phylogenetic affinity between these taxa...|$|R
40|$|Life is an {{ensemble}} of countless emerging properties arising through self-assembly and self-organization phenomena, manifesting at the cellular, the tissue and the organismal level. The mechanical integrity {{of a cell}} is orchestrated by the cytoskeleton, a dynamic system comprised of three biopolymers, actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments, acting in symphony, facilitated by a plethora of accessory proteins. Understanding the cytoskeletal functionality {{and its relation to}} other cellular components and properties is a prominent question in biophysics. Actin, a dynamic and polymorphic component, forms a variety of structures such as filaments, bundles, and their networks. The unique viscoelastic properties shown by actin-based structures have been extensively probed via rheological means. On the contrary, the underlying microstructural dynamics remain mostly uncovered. Actin bundles are crucial for eukaryotic cells; they are involved in the intracellular transport, contractive forces, mechanical stability, cell motility and environment exploration. This thesis takes a step forward to fathom the rich dynamics and emergent properties exhibited by actin bundles within flow-free confinements, a prerequisite for the study. To study a reversible reaction sequence in a step-by-step manner, one needs an open system. As a result, there have been relatively few studies in this direction, as most of the experimental systems are closed, for instance, sealed coverslips or liposomes. We created a straightforward microfluidic system, consisting of quasi two-dimensional, cell-sized compartments, enclosing sub-picolitre volumes. These `microchambers' are connected to the controlling channel (the reservoir) via narrow connecting channels, allowing exclusive diffusive transport {{into and out of the}} microchambers. The system represents an ideal environment to form an entangled network of actin filaments in a steady-state and is manipulable in a step-by-step fashion. We induce bundling of actin filaments in three ways: counterion condensation aided by magnesium ions, depletion interactions mimicked by polyethylene glycol, acting as a crowding agent, and specific interactions with actin exhibited by filamin, an actin binding protein. Above the critical concentration of bundling agents, actin filaments transform into an emerging network of actin bundles, a process associated with percolation, leading to a single connected entity. Sharing of filaments is an important parameter for the observed behaviour, as reducing the actin filament length exclusively forms bundles without percolation. We encounter a hierarchical process of bundling: <b>filaments</b> <b>coalesce</b> into small bundles that further fuse to form bigger bundles. Disassembly involves a similar hierarchy, additionally involving peeling-off of single filaments. We explore the reactions using time-lapse image analyses and apply kinetic models. Counterion condensation forms a network comprising of straight, rigid bundles facilitated by a zipping process (v 12 µm/s), generating tension within the network. Disassembly leads to the release of the stored energy, utilized in the buckling of bundles, enabling us to estimate 100 - 200 kT of stored energy. Crowding agents force the actin filaments to form an intriguing spindle-like structure, consisting of poles with sets of aligned filaments shared and stretched between them, which further transforms into a network of bundles. The disassembly constitutes the reversal of the process. Filamin forms ring-like networks, containing intrinsically curved bundles. Owing to the highly specific interactions, the network does not disassemble, even after 12 hours. In essence, using a bottom-up approach, we explore the emerging properties of actin bundles, with an emphasis on their dynamics...|$|R
