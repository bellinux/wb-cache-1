40|$|The Atlantic marine {{incursion}} (5000 - 2300 B. C.) deposited sands and clays in {{the western}} Netherlands at a level about 4 metres below mean sea-level which could be easily studied in the Haarlemmermeer Polder. Some incursions and their sediments were traced in the terrain (Old Holocene sand, Hoofddorp deposits, Old Marine clay and Beinsdorp deposits); a small regression period allowed soil formation (decalcification on the Hoofddorp deposits). In the Subboreal and Subatlantic period, peat started to grow {{on top of the}} marine deposits, interrupted by marine incursions; in Medieval times the peat was eroded and three lakes were formed, which afterwards coalesced into one great lake. This lake threatened to destroy the central part of Holland together with the town of Amsterdam and was finally pumped out and reclaimed in 1853. Granular composition and CaCO 3 content determined suitability for crop production. The eroded peat was deposited as peat detritus in many places. There the topsoils were black and N manuring was not necessary, because of good nitrification. Sugarbeet produced less sugar on these soils. Apart from this, <b>cat</b> <b>clay</b> formation (causing low pH values) and seepage (mainly saline) were studied. Often deep trenching or deep ploughing was necessary to get a calcareous topsoil. <p/...|$|E

50|$|Richard Lieber Log Cabin, {{also known}} as the Old Log Cabin, is a {{historic}} log cabin located at Turkey Run State Park in Sugar Creek Township, Parke County, Indiana. It was built in 1848, and completely rebuilt in 1918. It is a one-story, hewn poplar log structure with a side-gable roof. It has a frame ell. The original log structure measures 30 feet wide and 20 feet deep and features a <b>cat</b> and <b>clay</b> chimney.|$|R
5000|$|One of her most-known works, {{entitled}} Radioactive <b>Cats,</b> features green-painted <b>clay</b> <b>cats</b> running amok {{in a gray}} kitchen. An {{older man}} {{sits in a chair}} with his back facing the camera while his elderly wife looks into a refrigerator that is the same color as the walls. Her 1990 work, [...] "Fox Games has a similar feel to Radioactive Cats";it unleashes the imagination of the viewer is allowed to roam freely. A third and final oft-recognized piece by her features numerous fish hovering above people in bed late at night and is called Revenge of the Goldfish. The piece was used as cover art for the Inspiral Carpets album of the same name.|$|R
50|$|The {{source of}} {{contamination}} was later {{found to be a}} barrel that exploded on February 14 because contractors at Los Alamos National Laboratory packed it with organic cat litter instead of <b>clay</b> <b>cat</b> litter. Other barrels with the same problem were then sealed in larger containers.|$|R
50|$|Clumping <b>clay</b> <b>cat</b> litters {{are natural}} products. Nevertheless, {{they may also}} contain {{naturally}} occurring crystalline silica, or silica dust, which in California is treated as a known carcinogen under Proposition 65. Clay litter is also criticized by the more expensive manufacturers of non-clay litter as being commonly produced in a strip mine in an environmentally degrading process.|$|R

50|$|The Dutch Dongen Formation {{correlates}} with the Belgian Ieper Group and Zenne Group. All of these units are marine sands and <b>clay</b> <b>cats</b> from the Ypresian (55.8 - 48.6 million years ago) and Lutetian (48.6 - 40.4 million years ago) ages, when the eustatic sea level was relatively high after the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. The sea level {{was so high}} that the North Sea was connected with the Paris Basin {{to the south and}} all of the Netherlands and most of Belgium and northern France was covered by shallow seas.|$|R
50|$|A major use of sawdust is for particleboard; coarse sawdust may be {{used for}} wood pulp. Sawdust has a variety of other {{practical}} uses, including serving as a mulch, as an alternative to <b>clay</b> <b>cat</b> litter, or as a fuel. Until the advent of refrigeration, it was often used in icehouses to keep ice frozen during the summer. It has been used in artistic displays, and as scatter in miniature railroad and other models. It is also sometimes used to soak up liquid spills, allowing the spill to be easily collected or swept aside. As such, it was formerly common on barroom floors. It is used to make Cutler's resin. Mixed with water and frozen, it forms pykrete, a slow-melting, much stronger form of ice.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{opens with}} the latest poem of Maxwell H. Brock, after which the cast arrives on stage {{inviting}} the [...] "squares" [...] into this world, and introducing many of the lead players ("The Bucket of Blood"). After taking hearing the poem, and taking abuse from the regulars and his boss, Leonard ("Walter, You're a Busboy") socially awkward busboy Walter Paisley returns home to {{attempt to create a}} sculpture of the face of the hostess Carla, whom he has a crush on ("I Know That I'm An Artist"). Despite his best efforts, his sculpture fails. He stops when he hears the meowing of Frankie, the cat owned by his inquisitive landlady, Mrs. Surchart, who has somehow gotten himself stuck in Walter's wall. Walter attempts to get Frankie out using a knife, but accidentally kills the cat when he sticks the knife into his wall. Disgusted with himself, Walter cries himself to sleep and has a maniacal dream sequence in which he remembers the torments of the day and ends with the poetry of Brock pour through his tormented mind, giving him a radical inspiration. Instead of giving Frankie a proper burial, Walter covers the <b>cat</b> in <b>clay,</b> leaving the knife stuck in it. ("Busboy Reprise") ...|$|R
25|$|Yorishiro are, however, most {{numerous}} in people's homes. During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with kadomatsu, {{which are}} the yorishiro of the new year's kami. Kamifuda, pieces of paper representing the kami, are hung above the door. There are kami who dwell in the toilet (benjō-gami) and in the well (suijin). The kamado-gami lives in the oven, and its function {{is to protect the}} house from fires. Other common yorishiro are the small altar called kamidana and the butsudan, which is an altar for the dead. (Butsudan were originally meant just for Buddhist worship, but now often contain also spirit tablets called ihai, which are yorishiro used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors). In shops one often sees <b>clay</b> <b>cats</b> with a raised paw called maneki-neko or rake-like bamboo objects called kumade supposed to attract good business.|$|R
50|$|One {{night after}} hearing the words of Maxwell H. Brock (Julian Burton), a poet who {{performs}} at The Yellow Door cafe, the dimwitted, impressionable, busboy Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) returns home to {{attempt to create a}} sculpture of the face of the hostess Carla (Barboura Morris). He stops when he hears the meowing of Frankie, the cat owned by his inquisitive landlady, Mrs. Surchart (Myrtle Vail), who has somehow gotten himself stuck in Walter's wall. Walter attempts to get Frankie out using a knife, but accidentally kills the cat when he sticks the knife into his wall. Instead of giving Frankie a proper burial, Walter covers the <b>cat</b> in <b>clay,</b> leaving the knife stuck in it.The next morning, Walter shows the cat to Carla and his boss Leonard (Antony Carbone). Leonard dismisses the oddly morbid piece, but Carla is enthusiastic about the work and convinces Leonard to display it in the café. Walter receives praise from Will (John Brinkley) and the other beatniks in the café. An adoring fan, Naolia (Jhean Burton), gives him a vial of heroin to remember her by. Naively ignorant of its function, he takes it home and is followed by Lou Raby (Bert Convy), an undercover cop, who attempts to take him into custody for narcotics possession. In a blind panic, thinking Lou is about to shoot him, Walter hits him with the frying pan he is holding, killing Lou instantly.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} changes in anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, and testosterone following a low–energy-density dietary intervention plus regimented supplementation program. MethodsThe study design was a pre-post intervention design without a control group. Normal participants were recruited from the faculty, staff, students, and community members from a chiropractic college to participate in a 21 -day weight loss program. All participants (n = 49; 36 women, 13 men; 31 ± 10. 3 years of age) received freshly prepared mostly vegan meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) that included 1200 to 1400 daily calories (5020. 8 to 5857. 6 J) for the women and 1600 to 1800 (6694. 4 to 7531. 2 J) daily calories for the men. Nutritional supplements containing enzymes that were intended to facilitate digestion, reduce cholesterol levels, increase metabolic rate, and mediate inflammatory processes were consumed 30 minutes before each meal. The regimented supplementation program included once-daily supplementation with a green drink that contained alfalfa, wheatgrass, apple cider vinegar, and fulvic acid throughout the study period. A cleanse supplementation containing magnesium, chia, flaxseed, lemon, camu camu, <b>cat's</b> claw, bentonite <b>clay,</b> tumeric, pau d'arco, chanca piedra, stevia, zeolite clay, slippery elm, garlic, ginger, peppermint, aloe, citrus bioflavonoids, and fulvic acid was added before each meal during week 2. During week 3, the cleanse supplementation was replaced with probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. ResultsMultiple paired t tests detected clinically meaningful reductions in weight (− 8. 7 ± 5. 54 lb) (− 3. 9 ± 2. 5 kg), total cholesterol (− 30. 0 ± 29. 77 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (− 21. 0 ± 25. 20 mg/dL) (P <. 05). There was a pre-post intervention increase in testosterone for men (111. 0 ± 121. 13 ng/dL, P <. 05). ConclusionsWeight loss and improvements in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurred after a low–energy-density dietary intervention plus regimented supplementation program...|$|R
