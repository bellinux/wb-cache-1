Only one of the electrodes has to be patterned in this way, the other can remain continuous (<b>common</b> <b>electrode).</b> For low information content numerical and alpha-numerical TN-LCDs, like digital watches or calculators, segmented electrodes are sufficient. If more complex data or graphics information have to be displayed, a matrix arrangement of electrodes is used. Obviously, the voltage controlled addressing of matrix displays, such as in LCD-screens for computer monitors or flat television screens, {{is more complex than}} with segmented electrodes. These matrix LCDs necessitate integration of additional non-linear electronic elements into each picture element of the display (e.g., thin-film diodes, TFDs, or thin-film transistors, TFTs) in order to allow the addressing of individual picture elements without crosstalk (unintended activation of non-addressed pixels).|$|E

50|$|The third {{category}} uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are {{the origin of}} a steady electric potential field, which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called Electrooculogram (EOG). If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in {{the orientation of the}} dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the <b>common</b> <b>electrode</b> setup two separate movement components - a horizontal and a vertical - can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel, which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.|$|E

40|$|Key words: PEM fuel cells, {{conventional}} gas distributor, current density distribution, segmented electrode, mathematical modeling * Author to whom correspondence {{should be addressed}} Current density and potential distribution measurements were conducted using a segmented current collector and flow field setup on membrane electrode assemblies prepared with segmented and un-segmented electrodes made from {{two different types of}} commercially available gas diffusion layers. Both galvanostatic and potentiostatic discharge modes were employed. Irrespective of the type of gas diffusion layer, when a <b>common</b> <b>electrode</b> was employed, significant performance variations were encountered between current collector segments in the constant–voltage mode, while the segment to segment variations were minimal in the constant current mode. Both types of discharge modes showed negligible variations between segments in the case of segmented electrode. A simple mathematical model was developed to assist in the interpretation of the experimental results. The differences in contact resistances between the current collectors and the gas diffusion layer, especially on the cathode side have been identified as the primary reason for the experimentally observed behavior. Based on the results presented here, segmenting the electrode along with the current collector is recommended for current distribution studies. When using a <b>common</b> <b>electrode,</b> only the galvanostatic mode is preferred to minimize contact artifacts...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Occupational asthma (OA) can {{be induced}} by fumes of manual metal-arc welding on {{stainless}} steel. In recent years, {{the use of}} special stainless steels (SSS) with high chromium content has increased. This study presents two cases of OA caused by manual metal-arc welding on SSS. In both cases, the diagnosis of OA was based on respiratory symptoms, occupational exposure and positive findings in the specific challenge tests. In the first case, a 46 -yr-old welder had experienced severe dyspnoea while welding SSS (SMO steel), but not in other situations. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a <b>common</b> <b>electrode</b> were negative. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 37 % drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). In the second case, a 34 -yr-old male had started to experience dyspnoea {{during the past few}} years, while welding especially SSS (Duplex steel). The workplace peak expiratory flow monitoring was suggestive of OA. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a <b>common</b> <b>electrode</b> did not cause bronchial obstruction. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 31 % drop in FEV 1. In conclusion, exposure to manual metal-arc welding fumes of special stainless steel should be considered as a new cause of occupational asthma...|$|E
