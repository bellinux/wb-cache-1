40|$|Recent {{research}} on maritime ports hinterlands {{points out the}} relevance of mass ground transport modes such as barge transport for enormous flows of containers to and from harbours, especially when a maritime port {{is located at the}} mouth of a river. Though, the modal share of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007) is significantly lower than elsewhere (32 % in Rotterdam and 33 % in Antwerp). Some reports and studies explain the viscosity of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport flows as a result of several factors, generally concentrated around the seaport community. In continuation of previous seminal works, this paper adopts a neo-institutional approach (Williamson, 1985; 1996) of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport to understand how the factors generating this viscosity are managed. Section 2 describes the characteristics of the transaction of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport. Section 3 is devoted to its attributes (asset specificity, frequency, uncertainty). According to Williamson’s (1996) remediableness criterion, the observed governance structure of a given transaction is presumed efficient and aligned to its attributes.

Discrete event simulation is used to analyze the impact on waiting times and capacity utilization at potential hubs and at sea terminals. The hub scenarios under investigation are the organization of an intermodal barge hub on the right river bank, an intermodal hub on the left river bank, a first multihub scenario with a local collection/distribution network and a potentially improved multihub scenario taking into account the specific structure of the port of Antwerp. The second multihub scenario offers most opportunities for reducing the turnaround time of all inland termi-nals.

40|$|Lots {{of studies}} have been devoted to shipper's modal choices since Baumol and Vinodt (1970) seminal papers. But, surprisingly, whereas {{institutional}} aspects play a determinant part {{in the structure of}} relationships in every supply chain, they are barely taken into account in academic papers (McGinnis, 1989; Jiang, 1998; Henscher and Puckett, 2005; Brooks et al., 2012), particularly regarding transaction costs. Indeed, shippers' modal choices are often characterised by their inertia (Golicic et al, 2003), which cannot be explained without Transaction Costs Economics (or New Institutional Economics, see Ruester, 2010), as developed by Coase (1937) and Williamson (1985; 1996) seminal works. This paper aims at showing that transaction costs are partially responsible for the low modal share of <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007).

This makes <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> transport a new growth area for Hong Kong Port. Traditionally, Hong Kong Port has been the main gateway for containers transported through the Pearl River system, but this advantageous position is under challenge from the adjacent ports in South China, especially from Shenzhen Port, which is keen to take a bigger share of the new growth by improving the access of barges to its port facilities. While services at Shenzhen Port are improving, barge operators have been experiencing high congestion at Hong Kong Port. Improving the quality of barge container services becomes crucial for Hong Kong Port. In this study, we propose and investigate three improvement strategies: to enhance the consolida- tion of small container flows, {{to increase the efficiency}} of berth allocations for barges, and to optimize the overall utilization of port resources in Hong Kong. These strategies can be instrumental for keeping Hong Kong's status as the gateway for the Pearl River system and help maintain its competitiveness as an international shipping hub. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|Containerisation {{has led to}} {{increased}} competition between ports and {{put pressure on the}} use of scarce hinterland infrastructure. Having good coordination between all actors involved in port-related transport, including infrastructural access to the hinterland, is required to be successful in container port competition. In hinterland chains, different coordination problems exist for different reasons. As a response, different public and private actors undertake coordination arrangements to solve coordination problems. The goal of this thesis is to advance the understanding of how actors in port-related transport chains improve this coordination. The core of the thesis consists of five article. They form a ‘pattern of discovery’ of different issues related to coordination in hinterland chains applying different theoretical lenses from inter-organisational theories in which Institutional Economics plays a central role. This thesis introduces a framework to analyse coordination in hinterland chains. The framework helps to cope with the complexity of coordination in port-related transport chains and it is a tool to explore coordination issues systematically. The first study shows that different coordination problems exist in transport by road, rail, and waterway. These coordination problems occur due to the imbalance between {{the costs and benefits of}} coordination, a lack of willingness to invest, the strategic considerations of the actors involved, and risk-averse behaviour. Based on literature review, desk research, interviews, and cases of coordination arrangements from the port of Rotterdam, we introduce a typology of four main categories of coordination arrangements. The categories are inspired by Transaction Cost Economics, theory on Property Rights, and Collective Action theory, and include: introduction of incentives, creation of interfirm alliances, changing scope of the organisation, and creating collective action. In the empirical part, coordination arrangements from container bargingin the port of Rotterdam are discussed and linked with the relevant coordination problem. The second study further explores coordination arrangements in the port of Rotterdam taking the typology from the first article as a starting point. Key characteristics related to the complexity of the transaction (number of actors involved, group character, and coordination problems to be solved) and of the coordination arrangements (type of coordination arrangement, function of actors involved, function of the initiator, power base of the initiator, transport mode and use of ICT) are defined. The analysis shows that transport companies are the most important initiator of coordination arrangements. The Rotterdam Port Authority and terminal operators also play an important role. This article assumes a relationship between the chosen coordination arrangement and the complexity of the transaction. More actors involved leads to more complexity, resulting in more hierarchical coordination arrangements; the involvement of public actors or the port authority reduces transaction costs. When the group size is large, initiators of coordination arrangements do not enforce coordination, but act mainly as a stimulator or enabler (leader firms). The analysis shows that ICT is usually applied to solve the lack of operational coordination, and when the group size is large. The third article further explores one main category of coordination arrangements, namely ‘changing scope’, thereby focussing on two actors, namely shipping lines and terminal operating companies. By making use of insights from Transaction Cost Economics and the Resource-based View, the paper helps to understand why and how shipping lines and terminal operating companies vertically integrate into intermodal transport and in inland terminals. The paper discusses a number of cases from the Hamburg–Le Havre range, where shipping lines and terminal operating companies have changed their scope. After the theoretical and empirical analysis, the papers draws conclusions on the explanatory power of the theories. From a theoretical point of view, and based on empirical observations, the study shows that three other aspects are relevant to take into account: the geographical scale of vertical integration strategies, the elements of power and culture of the firms, and the role of the formal institutional environment. In the fourth study, the focus is on including the role of the institutional environment and dynamics in the analysis of coordination in hinterland chains. Based on an in-depth study into coordination in liberalised railway market in the Port of Rotterdam, empirical illustrations are used to adjust the Transaction Cost Economics approach towards a dynamic model influenced by Douglas North's theory on economic and institutional change. The study states that such a framework is relevant to study port-related railway chains that changed from a single and homogenous actor constellation to a multiple and heterogeneous actor constellation. In the adapted framework, the institutional environment is not only a constraint but also an instrument creating possibilities for improving coordinating behaviour, and allowing interaction between the coordination arrangements and the institutional environment. The last article deepened the insights on causes of coordination problems focussing on container barging in the port of Rotterdam. A multidisciplinary analysis is performed, analysing possible institutional reasons that cause coordination problems. The study shows that container barging has a large track record of coordination arrangements. The sector is embedded in a history with many vertical and horizontal alliances. Although the Inland Waterway Transport sector can be characterised as conservative and individualistic, <b>container</b> <b>barge</b> operators act with an entrepreneurial, adaptive and future-oriented spirit. The degree of organisation among barge operators and inland terminal operators, active in organising barge transport, is relatively high, reflecting an ability to work improve coordination in the future. The present division of property and decision rights forms a bad condition for future improvement. This includes the missing contract between the barge operator and the deep-sea terminal operator, and between the barge operator or skipper and the infrastructure manager. This is difficult to change in the short term. TRAIL Thesis Series no. T 2016 / 19, the Netherlands Research School TRAILEconomics of Technology and Innovatio...|$|E

40|$|In {{logistics}} {{and transportation}} many routing {{problems can be}} defined as pickup and delivery problems with time windows. In the present paper, one particular case is introduced in which a small fixed fleet of <b>container</b> <b>barges</b> needs to be routed on inland waterways. In contrast to the Liner Shipping problem, barges do not sail on a fixed schedule. Instead, a sched- ule is composed by considering the pickup and delivery intervals of all incoming orders within the planning horizon. Containers can be stacked in two or three layers, while the number of layers and the total container weight determine the barge’s draft and thus the possibility to sail beneath bridges. Exchanging barges between towboats enables variability in barge capacity and therefore assists in generating cost-efficient routes. Addition- ally, the operator’s inland location imposes extra constraints concerning lock waiting times and varying travel times. The operator’s main goal is to offer high quality services with competitive costs in comparison with truck haulage. When the fleet capacity is insufficient for delivering all or- ders within the planning horizon, alternative means of transportation (i. e. truck haulage, leasing an extra barge) are necessary. However, these are more costly and are penalized accordingly. Real world data was provided by the container transportation company BCTN Meerhout. We present a heuristic approach to this problem. The optimization method is evaluated on the real data and experiments reveal competitive costs. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|To {{obtain the}} {{necessary}} input data, all intermodal terminals in the inland waterway network are asked for information to identify current container flows in the network. Real data on shuttle services {{is used as}} an input for the simulation model. For each shuttle service the following information is required: which type of barge is used, which destinations are visited {{and what is the}} average number of import and export containers for each destination. Container transport interacts with other freight flows. Therefore, the flow of non-containerized goods on the inland waterway network is introduced as an input in the simulation model. These flows affect the waiting times at locks. Information is also necessary on the network connections. The waterway administrators (Waterwegen en Zeekanaal nv, nv De Scheepvaart en Gemeentelijk Havenbedrijf Antwerpen) provided information on the number of locks on each waterway, distances between locks, average lockage times, number of lock chambers and size of the chambers. In the port area of Antwerp three clusters of locks connect the inner port area with the sea side. Data is required on the choice of locks when sailing in the port area. The average quay length available for handling inland navigation at sea terminals gives an indication of the service capacity in the port area of Antwerp. The port authority provided the average mooring time and time for loading and unloading in order to model service times of inland <b>container</b> <b>barges</b> in the port area. Service times in the port area include the time for mooring at each sea terminal plus the handling time of all import and export containers.|$|R

Most of the cargo shipped between the United States and Puerto Rico is carried by four Jones Act carriers that provide dedicated, scheduled weekly service using containerships and <b>container</b> <b>barges.</b> Although some vessels are operating beyond their expected useful service life, many have been reconstructed or refurbished. Jones Act dry and liquid bulkcargo vessels also operate in the market, although some shippers report that qualified bulk-cargo vessels may not always be available to meet their needs. Cargo moving between Puerto Rico and foreign destinations is carried by numerous foreign-flag vessels, often with greater capacity, and typically as part of longer global trade routes. Freight rates are determined by a number of factors, including the supply of vessels and consumer demand in the market, as well as costs that carriers face to operate, some of which (e. g., crew costs) are affected by Jones Act requirements. The average freight rates of the four major Jones Act carriers in this market were lower in 2010 than they were in 2006, which was the onset of the recent recession in Puerto Rico that has contributed to decreases in demand. Foreign-flag carriers serving Puerto Rico from foreign ports operate under different rules, regulations, and supply and demand conditions and generally have lower costs to operate than Jones Act carriers have. Shippers doing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight rates are often [...] although not always [...] lower for foreign carriers going to and from Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the United States, despite longer distances.
