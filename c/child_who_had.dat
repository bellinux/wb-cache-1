5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|When Henry died in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, {{inherited}} the throne.

It appeared that more then half of the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence suffered from {{at least one other}} form of maltreatment. No differences were found in the nine characteristics that had been tested in their distributions for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed domestic violence compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> maltreated in another form.

40|$|REVIEW QUESTION / OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} of this review is to identify and synthesize the best international qualitative evidence on healthcare users’ experiences of communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. For {{the purposes of this}} review, “healthcare users” will be taken to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions and their families. The question to be addressed is: - What are healthcare users’ experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions? INCLUSION CRITERIA - Types of participants: This review will consider all qualitative studies that focus on users of healthcare services for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. These users are anticipated to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition and their family members. In instances where children are not under the legal care of one or both parents, service users may also include other types of legal guardians. - Phenomena of interest: This review will consider experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. - Context: This review will consider studies relating to communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition, irrespective of whether the healthcare service is based in a hospital, hospice, or community setting. There is no restriction on the country in which a study was conducted...|$|R

They accidentally save Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta, a time-travelling justice department. When shot by Hitler, Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song, the grown version of Amy and Rory's <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been taken away from them.

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open {{conflict}} breaking out between various parties. Firstly, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, forbade the search for his incarnation. However, in 1618 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, secretly identified the <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa.

25|$|In May 1961, Ethiopia {{hosted the}} United Nations-sponsored Conference of African States on the Development of Education. Among other things, the conference {{highlighted}} Ethiopia's educational deficiencies. The Ethiopian education system, especially in {{primary and secondary}} education, was ranked the bottom among African nations. There were school and teacher shortages, a high dropout rate, and low overall attendance rates; especially among females, non-Christians, rural and pastoral children. Embarrassed by this record, the Ministry of Education developed a new education policy, which was in effect until 1974. Designed {{in conjunction with the}} objectives of the government's second and third five-year development plans, extending from 1962 to 1973, the policy gave precedence to the establishment of technical training schools, although academic education also was expanded. Curriculum revisions introduced a mix of academic and nonacademic subjects. But Amharic became the language of instruction for the entire primary cycle, which handicapped any <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a different primary language.|$|E

Certain mindfulness practices, such as being present and attending to the sensations experienced within that moment, seem to be embedded within various DvT interventions and techniques. Nevertheless, mindfulness-based treatments do not include the concept of ‘play’, which is a key feature of DvT and can be very useful when working with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been physically abused.

Hannes Oberhauser is a background character in the short story [...] "Octopussy" [...] from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection, and is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983. As Sam Mendes searched for events in young Bond's life to follow the childhood discussed in Skyfall, he came across Hannes Oberhauser, who becomes a father figure to Bond. From there Mendes conceived the idea of [...] "a natural <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been pushed out, cuckoo in the nest" [...] by Bond, which became Franz. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming.|$|E

Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by her mother, had been caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902.

Methods: We used a questionnaire method for the parents of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' and for instructors Swimming Training. Results: It was proved that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> attended 'baby swimming' were noticeably more successful in elementary swimming skills compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not attended baby swimming. However, the differences in mastering the basic swimming skills were only slightly better in the group of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> done baby swimming.
