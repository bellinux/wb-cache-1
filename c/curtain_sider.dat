Double deck trailers are generally a step-frame construction with the majority being either box or <b>curtain</b> <b>siders,</b> with box trailers having either a fixed or movable (floating) deck, and curtain sides having either a fixed or hinged second deck; this hinged second deck generally swings into a position {{down the length of the}} trailer, and can be divided into two or three sections to allow greater load flexibility.|$|R
