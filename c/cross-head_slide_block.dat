We provide a counterexample showing that the converse does not hold. We use this example to generalize the notion of progressive to a property of block maps we call weakly progressive, and we prove that a <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> code coming from a weakly progressive block map is a local homeomorphism. We also introduce {{the notion of a}} regressive block map and prove that a <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> code *-commutes with the shift map if and only if it comes from a regressive block map.

40|$|The {{relative}} positions {{between the}} four <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> {{vary with the}} movement of the table due to the geometric errors of the guide rail. Consequently, the additional load on the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> is increased. A new method of error measurement and identification by using a self-designed stress test plate was presented. BP neural network model was used to establish the mapping between the stress of key measurement points on the test plate and the displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks.</b> By measuring the stress, the relative displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were obtained, from which the geometric errors of the guide rails were converted. Firstly, the finite element model was built to find the key measurement points of the test plate. Then the BP neural network was trained by using the samples extracted from the finite element model. The stress at the key measurement points were taken as the input and the relative displacements of the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were taken as the output. Finally, the geometric errors of the two guide rails were obtained according to the measured stress. The results show that the maximum difference between the measured geometric errors and the output of BP neural network was 5 μm. Therefore, the correctness and feasibility of the method were verified...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring and {{analysis}} of hydrological parameters are crucial to understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of a landslide. This paper analyses hydrological parameters of an existing creeping landslide site in western Japan known as Nuta-Yone Landslide. The landslide site has been active since the last several decades. Attempts to retard the rate of landslide have been partially successful but several very expensive underground horizontal drains proved to be less effective or ineffective due to poor locations. Groundwater flow and resulting fluctuation of pore water pressures at the slip layer of a <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> of the landslide site were simulated by constructing a MODFLOW based three-dimensional groundwater flow model. The distributions of different parameters in the calibrated model were used to explain the reasons of ineffective drains and categorize locations for the drains that have higher potential of being effective. Local variations in pore water pressure fluctuations were used to pin-point the areas that needed dewatering. The groundwater flow model results were integrated with a two-dimensional slope stability analysis method to find local distribution of two-dimensional factor of safety within the <b>sliding</b> <b>block.</b> Fluctuation in quasi-three-dimensional factor of safety of the entire <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> was simulated by using various methods. The study results showed {{the reason for the}} creeping nature of the <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is collinear with the piston trajectory, while <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by piston group. Even the complete balance of the first and second-order reciprocating inertia forces can be obtained, which can reduce the vibration and noise of diesel engine...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Liquefaction-induced lateral {{spreading}} deformations can pose significant risks to bridge pile foundations, underground utilities, and shallow foundation systems, particularly at sites in seismically active areas near embankments and levees, {{in close proximity}} to natural or man-made free faces. Current approaches for {{lateral spreading}} predictions, consisting primarily of empirical models and strain potential methods, largely neglect complex and critical factors that influence such deformations, such as nonlinear dynamic site response, dilation pulses, void redistribution, and water film formation, as well as complex two- or three-dimensional topographic effects. It has also been proposed by several researchers that lateral spreading predictions can be potentially approximated using Newmark-type rigid block analyses, with an appropriate reduction in the yield acceleration to account for soil liquefaction. The appropriateness of the Newmark-type framework in lateral spread characterization was assessed in this study. Particular focus was placed on characterizing any potential structural biases inherent to the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> framework, including those related to the assumption of strain concentration along a discrete failure plane and rigid dynamic behavior, as well as practical issues related to the uncertainty in <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> displacement predictions, and how the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> method compares to other approaches currently in use for predicting lateral spreading displacements. When evaluating solely the effects of the assumption of a discrete failure surface, <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> analyses predicted displacements on the order of 30 to 70 % lower than displacements predicted using simple dynamic analyses of a soil continuum. Further analyses showed that, when compared to both finite-element methods used for liquefaction modeling and established lateral spreading empirical models, <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> methods largely failed to predict substantial deformations over a broad range of lateral spreading conditions, and have the potential to be highly un-conservative in characterizing lateral spreading hazards in general...|$|R
