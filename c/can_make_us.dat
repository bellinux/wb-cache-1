Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged {{the creation of new}} socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.|$|E
500|$|The {{work has}} since come {{to assume a}} preeminent place in English literature, despite its {{numerous}} detractors. Anthony Burgess has lauded Finnegans Wake as [...] "a great comic vision, {{one of the few}} books of the world that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> laugh aloud on nearly every page." [...] The prominent literary academic Harold Bloom has called it Joyce's masterpiece, and wrote that [...] " [...] aesthetic merit were ever again to center the canon [...] would be as close as our chaos could come to the heights of Shakespeare and Dante." [...] The now commonplace term 'quark'– a subatomic particle – originates from Finnegans Wake.|$|E

Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays.

The following year, in his Lectures on the English Poets, referring to tragic poetry especially, he would observe how [...] "in proportion as it sharpens the edge of calamity and disappointment, it strengthens the desire of good." [...] Yet, he remained alert to ways in which poetry can also express and reinforce our less admirable tendencies. Following an observation of Burke he notes that [...] "people flock to see a tragedy; but if there were a public execution in the next street, the theatre would very soon be empty.
