5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where it grows singly or in small groups in <b>clayey</b> soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of <b>clayey</b> and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse <b>clayey</b> and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable <b>clayey</b> and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
5|$|This isle is for {{the most}} part arable, but rocky in other parts; the mould is brown and <b>clayey,</b> inclining to red; it is good for {{pasturage}} and cultivation. The corn growing here is oats and barley. The cattle bred here are cows, horses, and sheep. There is a church in this island called Kilchattan, it has an altar in the east end, and upon it a font of stone which is very large, and hath a small hole in the middle which goes quite through it. There are several tombstones in and about this church; the family of the Macneils, the principal possessors of this isle, are buried under the tombstones on the east side the church, where there is a plot of ground set apart for them. Most of all the tombs have a two-handed sword engraven on them, and there is one that has the representation of a man upon it... This isle affords no wood of any kind, but a few bushes of juniper on the little hills.|$|E

25|$|The Stanley Shale is {{predominantly}} a <b>clayey,</b> thinly fissile, black to green shale, with {{large amounts of}} sandstone interbedded throughout the formation. The sandstone, when freshly exposed, is a hard, fine-grained, feldspathic, silty sandstone, but weathers easily to a soft, <b>clayey</b> porous material ranging from green to brown in color. Almost all of the low-lying areas {{in the city of}} Hot Springs are composed of the Stanley Shale, and it surrounds Hot Springs Mountain on the south, east, and west sides.|$|E
25|$|The summit area is {{composed}} mostly of till (<b>clayey</b> silty gravel) overlying rocks of the Lincomb Tarn Formation. This consists of dacitic lapilli-tuff with andesite sills. The eastern plateau above Thirlmere shows some outbreaks of the volcaniclastic sandstone of the Esk Pike Formation.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{here has}} the {{expected}} shallow, lime-rich soil over chalk or limestone of the escarpment with lower {{parts of the}} escarpment summit here, where the topsoil has eroded, having slightly acid, loamy and <b>clayey</b> soils with impeded drainage, which makes that soil particularly fertile.|$|E
25|$|Negative pore {{pressures}} in <b>clayey</b> soil {{can be much}} more powerful than those in sand. Negative pore pressures explain why clay soils shrink when they dry and swell as they are wetted. The swelling and shrinkage can cause major distress, especially to light structures and roads.|$|E
25|$|Six {{sandstone}} {{names are}} possible using the descriptors for grain composition (quartz-, feldspathic-, and lithic-) {{and the amount}} of matrix (wacke or arenite). For example, a quartz arenite would be composed of mostly (>90%) quartz grains and have little or no <b>clayey</b> matrix between the grains, a lithic wacke would have abundant lithic grains and abundant muddy matrix, etc.|$|E
25|$|Approximately three {{quarters}} of Mauritania is desert or semi-desert. As a result of extended, severe drought, the desert has been expanding since the mid-1960s. To the west, between the ocean and the plateaus, are alternating areas of <b>clayey</b> plains (regs) and sand dunes (ergs), some of which shift from place to place, gradually moved by high winds. The dunes generally increase in size and mobility toward the north.|$|E
25|$|Bangalore has {{a handful}} of {{freshwater}} lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit {{in the area and}} includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to <b>clayey</b> soils.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} dredged by Boral Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully sludgy <b>clayey</b> sediment load in the river which did not clear.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{proportions}} of alkali feldspar to total feldspar, granites on Penang Island are further distinguished into two main groups: the North Penang Pluton (approximately north of latitude 5° 23'), and the South Penang Pluton. The former group is subdivided into the Ferringhi Granite, the Tanjung Bungah Granite and the Muka Head Microgranite, whereas the latter is subdivided into the Batu Maung Granite and the Sungai Ara Granite. A study of three disparate locations on the island show that the soil profile in Batu Ferringhi (of early Jurassic age) is silty whereas those in Paya Terubong (early Permian – late Carboniferous) and Tanjung Bungah (early Jurassic) are <b>clayey.</b>|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{questions}} of hygiene posed {{a problem in}} the camps, built in haste. The goal was to quickly build a maximum number of installations, which relegated sanitary considerations to the back burner. Camps in Germany featured only a simple faucet in the yard for thousands of people. Very often, latrines consisted of a simple board with a hole in the middle above a pit, which the prisoners were tasked with emptying at regular intervals. Because of their basic construction, the toilets often overflowed during powerful rains, making an unbreathable atmosphere prevail in the camps. Moreover, the <b>clayey</b> soil turned to muck from the first rains.|$|E
25|$|A river system then {{migrated}} northward and transitioned {{into either}} a large lake or marsh. As this occurred, bentonite-rich clay (formed {{in part from}} volcanic ash erupted from nearby volcanoes) and <b>clayey</b> cross-bedded sand with some interbeds and lenses of lime ooze were laid down. This eventually became the light purplish-gray claystone, sandstone, and carbonate rock of the Chinle's Monitor Butte Member. Burrows that measure 5inches (13cm) in diameter and 5feet (1.5m) long were excavated by lungfish into the Monitor Butte. This member easily stands out in the lower to middle slopes of the Waterpocket Fold's west face in such places as The Castle and along the cliff's just north of State Route 24 as it enters the park.|$|E
25|$|The dam {{formed the}} {{southern}} wall {{of one of}} the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate tailings solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried. During its operation from 1967 to 1982, the mill produced 3.5 million tons of tailings at the rate of 4,000 tons a day. The 35-foot-high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible <b>clayey,</b> silty sand a hundred feet deep. United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than tailings themselves as building material. The holding pond was not lined, in violation of standards in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 that required that holding ponds be impermeable. This lack of lining allowed tailings solution to seep into the ground, weakening the foundation of the dam and contaminating the groundwater.|$|E
25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (<b>clayey)</b> Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a <b>clayey</b> soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze {{the water out of}} a thick deposit of <b>clayey</b> soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in a matter of seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E
25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the <b>clayey</b> soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E
25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against the wall above the pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually <b>clayey</b> soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E

500|$|The geology of Southcote {{includes}} the Reading Formation—rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay, silt and sand {{formed in the}} Palaeogene period. Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk, with geological surveys also finding flint samples. A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly Plastic Clay (now known as the Lambeth Group) and chalk north of the river, with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet. More specifically, the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel, including Winter Hill (variably <b>clayey</b> and sandy), Lynch Hill (sand and gravel with lenses of silt, clay or peat), and head (a polymict deposit usually formed by periglacial solifluction or gelifluction).

500|$|Onions {{are best}} {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained.

Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity.
