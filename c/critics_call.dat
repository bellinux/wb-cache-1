25|$|Martin Seymour-Smith, Rudyard Kipling, (1990). Biography by {{a scholar}} who uses newly opened Kipling letters to argue {{he was a}} {{repressed}} homosexual who married Caroline Balestier although he was really {{in love with her}} brother Wolcott; <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> the book controversial.|$|E
25|$|His satirical works {{depict the}} second world, {{in which human}} flaws are caricatured {{with little regard for}} actual or {{historical}} truth. Though <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> attention to these anachronisms and narrative inconsistencies, it's possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of Christmas, such as the figure of the Virgin Mother, the infant Jesus, and Christmas eve, demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his social commentary.|$|E
25|$|In February 2001, the US Government Accountability Office {{reported}} the FDA, {{which is responsible}} for regulating feed, had not adequately enforced the various bans. Compliance with the regulations was shown to be extremely poor before the discovery of a cow in Washington infected with BSE in 2003, but industry representatives report that compliance is now total. Even so, <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> the partial prohibitions insufficient. Indeed, US meat producer Creekstone Farms was forcibly prevented from conducting BSE testing by the USDA, which under an obscure 1913 law had the authority to restrict sales of BSE testing kits, allegedly to protect other producers from being forced to conduct the same tests to stay competitive.|$|E

25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had not wanted to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to be calling Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E
500|$|Cult films {{frequently}} break cultural taboos, {{and many}} feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof. [...] This {{can lead to}} controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> them frivolous or incompetent. [...] Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films. [...] Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects. [...] Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed. [...] Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.|$|E
500|$|Pericles {{had such}} a {{profound}} influence on Athenian society that Thucydides, a contemporary historian, acclaimed him as [...] "the first citizen of Athens". Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire, and led his countrymen {{during the first two}} years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the [...] "Age of Pericles", though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars, or as late as the next century. Pericles promoted the arts and literature; it is principally through his efforts that Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis (including the Parthenon). This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people. Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> him a populist.|$|E

For example, {{journalist and author}} Mikal Gilmore said the novel [...] "feels free wheeling when you read it [...] it doesn't feel accidental. The writing is right there, on the page — startling, unprecedented and brilliantly crafted". Critics believe that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{should be considered a}} work of gonzo journalism because the characteristics of gonzo journalism are all characteristics seen in the novel.|$|E

Kate Kellaway of The Observer called the first book [...] "a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention– as if Colfer were as much an inspired [...] as a writer". Time.com said of the book, [...] "Artemis Fowl is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime", while The New York Times Book Review said that [...] "Colfer has done enormously, explosively well" [...] in writing a book that could be accurately described as Die Hard with fairies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common law}} tort of {{trespass}} to chattels has been invoked {{in the modern}} context of electronic communications to combat the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as spam. [...] In addition, several companies have successfully used the tort to block certain people, usually competitors, from accessing their servers. Though courts initially endorsed a broad application of this legal theory in the electronic context, more recently other jurists have narrowed its scope. As trespass to chattels is extended further to computer networks, some fear that plaintiffs are using this cause of action to quash fair competition and to deter the exercise of free speech; consequently, <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> for the limitation of the tort to instances where the plaintiff can demonstrate actual damages.|$|E
2500|$|David Horowitz {{developed}} an [...] "Islamo-Fascist Awareness Week" [...] consisting of 26 workshops on university campuses, between 2226 October 2007. <b>Critics</b> <b>call</b> it a (conservative) buzzword. A number of Republicans, such as Rick Santorum, {{used it as}} shorthand for terrorists, and Donald Rumsfeld dismissed critics of the invasion of Iraq as appeasers of a [...] "new type of fascism". In April 2008, the Associated Press reported that US federal agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, were advised to stop using the term Islamo-fascism in a fourteen-point memo issued by the Extremist Messaging Branch, a department of another federal body known as the National Counterterrorism Center. Aimed at improving {{the presentation of the}} War on Terrorism before Muslim audiences and the media, the memo states: [...] "We are communicating with, not confronting, our audiences. Don't insult or confuse them with pejorative terms such as 'Islamo-fascism,' which are considered offensive by many Muslims." [...] By 2007 Norman Podhoretz, arguing that the United States {{was in the midst of}} World War IV, identified Iran as the main center of the Islamofascist ideology he was convinced America had been fighting since 2001. Podhoretz called on the United States to bomb Iran as [...] "soon as logistically possible".|$|E

2500|$|In {{their home}} series against India in 1982–83, Pakistan played six Tests and {{defeated}} them by 3–0; Pakistan's [...] victories at Karachi, Hyderabad and Faisalabad were gained by large margins. Miandad's consistency of scoring runs, along with Zaheer, Mudassar and Mohsin Khan, crushed the Indian bowling line. Miandad {{was the third}} highest run-scorer, with 594 runs – after Mudassar's 761 and Zaheer's 650 runs – at the average of 118.80; they made {{the record for the}} three top batsmen in any Test series. Miandad and Mudassar's partnership of 451 runs in the Hyderabad Test constituted a new world record for the third wicket, and equalled the all-time record for any Test wicket, made by Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford in 1938. They became the first two Pakistani batsmen to score double-centuries in an inning. Miandad scored his career best 280 not out, before the captain Imran Khan, decided to declare the innings, thus stopping him from [...] "possibly breaking the individual Test world record of Sir Garfield Sobers". Cricket <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> this [...] "one of the worst decisions by Imran as captain of Pakistan" [...] as he [...] "didn't even give him a particular time or the number of overs he could bat on for." [...] Miandad, however never expressed displeasure on the decision. Pakistan won the match by an innings and 119 runs. Pakistan visited India in 1983–84 under the captaincy of Zaheer, and played a leveled three-Test match series. Miandad scored 225 runs in the series at the average of 75.00, including 99 runs at Bangalore. Miandad scored 131 runs against Australia at the Adelaide Oval, the third Test of the series between the teams. He could not perform consistently and finished the series with 302 runs at average of over 33, with Pakistan lost the five-match series 2–0.|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, Racine {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} Sophocles but was more influenced by Euripides (e.g. Iphigenia at Aulis and Hippolytus were the models for his plays Iphigénie and Phèdre). Euripides' reputation {{was to take}} a beating early in the 19th century when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846 and, in them, he opined that Euripides [...] "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning," [...] a view that came to influence Friedrich Nietzsche, who however {{seems not to have}} known the Euripidean plays at all well. However literary figures such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning could study and admire the Schlegels while still appreciating Euripides as [...] "our Euripides the human" [...] (Wine of Cyprus stanza 12). [...] Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: [...] "A [...] tragedy does not have to end 'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment." [...] In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray {{played an important role in}} popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook which seems nearer to ours for example than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides' plays as [...] "self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display" [...] and another springs to the poet's defence in terms such as: [...] "His plays are remarkable for their range of tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> cynical artificiality, of their construction." ...|$|E
60|$|After all {{objections}} {{have been}} urged, and this among others has certainly a little weight, the Maid of Orleans will remain {{one of the}} very finest of modern dramas. Perhaps, among all Schiller's plays, it is the one which evinces most of that quality denominated genius in the strictest meaning of the word. Wallenstein embodies more thought, more knowledge, more conception; but it is only in parts illuminated by that ethereal brightness, which shines over every part of this. The spirit of the romantic ages is here imaged forth; but the whole is exalted, embellished, ennobled. It is what the <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> idealised. The heart must be cold, the imagination dull, which the Jungfrau von Orleans will not move.|$|E

60|$|But {{then it is}} {{not every}} knave, nor (let me add) every fool, that is a fit subject for a Dunciad. There must still exist some analogy, if not {{resemblance}} of qualities, between the heroes of the two poems, and this in order to admit what neoteric <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> the parody, one of the liveliest graces of the little epic. Thus, it being agreed that the constituent qualities of the greater epic hero are wisdom, bravery, and love, from whence springeth heroic virtue; it followeth that those of the lesser epic hero should be vanity, impudence, and debauchery, from which happy assemblage resulteth heroic dulness, the never-dying subject of this our poem.|$|E
60|$|We met {{first in}} the Merediths' house-boat, the Tawny Owl, which was then lying at Molesey. Gilray, as I soon saw, was a man trying to be miserable, and finding it the hardest task in life. It is strange that the {{philosophers}} have never hit upon this profound truth. No man ever tried harder to be unhappy than Gilray; but the luck was against him, {{and he was always}} forgetting himself. Mark Tapley succeeded in being jolly in adverse circumstances; Gilray failed, on the whole, in being miserable in a delightful house-boat. It is, however, so much more difficult to keep up misery than jollity that I like to think of his attempt as what the dramatic <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> a succès d'estime.|$|E
60|$|So the {{excellent}} Public is hereby {{assured that the}} sale of my book is already secured.

Now, I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the Review and Magazine <b>critics</b> <b>call</b> lofty and true, and about thirty thousand (this tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing. The Public will see by a glance at this schedule, that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting them, since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot.|$|E
