40|$|The American {{class action}} is a {{procedural}} tool that advances substantive law values such as deterrence, compensation, and fairness. Opt-out class actions in particular achieve these goals by aggregating claims not only of active participants but also passive plaintiffs. Full faith and credit then extends the preclusive effect of class judgments to other U. S. courts. But there is no international full faith and <b>credit</b> <b>obligation,</b> and many foreign courts will not treat U. S. class judgments as binding on passive plaintiffs. Therefore, some plaintiffs {{may be able to}} wait until the U. S. class action is resolved before either joining the U. S. suit (and reaping its rewards) or relitigating the case abroad. Transnational class actions thus give some plaintiffs “litigation options. ” The few courts and scholars that have recognized this phenomenon have proposed methods to identify litigation option holders and exclude them from opt-out treatment. Some U. S. judges, for example, have refused to certify classes that include citizens of foreign countries that may not recognize U. S. class judgments. This Article shows that this conventional wisdom is misdirected: citizenship is the wrong measure, courts are poorly positioned to identify relitigation risks, and the social costs of excluding option holders may well outweigh the benefits. Instead, courts should certify classes of foreign and domestic plaintiffs in service of policy goals such as deterrence and intraclass fairness regardless of foreign preclusion law. At the same time, this Article suggests innovative approaches to achieve some preclusion previously unremarked upon in transnational cases. Prior approaches are insufficient, in part, because they rely on courts without acknowledging the informational asymmetries between courts and parties or the limited tools available for judicial resolution. This Article explains how private incentives and private information may fill the gap in interjurisdictional preclusion law. Parties should be encouraged to negotiate private preclusion agreements in cases in which preclusion matters. In addition, courts can coordinate informally to curb costly relitigation. In summary, this Article uses values derived from lawmaking choices and a practical assessment of the litigation environment to respond to litigation options in transnational class actions not by excluding option holders but instead by permitting aggregation and seeking alternatives to preclusion law. This Article applies these lessons to transnational class actions filed in a single jurisdiction (e. g., a U. S. court), as well as to dueling class actions filed in two countries simultaneously and to U. S. recognition of foreign aggregate judgments whatever their form...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 56). Banking industry in Bangladesh {{has become a major}} contributor to the economy since the last decade. Economic prospects and business friendly environment of Bangladesh, foreign banks have come and opened banking operations here. Of the 9 Foreign Commercial Banks in Bangladesh Citibank N. A. has been a pioneer in innovative banking services. Citibank N. A. is a concern of Citigroup Inc. located centrally in New York. Business entities require a huge amount of money to launch several projects. And money is provided by the banks in terms of credit. Credit is a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives something of value now and agrees to repay the lender at some later date. Credit risk means the risk of credit loss which results from the failure of a borrower to honor the borrower‟s <b>credit</b> <b>obligation</b> to the financial institution. Bangladesh Bank has formulated Credit Risk Guideline to supervise the process of Credit Risk Management. As a scheduled foreign bank in Bangladesh, Citibank N. A. complies with that policy and it has the entire infrastructure in place and activities are performed accordingly. Besides this, in Citibank N. A. there is a separate Credit Risk Policy named as „ICG Credit Risk Policy‟. This is the global risk policy for the bank and Citibank N. A. follows this too for the internal compliance. Being a global bank Citibank N. A. has high risks in its business as it operates globally across 160 countries. Credit process is a long one and it has several stages. Firstly the borrower‟s application is considered after examining its financial strength and quality of assets. Based on the financial and asset qualities a risk grading is tagged to the borrower. The Business unit decides whether the borrower will be provided credit facility or not. A separate Risk Chain monitors the whole process in collaboration with the business unit. After decision of lending primary documentation and account opening process is performed by the respective units and upon perfection of the required documentation, the borrower is provided credit facilities. Credit related documents are standard documents formulated by the legal team of the bank and the documents are printed and kept in safe custody of CRMS. For deferrals in documentation, respective RMs raise deferral request to the Risk Chain who monitors the process from India. Upon perfecting of documentation CRMS unit maintains the credit lines for the borrowers. Before letting the customer to take drawdown, CRMS collects the CIB Report from the Database of CIB and checks the status of the borrower in question. This is a major checking done by CRMS and the Head of CRMS deals with this to make sure there is no error in the process. Loan monitoring is solely done by the CRMS unit. RMs as well as business and Risk Chain are informed about the availed facilities / utilization on a daily basis. Repayment schedules are closely monitored and classification status of the borrowers changes if there is any discrepancy or delay in repayment schedule. Thus the whole process goes on in both the pre sanction and post sanction stages. For hypothecated assets of borrowers, RMs collect the stock reports and insurance cover notes of those assets so that those assets are safe and available for sale if the customer defaults. Non-performing loan in Citibank N. A is below 2 % and this signifies the perfection of Citibank N. A in managing the credit portfolio. CRMS reports to Bangladesh bank as part of the required regulatory reporting. There are 7 monthly reports, 16 quarterly reports, 6 semiannual reports and 1 annual report which are regularly submitted to different departments of Bangladesh Bank. The BB officials let CRMS know if there is any discrepancy and CRMS also obtains clarification from the departments if there is any such requirement. Lamia ShamaB. Business Administratio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the level of financial satisfaction of the family money manager in relation to socioeconomic characteristics, attitudes towards credit, and credit practices. The population was members of the USU Community Credit Union. Data were collected with a mail survey questionnaire from {{a random sample of}} 500 subjects. After multiple follow-up attempts, the response rate was 55. 2 percent. The dependent variable was financial satisfaction; the independent variables were categorized into three groups: socioeconomic characteristics, credit attitudes, and credit practices. The conceptual model of this study hypothesized that there is a relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Age, education, home value, household income, and savings were positively related to financial satisfaction. Those who felt comfortable with larger amounts of credit payment were associated with higher income levels and higher satisfaction levels. People with favorable attitudes toward borrowing money to pay for houses {{were more likely to be}} satisfied with their financial conditions. Convenience credit card users were more satisfied than installment users. Higher debt repayment-to-income ratios were associated with lower levels of financial satisfaction. Respondents 2 ̆ 7 feeling about their <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> was the most powerful predictor of financial satisfaction; people who were concerned about their <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> were likely to be less satisfied with their financial situations that those who were not. Concern over <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> was not highly related to socioeconomic characteristics or debt repayment-to- income ratio. Accordingly, the subjective assessment of <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> was more important in explaining financial satisfaction than the objective measurement of family debt burden such as debt repayment-to-income ratio. Fifty-two percent of the variation in financial satisfaction was accounted for by socioeconomic characteristics, credit attitudes, and credit practices. Credit practices were more powerful predictors of financial satisfaction than socioeconomic characteristics. This result illustrates the importance of credit management as a contributing factor in financial satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a new {{approach}} to risk assessment for banks. Rather than looking at them individually we try to undertake an analysis {{at the level of the}} banking system. Such a perspective is necessary because the complicated network of mutual <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> can make the actual risk exposure of banks invisible at the level of individual institutions. We apply our framework to a cross section of individual bank data as they are usually collected at the central bank. Using standard risk management techniques in combination with a network model of interbank exposures we analyze the consequences of macroeconomic shocks for bank insolvency risk. In particular we consider interest rate shocks, exchange rate and stock market movements as well as shocks related to the business cycle. The feedback between individual banks and potential domino effects from bank defaults are taken explicitly into account. The model determines endogenously probabilities of bank insolvencies, recovery rates and a decomposition of insolvency cases into defaults that directly result from movements in risk factors and defaults that arise indirectly as a consequence of contagion.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the modern}} {{financial}} services industry, thrifts 1 {{engage in an}} unprecedented range of complex and risky commercial transactions. Consequently, the receiver of a failed thrift, which in most cases is the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) appointed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), 2 is likely to face a host of complex claims. These claims arise {{not only from the}} thrift 2 ̆ 7 s deposit liabilities but also from its investment transactions and the incidental disputes generated by such activities. The scene of a thrift failure is often already strewn with litigation, and the receivership itself is likely to generate still more. 3 Even if litigation has not yet commenced, the receiver has to pay the thrift 2 ̆ 7 s valid <b>credit</b> <b>obligations</b> and so has to distinguish good claims from bad and quantify the former. In the process of accepting, settling or rejecting a diverse and complex range of creditor claims, disputes concerning their validity will have to be resolved informally or, if this cannot be done, either through the judicial process or by administrative adjudication. The latter process {{is the subject of this}} study. The importance of this claims determination process has grown with the escalation of thrift failures in recent years. 4 Although, with the assistance of the FSLIC, many insolvent thrifts can be restored to financial health, sold or merged, a significant number have already proven so irretrievable that the FHLBB has had to place them into liquidation.

40|$|Objective: We {{consider}} the following problem from credit risk modeling: Our sample (Xi; Yi), 1 < i < n, consists of pairs of variables. The first variable Xi measures the creditworthiness of individual i. The second variable Yi is the default indicator of individual i. It has two states: Yi = 1 indicates a default, Yi = 0 a non-default. A default occurs, if individual i cannot meet its contractual <b>credit</b> <b>obligations,</b> i. e. it cannot pay back its outstandings regularly. In afirst step, our objective is to estimate the threshold between good and bad creditworthiness {{in the sense of}} dividing the range of Xi into two rating classes: One class with good creditworthiness and a low probability of default and another class with bad creditworthiness and a high probability of default. Methods: Given observations of individual creditworthiness Xi and defaults Yi, the field of change point analysis provides a natural way to estimate the breakpoint between the rating classes. In order to account for dependency between the observations, the literature proposes a combination of three model classes: These are a breakpoint model, a linear one-factor model for the creditworthiness Xi, and a Bernoulli mixture model for the defaults Yi. We generalize the dependency structure further and use a generalized link between systematic factor and idiosyncratic factor of creditworthiness. So the systematic factor cannot only change the location, but also the form of the distribution of creditworthiness. Results: For the case of two rating classes, we propose several estimators for the breakpoint and for the default probabilities within the rating classes. We prove the strong consistency of these estimators in the given non-i. i. d. framework. The theoretical results are illustrated by a simulation study. Finally, we give an overview of research opportunities...|$|R
