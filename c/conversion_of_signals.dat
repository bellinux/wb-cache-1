If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the analog-to-digital converter or a digital-to-analog converter, the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error {{is proportional to the}} slew rate of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error. Various effects such as noise (random jitter), or spectral components (periodic jitter) can come about depending on the pattern of the jitter in relation to the signal. In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a Nyquist frequency of 22 kHz to 14 bits.|$|E

The new AID techniques proposed here are motivated by the sampling of the input signal in domains which may lead to lower levels of signal distortion and significantly less demanding A/D conversion characteristics. As a particular case, we study A/D conversion in the frequency domain where samples of the signal spectrum are taken such that no time-aliasing occurs in the discrete-time version of the signal.

It has been widely shown that minor alterations in lipid membranes are critically involved in the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> from the environment to the transcriptional activation of heat shock genes. Previously, we have proposed that the composition, molecular arrangement, and physical state of lipid membranes and their organization have crucial roles in cellular responses during stress caused by physical and chemical factors as well as in pathological states. Here, we show that transformation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT 2 (Salmonella Typhimurium) with a heterologous 12 -desaturase (or with its trans-membrane regions) causes major changes in the pathogen’s membrane dynamic. In addition, this pathogen is strongly impaired in the synthesis of major stress proteins (heat shock proteins) under heat shock. These data support the hypothesis that the perception of temperature in Salmonella is strictly controlled by membrane order and by a specific membrane lipid/protein ratio that ultimately causes transcriptional activation of heat shock genes.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} analog {{to digital}} (A/D) conversion, {{based on the}} quantization of coefficients obtained via the projection of a continuous time signal over a set of basis functions. The framework presented here for A/D conversion is motivated by the sampling of an input signal in domains which may lead to significantly less demanding A/D conversion characteristics, i. e., lower sampling rates and lower bit resolution requirements. We show that the proposed system efficiently parallelizes the {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC), which lowers the sampling rate requirements by increasing the number of basis functions on which the continuous time signal is projected, leading to a tradeoff between sampling rate reduction and system complexity. Additionally, the A/D conversion resolution requirements can be reduced by optimally assigning the available number of bits according to the variance distribution of the coefficients obtained from the signal projection over the new A/D conversion domain. In particular, we study A/D conversion in the frequency domain, where samples of the continuous signal spectrum are taken such that no time aliasing occurs in the discrete time version of the signal. We show that the frequency domain ADC overcomes some of the difficulties encountered in conventional time-domain methods for A/D <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> with very large bandwidths, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. The proposed A/D conversion method is compared with conventional ADCs based on pulse code modulation (PCM). Fundamental figures of merit in A/D conversion and system tradeoffs are discussed for the proposed ADC. The signal-to-noise and distortion ratios of the frequency domain ADC are presented, which quantify the impact of the most critical impairments of the proposed ADC technique. We also consider application to communications receivers, and provide a design example of a multi-carrier UWB receiver.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} filter is a digital filter that can adjust its coefficients {{to give the}} best match t An {{adaptive filter}} is a digital filter that can adjust its coefficients to give the best match to a given desired signal. When an adaptive filter operates in a changeable environment the filter coefficients can adapt in response {{to changes in the}} applied input signals. Adaptive filters depend on recursive algorithms to update their coefficients and train them to near the optimum solution. An everyday example of adaptive filters is in the telephone system where, impedance mismatches causing echoes of a signal are a significant source of annoyance to the users of the system. The adaptive signal process is here to estimate and generate the echo path and compensate for it. To do this the echo path is viewed as an unknown system with some impulse response and the adaptive filter must mimic this response. Adaptive Filters are generally implemented in the time domain which works well in most scenarios however in many applications the impulse response become long, and increasing the complexity of the filter beyond a level where it can no longer be implemented efficiently in the time domain. An example of acoustic echo cancellation applications is in hands free telephony system. However there exists an alternative solution and that is to implement the filters in the frequency domain. The Discrete Fourier Transform or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) allows the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> from the time domain to the frequency domain in an efficient manner. Despite the efficiency of the FFT the overhead involved in converting the signals to the frequency domain does place a restriction {{on the use of the}} algorithm. When the impulse response of the unknown system and hence the impulse response of the filter is long enough however this is not an issue since the computational cost of the conversion is much less than that of the time domain algorithm. The actual filtering of the signals requires little computational cost in the frequency domain. Investigation of the so-called crossover point, the point where the frequency domain implementation becomes more efficient than the time domain implementation is important to establish the point where frequency domain implementation becomes practical...|$|E
