He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches, including a best of 3/2 against Thailand, and scored 15 runs at 7.50. India won {{all but one of}} the matches, most by enormous margins.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the}} first to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic {{were the first}} physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|The Student Residence {{supports}} several cultural projects {{developed by}} voluntary and worker students {{and open to}} the participation of internal and external community. It encourages interdisciplinary training and integration between the resident students and the external community. The diversity of races and cultures, brought by <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> other states and countries is an advantage for the residents who live in the house, facilitating full citizenship, through the exercise of their rights and duties within the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Boletus collinitus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Otto Kuntze transferred {{it to the}} genus Suillus in his 1898 Revisio Generum Plantarum. In 1969 Dutch mycologist H.S.C. Huijsman described the variety S.collinitus var. aureus (as S.fluryi var. aureus; S.fluryi is a synonym of S.collinitus) based on a collection from Switzerland. The variety velatipes was described in 1998 by Giampaolo Simonini and <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> Italian collections.|$|E

5|$|Eric Pringle, {{a veteran}} of 2D digital animation, was {{employed}} as animation director, providing Jones with much technical assistance. Pringle's <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, another Cartoon Network production, comprised a team of around fifteen full-time animators at the network's studio, all working on Apple computers. Greg Miller was hired as supervising director, Martin Cendreda as technical director, and John Pham with Jon Vermilyea as character designers. Miller is the creator of Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, another series on the network. Vermilyea worked also as a character designer on the network's series Adventure Time, while Cendreda, Pham, and Jones all contributed to the anthology comic book Kramers Ergot. Michael Yank was employed as a writer for most episodes, with Mirari Films' CEO Eric Kaplan supervising the creation of scripts.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, rainy Friday night, only 4,124 spectators paid {{to see the}} game, more to see {{players from}} the Philadelphia Eagles, the local American {{football}} team, play an exhibition basketball game against their <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> the Baltimore Colts before the NBA game started. The arena's capacity was over 8,000, and Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb was infamous for exaggerating attendance numbers. Warriors home attendance had dropped from 7,000 in Chamberlain's rookie season to less than 5,000 in this, his third, season. College basketball had started offering doubleheaders during the Great Depression to provide customers value for their money. Fans had grown accustomed to watching two games, so doubleheaders in the NBA became common.|$|E
5|$|The second {{series of}} Beyond Our Ken {{followed}} in 1959; {{a third in}} 1960. Horne also continued his work in television, hosting his own series, Trader Horne, and appearing {{on a number of}} other programmes. In April 1961 he made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs, this time unaccompanied by Murdoch. In October that year—three weeks after the fifth series of Beyond Our Ken began recording—Horne appeared as the anchorman on a new BBC television series, Let's Imagine, a discussion programme which ran for 20 editions over 18 months. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1962, hosted by Eamonn Andrews, in which guests included friends and <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> his connections in business and entertainment. In June 1963 he began Ken's Column, a series of 15-minute one-man programmes for Anglia Television.|$|E

5|$|Wheeler {{had been}} keen {{to return to}} {{excavation}} in Britain. Based on {{the one he had}} organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{continued}} {{to travel and}} speak, {{but in the early}} 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at Port Fairy after two months of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished <b>colleagues</b> <b>from</b> the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at Tower Hill cemetery, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the House of Representatives; Prime Minister Bob Hawke took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians.|$|E
