40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} is best {{characterized as a}} fluctuation of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, which leads to epigenetic and genetic adaptation of clones and increased invasiveness and metastasis. In turn, these hypoxic adaptations make the tumors more difficult to treat and confer increased resistance to <b>current</b> therapies. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> adaptation is the regulation of gene products in response to hypoxia. Many of these hypoxia-regulated genes are mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1) complex, which is composed of a heterodimer pair of HIF- 1 a and HIF- 1 b. This heterodimer binds to the promoter of hypoxia-responsive genes, while interacting with other transcription factors, such as p 300, signal and transducer of transcription 3, and Redox effector factor 1 /apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. HIF- 1 a levels itself can be regulated by hypoxia transcriptionally and post-translationally through ubiquitination; but {{the magnitude of the}} response is modulated by several other pathways, including free radicals that affect crosstalk with HIF- 1 a/HIF- 1 b transcriptional activities.

Yet there continues to be fewer women sent on international assignments than men.

The prime {{aim is to}} establish a palynologically based zonal scheme for the Ordovician sequence as represented in five cored boreholes drilled through the Lower to Middle Ordovician strata of the central-northeastern Canning Basin. These strata embrace the Oepikodus communis through Phragmodus-Plectodina conodont zonal interval and comprise (in ascending order) the Willara, Goldwyer, and Nita formations, of inferred early Arenig to Llanvirn age. All three formations contain moderately diverse and variably preserved palynomorphs. The palynomorph taxa, detailed systematically in the <b>current</b> <b>Part</b> One <b>of</b> <b>this</b> monograph, comprise 66 species of acritarchs and six of prasinophytes. Of these, two species of prasinophytes and 11 of acritarchs are newly established: Cymatiosphaera meandrica and Pterospermella franciniae; Aremoricanium hyalinum, A. solaris, Baltisphaeridium tenuicomatum, Gorgonisphaeridium crebrum, Lophosphaeridium aequalium, L. aspersum, Micrhystridium infrequens, Pylantios hadrus, Sertulidium amplexum, Striatotheca indistincta, and Tribulidium globosum. Pylantios (typified by P. hadrus), Sertulidium (typified by S. amplexum), and Tribulidium (typified by T globosum); are defined as new acritarch genera. Three new combinations are instituted: Baltisphaeridium pugiatum (PLAYFORD & MARTIN 1984), Polygonium canningianum (COMRAZ & PENIGUEL 1972), and Sacculidium furtivum (PLAYFORD & MARTIN 1984); and Ammonidium macilentum PLAYFORD & MARTIN 1984 and Sacculidium furtivum (PLAYFORD & MARTIN 1984) are emended.

40|$|Since {{early eighties}} when first superconductor/semiconductor hybrid {{structures}} JOFET (Josephson Field Effect Transistor) {{had been created}} {{there has been a}} huge interest in controlled Josephson junctions. The idea of the JOFET is to control the supercurrent by changing the electron concentration in the two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) by the gate voltage. However the required voltages are relatively high effectively resulting in attenuation of a signal. Later it was shown that injection of hot carriers into the 2 DEG region also makes it possible to control the Josephson current. In this approach the injection current is smaller than the supercurrent, i. e. the system works as a current amplifier. This thesis is concerned with the control of the supercurrent in Nb-InGaAs/InP-Nb Josephson junctions by current injection into the 2 DEG region in 3 - and 4 -terminal configurations. It is shown that control efficiency depends on the junction width. The measurements in applied magnetic field B show recovery of the critical current at a value of B that corresponds to the first minimum in Ic-B dependence. Both above experimental observations can be explained by a local character of the influence of the injected <b>current.</b> Significant <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis is devoted to details of sample processing.

To exploit Rashba {{effect in}} a 2 D electron gas on silicon surface for spin transport, {{it is necessary}} to have surface reconstruction with spin-split metallic surface-state bands. However, metals with strong spin-orbit coupling (e. g., Bi, Tl, Sb, Pt) induce reconstructions on silicon with almost exclusively spin-split insulating bands. We propose a strategy to create spin-split metallic bands using a dense 2 D alloy layer containing a metal with strong spin-orbit coupling and another metal to modify the surface reconstruction. Here we report two examples, i. e., alloying Bi/Si(111) √ 3 × √ 3 reconstruction with Na and Tl/Si(111) 1 × 1 reconstruction with Pb.

This paper considers distribution automation as a supplementary scheme to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions.

Once the region where the vibration originated has been found, the different phenomena that effect the location of the power-in region that were discovered are shown. Four different factors are presented that effect the locations of the power-in region: the incidence angle of the current, the gradient of the current direction, the current profile, and the end effects at high mode number. (cont.) Two dimensionless parameters are presented which help in the prediction of VIV given a current profile. The first is the power-in determination factor which predicts the region where the power-in occurs using a combination of the current velocity and the power-in length. The second parameter, the time sharing parameter, helps to determine whether the riser will respond with a single frequency, or switch between frequencies in time. by Susan B. Swithenbank.

The need for and timing of treatment of other hyperlipidemias remains elusive. Remnant cholesterol has been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We assess its clearance by the liver and its relation with apo-CIII levels, and show that this lipid moiety influences several inflammatory pathways. In the second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis we investigate non-lipid driven diseases that predispose to cardiovascular risk, in which guidelines are scarce and interpretation may be difficult. Using ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT we find increased arterial inflammation in common chronic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). We assess the influence of anti-inflammatory treatment hereon and potential treatment with statins. We also find increased arterial inflammation in subjects suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease or diabetes, both associated with high CVD risk. The level of arterial inflammation is largely independent of traditional risk factors and driven by measures of disease regulation, highlighting the need for additional screening and treatment options. Although lowering of the inflammation is likely to improve cardiovascular outcomes, reduced immune responses carry increased risk of infection. Future therapies may also aim at enhancing anti-inflammatory pathways. In the final chapter <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis, we assess the potential of enhancing anti-inflammatory B cells on the progression of atherosclerosis...|$|R
