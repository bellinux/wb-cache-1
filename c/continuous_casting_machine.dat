50|$|Molten metal is {{introduced}} into the twin-belt <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> from a tundish through a nozzle placed between the casting belts. The metal is cooled by {{direct contact with the}} belts which are in turn cooled by high pressure recirculating water.

50|$|Within the twin-belt <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> {{molten metal}} {{progressively}} solidifies on the mold surfaces {{as it moves}} through the mold region, with a sump of molten metal present between the solidifying outer surfaces. Belt coatings, texture, and gas layer modifications are used to fine tune the heat transfer rate from the cast metal to the belt. Full thickness solidification can occur as early as 30% {{of the way through}} the mold for thin strip, or up to 2 m beyond the mold exit for large bar where exit water spray cooling and roller support are required.|$|E
50|$|He founded The Canara Workshops Ltd. in 1943 {{and started}} {{manufacture}} of automobile leaf springs under {{the brand name}} Canara Springs in 1950. Considering the increased demand in Northern India he opened another factory in Nagpur. The Nagpur unit was closed in the late 60's due to various problems faced by the company. The raw material for the leaf springs, spring steel flats used to be imported into the country. In the late 60s Kudva felt the need for starting a mini steel plant to manufacture the required spring steel within the country. With this in mind a mini steel plant consisting of a 5 metric tonne electric arc furnace, a vertical <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> to cast steel billets and a rolling mill was conceptualised.|$|E

50|$|It is {{here that}} the design of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> may vary. This {{describes}} a 'curved apron' casting machine; vertical configurations are also used. In a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a vertical <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber. Molds in a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> can be straight or curved, depending on the basic design of the machine.|$|R

50|$|Starting a <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> {{involves}} {{placing a}} dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) {{up through the}} spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} {{secondary cooling}} zone {{is an important part}} of the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> In this zone, a breakout may occur because of an increase of the local and temperature heterogeneity of steel, resulting from an increase of the stress caused by bending of the slab and by high local concentration of nonmetallic slag inclusions. Changes of the chemical composition of steel during continuous casting are particularly dangerous. In the event that two melts are cast one after another, that is, if the melt of steel with chemical composition A ends and is immediately followed by the steel B, it may automatically stop the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> and an atypical breakout may take place. It has happened during continuous casting of the slab, 250 [*]×[*] 1530 [*]mm in the area of straightening, 20 [*]min after flying change of tundish.
