30|$|Cutting fluid {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the manufacturing industry as lubricant [8]. It can be mainly classified into two categories: oil-based and water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> The primary functions of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> include lubrication, cooling, cleaning, and antirust. At present, the lubrication performance of oil-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is outstanding, but its cooling property is inferior. On the contrary, water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> shows powerful ability in cooling, cleaning, and antirust, but it is relatively weak in lubrication [9].

However, the water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is not ideal due to its inferior lubrication ability [8].

The characteristics that have a thermal impact on the grinding process are the cooling, lubrication, ignition and misting properties of the fluid.

Once an optimal <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> had been established, the project then investigated the optimal method of applying this fluid, with particular reference to the type and design of the nozzle used to apply the fluid to the grinding zone.
