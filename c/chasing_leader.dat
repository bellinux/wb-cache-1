50|$|Kauto Star again {{began the}} season in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree, where he faced three rivals: Melling Chase winner Monet's Garden, Gold Cup runner up Exotic Dancer and Ashley Brook.

During the closing stages of the race, he <b>chased</b> <b>leader</b> Monet's Garden but could not catch him. Monet's Garden won by 1½ lengths from Kauto Star, who was giving him a stone in weight, with Exotic Dancer a further 20 lengths back in third. Kauto Star {{continued}} to follow the same path as last season and next started in the Betfair Chase, where he was ridden by Sam Thomas due to regular jockey Ruby Walsh being out injured with a dislocated shoulder.

He then traveled to Australia to stand as a stallion for Coolmore (which Michael Tabor is involved with) during the 1997 Southern Hemisphere breeding season.|$|R
50|$|All five leading contenders ran well {{throughout}} {{the first three}} quarters of the race and were all well placed to mount a challenge as they jumped the Canal Turn for the second time. Greasepaint kicked on to lead at that stage and was joined four fences from the finish by Hallo Dandy who both began to stretch the chasing field. Broomy Bank and Grittar were among those who began to lose touch while Lucky Vane continued to <b>chase</b> the <b>leaders</b> towards the penultimate fence but was fighting for the minor places by the last fence.|$|R
50|$|Morgan {{returned}} to the printing business and remained in Cincinnati until 1871, {{when he moved to}} Cottonwood Falls, Kansas and started the <b>Chase</b> County <b>Leader</b> newspaper, continuing it until his retirement in 1903. He was a Republican and in 1879 he represented Chase County in the state legislature. From 1893-5 he was a state senator, active in promoting prohibition. In 1891 he was part of a government commission which negotiated a treaty with the Paiute residents of the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation in Nevada; the treaty was never ratified by Congress.|$|R

After <b>chasing</b> the <b>leaders</b> he {{took the lead in}} the final furlong and drew away to win [...] "comfortably" [...] by three lengths from the British-trained Mr Napper Tandy.|$|R
25|$|Elected as a Whig to the Cincinnati City Council in 1840, Chase {{left that}} party the next year. For seven {{years he was}} the leader of the Liberty Party in Ohio. He helped balance its idealism with his pragmatic {{approach}} and political thought. He was skillful in drafting platforms and addresses, and he prepared the national Liberty platform of 1843 and the Liberty address of 1845. Building the Liberty Party was slow going. By 1848 <b>Chase</b> was <b>leader</b> in the effort to combine the Liberty Party with the Barnburners or Van Buren Democrats of New York to form the Free Soil Party.|$|R
50|$|Morgan's {{grandfather}} James Morgan {{emigrated from}} Ireland in 1847, settling in Cincinnati. Morgan's father William Albert Morgan (1841-1917) was apprenticed to a printer and then {{served in the}} Civil War. In 1871 he moved to Cottonwood Falls, Kansas and started the <b>Chase</b> County <b>Leader</b> newspaper, which he continued until retiring in 1903. He also served {{in both houses of}} the state legislature. Morgan's mother Wilhelmina (Yoast) Morgan (1843-1910) was active in civic organizations and politics, serving as mayor of Cottonwood Falls in 1885. Morgan himself was educated in Cottonwood Falls and then at the state university in Lawrence, majoring in journalism.|$|R
50|$|Wylde Hide was a ten-year-old, two-times {{winner of}} the Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park who was {{carrying}} much of the Irish support to break a 22-year run without a horse from their homeland winning the race. It was also felt that the J. P. McManus-owned gelding would have gone close had he not unseated when starting to issue a challenge at the Canal Turn second time in the 1996 race. The Arthur Moore-trained 11/1 shot failed to improve on that and was <b>chasing</b> the <b>leaders</b> when he blundered at Becher's Brook on the second circuit and unseated Charlie Swan.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{began her}} second season {{in a strong}} renewal of the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 8 April. After <b>chasing</b> the <b>leaders</b> {{in the early stages}} she stayed on {{strongly}} to finish second, beaten a head by her stablemate Hydrangea with Intricately (winner of the Moyglare Stud Stakes) in fourth and the favourite Promise To Be True (second in the Prix Marcel Boussac) in sixth place. The filly's performance attracted little immediate attention, but at the start of May she began to attract considerable support for the 1000 Guineas, being backed down from 33/1 to 10/1 in the ante-post betting market.|$|R
50|$|A sequel, Gunman Clive 2, was {{released}} for the Nintendo 3DS on 29 January 2015. The story now takes Clive {{around the world}} to <b>chase</b> after the <b>leader</b> of the bandits from the first game. In June 2015, Bertil Hörberg announced the two games would be released on the Wii U as Gunman Clive HD Collection.|$|R
5000|$|Integral started {{favourite}} for her reappearance as {{a four-year-old}} in the Dahlia Stakes. After being held {{up at the}} rear she moved through to challenge the leaders {{as they entered the}} final furlong. Esoterique and Integral pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field and were neck and neck inside the last 200 yards, but Integral could not quite get to Esoterique, losing by a head. At Royal Ascot, Integral was one of the 14 fillies and mares to line up for the Duke of Cambridge Stakes. Ryan Moore positioned her just behind the leaders in the early stages before quickening to take the lead over a furlong from the finish. She drifted right in the closing stages, but pulled away to win by two lengths from L'Amour De Ma Vie. On 11 July, Integral was ridden by regular jockey Ryan Moore in the Falmouth Stakes. She started the race as the 15/8 favourite and <b>chased</b> <b>leader</b> Sky Lantern in the early stages. Rizeena moved up to join Sky Lantern at the head of the field after three furlongs, with Integral just behind the pair. Sky Lantern began to fade three furlongs from the finish, leaving Rizeena in an outright lead until she was overtaken by Integral over one furlong from the finish. As they entered the final furlong Integral had a two length lead, which she maintained until the finish to win the race, beating runner-up Rizeena by that margin, with Peace Burg a further three quarters of a length behind the runner-up in third place.|$|R

50|$|In late August, Plesa {{took his}} entire stable down to Calder Race Course for the autumn and winter. On August 25, Itsmyluckyday ran in a listed stakes race called the $75,000 Fasig-Tipton Turf Dash at five furlongs. In this sprint, he broke sixth and {{advanced}} to third {{going into the}} turn. Itsmyluckyday <b>chased</b> the <b>leaders</b> under jockey Manoel Cruz and drew away to win by four lengths. In his next start, Itsmyluckyday raced in the $100,000 Foolish Pleasure Stakes at a mile and 70 yards at Calder. He broke in fourth under jockey Manoel Cruz, went three wide around the final turn, and drew clear of the field to win by three lengths.|$|R
