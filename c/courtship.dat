5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} <b>courtship</b> displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of <b>courtship</b> behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E

5|$|The main {{call of the}} American white ibis is a honking sound, {{transcribed}} as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The call is used in flight, <b>courtship</b> or when disturbed. Birds also utter a muted huu-huu-huu call while foraging, {{and make}} a squealing call in <b>courtship.</b> Young in the nest give a high-pitched zziu as a begging call.|$|E
5|$|Aerial <b>courtship</b> {{displays}} involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All <b>courtship</b> displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp's father lived a mile (1.6km) from Cooke's estate, and {{the young}} man wanted to meet her. Beauchamp {{gradually}} gained Cooke's trust by visiting under the guise of borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a <b>courtship.</b> Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the <b>courtship</b> progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.|$|E

5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a <b>courtship</b> display. Internal fertilization and similar <b>courtship</b> behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E

5|$|The <b>courtship</b> {{rituals of}} the American {{goldfinch}} include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin <b>courtship</b> in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a <b>courtship</b> period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of <b>courtship</b> is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the <b>courtship.</b> In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins <b>courtship.</b> Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies {{with the female}} and rhythmically contract; the {{resulting}} mass of snakes can remain nearly motionless for several days. After <b>courtship,</b> the snakes copulate for about {{an average of two}} hours.|$|E

50|$|In <b>courtships,</b> females land on exposed perches and the {{following}} major events occur: the male contacts the female, the male begins probing, the male abdomen comes between the female's hindwings, and lastly the male stops moving. Aside from many other butterfly species, P. protodice females lack an abdominal extension response. A male does nothing more than land on a female's thorax and couple with her. In half of all <b>courtships,</b> females also exhibit a low amplitude flutter response {{which seems to have}} no effect on the duration of copulation.|$|R
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or <b>courtship</b> arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, <b>courtship</b> proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic <b>courtship</b> dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The <b>courtship</b> dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the <b>courtship</b> dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males <b>courtship,</b> the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full <b>courtship</b> dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
