5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with <b>chromium,</b> <b>steel</b> and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the clinker arises {{both from the}} natural raw materials and {{from the use of}} recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel, zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard <b>chromium</b> <b>steel</b> alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As chromate (CrO42−) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4).|$|E

25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

40|$|Abstract. The higher steam {{temperatures}} and pressures {{required to achieve}} increase in thermal efficiency of fossil fuel-fired power-generation plants necessi-tate the use of steels with improved creep rupture strength. The 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels</b> developed {{during the last three}} decades are of great interest in such applications. In this report, the development of steels P 91, P 92 and E 911 is described. It is shown that the martensitic transformation in these three steels produces high dislocation density that confers significant transient hardening. However, the dislocation den-sity decreases during exposure at service temperatures due to recovery effects and for long-term creep strength the sub-grain structure produced under different con-ditions is most important. The changes in the microstructure mean that great care is needed in the extrapolation of experimental data to obtain design values. Only data from tests with rupture times above 3, 000 h provide reasonable extrapolated values. It is further shown that for the 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels,</b> oxidation resistance in steam is not sufficiently high for their use as thin-walled components at temperatures of 600 C and above. The potential for the development of <b>steels</b> of higher <b>chromium</b> contents (above 11 %) to give an improvement in steam oxidation resistance whilst maintaining creep resistance to the 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels</b> is discussed...|$|R

Helium ion implantation should simulate changes of structure due to knocking-out of atoms during neutron irradiation.
