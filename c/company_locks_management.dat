40|$|The paper {{studies the}} impact of several lock manager designs on the {{overhead}} imposed to a persistent programming language by automated object locking. Our study reveals that a <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> method based on lock state sharing outperforms more traditional <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> designs. <b>Lock</b> state sharing is a novel <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> method that represents all lock data structures with equal values with a single shared data structure. Sharing the value of locks has numerous benefits: (i) it makes the space consumed by the lock manager small and independent {{of the number of}} locks acquired by transactions, (ii) it eliminates the need for expensive book-keeping of locks by transactions, and (iii) it enables the use of memoization techniques for whole locking operations. These advantages add up to make the release of locks practically free, and the processing of over 99 % of lock requests between 8 to 14 RISC instructions. 1...|$|R

40|$|A Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) {{provides}} advisory locking {{services to}} {{applications such as}} databases and file systems that run on distributed systems. <b>Lock</b> <b>management</b> at the server is implemented using First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel way of delegating the <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> to the participating lock-requesting nodes, using advanced network primitives such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Atomic operations. This nicely complements the original idea of DLM, where <b>management</b> of the <b>lock</b> space is distributed. Our implementation achieves better load balancing, reduction in server load and improved throughput over traditional designs...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we aim to}} {{evaluate}} different Distributed <b>Lock</b> <b>Management</b> service designs with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). In specific, we implement and evaluate the centralized and the RDMA-enabled lock manager designs for fast network settings. Experimental results confirms a couple of hypotheses. First, in the traditional centralized lock manager design, CPU is the bottleneck and bypassing CPU on client-to-server communication using RDMA results in better lock service perofrmance. Second, different lock manager designs with RDMA in consideration result in even better performance; we need to re-design <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> system for RDMA and fast networks...|$|R

40|$|Sather, a {{parallel}} object-oriented programming language developed at ICSI, offers advanced thread synchronization constructs separating locking mechanism and policies. While a <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> system provides a general locking mechanism, synchronization objects define and implement different extensible policies. Commonly used synchronization {{objects such as}} mutual exclusion and reader/writer locks are provided by the standard Sather library. Synchronization objects with more complex semantics can be defined by the user. The conjunctive and disjunctive acquisition of collections of locks and the deadlock detection are distinct features of Sather supported by the locking mechanism. This paper introduces the Sather synchronization constructs and presents the design and implementation of a <b>lock</b> <b>management</b> runtime system. We argue that a clean, object-oriented design allows us to support sophisticated synchronization policies while preserving efficiency on distributed computin [...] ...|$|R
