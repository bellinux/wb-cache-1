40|$|This paper {{presents}} an informal process {{inspired by a}} public practice of conflict mediation used until {{a few decades ago}} in Gallura (NE Sardinia, Italy), named La Rasgioni (The Reason). The aim is twofold: (i) to introduce an innovative method that translates the complexity of water-related conflicts into a “dialogical tool”, aimed at enhancing social learning by adopting theatrical techniques; and (ii) to report the outcomes that emerged from the application of this method in Arborea, the main dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>district</b> and the only nitrate-vulnerable zone in Sardinia, to mediate contrasting positions between local entrepreneurs and representatives of the relevant institutions. We discuss our results in the light of four pillars, adopted as research lenses in the International research Project CADWAGO (Climate Change Adaptation and Water Governance), which consider the specific “social–ecological” components of the Arborea system, climate change adaptability in water governance institutions and organizations, systemic governance (relational) practices, and governance learning. The combination of the four CADWAGO pillars and La Rasgioni created an innovative dialogical space that enabled stakeholders and researchers to collectively identify barriers and opportunities for effective governance practices. Potential wider implications and applications of La Rasgioni process are also discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{identified the}} forms of share market, to calculate the price received by farmers and middlemen, and analyze marketing margins of beef cattle market. This research was conducted in June to August 2011, in Aceh Besar regency of Aceh province. The method {{used in this study}} was a survey method and field direct observations and interviews using questionnaires to farmers, middlemen (mugge)  and meat traders respondent. The number of samples were 420 respondents, including 270 respondents of livestock farmers, 105 respondents of middlemen (mugee) and 45 respondents of meat traders (final consumer) from the three districts. This study used regression analysis to determine the effect of variables simultaneously observed the marketing margin. The results showed there were 2 channel marketings, channel marketing I of farmers to the final consumer through two market participants were mugee and meat traders,while the marketing channel II from farmers to consumers through one market participants that was meat traders. In marketing channels I mugee get income share 24. 89 % with 10. 38 % share of the cost, while the meat traders got incomeshare 47. 70 % with 17. 03 % share of the cost. In marketing channels II meat tradersgot income share 83. 00 % with 17. 00 % share of the cost. In marketing channels I mugee marketing margin of Rp 1, 026, 293. 10 /head and the meat traders of Rp 1, 883, 045. 98 /head, while the meat traders of Rp 2, 944, 838. 00 /head. The coefficient ofdetermination (R 2) equalto 0. 337321, which means cattle marketing margin could be explained jointly by 33. 73 % by the marketing costs, the price at the farmer level and the number of middlemen. The test results of the marketing costs (x 1) significantly (P< 0. 05) on the marketing margin, the price at the farmer level (x 2) was highly significant (P< 0. 01) on the marketing margin and the number of middlemen (x 3) didnot affect the marketing margin.
