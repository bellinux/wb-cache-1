[...] The ceramic industry grew as the demand increased. [...] The [...] "Golden Era in tile making" [...] and art pottery, influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, was around 1910.

He experimented with that glaze in odd moments over a period of a dozen or fifteen years. The color comes out in the kiln. By control of heat he controlled the behavior of the coloring. Another unique glaze he produced was a Persian blue, a turquoise blue with pebble effect. Those were just two glazes of thousands he produced.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, one vessel type used in food {{preparation}} was closely {{linked with the}} spread of Roman culture and Roman cuisine: the [...] This was a robust shallow bowl with a thick, out-curved rim that {{made it easy to}} handle, often a pouring lip, and an internal surface deliberately roughened with a coating of grit or coarse sand during manufacture. It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman <b>ceramic</b> <b>products,</b> many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{people of}} Mukurweini are mainly farmers and whereas coffee {{is the main}} cash crop in the area, most of them {{practice}} subsistence farming due to {{the small size of}} family holdings. The north-west tip of the District adjacent to Othaya has a few farmers who grow tea. The area is well endowed and has several permanent rivers and numerous springs and streams. The include Rwarai, Gura, Mugono, Thagana, Gikira, Ndurumo, Thiha, Gathera and Ithanji rivers. There is however very little irrigation activity in spite of the dry spells which are now more frequent. The failure to harness these abundant water resources for irrigated farm production is a draw back to District's economic development and food self security. The Division does not experience extreme weather-related disasters beyond occasional droughts. Wajee Nature Park, a bird conservancy, located in Giathugu Location is a good site for all nature and bird watchers. There are a number of falls along Rwarai river with scenic beauty and area sight to behold. The river valleys in Mukurweini are home to many bird species a number of which are preserved at Wajee Nature Park. The camp has a high class restaurant and Boarding facilities which include pitched luxury tents. The lower parts of the Division particularly Rutune and Thanu Locations have sandy loam soils which are not conducive to subsistence farming. A few people are however involved in the growing of tobacco in the area.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore further on {{findings}} from previous research work which experimentally investigates {{the viability of}} digital and rapid prototyping in small and medium scale ceramic industries. The findings from the research revealed that digital and rapid prototyping are viable in reducing development time and improving prototype accuracy; however, based on the rapid technology (Fused Deposition Modeling) used for the research, the research shows that rapid prototyping is an expensive approach.
