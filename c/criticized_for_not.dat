5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters, and he was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> fully {{utilizing}} {{many of the}} features of the Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed. The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised to be coming later.|$|E
5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> {{putting his}} five ships {{that had the}} {{superior}} SG radar systems {{at the ends of}} his column, for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in poor visibility, particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, the 747X {{family was}} unable to garner enough {{interest}} to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept. Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X {{did not make it}} beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.|$|E

Virginia Tech {{was offered a}} berth after it finished its season 11–2, which culminated in a 38–10 loss in the 2011 ACC Championship Game to Clemson. Media attention focused {{on the quality of the}} bowl selection, as both teams were <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having strong schedules. Attention also focused on how Virginia Tech's defense would contain Michigan QB Denard Robinson.|$|E
5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E

5|$|Windows 8.1 {{received}} mixed reception, {{although more}} positive than Windows 8, with critics praising the expanded functionality available to apps {{in comparison to}} 8, its OneDrive integration, along with its user interface tweaks {{and the addition of}} expanded tutorials for operating the Windows 8 interface. Despite these improvements, Windows 8.1 was still <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> addressing all digressions of Windows 8 (such as a poor level of integration between Metro-style apps and the desktop interface), and the potential privacy implications of the expanded use of online services. , the market share of Windows 8.1 is 6.40%.|$|E
5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard {{continued}} {{commanding the}} defenses of Petersburg {{in the early}} days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, several younger German historians <b>criticized</b> Mommsen <b>for</b> <b>not</b> {{denouncing the}} Nazi past of his mentors while a {{university}} {{student in the}} 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Murphy <b>criticized</b> Farrelly <b>for</b> <b>not</b> {{including}} handicapped {{people in}} his movie Dumb & Dumber. This led to Murphy's first movie role in Farrelly's comedy movie Kingpin.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{and fans}} hailed the plot's dark {{atmosphere}} and realistic use of surveillance tech {{to make the}} story believable. But the film, however, has been <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> having <b>not</b> enough creativity <b>for</b> those looking for something more. It has also been <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> being too short.|$|R
5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he has been <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it {{as high as it}} was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, {{the cannon}} {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the Green Building sporting a giant 21-pound gold-plated aluminum Brass Rat around its barrel, which was positioned to point towards Pasadena, and female MIT students mockingly posted pictures of themselves posing in bikinis with the cannon. It was revealed that preparations for the heist had been underway since December. MIT was softly <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> leaving a note explaining that the theft was a prank, as required by Caltech's pranking ethics, which were said to be more stringent than MIT's, but the prank was largely taken in good humor at both campuses.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in them looking not as good as the PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E
25|$|The work {{received}} generally favorable reviews, though scholars <b>criticized</b> Foote <b>for</b> <b>not</b> including footnotes and for neglecting {{subjects such}} as economics and politics of the Civil War era.|$|R
50|$|The {{film has}} been <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> {{allegedly}} <b>not</b> being true {{to the details}} of his life and career and for inventing incidents and rearranging locations, such as Petey's appearance on The Tonight Show, which never actually took place.|$|R

5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{corpus of}} Kilmer's work was {{produced}} between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry {{fell out of}} favor and Modernism took root—especially with {{the influence of the}} Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer's verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics—he can be considered as one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, meter, and theme, and for being too sentimental to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Sakic {{was one of}} the top scorers in the league, but in {{his early}} years, he was <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> leading his team to playoff success. While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst teams in the league, {{finishing}} last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league. After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as capable of leading a team to success, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the character development but some <b>criticized</b> it <b>for</b> <b>not</b> advancing enough story, {{which has been}} another point of criticism for the last episodes.|$|R
