40|$|ABSTRACT: Free-range {{chickens}} are sentinels for {{the presence}} of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in the environment because they feed from ground. T. gondii infected chickens are also an important source of infection for cats that shed environmentally resistant oocysts after eating infected chicken tissues. We surveyed 50 free-range chickens from Oyo State, Nigeria {{for the presence}} of T. gondii antibodies using the modified agglutination <b>test</b> (MAT). All <b>chickens</b> <b>tested</b> seropositive with MAT titers of 1 : 5 in 8 chickens, 1 : 1 : 25 in 9 chickens, 1 : 100 in 19 chickens, and 1 : 500 in 14 chickens.

40|$|Strategies for {{differentiating}} infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) require improvement {{for increased}} surveillance of avian influenza (AI), where vaccination is employed to control disease. We propose a novel DIVA approach for chickens using tetanus toxoid (TT) as an exogenous marker independent of serotype and relatedness of circulating and vaccine strains. Of 1779 <b>chickens</b> <b>tested</b> from Australia, Hong Kong and China, 100 % were seronegative for TT-specific antibodies without vaccination. Tetanus toxoid adjuvanted to mineral oil was immunogenic in chickens. Co-delivery of both TT and inactivated LPAI (H 6 N 2) vaccines in chickens elicited strong TT and influenza-specific antibody responses, which persisted to 53 weeks post-vaccination. Furthermore, immunization {{with a combined}} vaccine composed of TT and AI induced high levels of antibodies to both antigens. We conclude that TT is a highly suitable exogenous marker for AI vaccination in chickens allowing simple and effective monitoring of AI vaccination status...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The cell-mediated immune (CMI) {{response}} to diphtheria toxoid (DT) was studied in commercial broiler breeder lines. The chickens were immunized with DT in complete Freund's adjuvant 21 days before CMI assay by delayed wattle reactivity (DWR) to DT. The DWR {{was shown to}} be a valid measure of CMI and to correlate with spleen cell migration inhibition and blastogenesis assays of CMI in vitro. In addition, each criterion of CMI was met, except for the passive transfer of DWR. These criteria were delayed timing, gross morphology, histopathology of DWR, and effect of antilymphocytic sera on DWR. The duration of DWR over a 1 -year period differed in the two lines of <b>chickens</b> <b>tested.</b> A significantly greater DWR was found in one line with all birds remaining reactive for CMI whereas in the other line 16 % did not have CMI {{by the end of the}} year.

40|$|Rapeseed {{proteins}} {{have been}} considered as being poorly digestible in the gut of non-ruminants. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the digestibility of napin and cruciferin in ileal digesta of broiler <b>chickens,</b> <b>testing</b> sixteen samples of rapeseed co-products with protein levels ranging from 293 g/kg to 560 g/kg dry matter. Each sample was included into a semi-synthetic diet at a rate of 500 g/kg and evaluated with broiler chickens in a randomised design. Dietary and ileal digesta proteins were extracted and identified by gel-based liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Three isomers of napin (a 2 S albumin) and nine cruciferins (an 11 S globulin) were identified in the rapeseed co-products, whereas six endogenous enzymes such as trypsin (I-P 1, II-P 29), chymotrypsin (elastase and precursor), carboxypeptidase B and α-amylase were found in the ileal digesta. It is concluded that as none of the rapeseed proteins were detected in the ileal digesta, rapeseed proteins can be readily digested by broiler chickens, irrespective of the protein content in the diet...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the regression versus progression of v-src-DNA-induced sarcomas is dependent on chicken line. As a first step in analyzing the role of tumor immunity as a determinant of this line dependence, experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether an antisarcoma immune response is generated in the course of sarcoma growth in TK chickens, a regressor line. To assay for this response, <b>test</b> TK <b>chickens</b> in which v-src-induced wing web sarcomas had regressed, as well as control TK chickens that had not been exposed to v-src, were challenged in protocols known to yield v-src-dependent sarcoma formation and monitored for challenge sarcoma growth.

40|$|ABSTRACT Level of humoral immune {{response}} to GAT {{has been associated with}} the MHC of chickens. Matings between two unrelated lines of chickens with low antibody response to GAT (G-Bl and SI Line B 19 L) resulted in progeny that were higher responders to GAT challenge (P <. 05) than either of the parental lines. Progeny of matings between two related sublines that are low responders to GAT (SI Lines B 19 L and B 1 L) had antibody responses to GAT that were not higher than the parental lines. Progeny of the between-line cross were backcrossed to SI B 19 L and G-Bl (B 13) parental lines, as well as mated inter se. These matings produced F 2 progeny whose GAT response was significantly associated (P <. 05) with their MHC (Ea-B) type. The progeny were of three MHC types (B 19 Bi 9, B 19 B 13, and B 13 B 13) that bound 66. 6, 71. 9, and 4. 6 %, respectively, of the GAT in a radioimmunoassay.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{learning}} and memory using the chicken model has relied on three learning paradigms, passive avoidance learning, imprinting and the pebble floor task. Passive avoidance learning and imprinting have been used predominantly in very young chickens and cannot be used to access learning and memory in older chickens. We have established a new behavioural learning paradigm, Discriminative Taste Aversion Learning (DTAL), {{that can be used}} with both young and older animals. The task requires chickens to discriminate between food crumbs dyed either red or yellow with one colour being associated with the aversive tasting substance, methylanthranilate. Learning can be tested at various times after the training session by presenting chickens with the coloured food crumbs without an aversive taste. Both <b>chickens</b> <b>tested</b> at 5 and 15 days post-hatch learned to avoid the aversive crumbs. Furthermore, the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (30 mM; 10 μl per hemisphere) injected into the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale 15 min pre-training or 45 min post-training blocked long-term memory for the DTAL task when tested 24 h later. Memory for the task was unaffected by anisomycin injection 120 min post-training or in control animals injected with saline at similar times. The timing of the cellular processes of protein synthesis needed for consolidation of the DTAL appears to be similar to those described for the other behavioural paradigms in young chickens...|$|R

Isolation of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was positive for 72 (25. 7 %) of the 280 <b>chickens</b> <b>tested,</b> with the frequency varying from 2. 2 to 100 % according to flock. A total of 45 appropriate isolates were selected and subjected to identification. Of the 45 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates selected, 37 were identified as Staphylococcus sciuri, 5 were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 3 were identified as Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The distribution of the species was different among the flocks. Comparative analysis of the SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the isolates could have originated from a single clone of each of S. sciuri and S. saprophyticus and three clones of S. epidermidis. By two methods based on the PCR technique, the mecA gene was detected in all five representative isolates of each methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal clone. The nucleotide sequence of a PCR fragment obtained from an isolate of S. sciuri was completely identical to the corresponding region of mecA genes reported in human methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates.
