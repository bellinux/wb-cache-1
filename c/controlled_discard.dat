This leads to tunnel vision, limited lateral thinking, and forced attention to minutia with limited added value. PhD projects, in particular, are severely affected by this. Students focus on a piece of work for 3 – 4 years to find themselves an expert on a subject of limited importance before entering post-doc life. There are simple ways to encourage lateral thinking in science and open up strategic space for unconventional, exciting and stimulating research that matters. Here we focus on various examples of lateral approaches to create synergy (use or application of knowledge or practices from non-related fields) and subsequent added value (appropriation of that knowledge, practice or process to deliver a real benefit to your own field of research).

However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the δ 15 N of the N source and the 14 N/ 15 N fractionation in plants under ammonium (NH 4 +) nutrition. When NH 4 + is the major N source, the two forms, NH 4 + and NH 3, are present in the nutrient solution. There is a 1. 025 thermodynamic isotope effect between NH 3 (g) and NH 4 + (aq) which drives to a different δ 15 N. Nine plant species with different NH 4 + -sensitivities were cultured hydroponically with NO 3 - or NH 4 + as the sole N sources, and plant growth and δ 15 N were determined. Short-term NH 4 + /NH 3 uptake experiments at pH 6. 0 and 9. 0 (which favours NH 3 form) were carried out in order to support and substantiate our hypothesis. N source fractionation throughout the whole plant was interpreted on the basis of the relative transport of NH 4 + and NH 3. Results Several NO 3 - -fed plants were consistently enriched in 15 N, whereas plants under NH 4 + nutrition were depleted of 15 N. It was shown that more sensitive plants to NH 4 + toxicity were the most depleted in 15 N. In parallel, N-deficient pea and spinach plants fed with 15 NH 4 + showed an increased level of NH 3 uptake at alkaline pH that was related to the 15 N depletion of the plant.

Lack of reliable, cheap and easy-to-use instruments, associated with the chaotic and varying nature of the meteorological and plant physiological factors influencing ET cause these estimations to be based on calculated values rather than the measured ones. The two-step approach where ET from a reference crop is calculated and multiplied by empirical crop coefficients to obtain ET from a crop has gained wide acceptance. Daily coefficients for a winter wheat crop growing under standard conditions, i. e. not short of water and growing under optimal agronomic conditions, were estimated for a cold sub-humid climate regime. One of the two methods used to estimate ET from a reference crop required net radiation (Rn) as input. Two sets of coefficients were used for calculating Rn. Weather data from a meteorological station was used to estimate Rn and ET from the reference crop. The winter wheat ET was measured using an eddy covariance system during the main parts of the growing seasons 2004 and 2005. The meteorological data and field measurements were quality <b>controlled</b> and <b>discarded</b> from the analysis if flagged for errors.

The length stroke {{is a part}} of the Opticruise system, in which the mechanical gear shifting process is performed by pneumatic actuators. To reduce piston velocity before the cylinder walls are reached, an oil damper is attached to the pneumatic actuator. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate if the oil damper can be replaced by a pneumatic feedback control law, a model predictive control scheme or an alter-native mechanical construction; in the interest of cost reduction, robustness, shift comfort and shift time. To be able to do a systematic analysis, a mathematical model of the length stroke is developed. The model, developed using a length stroke that is not mounted on a truck, captures the essential dynamics of the system and is used to evaluate control strategies and investigate system properties. As the delay in feedback information from the different sensors is larger than the process time constant, a pneumatic feedback <b>control</b> law is <b>discarded.</b> A mode...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: While genetic {{determinants}} of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are well characterised {{in the general}} population, they are understudied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective {{was to determine the}} association of established LDL and RA genetic alleles with LDL levels in RA cases compared with non-RA controls. Methods: Using data from electronic medical records, we linked validated RA cases and non-RA <b>controls</b> to <b>discarded</b> blood samples. For each individual, we extracted data on: first LDL measurement, age, gender and year of LDL measurement. We genotyped subjects for 11 LDL and 44 non-HLA RA alleles, and calculated RA and LDL genetic risk scores (GRS). We tested the association between each GRS and LDL level using multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, year of LDL measurement and RA status. Results: Among 567 RA cases and 979 controls, 80 % were female and mean age at the first LDL measurement was 55  years. RA cases had significantly lower mean LDL levels than controls (117. 2 vs 125. 6  mg/dl, respectively, p< 0. 0001). Each unit increase in LDL GRS was associated with 0. 8  mg/dl higher LDL levels in both RA cases and controls (p= 3. 0 × 10 [superscript − 7]). Each unit increase in RA GRS was associated with 4. 3  mg/dl lower LDL levels in both groups (p= 0. 01). Conclusions: LDL alleles were associated with higher LDL levels in RA. RA alleles were associated with lower LDL levels in both RA cases and controls. As RA cases carry more RA alleles, these findings suggest a genetic basis for epidemiological observations of lower LDL levels in RA. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)
