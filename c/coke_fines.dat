For understanding the behavior of coke at various HM productivities, a tuyere coke sampler was used to collect the coke samples for measuring the coke strength.

The primary objective of this research is to determine how bed wetness affects entrainment. First, a new {{fluidized bed}} was constructed, and a novel pseudo-isokinetic sampling was developed and tested to collect entrained solids. Then the entrainment from the dry bed in the bubbling and the turbulent regime was investigated. The cluster analysis was performed and showed an improvement in predicting the flux of solids ejected from bed surface, above the TDH, and across the freeboard. In the next chapter, the effect of the different levels of bed wetness on flux and size distribution of the entrained particles was studied, and the results were compared to the ones obtained for the dry bed. It was observed that in the bubbling regime, the presence of liquid can change the bubble properties in the bed which will affect the entrainment. However, the effect of low liquid loading on entrainment in turbulent regime was found to be negligible.

40|$|Based on 100 % pellets {{operation}} at BF No. 3 at SSAB Tunnplåt in Luleå a new pellet with CaO/SiO 2 = 1 was developed during early nineties. The pellet showed good results in metallurgical laboratory test but caused slag formation {{problems in the}} bosh. A high basicity slag was formed during interaction with basic fluxes and its melting point was increased when the slag was finally reduced. By injection of basic fluxes, the slag formation problems in the bosh can be avoided. Without a sinter plant, dusts have to be recycled in a cold bonded briquette. Injection of some of BF flue dust would improve {{the properties of the}} briquette and may be beneficial for the BF process. Based on top charging or tuyere-injection of basic fluxes and the injection of BF flue dust studies have been done. The studies carried out will clarify some phenomena of slag formation and the effect of co- injection on coal combustion in the blast furnace, including the effect of: 1) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are top- charged; 2) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are tuyere injected; 3) chemical composition and metallurgical properties of pellet and fluxes on slag formation; 4) reduction conditions on (reduction temperature, reducing gas composition) on bosh slag formation; 5 co- injection of BOF slag or BF flue dust on coal combustion efficiency and BF performance. From the results, it can be concluded that the interaction between pellets and fluxes starts when softening and melting starts in the cohesive layer. By choosing fluxes of a high melting point the dissolution of them in the bosh slag can be delayed and the excessive basicity of the bosh slag can be limited. A basic flux with a low melting point will easily dissolve into the bosh slag causing its basicity to increase, which is beneficial to S refining when acid pellets are used. The formation of a bosh slag of excessive basicity (which causes BF operation disturbances, because its high melting point, increases further during reduction) can be avoided by tuyere injection of basic fluxes with the coal. The positive effect is greatest when a fluxed pellet of basicity B 2  1 and with a high Fe content is used as ferrous burden. In this case, the slag amount can be significantly decreased. BOF slag has suitable high-temperature properties for use as a basic flux in combination with e. g., olivine pellets. It has a low softening and melting temperature, does not shrink, is slowly reduced in the BF shaft and its properties are almost unaffected by the partial reduction occurring in the shaft of the BF. BOF slag absorbs a low content of alkalies, which causes volume increase at elevated temperatures, when the basicity is still high. The results indicate that co-injection of BOF slag or BF flue dust with PC has positive effects on the BF operation. The injection of BOF slag decreases the Si content in HM by an increased basicity of the slag formed during combustion leading to a decreased activity of SiO 2 in the slag and by an increased FeO content in the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of reducing agents can be reduced because of a decreased Si content in HM and a decreased slag amount. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of improved melting properties of tuyere slag caused by an increased basicity and FeO content, consumption of coal and <b>coke</b> <b>fines</b> by FeO and improved radial transport of tuyere slag. The injection of BOF slag improves the bosh slag because an excessive basicity caused by top-charged fluxes added for neutralisation of coal and coke ashes and non-uniform slag formation caused by uneven distribution of top-charged fluxes are avoided. The productivity increases because of the possibility to decrease the slag amount. The injection of BOF slag can be done without negative effects on combustion efficiency by using very finely ground BOF slag and because of improved total consumption of coal and <b>coke</b> <b>fines</b> by direct reduction in the coke bed. The injection of BF flue dust decreases the Si content in HM by an increased FeO content of the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of coal and coke is decreased because of a high of C content in BF flue dust and the decreased Si content in HM. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of consumption of coal and <b>coke</b> <b>fines</b> by FeO and improved melting properties of tuyere slag promoting the radial transport of the tuyere slag. The injection of BF flue dust can be done without negative effects on the total consumption of coal and <b>coke</b> <b>fines</b> by direct reduction in the coke bed. Injected BF flue dust supplies oxygen for combustion, but because of endothermic reactions as reduction of hematite and calcination of limestone occurring in the BF flue dust at the same temperatures as release and disintegration of VM, it will {{have a negative effect on}} the combustion of HV coal.

40|$|To produce {{structurally}} sound carbon anodes for use {{in aluminum}} smelting, a strong bond between filler and binder coke is necessary. Bond strength results from mechanical interlocking and adhesion of the binder coke to the filler coke. Critical for creating such bonds {{is the ability of}} the pitch to wet the coke surface and penetrate the coke porosity during mixing and forming. Wettability is normally assessed from the pitch behavior during the initial stages of a penetration test. In the test, the observed contact angle between a pitch droplet and a bed of <b>fine</b> <b>coke</b> particles is recorded as the temperature is increased. The temperature at which this contact angle becomes 90 ° {{is referred to as the}} wetting temperature of the pitch. The penetration test may be useful to identify pitch and coke combinations that are unlikely to produce baked anodes of acceptable quality with standard paste preparation conditions. It does not, however, provide a measure of the true wettability of a coke by a pitch. The isothermal penetration experiments reported here demonstrate that the observed contact angle of a pitch against a coke bed changes continuously from 90 ° to 90 °, even to 0 °, at a temperature much lower than the wetting temperature derived from the penetration test. The requirements for the measurement of a true contact angle and the difference between the concepts of adhesion and wetting are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In an {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} bed, the combustion behaviour of coke particles together with {{velocity of the}} flowing gas stream determines the temperature, width and speed of the traversing flame front. A bed heat treatment mathematical model was formulated in an earlier study to describe this complex relationship. An area of improvement in the model is {{the description of the}} coke combustion process, which is highly dependent on the resistances controlling the flow of gases to and from the coke particles. These vary for different coke particles because of the prior coarsening of the sinter mix by granulation. The characteristic structure of granules – nuclear particle with an adhering fines layer – indicates that gases have better access to <b>finer</b> <b>coke</b> particles. In this study, an available granulation model is integrated into the heat treatment model to provide a novel description of coke positioning within granules. In addition to this change, two endothermic reactions were introduced into the model. Using the previous and modified models, predicted bed temperature–time profiles as a function of position down the bed, were compared against embedded thermocouples results from seventeen laboratory sinter tests. Generally, the modified definition of coke combustion behaviour resulted in improved comparison with experimental results. In the sintering literature, studies have been reported on: the use of charcoal/biomass char to replace coke, the preferential placement of coke particles on the outside of granules, and varying the size distribution of the coke particles. Improving the access of gases to coke particles and decreasing coke size are comparable to using more reactive fuels. Combustion rate, efficiency and flame front properties are all influenced by fuel reactivity. Model predictions of changes in bed temperatures, flame front properties and sintering performance caused by fuel type, location and size are consistent with reported observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} consumes {{a large amount}} of high quality {{metallurgy}} coke (size 35 - 80 mm) in addition to ore in the form of pellets and sinter. This coke is the coarse fraction, derived from the <b>coke</b> plant. The <b>fine</b> fraction (8 - 35 mm), arise after sieving, named nut coke, can’t be directly used in blast furnace. The fraction of smaller than 8 mm is used in the sinter plant. Therefore, a large fraction of coke around 20 % from coking plant/process is not used for iron ore reduction. Recent research indicates that usage of nut coke will be economic if properly used. Nut coke cannot be directly mixed with normal coke because it will decrease the permeability of the coke layer in the blast furnace. However, mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden layer could be an effective way to use the coke resource economically. This mixed charging could improve softening and melting behaviour, reduction kinetics and permeability and also make full use of the coke resource. It may, however, also worsen the layer permeability and even deteriorate the whole blast furnace process. The mechanism of the effect of mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace is still not clear, and thus the usage of nut coke is still limited. To investigate the effect and mechanism of using nut coke in the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace, cold flow model experiments and high temperature experiments have been conducted.

Coke samples were obtained through tuyere drilling and analysed using a range of analytical tools including XRD, SEM and high temperature reactors with emphasis on mineralogy, carbon structure and reactivity. Carbon structure was found to be a suitable indicator to assess tuyere-level temperature. Quartz and mullite were found to be significantly reduced in tuyere-level cokes while SiC and ferrosilicon alloys were the most notable Si bearing minerals formed. Recirculating alkalis were found to have most significant impact on coke apparent reactivity. Graphitization was found to contribute in - 0. 45 mm <b>coke</b> <b>fines</b> generation. The injection rate was found to have most distinct effect on the coke samples from the bosh and raceway regions. High injection rate cokes were distinguished by a greater degree of graphitization, less amount of SiC and complete absence of mullite phase. Ferrosilicon phases were not influenced. The apparent reaction rates of high injection rate cokes was shown to be marginally lower, which is attributed to higher degree of graphitization and less amount of adsorbed potassium. The study suggested that the effect of injection rate on the modification of coke properties is mainly attributed to changes in temperature profile of tuyere-level regions. The ferrosilicon alloys were found to catalyse coke graphitization intensity. The hot metal was shown to have a stronger effect on the ferrosilicon formation compare to in situ formation. Quartz particle size {{does not seem to be}} a critical factor in SiC formation in tuyere-level cokes due to such long reaction time at high temperatures.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} in use of reducing agents in blast furnace (BF) ironmaking has been significantly improved over the years. At most blast furnaces, auxiliary fuels are injected to replace some of the coke. To further reduce carbon consumption, prevention of losses and modification of raw materials or process conditions are required. In this study coke properties, their development during the descent in the BF under different process conditions, contribution to off-gas dust as well as modifications of coke aiming for reduced energy consumption in the BF have been investigated. The changes in chemical composition of coke ash, mineral phase developments and coke participation in the endothermic gasification reaction with CO 2 and coke graphitisation were studied. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the losses of material in the off-gas, a characterisation of the off-gas dust and its connection to BF conditions and coke property development in the BF has been made. Coke properties have been studied in the laboratory and in samples taken out from different parts of the LKAB Experimental BF (EBF®) during varied operational set-ups. Properties of coke from the BF high-temperature region were studied via tuyere core-drilling of samples from the EBF and an industrial-scale BF. The results showed that the coarser dry flue dust is mechanically formed. <b>Coke</b> <b>fines</b> originating from the upper shaft dominates the coarser fractions. Gasification in the shaft has a negligible effect on the high quality coke used in the EBF. The finer dust fraction, sludge, consists mainly of chemically formed spherical particles in the order of < 1 μm. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high-temperature area precipitate from the ascending gas as the temperature decreases. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are favourable for low flue dust amounts expelled from the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured in the standardised test, was compared with coke from basket samples charged into the EBF. Coke reactivity in the EBF is considerably lower for all coke types studied compared to coke studied in the CRI/CSR test. Due to higher gasification in the laboratory test the ash content is higher in that test. However, gaseous components in the EBF, such as recirculated alkali, contribute to changed ash composition in BF coke. Laboratory studies using fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) on the same material, original as well as Fe- and Ca-activated coke samples, identified the effects on reaction behaviour and were the basis for selection of the potentially best method for activating nut coke to achieve higher reactivity with CO 2 when charged into iron-bearing layers. All types of Fe- and Ca-containing activation agents used increase the apparent reaction rates for coke with low reactivity and contents of catalytic components in the ash. Activation with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 has the strongest effect on the reactivity, followed by slurry of Ca(OH) 2 and iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) in descending order. Use of a non-specific weight loss in TGA as a basis for apparent reaction rate demands measurements in a temperature interval free from other reactions involving the activation agents. The reaction rate is reduced when CO is present in the reaction gas. Aiming for a method for determination of thermal history in BF samples the correlation between temperature and coke graphitisation was studied using three different data processing methods for removing the influence from overlapping peaks during X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural changes in coke during heat treatment are accompanied by chemical transformations in ash compounds and changed the pattern of disturbing peaks. Key ash phases were SiO 2 and mullite. At high temperatures (~ 1500 °C) the SiO 2 peaks are reduced in magnitude and finally disappear to be replaced with SiC peaks. The graphitisation was correlated with temperature and time in argon atmosphere and the impact from hot metal and slag was investigated. The graphitisation degree in coke samples from the EBF raceway and hearth was estimated and the evolution of structural order was found to be suitable in order to estimate the thermal history of coke in blast furnaces. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high temperature area are precipitated from the ascending gas as the temperature is decreased. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust.
