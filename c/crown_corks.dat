50|$|Until {{many years}} after the {{invention}} in 1892 of <b>crown</b> <b>corks,</b> beer bottles were stopped with corks. The increasing popularity of bottled beer created {{a need for a}} faster corkscrew. This led to the invention of a variety of “automatic” corkscrew mechanisms patented in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States, England and several European countries.|$|E

The deposit for beer bottles sealed with <b>crown</b> <b>corks</b> is €0.08; for bottles with flip-top closures, the deposit is €0.15.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>corks</b> are {{collected}} by {{people around the}} world who admire the variety of designs and relative ease of storage. Collectors tend to prefer the term crown cap over corks. In Mexico, these are called corcholatas. In Spain and South America, the names chapas or chapitas are used. (In northern Chile, the name calas is used.) In the Philippines, the term tansan is employed.|$|E
50|$|The {{crown cork}} (also {{known as a}} crown seal, crown cap or just a cap), the first form of bottle cap, was invented by William Painter in 1892 in Baltimore. The company making it was {{originally}} called the Bottle Seal Company, but it changed its name with the almost immediate success of the crown cork to the Crown Cork and Seal Company. It still informally goes by that name, but is officially Crown Holdings. <b>Crown</b> <b>corks</b> {{are similar to the}} Pilfer proof caps, as usage of both products is to seal the bottle.|$|E

5000|$|A {{corkscrew}} is a {{tool for}} drawing corks from wine bottles, beer bottles and other household bottles before the invention of screw caps and <b>Crown</b> <b>corks.</b> In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the [...] "worm") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further {{increase the amount of}} force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks.|$|E
5000|$|Lotería is the Spanish {{word for}} lottery. The deck is {{composed}} {{of a set of}} 54 different images, each one in a card. To start the game, the caller (cantor, or singer) randomly selects a card from the deck and announces it to the players by its name, sometimes using a riddle or humorous patter instead of reading the card name. The players with a matching pictogram on their board mark it off with a chip or other kind of marker (many Mexican people traditionally use small rocks, <b>crown</b> <b>corks</b> or pinto beans as markers). The first player with four chips in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, squared pattern,any other previously specified pattern, or fills the tabla first shouts [...] "¡Lotería!" [...] (Lottery!) or [...] "¡Buenas!" [...] (Good!) and is the winner.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, soda bottles had ordinary cork bottle stoppers and often had rounded bottoms so they could not be stored standing upright. The reason for this is corks have a tendency to dry out and shrink, which allows the gas pressure in the bottle to cause the cork to [...] "pop." [...] Storing bottles on their side prevents the corks from drying out and [...] "popping." [...] After {{the invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, this problem was eliminated, and soda bottles could be stored standing upright.|$|R

40|$|Different beers with {{intensive}} hop {{additions to}} achieve a hop bouquet were aged for up to 700 days at 20 °C and 30 °C and {{the behavior of the}} hop aroma substances was examined, based on low oxygen bottling and the use of scavenger <b>crown</b> <b>corks.</b> Special attention was paid to the linalool, which produced the following results in summary: - the stereoisomers R-linalool and S-linalool are observed separately, because R-linalool is much more sensorily active than S-linalool - R-linalool as %-rel. of total linalool decreases about 30 % per year at 20 °C, S-linalool increases about 150 % per year - The R-linalool decreases from 90 % in fresh beer to 75 % within one year at 20 °C - Influences from the type of hopping (for example in the wort or dry hopping) or the type of beer (for example bottom fermenting or top fermenting) were not noticeable - Since R-linalool is sensorily much more active than S-linalool, the decrease in R-linalool plays a decisive role. Just the analysis of total linalool is not sufficient to describe sensory effects. The behavior of other aroma substances during storage at 20 °C can be defined as follows: - Monoterpenes were surprisingly stable; the sesquiterpenes too suffered only slight losses - Some carboxylic esters are relatively stable, the majority decreased by 12 and 20 % per 100 days at 20 °C - Of the monoterpene alcohols R-linalool decreased significantly, nerol and geraniol behaved differently, whereas alpha-terpineol and 1 -terpinen- 4 -ol increased - The oxidized sesquiterpenes decreased slightly - Beta-damascenone and 2 terpene ethers increased significantly The examinations did not include sensory assesment. Obviously the decrease in R-linalool leads to less hoppy-floral notes and the loss of some esters means less fruity notes. Overall the hop aroma substances proved to be more stable than presumed. A hop aroma in the beer will change during beer aging but will not completely disappear depending on the original impact. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|As U. S. Industries work {{to become}} more {{competitive}} in a global market, employers have at various time turned to processes for involving employees in decision-making and harnessing valuable employee insight in areas related to workplace efficiency and plant safety, among others. However, these mechanisms risk running afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, Section 8 (a) (2), which prohibits employer domination or interference with labor organizations. In a line of decisions between 1992 and 2001, the NLRB has developed a doctrine for employee involvement based around Section 8 (a) (2) and the scope of “dealing with” under Section 2 (5). This Comment analyzes the recent trends in the “dealing with” doctrine, focusing on changes to the “delegated managerial authority” exception analysis after the Board’s decision in <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal Co. This Comment criticizes the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal test as imprecise and potentially unbalancing, and recommends that the Board either narrow its application of <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal to similarly comprehensive employee participation programs or apply a test for managerial authority that conforms to its “managerial employee” test, as developed in Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva University...|$|R
