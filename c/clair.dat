5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} <b>Clair</b> Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing <b>Clair</b> Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary <b>Clair</b> iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E

5|$|Bruce Robert Jackson (3 June 1949 – 29 January 2011) was an Australian audio {{engineer}} who co-founded JANDS, an Australian audio, lighting and staging company. He joined American touring audio engineer Roy <b>Clair</b> and mixed concert stage monitors for Elvis Presley in the 1970s. With <b>Clair</b> Brothers, a concert sound company, Jackson designed audio electronics including a custom mixing console. Beginning in 1978, Jackson toured as Bruce Springsteen's band engineer for a decade, using <b>Clair</b> Brothers sound systems. A business interest in Fairlight CMI in Sydney introduced Jackson to digital audio, and he subsequently founded the digital audio company Apogee Electronics in Santa Monica, California, {{where he lived}} at the time. After selling his share of Apogee, Jackson co-founded with Roy and Gene <b>Clair</b> a joint venture which produced the <b>Clair</b> iO, a loudspeaker management system for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson turned the venture commercial {{with the help of}} Dave McGrath's Lake Technology. Dolby Laboratories bought the technology and formed Dolby Lake with Jackson as vice president, then in 2009 Lab.gruppen acquired the brand. Jackson was honoured with the Parnelli Innovator Award in 2005 for his inventive loudspeaker controller.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{assisted}} <b>Clair</b> Brothers by teaming with Ron Borthwick {{to design}} a mixing console that folded up into its own road case, a proprietary model used by <b>Clair</b> Brothers for some 12 years of top tours. The console used novel plasma bargraph meters which displayed both average and peak sound levels, combining the characteristics of fast peak meters and slower VU meters. <b>Clair</b> Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound console to incorporate parametric equalisation.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, {{just hours}} before Sullivan's arrival, Thompson sent 600 troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Arthur St. <b>Clair</b> toward Trois-Rivières with the goal of {{surprising}} and beating back the small British force believed to be there. Sullivan, on his arrival at Sorel, immediately dispatched Thompson with an additional 1,600 men to follow. These forces caught up with St. <b>Clair</b> at Nicolet, where defenses against troop movements on the river were erected the next day. On the night of June 7, Thompson, St. <b>Clair,</b> and about 2,000 men crossed the river, landing at Pointe du Lac, a few miles above Trois-Rivières.|$|E

5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote <b>Clair</b> and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of <b>Clair</b> being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than <b>Clair,</b> who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
