40|$|High-quality {{products}} and shorten manufacturing lead time {{are very important}} factors addressed by many companies. Typically, low-quality products are induced by inconsistent of manufacturing process performance. To get a constant laser power in Infrared (IR) Laser Marking process was a common problem facing by many engineers in the manufacturing industry. This consequences might effect on laser marking characteristics such as the possibility of burn marking or blur marking particularly on the products. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to study the interaction between Infrared (IR) Laser Marking input parameters such as <b>current</b> (<b>amp),</b> frequency (Hz), water flow (l/min) and laser beam size (mm) on laser power (watt) as the main response. Furthermore, the response of laser power from Infra-Red laser process can be predicted when all combinations of parameters are tested. The IR marking machine was deployed and experimental studies were conducted in order to meet this objective. The experiments were based on Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) because second order model or polynomial equation was needed to fit for the response. The relationship between input and output parameters can be visualized by 3 D graphs which were developed from Mathematical modeling. Based on the experiment results, the parameters that have significant effects on the laser power are current, laser beam size and water flow.

40|$|The {{sources of}} energy are limited but the need is growing and {{electricity}} {{is one of the}} highest operational costs of a building. The high cost is mainly contributed by the electrical energy consumption of the air-conditioning and lighting systems. Optimizing the power consumption of a building without sacrificing the occupants’ comfort is extremely important as this will reduce electricity bills while maintaining the productivity level of the building’s occupants. This work adopts the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA), for solving the multi-objective optimization problem of the power consumption and comfort in a building, focusing on the room temperature and illumination. The case study involves the use of one air conditioning unit and 12 units of 36 -watt fluorescent lamps in a 5 -m 2 room with the objective of minimizing the power consumption and maximizing comfort. With the application of the GA, the demand requirements have been satisfied. Comparisons between the use of the optimization technique and without the optimization technique have been carried out, both in simulation and real-time experiments. The results show that the GA optimization produces a 23. 85 % reduction in terms of <b>current</b> (<b>amp),</b> 24. 68 % reduction in terms of power (w), 23. 09 % reduction kWh, and 22. 81 % reduction in terms of the electric billing cost...|$|E

50|$|A bulk {{electrolysis}} is best {{performed in}} a three part cell in which both the auxiliary electrode and reference electrode have their own cell which connects to the cell containing the working electrode. This isolates the undesired redox events taking place at the auxiliary electrode. During bulk electrolysis, the analyte undergoes a redox event at the working electrode. If the system was open, {{then it would be}} possible for the product of that reaction to diffuse back to the auxiliary electrode and undergo the inverse redox reaction. In addition to maintaining the proper current at the working electrode, the auxiliary electrode will experience extreme potentials often oxidizing or reducing the solvent or electrolyte to balance the current. In voltammetry experiments, the <b>currents</b> (<b>amps)</b> are so small and it is not a problem to decompose a small amount of solvent or electrolyte. In contrast, a bulk electrolysis involves currents greater by several orders of magnitude. At the auxiliary electrode, this greater current would decompose a significant amount of the solution/electrolyte and probably boiling the solution in the process all in an effort to balance the current. To mitigate this challenge the auxiliary cell will often contain a stoichiometric or greater amount of sacrificial reductant (ferrocene) or sacrificial oxidant (ferrocenium) to balance the overall redox reaction.|$|R

40|$|In arc welding, {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from the welding electrode to the base metal by an electric arc. When the welder starts the arc, both the base metal and the filler metal are melted to create the weld. This melting is possi-ble because a sufficient amount of power (energy transferred per unit time) and energy density is supplied to the electrode. Heat input is a relative measure of the energy transferred per unit length of weld. It is an important characteristic because, like preheat and interpass temperature, it influences the cooling rate, which may affect the mechanical properties and metallurgical structure of the weld and the HAZ (see Figure 1). Heat input is typically calculated as {{the ratio of the}} power (i. e., voltage x current) to the velocity of the heat source (i. e., the arc) as follows: where, H = heat input (kJ/in or kJ/mm) E = arc voltage (volts) I = <b>current</b> (<b>amps)</b> S = travel speed (in/min or mm/min) This equation is useful for comparing different welding procedures for a given welding process.
