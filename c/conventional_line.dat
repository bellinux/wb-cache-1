25|$|During the AKB48 Group Rinji Sokai {{concert in}} Nippon Budokan in April 2013, AKB48 {{announced}} {{her return to}} Team K and concurrent membership with SNH48. In the 2013 AKB48 general election, she finished tenth overall. During the election results event, she declared her plans to focus on SNH48, and after confirmation with AKB48 management, became the first AKB48 member to voluntarily drop concurrency. As a result, she {{did not participate in}} the rock-paper-scissors tournament in 2013 and rarely appeared with the group until February 2014, when AKB48 announced Miyazawa's transfer to Nagoya-based SKE48 at the Grand Reformation Festival, while staying a concurrent member of SNH48. She was appointed the 'leader' of SKE48's Team S. This time, she accepted the new position after learning of the transfer via a live phone call from that event. However, she suffered a significant decrease in popularity in the process, as she lost over 21000 votes compared to 2013 in the 2014 AKB48 general election, but still managed to maintain the 12th position overall. In SKE48, Miyazawa appeared frequently as one of the leading members in commercial campaigns, TV and stage performances, and had since then been selected to appear in AKB48's 38th single, her first regular single appearance since Sayonara Crawl, and her 29th title track performance overall. In the general election for the 41st single in 2015, she recovered from the heavy loss in 2014, by adding 31,000 votes to her result and ranking in at the 8th position, her personal best. Before the event, she stated that she would not be participating in future fan elections. By the end of 2015, she had appeared in 32 single A-sides of AKB48, trailing only five other members. Kuchibiru ni Be My Baby, AKB48's 10th anniversary single, marked her return to the main selection of promoting members of AKB48 releases. It was her first appearance in a management selected <b>conventional</b> <b>line</b> up of 16 members since Give Me Five! in 2012, before her transfer to SNH48.|$|E
2500|$|Two decades later, {{to speed}} up {{services}} along its Madrid-Valencia <b>conventional</b> <b>line,</b> Renfe ordered ten Pendolini in 1996. The trains, based on the ETR 460 and ETR 470, were delivered by a joint consortium of Fiat Ferroviaria and GEC-Alsthom from 1998 as RENFE Class 490. The three-car trains are suited for 220km/h on RENFE's conventional lines electrified with 3kV DC. The Class 490 took up the new Madrid-Valencia Alaris services in 1999. With growing demand, {{the capacity of the}} Class 490 was no longer sufficient, and from February 2008, the trains were transferred to the [...] Mediterráneo line between Valencia and Barcelona.|$|E
2500|$|The TGV {{opened to}} the public between Paris and Lyon on 27 September 1981. Contrary to its earlier fast services, SNCF {{intended}} TGV service for all types of passengers, with the same initial ticket price as trains on the parallel <b>conventional</b> <b>line.</b> To counteract the popular misconception that the TGV would be a premium service for business travellers, SNCF started a major publicity campaign focusing on the speed, frequency, reservation policy, normal price, and broad accessibility of the service. This commitment to a democratised TGV service was enhanced in the Mitterrand era with the promotional slogan [...] "Progress means nothing unless it is shared by all". The TGV was considerably faster (in terms of door to door travel time) than normal trains, cars, or aeroplanes. The trains became widely popular, the public welcoming fast and practical travel.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Lego Group {{brought out a}} series of new and {{specialized}} ranges aimed at particular demographics. The Slizers/Throwbots line preceded the Bionicle range, and uses Technic pieces and specialist moldings to create a set of action figures for boys, while Belville is a more <b>conventional</b> <b>line</b> aimed at girls and featuring large posable figures like those in the Technic range. A [...] "Lego 4 Juniors" [...] group features [...] tall medium-sized figures ("medi-figure") without jointed arms, and longer legs than the classic Lego minifigure. In 2003, the Lego Group introduced a completely new system, Clikits, aimed at girls and consisting of customizable plastic jewelry and accessories. In 2004, Lego added the QUATRO brick, for ages 1–3. Much like Duplo, a Quatro brick is four times the dimension of a regular Lego brick, and is compatible with the Duplo brick. Also that year, they created the second line of Knights Kingdom themed product.|$|E
60|$|Immediately after Gama's return, a {{fleet of}} {{thirteen}} sail was fitted out to visit the magnificent countries of which he brought accounts. This expedition sailed on the 9th of March, 1500, for Calicut, {{under the command of}} Pedro Alvarez de Cabral. Having passed the Cape de Verde Islands, he sought to avoid the calms prevalent on the coast of Guinea, by stretching far to the west. Suddenly, on the 25th of April, he came in sight of land unknown to any one in his squadron; for, as yet, they had not heard of the discoveries of Pinzon and Lepe. He at first supposed it to be some great island; but after coasting it for some time, he became persuaded that it must be part of a continent. Having ranged along it somewhat beyond the fifteenth degree of southern latitude, he landed at a harbor which he called Porto Securo, and taking possession of the country for the crown of Portugal, dispatched a ship to Lisbon with the important tidings. [99] In this way did the Brazils come into the possession of Portugal, being to the eastward of the <b>conventional</b> <b>line</b> settled with Spain as the boundaries of their respective territories. Dr. Robertson, in recording this voyage of Cabral, concludes with one of his just and elegant remarks.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a matter}} as this may at all events {{speak of the}} style in which our young woman could affect those who were near her, may testify {{to the sort of}} {{interest}} she could inspire. She worked--and seemingly quite without design--upon the sympathy, the curiosity, the fancy of her associates, and we shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer to her than by feeling their impression and sharing, if need be, their confusion. She reduced them, Mrs. Stringham would have said, reduced them to a consenting bewilderment; which was precisely, for that good lady, on a last analysis, what was most in harmony with her greatness. She exceeded, escaped measure, was surprising only because they were so far from great. Thus it was that on this wondrous day on the Brünig the spell of watching her had grown more than ever irresistible; a proof of what--or of a part of what--Mrs. Stringham had, with all the rest, been reduced to. She had almost the sense of tracking her young friend as if at a given moment to pounce. She knew she shouldn't pounce, she hadn't come out to pounce; yet she felt her attention secretive, all the same, and her observation scientific. She struck herself as hovering like a spy, applying tests, laying traps, concealing signs. This would last, however, only till she should fairly know what was the matter; and to watch was, after all, meanwhile, a way of clinging to the girl, not less than an occupation, a satisfaction in itself. The pleasure of watching, moreover, if a reason were needed, came from a sense of her beauty. Her beauty hadn't at all originally seemed a part of the situation, and Mrs. Stringham had, even in the first flush of friendship, not named it, grossly, to any one; having seen early that, for stupid people--and who, she sometimes secretly asked herself, wasn't stupid?--it would take a great deal of explaining. She had learned not to mention it till it was mentioned first--which occasionally happened, but not too often; and then she was there in force. Then she both warmed to the perception that met her own perception, and disputed it, suspiciously, as to special items; while, in general, she had learned to refine {{even to the point of}} herself employing the word that most people employed. She employed it to pretend that she was also stupid and so have done with the matter; spoke of her friend as plain, as ugly even, in a case of especially dense insistence; but as, in appearance, so [...] "awfully full of things." [...] This was her own way of describing a face that, thanks, doubtless, to rather too much forehead, too much nose and too much mouth, together with too little mere conventional colour and <b>conventional</b> <b>line,</b> was expressive, irregular, exquisite, both for speech and for silence. When Milly smiled it was a public event--when she didn't it was a chapter of history. They had stopped, on the Brünig, for luncheon, and there had come up for them under the charm of the place the question of a longer stay.|$|E

5000|$|This {{industrial}} development had {{consequences for the}} GDLR's <b>conventional</b> <b>line</b> besides the upturn in rail traffic. The huge growth in road traffic - from near zero - by lorries and employees {{put pressure on the}} level crossings. This, together with the specific example of an accident on 7 April 1954 when a light engine collided with a van at Kiln Lane level crossing, resulted in the crossings adjacent to Kiln Lane and Great Coates tramcar halts having signalling and lifting barriers installed and the lineside electricity cables being buried. The signalling introduced on both the electric and the <b>conventional</b> <b>line</b> was two aspect - red and white.|$|E
50|$|The death-throes of the {{electric}} line led to two recorded, public, suggestions being made that passenger services be run along the GDLR's <b>conventional</b> <b>line.</b> On 16 March 1955 The BTC Chairman, Sir Brian Robertson, visited and in a speech said that the Commission would consider running DMUs or, astonishingly, EMUs along the line if the tramway closed, but that this would only be feasible if a direct road between Grimsby and Immingham {{was not going to}} happen. The politicking reappeared on 29 December 1960 when British Railways announced that if their application to withdraw the tramway was refused they would run a DMU service on the GDLR <b>conventional</b> <b>line,</b> competing with Grimsby Council's bus service. The council subsequently withdrew its objection to closing the tramway.|$|E
