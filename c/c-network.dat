Multi-media campaigns - ICanServe ties up with Philippine {{broadcast}} networks to air ICanServe-produced {{television and radio}} commercials that promote early breast cancer detection during Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October); ICanServe, in cooperation with <b>C-Network,</b> also produced English-language and Tagalog-language videos that demonstrate self breast examination to support Ating Dibdibin, as well as raise funds for women {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} during the program's screening period.|$|E

Density functional theory calculations show that the formation of surface structures capable to initiate the unzipping and cracking of the oxidized C network is strongly influenced by the constraint of the graphitic lattice on the surface functional groups. Accounting for this effect on the preferential spatial patterning of O adsorbates allows us to revise and extend the current models of graphene oxidative unzipping and cutting. We find that these processes are rate limited by O diffusion and driven by the local strain induced by the O adspecies. Adsorbate mobility is ultimately recognized as a key factor to control and to prevent the <b>C-network</b> breakdown during thermal processing of oxidized graphene...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{developed}} {{concepts and}} techniques of analyzing complex systems provide new {{insight into the}} structure of social networks. Uncovering recurrent preferences and organizational principles in such networks is a key issue to characterize them. We investigate school friendship networks from the Add Health database. Applying threshold analysis, {{we find that the}} friendship networks do not form a single connected component through mutual strong nominations within a school, while under weaker conditions such interconnectedness is present. We extract the networks of overlapping communities at the schools (<b>c-networks)</b> and find that they are scale free and disassortative in contrast to the direct friendship networks, which have an exponential degree distribution and are assortative. Based on the network analysis we study the ethnic preferences in friendship selection. The clique percolation method we use reveals that when in minority, the students tend to build more densely interconnected groups of friends. We also find an asymmetry in the behavior of black minorities in a white majority as compared to that of white minorities in a black majority. Comment: submitted to Physica...|$|R
