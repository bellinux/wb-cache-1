40|$|Soft {{errors that}} affect {{flip-flops}} {{are a major}} issue in advanced electronic circuits. As technology scales, multiple bit errors become more likely. This limits the applicability of traditional protection techniques like triplication with voting or single error correction <b>codes</b> <b>that</b> can correct only one error. Multiple errors tend to affect adjacent bits, and therefore it is interesting to use error correction <b>codes</b> <b>that</b> can correct adjacent errors. The issue with these <b>codes</b> is <b>that</b> they require a large area and delay that limits their use to protect flip-flops in circuits. Presented are <b>codes</b> <b>that</b> can be implemented with low area and delay and can correct multiple adjacent errors...|$|R

5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows.

Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
