CASE PRESENTATION: A 24 -year-old woman was admitted to hospital for decreased consciousness and hyperthermia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, and elevated protein. Cultures were negative. Patient state worsened with agitation, facial dyskinesia, ocular deviation, and limb dystonia. Diagnosis of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis was evidenced by specific antibodies. High doses of methylprednisolone were administered. CT scan disclosed an ovarian teratoma and tumor resection was scheduled under anesthesia with propofol, sufentanil, atracurium and sevoflurane. Sedation after surgery was maintained with propofol. Rapidly after surgery, patient's condition deteriorated with increase of dyskinesias, and two tonic-clonic generalized seizure events.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{model for}} the acetylcholine binding site on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is proposed. It is derived from assumptions based on existing biochemical, structural, and pharmacological data, combined with molecular modeling and principles of protein evolution and architecture. Acetylcholine is proposed {{to fit into a}} pocket on one face of an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet formed by residues 128 - 142 on the alpha-subunit. This sheet is flexible yet stable, in part because of a double cystine bridge at its end. Asp 138, Thr 133, and Gln 140 provide a ring of negative charges around the quaternary ammonium group of acetylcholine, Ile 131 and alkane segments of the other residues in the binding site provide hydrophobic interactions, and Gln 140 provides a hydrogen bond for acetylcholine's carbonyl group; Glu 129 would form part of the second anionic subsite for the bis-quaternary ammonium compounds and <b>curares.</b> The model is compatible with the available evidence pertaining to the binding site and with structure-activity relationship studies. It is precise and detailed, thereby making clear predictions, which are directly testable by affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis.

40|$|In the Greek Antiquity, {{the term}} {{strychnos}} was first coined to describe various toxic Solanacae. Nowadays, the genus Strychnos created by Linnaeus in 1753 is the numerically most important genus from the Loganiaceae family and comprises 196 species {{growing in the}} warm regions of Asia (58 species), America (64) and Africa (75). Species on the three continents are almost totally segregated. Only Strychnos potatorum is common to Asia and Africa. The toxicity of Strychnos was empirically well-known from time immemorial. Inhabitants of South-Eastern Asia and India had an ancestral knowledge of Strychnos nux vomica, whose deadly poisonous seeds were later imported and marketed in Europe to kill rodents and small predators. Concentrated extracts from Amazonian Strychnos, known as <b>curares,</b> are also remarkable hunting poisons, used by South American Indians. Accordingly, modern scientific investigations of Strychnos and their alkaloids started with Asian or American species used as traditionnal poisons. Strychnine was the first alkaloid found in Strychnos. It was isolated from Asian S. nux vomica in 1818, but its structure was fully elucidated only in the 1950 s. Meanwhile, various curarizing alkaloids from American Strychnos were identified. Based on these early results, Strychnos alkaloids were initially classified according to their geographical origin. Asian Strychnos were assumed to contain strychnine and related compounds, whereas curarizing ammonium salts were associated with American Strychnos. African species were assimilated to their Asian counterparts and deemed of less interest. During the last three decades, however, systematic screening of African Strychnos has revealed the presence of numerous, varied alkaloids in these plants and demonstrated that the correlation between geographical distribution and alkaloid content was erroneous. Presently, 47 African species have been investigated and their alkaloids analyzed, significantly more than Asian and American materials (about 10 and 20 species, respectively).

25|$|Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is a {{compound}} that, like {{a number of}} neurotoxins, was first identified through its damaging effects to the nervous system and shown to have the capacity of inhibiting the function of motor nerves and thus the contraction of the musculature {{in a manner similar}} to that of <b>curare.</b> Additionally, through chronic TEA administration, muscular atrophy would be induced. It was later determined that TEA functions in-vivo primarily through its ability to inhibit both the potassium channels responsible for the delayed rectifier seen in an action potential and some population of calcium-dependent potassium channels. It is this capability to inhibit potassium flux in neurons that has made TEA one of the most important tools in neuroscience. It has been hypothesized that the ability for TEA to inhibit potassium channels is derived from its similar space-filling structure to potassium ions. What makes TEA very useful for neuroscientists is its specific ability to eliminate potassium channel activity, thereby allowing the study of neuron response contributions of other ion channels such as voltage gated sodium channels. In addition to its many uses in neuroscience research, TEA has been shown to perform as an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease through its ability to limit the progression of the disease.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of chemical synapses is that they are the site of action for the majority of psychoactive drugs. [...] Synapses are affected by drugs such as <b>curare,</b> strychnine, cocaine, morphine, alcohol, LSD, and countless others. These drugs have different effects on synaptic function, and often are restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter. For example, <b>curare</b> is a poison that stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane, causing paralysis. Strychnine blocks the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter glycine, which causes the body to pick up and react to weaker and previously ignored stimuli, resulting in uncontrollable muscle spasms. Morphine acts on synapses that use endorphin neurotransmitters, and alcohol increases the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. LSD interferes with synapses that use the neurotransmitter serotonin. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine and therefore increases its effects.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "curare" [...] is {{ambiguous}} {{because it has}} been used to describe a number of poisons which at the time of naming were understood differently from present day understandings.

The neurotoxin category contains a number of distinct poisons, though all were originally purified from plants originating in South America. The effect with which injected <b>curare</b> poison is usually associated is muscle paralysis and resultant death. <b>Curare</b> notably functions to inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.

2500|$|Using dogs, Martin Seligman and {{his colleagues}} pioneered the study of {{depression}} in the animal model of learned helplessness at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being shocked and group B {{had no control over}} when they were being shocked. After the shocking condition the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition. To eliminate an interference effect – that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal escape behavior – the dogs were immobilized using <b>curare,</b> a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. Both the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts. [...] Consequently, a theory emerged that attributed the behavior of the animals to the effects of the shock as a stressor so extreme that it depleted a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement. [...] After the dogs study the effects of helplessness have been tested in species from fish to cats. [...] Most recently learned helplessness has been studied in rhesus macaques using inescapable shock, evoked through stress situations like forced swimming, behavioral despair tasks, tails suspension and pinch induced catalepsy; situations that render the monkey incapable of controlling the environment.|$|E

60|$|The several {{substances}} {{mentioned in}} this chapter affect the colour of the glands very differently. These often become dark at first, and then very pale or white, as was conspicuously the case with glands subjected to the poison of the cobra and citrate of strychnine. In other cases they are from the first rendered white, as with leaves placed in hot water and several acids; and this, I presume, {{is the result of}} the coagulation of the albumen. On the same leaf some glands become white and others dark-coloured, as occurred with leaves in a solution of the sulphate of quinine, and in the vapour of alcohol. Prolonged immersion in nicotine, <b>curare,</b> and even water, blackens the glands; and this, I believe, is due to the aggregation of the protoplasm within their cells. Yet <b>curare</b> caused very little aggregation in the cells of the tentacles, whereas nicotine and sulphate of quinine induced strongly marked aggregation down their bases. The aggregated masses in leaves which had been immersed for 3 hrs. 15 m. in a saturated solution of sulphate of quinine exhibited incessant [page 226] changes of form, but after 24 hrs. were motionless; the leaf being flaccid and apparently dead. On the other hand, with leaves subjected for 48 hrs. to a strong solution of the poison of the cobra, the protoplasmic masses were unusually active, whilst with the higher animals the vibratile cilia and white corpuscles of the blood seem to be quickly paralysed by this substance.|$|E
60|$|Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the {{foregoing}} Agents.--As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the channel of transmission. This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused {{a certain amount of}} inflection. Hydrocyanic acid, again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and hydrocyanic acid, excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, hyoscyamus, atropine, veratrine, colchicine, <b>curare,</b> and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that <b>curare,</b> colchicine, and veratrine are muscle-poisons--that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection.|$|E

Charcoal they could procure, enough to set the world on fire; but nitre they had not yet seen; perhaps they should find it among the hills: while as for sulphur, any brave man could get that where there were volcanoes. Who had not heard how one of Cortez' Spaniards, in like need, was lowered in a basket down the smoking crater of Popocatepetl, till he had gathered sulphur enough to conquer an empire? And what a Spaniard could do an Englishman could do, or they would know the reason why. And if they found none--why clothyard arrows had done Englishmen's work many a time already, and they could do it again, not to mention those same blow-guns and their arrows of <b>curare</b> poison, which, though they might be useless against Spaniards' armor, were far more valuable than muskets for procuring food, from the simple fact of their silence.|$|E
60|$|Only a {{few other}} salts, besides those of ammonia, were tried in {{relation}} to the process of aggregation. A leaf was placed in a solution of one part of chloride of sodium to 218 of water, and after 1 hr. the contents of the cells were aggregated into small, irregularly globular, brownish masses; these after 2 hrs. were almost disintegrated and pulpy. It was evident that the protoplasm had been injuriously affected; and soon afterwards some of the cells appeared quite empty. These effects differ altogether from those produced by the several salts of ammonia, as well as by various organic fluids, and by inorganic particles placed on the glands. A solution of the same strength of carbonate of soda and carbonate of potash acted in nearly the same manner as the chloride; and here again, after 2 hrs. 30 m., the outer cells of some of the glands had emptied themselves of their brown pulpy contents. We shall see in the eighth chapter that solutions of several salts of soda of half the above strength cause inflection, but do not injure the leaves. Weak solutions of sulphate of quinine, of nicotine, camphor, poison of the cobra, &c., soon induce well-marked aggregation; whereas certain other substances (for instance, a solution of <b>curare)</b> have no such tendency.|$|E
