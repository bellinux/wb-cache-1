50|$|His {{approach}} to research is both deliberate and naïve. There are steps he follows in performing an empirical or <b>conceptual</b> <b>study.</b> However, {{he tries to}} ignore any latent preconceived specific theory or a fixed toolkit of methods. To him the phenomena is paramount and not the literature. He always wants a fresh, independent look at a problem whenever possible. The {{first step is to}} “wallow” in the phenomena until reaching an intuitive feel for them. (Please note: to wallow in the phenomena {{is not the same thing}} as wallowing in the literature about the phenomena). Next is the effort to formulate the research questions, taking care to always to be “anchored” in the phenomena. This formulation provides a narrative and means to begin the development of some explanation for the phenomena. Once an explanation is developed, the question becomes: how can this be refuted? The next step is to refute it. This is the easiest step! This basic research process iterates until one runs out of new ideas for refuting the explanation. Stopping to write up results is the next step. These developments are merged into a wider stream of his past research work and where feasible, the relevant literatures. Because of the importance he places on counterexamples, he eschews the use of mathematical statistics in favor of strong inference. His purpose is to use each research adventure to help erect a less ramshackle theoretical edifice for the group and organizational sciences.|$|E
50|$|The NWC {{approved}} the RRW Feasibility Study {{that began in}} May 2005 and completed in November 2006. The goal of the RRW {{study was to identify}} designs that will sustain long term confidence in a safe, secure and reliable stockpile and enable transformation to a responsive nuclear weapon infrastructure. The joint DOE/DoD RRW POG was tasked to oversee a laboratory design competition for a RRW warhead with FPU goal of FY 2012. The POG assessed the technical feasibility including certification without nuclear testing, design definition, manufacturing, and an initial cost assessment to determine whether the proposed candidates met the RRW study objectives and requirements. The POG presented the RRW study results to the NWC in November 2006 and the NWC decided that the RRW for submarine-launched ballistic missiles is feasible and should proceed to complete a Phase 2A design definition and cost study. In addition, the NWC determined that the RRW is to be adopted as the strategy for maintaining a long term safe, secure and reliable nuclear deterrent and as such also directed the initiation of a <b>conceptual</b> <b>study</b> for an additional RRW design. The next steps include detailed design and preliminary cost estimates of the RRW to confirm that the RRW design provides surety enhancements, can be certified without nuclear testing, is cost-effective, and will support both stockpile and infrastructure transformation. Once this acquisition planning is completed and if the NWC decides to proceed to engineering and production development, outyear funding (FY 2009 - FY 2012) to support an executable program will be submitted.|$|E
