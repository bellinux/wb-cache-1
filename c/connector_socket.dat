Shown is a 9-pin male (DE-9M) connector (plug), and a 25-pin female (DB-25F) <b>connector</b> (<b>socket).</b> The hexagonal pillars (4-40 bolt) at {{both ends}} of each connector have a threaded stud fastening the connectors to the metal panel. They also have threaded sockets to receive jackscrews on the cable shell, holding the plug and socket together.|$|E
50|$|The XJACK was {{originally}} used in modem and network cards, {{to attach a}} standard RJ11 or 8P8C plug directly to the PC card. They do not require a separate dongle, which could be lost or misplaced, and {{do not need to}} be removed from the laptop when travelling. An alternative approach is to use larger type III cards with a regular modular <b>connector</b> <b>socket,</b> but this approach requires more space.|$|E

Single phase Swiss plugs and sockets are described in AC power plugs and sockets ...|$|R
50|$|The 16-bit AT bus slot {{originally}} {{used two}} standard edge <b>connector</b> <b>sockets</b> in early IBM PC/AT machines. However, with {{the popularity of}} the AT-architecture and the 16-bit ISA bus, manufacturers introduced specialized 98-pin connectors that integrated the two sockets into one unit. These can be found in almost every AT-class PC manufactured after the mid-1980s. The ISA slot connector is typically black (distinguishing it from the brown EISA connectors and white PCI connectors).|$|R
5000|$|Edge <b>connector</b> <b>sockets</b> {{consist of}} a plastic [...] "box" [...] open on one side, with pins on one or both side(s) of the longer edges, sprung to push {{into the middle of}} the open center. Connectors are often keyed to ensure the correct {{polarity}}, and may contain bumps or notches both for polarity and to ensure that the wrong type of device is not inserted. The socket's width is chosen to fit to the thickness of the connecting PCB.|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} printer cheap {{enough to be}} {{included}} with every PCW, Amstrad placed {{the majority of its}} drive electronics inside the PCW cabinet. The printer case contained only electromechanical components and high current driver electronics; its power was supplied via a coaxial power <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> on the monitor casing, and rather than using a traditional parallel interface, pin and motor signals were connected directly by a 34-wire ribbon cable to an 8041 microcontroller on the PCW's mainboard.|$|E
50|$|It has a 3.5mm TRS <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> for {{standard}} headphones, {{and takes a}} TRRS connector (like the iPhone) for stereo headsets. The phone can also be operated in this manner, however loose connections can cause it to randomly stop, skip to another song, or even beep very loudly and redial without permission, even with a regular pair of headphones {{that does not have}} these features. There is also no setting available to defeat this behavior, which occurs even with the switch in the locked position.|$|E
50|$|A typical TAE {{installation}} is a multi-socket {{junction box}} {{with at least}} one N connector and one F <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> in the box, but having usually two N and one F connector. Up to three N connectors are possible. Network service enters the box and connects to pins 1 and 2 on the right-most N connector. Service is daisy-chained from pins 5 and 6 on the N connector to pins 1 and 2 on the next N connector to the left. The F connector is attached to pins 5 and 6 on the last N connector {{at the end of the}} chain.|$|E
50|$|Note the {{connections}} to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from {{the opposite side of}} the <b>connector)</b> that <b>socket</b> 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray <b>connector,</b> note that <b>socket</b> 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black <b>connector,</b> <b>sockets</b> 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.|$|R

50|$|Most {{models of}} PCW were bundled with a 9-pin {{dot matrix printer}} mechanism, with the later 9512 and 9512+ models using a {{daisywheel}} (with a different cable; the printers were not interchangeable with the dot matrix models). These PCW printers could not, of course, be used on other computers, and the original PCW lacked a then-standard Centronics printer port. Instead, the Z80 bus and video signals were brought to an edge <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Many accessories including parallel and serial ports were produced for this interface. Some of the later models included a built-in parallel port; these could be bundled with either the dedicated Amstrad printer, or a Canon Bubblejet model.|$|E
5000|$|The DR-110 had various outputs. It could output a [...] "V-trig" [...] {{clock pulse}} (+6V, 10ms duration), via a 3.5mm mini-jack, to allow other [...] "slave" [...] {{synthesizer}} units (e.g. arpeggiators) to synchronize to the DR-110 accent section. The DR-110 has a 10kΩ impedance unbalanced mono audio output, available on an ¼" [...] phone <b>connector</b> <b>socket.</b> This output can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. The socket was configured as the [...] "Roland P-bus", which meant {{it also could}} be used as a simultaneous audio input, the input source being mixed with the output signal. A separate 3.5mm headphone output socket was also present. The headphone socket can be used with headphones to listen to the unit's drum sounds without disturbing others.|$|E

50|$|The Rhythm 55 can not {{interface}} with other instruments (e.g. to synchronize its tempo with another machine). The Rhythm 55 has a mono audio output, available on two unbalanced phone <b>connector</b> sockets—one <b>socket</b> is high impedance, the other low impedance.|$|R
5000|$|PCB of an M.2 module {{provides}} a 75-position edge connector; {{depending on the}} type of module, certain pin positions are removed to present one or more keying notches. Host-side M.2 <b>connectors</b> (<b>sockets)</b> may populate one or more mating key positions, determining the type of modules accepted by the host; , host-side connectors are available with only one mating key position populated (either B or M). [...] Furthermore, M.2 sockets keyed for SATA or two PCI Express lanes (PCIe ×2) are referred to as [...] "socket 2 configuration" [...] or [...] "socket 2", while the sockets keyed for four PCI Express lanes (PCIe ×4) are referred to as [...] "socket 3 configuration" [...] or [...] "socket 3".|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} {{could be}} interconnected by manually inserting jumper wires fitted with tapered pin <b>connectors</b> into <b>sockets</b> {{on the main}} circuit board.

Methods to improve signal integrity in inductively coupled systems are established. Options include transformer geometry optimization, integrated series terminations and system level tradeoffs...|$|R
40|$|Betaflex <b>connectors</b> are <b>sockets</b> {{that connect}} multichip modules and high density ceramic {{packages}} to printed circuit boards. They incorporate {{shape memory alloy}} technology, developed under NASA contract. Aimed at computer, telecommunication, avionics and military markets, the connectors enable designers to gain up to 40 percent more board space and provide 100 signal lines to the inch. When the nickel titanium element in the connector is heated by a low voltage power supply, the connector's spring is opened allowing the circuit board to be inserted with zero force. This makes assembly easier and more reliable. Beta Phase {{was taken over by}} Mopex, BPS and currently manufactures these connectors...|$|R
50|$|The usual wiring has the {{positive}} (red) wire {{running to the}} terminal with a square profile, and the negative (black) wire running to the half-circle, half-square terminal. This is true for both genders of <b>connector.</b> The female <b>sockets</b> are in a male housing and the male pins are in a female housing. The male pins (female housing) connector is usually on the battery side.|$|R
5000|$|The terms plug, pin, and prong {{are also}} {{often used for}} [...] "male" [...] <b>connectors,</b> and receptacle, <b>socket,</b> and slot are used for [...] "female" [...] connectors.

40|$|Capacitive Leadframe {{testing is}} an {{effective}} approach for detecting faults in printed circuit boards. Capacitance measurements, however, are affected by mechanical variations during testing and by tolerances of electrical parameters of components, {{making it difficult to}} use threshold based techniques for defect detection.
