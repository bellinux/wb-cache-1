5|$|The first {{excavations}} at Volubilis {{were carried}} out by the French archaeologist Henri de la MartiniÃ¨re between 1887 and 1892.

Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.|$|E
