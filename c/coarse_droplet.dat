30|$|The spot-gun method uses a very <b>coarse</b> <b>droplet</b> {{spectrum}} (500 + VMD) and the helicopter’s downwash {{to distribute}} the spray droplets down through the canopy. The large droplets minimise drift and other off-target impacts while the downwash provides the coverage and even distribution necessary for treatment efficacy. As expected, with a <b>coarse</b> <b>droplet</b> spectrum, there is less material {{at the base of}} the canopy compared to the middle and the top (Figures  1 and 2). Unexpectedly, the distributions of dye on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were similar throughout the canopy profile, resulting in better coverage on the abaxial leaf surfaces {{at the base of the}} inner canopy. The high coverage of dye on the abaxial leaf surfaces was possible due to a helicopter downwash effect, which moved the leaves and exposed both sides of the leaf surfaces to the spray.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} airborne transmitted diseases indoors has prompted {{the attention of}} studying expiratory droplet dispersion and transport in built environments. Droplet dispersion in a room under the conventional well-mixed and displacement ventilation is simulated. In this work, a source (i. e. a patient) and a receptor (i. e the susceptible object) were located in a mechanical ventilated room. This study evaluated droplet dispersion and mixing under well-mixing and displacement ventilation scheme. Two droplet nuclei sizes, 0. 01 and 10 µm, are selected as they represent very fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets.</b> The flow field is modeled using k-ε RNG model. A new Eulerian drift-flux methodology is employed to model droplet phase. Under the conventional ventilation scheme, both fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> are homogeneously dispersed within approximately 50 s. Droplet nuclei exhibit distinctive dispersion behavior, particularly for low airflow microenvironment. After 210 s of droplet emission, gravitational settling influences the dispersion for 10 µm droplets, and concentration gradient can still be observed for displacement ventilation...|$|R

These combinations of speed and droplet size were evaluated for percent coverage of the spray and percent control of targeted weeds 3, 7, and 15 days after treatment (DAT). Four replications were conducted for each speed and droplet size combination except for at 19 km/h (12 mph) where only three replications were used (35 plots).

40|$|This {{information}} {{relates to}} improvements in devices for delivery of spray droplets from aircraft or ground vehicle. The application of pesticide using aircraft remains {{a vital part}} of modern agricultural systems, but the problem of associated off-target transport or spray drift is receiving increasing attention. Research carried out by Craig et al 1998 a has demonstrated that spray drift depends upon the size of droplets in the spray and also the width of the droplet size distribution or spectrum. Buffer distances of several hundred metres are often required to reduce aircraft spray drift deposition to acceptable levels. Such large distances are inconvenient and uneconomical in most cropping situations. The present approach is to significantly reduce spray drift by developing a new nozzle which utilises large droplet Controlled Droplet Application (CDA) technology. This would produce a spray with a narrow droplet size distribution and reduce the number of driftable fines, and also the number of excessively <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> which constitute waste. ...|$|R

The experiment was conducted in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais/Brazil, in completely randomized design with ten replications and 4 x 20 split-plot arrangement in space. Drift deposited on collectors located over ground level was resulted by 150 L ha- 1 carrier volume applications through four nozzle types (XR 11002 (fine droplets); AIXR 11002 (coarse droplets); TT 11002 (medium droplets); TTI 11002 (extremely <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets)),</b> collected in 20 downwind distances, parallel to the crop line outside the target area, spaced by 2. 5 m.

40|$|Transmission of {{respiratory}} infectious diseases in humans, for instance influenza, occurs by several modes. Respirable droplets, droplets whose pre-evaporation aerodynamic diameter {{is less than}} 20 microns, provide a vector of transmission of an infectious pathogen that may contribute to different transmission modes. Larger droplets either evaporate very fast or gravitationally settle, their effect being rather limited except for very close contacts between susceptible and infected persons. An epidemiological model with explicit consideration {{of the dynamics of}} respirable droplets is developed to assess their relevance in the infectious process. Respirable droplets are divided into three classes: fine, <b>coarse</b> and settled. <b>Droplet</b> dynamics is determined by their physical properties (size), whereas the population dynamics by the infectivity of the pathogen. The size and number of droplets shed by an infected person via expulsion events (e. g. sneezing, coughing, talking) are important physical parameters as they determine the residence time a droplet remains airborne, its regional deposition in the respiratory tract, and the amount of pathogen carried. We argue, using estimates from experimental studies, that respirable droplets are a dynamically possible transmission vector for influenza. Airborne <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> may provide the dominant transmission mode, the relative importance of transmission modes depending on model parameters. The impact of settled pathogen-carrying droplets depends on the inactivation rates of the pathogen in different environmental media. The model provides an expandable theoretical framework, which in combination with better experimental data, could contribute to understanding the transmission {{of respiratory}} infectious diseases, to evaluate the effects of associated control strategies, and to assess the relative importance of transmission modes.

40|$|Spray {{deposition}} {{is a novel}} manufacturing process, {{which is}} currently being developed for producing near-net-shape preforms. Spray deposition involves {{the creation of a}} spray of droplets by a gas atomizer and the consolidation of these droplets on a substrate to create a preform. In order to maximize the metallurgical benefits of spray deposition, a thorough study of the solidification process is important. In this study, 7075 Al alloy is atomized by high velocity argon gas and atomized droplets are collected on the fixed copper substrate. The microstructure of over spray powder and the preform are studied. Spray atomization produces various sizes of droplets, ranging from 5 to 300 μ m. A variety of microstructures are observed for different size of powders. Microstructural changes occur due to the difference in the cooling rates of the atomized droplets. The cooling rate of the fine droplets is high compared with <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets.</b> Generally the cooling rate of the droplet changes from 101 to 106 Ks^- 1. In the spray deposition the preform shows equiaxed grains, while the size of the grain changes from bottom to top of the preform.

Self-emulsification was monitored by visual observations and droplet size measurement. Mesophases obtained by 50 % v/v aqueous hydration of SES were utilized for polarizing microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and rheological studies. Results. SES 30 % presented good emulsifying properties and nano-size droplets were observed after its emulsification as compared to micron sized droplets for other SES. In polarizing microscopy, formation of intermediate LC phase was observed in all SES. Lamellar phase was evident in 30 % SES while other SES exhibited micellar cubic phase. Presence of high level of structurally bound water in thermal analysis confirmed mesophase formation in all SES. In frequency sweep, decrease in elastic modulus, an increase in phase degree and loss tangent was observed for 30 % SES. Exactly opposite trend was seen in other SES. Thus, rheological studies concluded presence of weak and fragile mesophase structure in 30 % SES while LC phase structure with little structural buildup was observed in other SES. This weak mesophase structure in SES 30 % presented no or very little resistance against strain induced deformation. Therefore, during emulsification, weak mesophase in SES 30 % ruptured with ease and released jet of nano-size <b>droplets</b> compared to <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> for other SES. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{control of}} Alopecurus myosuroides (ALOMY) {{depends on the}} application date, the product selection and the dose rate and is also influenced by the correct application technology. Small and large plot trials were conducted at locations with heavy ALOMY infestation in the years 2004 - 2010. Atlantis WG (mesosulfuron & iodosulfuron) with different water dose rates, nozzle types and {{at different times of}} day was applied to control ALOMY in winter wheat. The droplet size as well as the water rate had the strongest impact on ALOMY control, while the application speed played a rather subordinated role. The applications with very <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> (90 % drift-reducing potential) lead to efficacy reductions. This becomes particularly visible with applications in the early growth stages of ALOMY. Coarse drops roll off faster. On the other hand, applications with fine or medium droplets tend to result in a better control but they can lead to drift at high wind velocities and evaporation at high air temperatures and therefore cause lower efficacy. There was no visible difference between the types of the tested nozzle tips like standard flat jet, compact injector nozzle and double flat spray nozzle. The herbicidal efficacy was clearly affected by the moisture of the weed leaves. With moist leaf surfaces, the risk of run-off effects exists. This was more expressed with high spray volumes (250 l/ha) and has to be considered at early day or night applications. In situations of moist leaves, the spray volumes can be reduced to 100 - 150 l/ha. It is recommended to use the 90 % drift reducing nozzles only in the sensitive field bark area and to secure the efficacy of Atlantis WG against ALOMY by adjusting the pressure, the driving speed or by changing the nozzles outside of this sensitive area. From these test results, the following nozzle recommendation is concluded: Compact injector nozzles like AIXR, Air-mix, IDK should be used with a caliber of 03 or 04 at about 3 bar.

However, information about the digestion fate of milk fat depending on its supramolecular structure for a given composition is scarce. Aim of the study In this study, 13 CO 2 breath tests were performed with fasted rats force–fed different dairy preparations of similar composition but differing in fat suprastructure in order to highlight differences of general lipid metabolism. Methods Each preparation consisted of a NaCl solution, anhydrous milk fat labelled with a 13 C mixed triacylglycerol, casein (as native phosphocaseinate powder with some lactose), and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Milk fat was either fed (i) unemulsified consecutively to the aqueous phase, or emulsified as (ii) <b>coarse</b> <b>droplets</b> of ∼ 10 µm covered mainly with the phospholipid, or (iii–iv) fine droplets of ∼ 1 µm covered mainly with casein, force–fed either in the liquid state or in a semi–crystallized state. 13 C abundance in expired air samples was measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry; results were expressed as 13 C enrichment and were submitted to an ANOVA analysis. Results The 13 CO 2 excretion curves of the unemulsified preparation and the coarse emulsion were similar and presented a sharp peak, both {{significantly different from the}} fine emulsion curves characterized by a nearly linear cumulative recovery. The crystalline state of the fine emulsion droplets and the viscosity of these emulsions did not affect significantly their excretion curves. The lipid metabolization (indicated by the 13 C recovery) was significantly slower for the fine droplets coated with casein than for the large droplets coated with the phospholipid and the unemulsified fat. For the latter, a single 13 C peak rapidly appeared, while for small droplets coated with caseins, 13 C excretion was continuous up to 6 h. Conclusions Global lipid metabolism based on oxidation to CO 2 was decreased with smaller compared to larger emulsified milk fat particles with different coatings. These data support the concept that dairy products with different fat suprastructures are digested and metabolized differently...|$|R

The size distribution of encapsulated fine emulsion (mean size ~ 0. 20 μm) shifted to a larger size distribution range during encapsulation possibly due to the contraction effect of the microgel particles. <b>Coarse</b> emulsion <b>droplets</b> (mean size ~ 18 μm) underwent a size reduction during encapsulation due to the shearing effect of the atomizing nozzle. However, no further size changes in the encapsulated emulsion were detected over four weeks. The type of emulsifier used and emulsion concentration did not significantly affect the emulsion stability.

40|$|With greater {{environmental}} awareness, {{the movement}} of pesticides within and off of a spray target area is a critical public concern. Ideally, all of the material applied should be deposited within the targeted swath on the intended pest or plant. But realistically, {{a portion of the}} spray remains airborne and is carried downwind to non-target areas. Airborne spray leaving the targeted area reduces the applied dosage, and could cause damage to neighboring plant and water source or other detrimental environmental impacts. To study the influences of nozzle type, spray mixture and wind speed on spray drift, experiments were conducted using a wind tunnel. Spray drift risk was assessed by adding a tracer to the spray mixture and measuring the quantities of spray deposited downwind from the nozzle on horizontal polythene lines with 2 mm diameter perpendicular to the wind direction in a vertical and a horizontal array. At a distance of 2 m downwind from the static nozzle, five collector lines (V 1 to V 5) were positioned one above the other at the spacing of 0. 1 m to provide an estimate of the spray still airborne through this vertical profile. An additional five sampling collector strings (H 1 to H 5) were placed in a horizontal array with one-meter horizontal spacing at 0. 1 m height to determine the fallout volumes and gradients of the spray from 2 to 6 m downwind. A water-soluble fluorescent tracer was dissolved into tap water as the spray liquid, and after the experiments, the collecting lines were washed with deionized water to measure deposit and drift. The results indicated that deposits on sampling collector decreased with increased vertical elevation and horizontal distance. Average fallout and airborne deposit resulting from the different spray applications were shown in the paper. These figures showed the expected fallout and airborne profiles for all tested nozzle types and sizes. The highest fallout deposits were measured at a position closest to the nozzle (H 1) with a systematic decrease with the distance from the nozzle. The highest airborne deposits were found at the lowest sampling collector (V 1) with a systematic decrease with increasing height above the wind tunnel floor. Airborne spray drift was affected by wind speed. At all sample positions, deposits on collectors were reduced at lower wind speed. Nozzle 2 ̆ 7 s structure was also found to influence droplet 2 ̆ 7 s size, so injector/pre-orifice nozzle produced <b>coarser</b> <b>droplets</b> and reduced spray drift. The amount of spray recovered is based on the amount of active ingredient of spray mixture within each droplet rather than the total droplet volume. On that basis, a multiple non-linear model for statistical drift prediction including four independent, non-correlated variables (target distance, wind speed, nozzle type and chemical type) was established. The regression model provided a drift evaluation approach, and it was important in the interpretation of wind tunnel data for different nozzle types, chemical types and sampling methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Rectal biopsies were {{obtained}} from 11 children, clinically presumed to suffer from the juvenile type of generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis. In addition, sural nerve biopsies were performed in 4 cases. Of the various staining procedures applied for light microscopy, Sundan Black B {{was found to be}} the most useful, revealing in each of the rectal biopsies at least some nerve cells with <b>coarse</b> black <b>droplets</b> as well as numerous mucosal macrophages with a more greyish, dustlike material. In sural nerve biopsies a slight reduction of the thick myelinated nerve fibers was seen in two cases, accompanied by regeneration phenomena. The latter were also detectable in one other case, the remaining sural nerve biopsy being histologically unremarkable. By electron microscopy neuronal perikarya revealed lipopigment bodies with a fingerprint-like pattern in each of the rectal biopsies. In one case only was this pattern combined with distinct curvilinear profiles. In 4 cases, however, the fingerprint-like deposits were intermingled with different lamellated bodies, some of them reminiscent of MCB's or zebra bodies. In two of the 4 cases, these were even seen exclusively in some neurons. In each of the rectal as well as the sural nerve biopsies, most of the non-neuronal cell types presented lipopigment bodies, likewise, displaying both curvilinear and fingerpring-like profiles, with some characteristics related to the various cell types. With regard to generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis the diagnostic value of rectal biopsies, though being disputed in the literature, appears reestablished by the findings presented...|$|R
40|$|Size {{distributions}} of twelve {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and major inorganic ions were measured at two receptor locations in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Region in southern China during 2006 - 2008. The size {{distributions of}} three- and four-ring PAHs were characterized with three modes, a condensation mode with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 0. 3 μm, a droplet mode (MMAD:. 7 - 1. 0 μm), and a coarse mode (MMAD: 3 - 5 μm). The less volatile five- to six-ring PAHs were mainly distributed in the condensation mode and droplet mode, with little presence in the <b>coarse</b> mode. The <b>droplet</b> mode was the most prominent mode for all PAHs at both sites, accounting for more than 70 % of the total particle-phase five- and six-ring PAHs and more than 60 % of the total particle-phase three- and four-ring PAHs. The dominant droplet mode could be attributed to a result of in-cloud processing of vehicular soot particles and biomass burning particles during the transport of source aerosols to the receptor sites. Presence of sulfate aqueous coating on the droplet-mode particles was hypothesized to make PAHs inaccessible to volatilization from particle phase and to oxidation by gaseous oxidants. Further implications of a dominant droplet-mode PAHs were discussed. Copyright © American Association for Aerosol Research...|$|R

A <b>coarse</b> emulsion containing <b>droplets</b> with a mean particle size of about 100 μm was homogenized 5 - 6 times through the same membrane at a constant pressure difference of 20 - 300 kPa to achieve additional droplet homogenization and size reduction. The optimum conditions with regard to particle size uniformity were 3 homogenization cycles at a pressure difference of 100 kPa, under which the mean size of outer W/O particles was 9 μm and the span of particle size distribution was as low as 0. 28. The optimum pressure difference in a single-stage process was higher, but the particle size distribution of prepared emulsions was broader than in a multi-stage process at smaller pressures. The transmembrane flux was in the range of 1. 8 - 37 m 3 /(m 2 h) and increased with increasing pressure difference and decreasing the content of W/O particles. The mean size of W/O particles in each cycle was remarkably constant over a wide range of their concentration of 1 - 60 vol. ...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{infectious}} diseases remain a major global health threat. The primary vector for their transmission is <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>droplets,</b> known as bioaerosols, exhaled from infected individuals during natural respiratory maneuvers, such as breathing, coughing and sneezing. Unfortunately, our current {{knowledge of the}} mechanisms by which these exhaled bioaerosols are formed in the lungs is in its infancy. In particular, progress in this field has been hindered by the complex structure of the respiratory fluid and the resulting {{lack of understanding of}} the biophysical properties of the fluid. In this thesis, a series of in vitro mimetics of conducting airway mucus were developed to enable in depth studies of mucus properties and bioaerosol formation from mucus-like surfaces. These mucus mimetics overcome major limitations of currently available models by matching the primary chemical composition and key physical properties of the mimetic to that of native tracheal mucus. Three mimetics were chosen to facilitate the study of highly viscoelastic (diseased) mucus and non-diseased mucus under low shear conditions, such as breathing, or high shear conditions, such as cough. To study bioaerosol formation in vitro, an enhanced simulated cough machine (SCM) was developed to generate bioaerosols from mucus mimetic surfaces during cough. By controlling the temperature and relative humidity within the SCM, the detectability of bioaerosols generated from the mimetic surfaces was improved due to limited aerosol drying. The size distribution of the bioaerosols was multimodal, with four to five modes being observed for all surfaces probed. While varying the composition of surfactant at the air-mucus interface {{had a significant impact on}} surface viscoelastic properties, the size distribution of bioaerosols generated from these surfaces did not differ significantly. However, the ability to generate bioaerosols from different surfaces was highly dependent on surface properties of the mimetic, with highly viscoelastic surfaces generating bioaerosols in only half the experiments. This research will enhance our knowledge of bioaerosol formation in the respiratory tract and ultimately guide the development of alternative strategies to suppress bioaerosol formation...|$|R
