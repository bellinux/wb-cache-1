40|$|In Iberian cereal-steppes, {{decoupling}} {{of payments}} from current production levels through the Single Farm Payment raised concerns regarding {{the potential for}} land abandonment and replacement of sheep by cattle, with eventual negative consequences for declining grassland birds. This study addressed this issue by analysing the responses of five grassland bird species of conservation concern to spatial land use gradients, which are expected to reflect changes potentially associated with the CAP reform. Our results show that both habitat fragmentation and grazing regimes were major drivers of breeding bird densities, though responses to these factors were species-specific. Thekla larks were most abundant in landscapes with small grassland patches and high edge density, whereas <b>calandra</b> <b>larks</b> were abundant only in large expanses of continuous open farmland habitat. Little bustard and short-toed lark densities declined in highly fragmented landscapes, but they appeared to tolerate or even benefit from low to moderate levels of open habitat fragmentation. Corn buntings were little affected by landscape patterns. At the field scale, little bustard and corn bunting densities were highest in fields grazed by cattle, whereas short-toed larks were mostly associated with sheep pastures. Short-toed larks and Thekla larks were most abundant in old fallow fields where cattle was largely absent, whereas corn buntings showed the inverse pattern. These results confirm {{the view that the}} same agricultural policies may be favourable for some species of conservation concern but detrimental to others, and so they cannot be assumed to bring uniform conservation benefits...|$|R
40|$|Afforestation often causes direct habitat {{losses for}} {{farmland}} birds of conservation concern, {{but it is}} uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and > 300 m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of <b>calandra</b> <b>larks</b> and short-toed larks, but not of little bustards and tawny pipits. Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Although the {{negative}} effects of habitat fragmentation have been widely documented at the landscape scale, much less is known about its impacts on species distributions at the biogeographical scale. We hypothesize that fragmentation influences the large-scale distribution of area- and edge-sensitive species by limiting their occurrence in regions with fragmented habitats, despite otherwise favourable environmental conditions. We test this hypothesis by assessing the interplay of climate and landscape factors influencing the distribution of the <b>calandra</b> <b>lark,</b> a grassland specialist that is highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Location: Iberia Peninsula, Europe. Methods: Ecological niche modelling was used to investigate the relative influence of climate/topography, landscape fragmentation and spatial structure on <b>calandra</b> <b>lark</b> distribution. Modelling assumed explicitly a hierarchically structured effect among explanatory variables, with climate/topography operating at broader spatial scales than landscape variables. An eigenvector-based spatial filtering approach was used to cancel bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation. The information theoretic approach was used in model selection, and variation partitioning was used to isolate the unique and shared effects of sets of explanatory variables. Results: Climate and topography were the most influential variables shaping the distribution of <b>calandra</b> <b>lark,</b> but incorporating landscape metrics contributed significantly to model improvement. The probability of <b>calandra</b> <b>lark</b> occurrence increased with total habitat area and declined with the number of patches and edge density. Variation partitioning showed a strong overlap between variation explained by climate/topography and landscape variables. After accounting for spatial structure in species distribution, the explanatory power of environmental variables remained largely unchanged. Main conclusions: We have shown here that landscape fragmentation can influence species distributions at the biogeographical scale. Incorporating fragmentation metrics into large-scale ecological niche models may contribute for a better understanding of mechanism driving species distributions and for improving predictive modelling of range shifts associated with land use and climate changes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Conserving {{grassland}} {{birds in}} farmed landscapes requires {{the maintenance of}} favourable agricultural land uses over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here we examined the field and landscape-scale habitat requirements of the <b>calandra</b> <b>lark</b> (Melanocorypha calandra), an obligate grassland bird often associated with open Mediterranean farmland. Breeding and wintering lark densities were assessed in 42 fallowfields in southern Portugal, and related to three sets of variables reflecting field, landscape and neighbourhood effects. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the unique and shared contributions of sets of variables to explained variation in lark distribution and abundance models. At the field scale, the presence of trees and shrubs showed the strongest negative effects on <b>calandra</b> <b>lark.</b> At the landscape scale therewere strong positive response of larks to the amount and patch size of open farmland habitats, and negative responses, albeit weaker, to drainage and road densities. <b>Calandra</b> <b>lark</b> distribution and abundance was also positively related to that of conspecifics in surrounding fields, particularly in spring. Results suggest that calandra larks are highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation, requiring fallow fields with no shrubs or trees, embedded in large expanses of open farmland.

Methods. Set-aside fields were surveyed in four regions of Catalonia (northeast of Spain) for the selected species during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. Set-aside habitat descriptors (e. g. size, vegetation structure) were collected. Ordination plots and information theoretic methods {{were used to assess}} the relationship between the selected bird species, set-aside features and the regions. Results. The region where the set-aside was located had a strong effect on the abundance of the selected species.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{generated}} by human activities {{is likely to}} affect agroecosystems in several ways: reinforcing intensification in northern and western Europe, and extensification in the Mediterranean countries. If we are to predict the consequences of global warming for wildlife, distribution models have to include climate data. The METEOSAT temporal series from EWBMS offers an attractive alternative to using climatic surfaces derived from ground stations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to test whether this climatic satellite data can improve the distribution models obtained previously by Suárez-Seoane et al. using habitat variables for three agro-steppe bird species: great bustard, little bustard and <b>calandra</b> <b>lark</b> in Spain. Rainfall, radiation balance, evapotranspiration and soil moisture images were incorporated together with the other variables used as predictors in the published stepwise GAM models. Changes in the predicted distributions from the habitat only and climate-habitats models were assessed by reference to the CORINE land cover categories. Inclusion of climatic variables from METEOSAT led to statistically superior models for all three species. There were large differences in the climatic variables selected and the original variables dropped among the species. Evapotranspiration variables were the most frequently selected. Maps of the differences between the habitat and climate-habitat models showed very different patterns for the three species. Inclusion of climate variables led to a wider range of land cover types being deemed suitable. Despite the statistical superiority of models, care is needed in deciding whether to use climatic variables because they may emphasize the fundamental rather than the realized niche. Used together, however, habitat and climate models can provide new insights into factors limiting species distributions and how they may respond to climate change. <br/...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the Sicilian {{avifauna}} changes and its existing connections with the land use variations {{has been carried out}} from the 80 s till today. We compared the Sicilian ornithological data acquired from the atlas maps with the regional land use maps data. We examined the land use variations and the distribution changes of some bird species on a regional level. To this aim, we analyzed the spatial distribution data of the birds in the period from 1984 - 1992 and 1993 - 2006. Moreover we examined the land use data of the period going from 1987 - 1988 and 1993 - 2000. After a preliminary analysis, we selected target species linked to different environments. Forest: Great spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Eurasian Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Marsh Tit Poecile palustris siculus; scrub and bush: Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, arable and grazing land: Greater short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, <b>Calandra</b> <b>Lark</b> Melanocorypha calandra; complex systems, olive grove and almond trees: European Roller Coracias garrulus, Woodchat Shrike Lanius senator. The distribution changes of these species in the examined periods were significant and they were not linked to the demography of the species nor to the major or minor level of exploration of the island. According to the results, it is obvious that, for these species, there is a clear connection between the land use changes and the distribution variations. Other species manifested changes that seemed to be linked to demographic trends, which involved the distribution of these species (for example the diffusion of the Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus). None of the existing changes could be unequivocally related to climate change...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{interest}} in species distribution modelling, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to spatial autocorrelation and non-stationarity. Both spatial autocorrelation (the tendency for adjacent locations to be more similar than distant ones) and non-stationarity (the variation in modelled relationships over space) are likely to be common properties of ecological systems. This paper focuses on non-stationarity and uses two local techniques, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and varying coefficient modelling (VCM), to assess its impact on model predictions. We extend two published studies, one on the presence–absence of calandra larks in Spain and the other on bird species richness in Britain, to compare GWR and VCM with the more usual global generalized linear modelling (GLM) and generalized additive modelling (GAM). For the <b>calandra</b> <b>lark</b> data, GWR and VCM produced better-fitting models than GLM or GAM. VCM in particular gave significantly reduced spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. GWR showed that individual predictors became stationary at different spatial scales, indicating that distributions are influenced by ecological processes operating over multiple scales. VCM was able to predict occurrence accurately on independent data from the same geographical area as the training data but not beyond, whereas the GAM produced good results on all areas. Individual predictions from the local methods often differed substantially from the global models. For the species richness data, VCM and GWR produced far better predictions than ordinary regression. Our analyses suggest that modellers interpolating data to produce maps for practical actions (e. g. conservation) should consider local methods, whereas they should not be used for extrapolation to new areas. We argue that local methods are complementary to global methods, revealing details of habitat associations and data properties which global methods average out and miss...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of fallow lands to favor farmland bird conservation is widely recognized. Since fallows provide key resources for birds within the agricultural matrix, such as nesting sites, shelter and forage, {{complete understanding of}} the effect of field-management strategies on vegetation structure and food is essential to fulfill bird requirements and improve habitat management. In this study we experimentally compare the most common field practices (ploughing, shredding, herbicide application and cover cropping) on fallow lands by assessing the resources they provide for birds in terms of vegetation structure and food resources (leaf and seed availability), as well as the economic costs of their implementation. Fallow management treatments are ranked for six target species in a lowland area of the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, according to the available information on their requirements. The different agronomic practices offer various quantities and types of resources, highlighting the importance of fallow management in bird conservation. Shredding and early herbicide application (February) are estimated to be good practices for Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and <b>Calandra</b> <b>Lark</b> (Melanocorypha calandra), providing both favorable habitat and foraging conditions, while being economical. Meanwhile, superficial tillage in spring is found to be optimum {{for the rest of the}} species tested, despite being among the poorest food providers. Alternating patches of the best treatments would improve the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes by maximizing the harboring habitat for the endangered species.
