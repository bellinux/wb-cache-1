25|$|Many {{training}} {{agencies such}} as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the value written on the cylinder by the gas blender, the scuba diver must either recalculate his or her bottom times with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>number,</b> the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen partial pressure before taking delivery), and finally a calculation of the maximum operating depth for that fill/cylinder. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations (for example, personalized cylinders for each diver must generally be kept track of on dive boats with nitrox, {{which is not the}} case with generic compressed air cylinders).|$|E
500|$|On 5 May 1998, a fire {{broke out}} onboard [...] while off the Western Australia coast. The fire {{was caused by the}} rupture of a {{flexible}} fuel line (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> nine, starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot indicator cock, which ignited a spray fire, resulting in the deaths of four crew. Following the fire, the Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as the Westralia Board of Inquiry. The enquiry found that the RAN and the contractor Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in both the RAN and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose. In 2005, ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were severely traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and subcontractor Jetrock. In August 2006, the Australian Government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock. The seven sailors stand to receive compensation totalling up to $10million.|$|E

50|$|An inline three-cylinder engine with 180° {{crankshaft}} can {{be found}} in early examples of the Laverda Jota motorcycle made by Italian manufacturer Laverda. In these engines, the outer pistons rise and fall together like a 360° straight-two engine. The inner cylinder is offset 180° from the outer cylinders. In these engines, <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> one fires, then 180° later <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> two fires, and then 180° later <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> three fires. There is no power stroke on the final 180° of rotation. This unusual crank angle came to be due to lack of proper tooling at the factory, which also made vertical twin engines that utilized a 180° crankshaft. After 1982, this engine had the regular 120° crank angle.|$|E

50|$|A later {{development}} in disk addressing was logical block addressing (LBA), {{in which the}} cylinder-head-sector triplet {{was replaced by a}} single number, called the block number. Within the disk drive, this linear block number was translated into a <b>cylinder</b> <b>number,</b> head number and sector number. Moving the translation into the disk drive allowed drive manufacturers to place a different number of blocks on each track transparently to the accessing software.|$|E

50|$|Cylinder 1024 is {{the first}} {{cylinder}} of a hard disk that was inaccessible in the original IBM PC compatible hardware specification, interrupt 13h, which uses cylinder-head-sector addressing.

50|$|This is {{a direct}} {{improvement}} upon a first-come first-served (FCFS) algorithm.

50|$|From RAMAC {{until the}} early 1960s most hard disk drive data were {{addressed}} {{in the form of}} a three number block addressing scheme Cylinder, Head & Sector (CHS); the <b>cylinder</b> <b>number,</b> which positioned the head access mechanism; the head number, which selected the read-write head; and the sector number, which specified the rotational position of a fixed size block. On June 2, 1961, IBM introduced the 1301, which had variable length records, and the market for sector-oriented disks was eclipsed for decades.|$|E
50|$|An {{exception}} is the Ford Flathead V8 where the number 1 cylinder {{is on the right}} front of the engine (same as other Ford V8's) but this cylinder is not the front cylinder of the engine. In this case number 5 is the front cylinder. A similar situation exists with the Pontiac V8's 455 etc. where the cylinders are numbered like a Chevrolet V8 but the right side bank is in front(like a Ford), this puts <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> 2 in front of number 1.|$|E

50|$|In a V engine, <b>cylinder</b> <b>numbering</b> varies among {{manufacturers}}. Generally speaking, {{the most}} forward <b>cylinder</b> is <b>numbered</b> 1, but some manufacturers will then continue numbering along that bank first (so {{that side of}} the engine would be 1-2-3-4, and the opposite bank would be 5-6-7-8) while others will <b>number</b> the <b>cylinders</b> from front to back along the crankshaft, so one bank would be 1-3-5-7 and the other bank would be 2-4-6-8. (In this example, a V8 is assumed). To further complicate matters, manufacturers may not have used the same system for all of their engines. It is important to check the numbering system used before comparing firing orders, because the order will vary significantly with crankshaft design (see crossplane).|$|R

50|$|Dual-mass {{flywheels}} {{were developed}} to address the escalation of torque and power, especially at low revs. The growing {{concern for the environment}} and the adoption of more stringent regulations have marked the development of more efficient new engines, lowering the <b>cylinder</b> <b>number</b> to 3 or even 2 cylinders, and allowing the delivery of more torque and power at low revolutions. The counterpart has been an increase in the level of vibration which traditional clutch discs are unable to absorb. This is where the dual-mass flywheels play a key role, making these mechanical developments more viable.|$|E
