40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed computational procedure for predicting the complete thermal history including transient temperature distribution during girth welding and subsequent post weld cooling of {{low carbon steel}} pipe flange joints. Using the FE code ABAQUS, 3 -dimensional non-linear heat transfer analysis is carried out to simulate {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process. ANSI Class # 300 flange is used with a 6 mm thick, 200 mm long and 100 mm nominal diameter pipe. Joint type is a single ‘V-groove’ butt joint with a 1. 2 mm root opening. FORTRAN subroutine is utilized for the application of volumetric heat flux from the weld torch using Goldak’s double ellipsoidal heat source model, which is based on Gaussian power density distribution. Temperature dependent thermal properties as well as phase change effects have also been accounted. Apart from comprehensive discussion on the thermal history, in-depth analysis of the axial temperature profile at four different sections {{on both sides of the}} weld joint is presented. The simulated results showed that the temperature distribution around the implemented heat source model is steady when the weld torch moves around the <b>circumferential</b> <b>joint.</b> The present simulation model can be used as a proper tool to investigate the effect of different GMAW process parameters...|$|E
40|$|Use of bolted {{flanged pipe}} joints {{is very common}} in petrochemical, nuclear and process industry. Welding of pipe to flange results in {{residual}} stress built up and distortions which provide negative effects on the structural integrity and sealing capability of the pipe flange joint. The effects include stress corrosion cracking, brittle fracture, reduced fatigue and creep strengths, poor sealing performance and reduced buckling strength etc. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the extent and distribution of residual stress built up and distortions in the welded pipe-flange joints. The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in <b>circumferential</b> <b>joint</b> in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results. Chapter- 6, describes the effect of welding (Current and speed) and geometrical (pipe diameter and thickness) parameters on residual stress profile. In Chapter- 7, an analytical study regarding mitigation of residual stresses using mechanical stress relieving is presented and the effects of internal pressure, external pressure and axial pull on the residual stresses are determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed. In this chapter a numerical procedure for modeling of tack welds is suggested. In addition, the effect of tack weld locations on welding deformations and residual stresses are investigated and appropriate position for the tack welds is suggested. The effect of root gap is also analyzed and presented. Chapter- 9, consists of experimental and numerical studies describing the effects of external constraints during welding on the flange face distortions and over all residual stress profile. Overall conclusions and further work recommendations are summarized in Chapter- 10...|$|E

40|$|After {{about two}} years of {{operation}} the surface crack examination of cylindrical pressure vessel (PV) for liquid ammonia revealed fine surface cracks. They were exclusively located in the weld material of the longitudinal and <b>circumferential</b> <b>joints</b> performed by the submerged arc welding process. For {{the construction of the}} PV the fine grained structural steel St E 355 as base metal and S 2 Mo wire as filler metal were used. The cracks were oriented mainly transverse to the welding direction and their appearance seemed to be typical for ammonia induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Because of the low operating stress level and the steel-relief heat treatment of the whole PV, X-ray residual stress measurements (XRSM) were performed in order to decide whether SCC was possible or not. As a result of the XRSM and additional investigations it was shown that the measured residual stresses were repsonsible for crack growth by the SCC mechanism. Crack initiation was caused by hydrogen induced embrittlement (cold cracking) because the welding was performed at an interpass temperature that was too low...|$|R

30|$|Global {{acetabular}} overcoverage {{can occur}} due to coxa profunda, protrusio, or true acetabular retroversion, which {{can result in}} pincer impingement. True acetabular retroversion refers to posterior wall undercoverage both superiorly and inferiorly, with relative anterior acetabular overcoverage. Coxa profunda {{is characterized by a}} deep acetabulum with <b>circumferential</b> medial <b>joint</b> space loss. On radiographs, the wall of the acetabulum projects medial to the ilioischial line [38]. Acetabular depth can be calculated by measuring the distance between a line drawn {{through the center of the}} femoral head and a line joining the anterior and posterior acetabular rims [39]. Protrusio acetabuli is diagnosed when the femoral head projects medial to the ilioischial line on an AP pelvis radiograph [40].|$|R
40|$|The paper treats a weld {{discontinuity}} called lack of fusion, {{which is}} frequently {{a cause of}} leakage of a water heater. The heater was produced by MAG welding using two wires (twin arc welding). The paper states some reasons for the occurrence of lack of fusion, i. e. the arc blow effect, an inappropriate gun position, uncontrolled movement of the weld pool, too low energy input, an improper joint preparation. The defect is illustrated in a macrograph of a weld produced at the water heater with twin wires in a shielding gas. Welding with twin wires is schematically represented with a <b>circumferential</b> welded <b>joint</b> between the end and shell of the water heater...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 12 HMF steel after longterm service. The investigated material was taken from a pipeline with <b>circumferential</b> welded <b>joint</b> after 419 988 hours of service at the temperature of 490 °C, steam pressure 8 MPa. Performed research has shown that the 12 HMF steel after service was characterized by a typical microstructure for this grade of steel, that is a ferritic-bainitic microstructure without any visible advanced processes of its degradation. The investigation of mechanical properties has shown that the examined steel after service was characterized by a very low impact energy KV, and yield strength lower than the required minimum. Whilst tensile strength and yield strength determined at elevated temperature was higher and similar to the standard requirements, respectively. It has been proved that the main cause of an increase in brittleness and a decrease in yield strength of the examined steel should be seen in the segregation of phosphorus to grain boundaries and the formation of precipitate free zones near the boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} {{mechanic}} model with springs {{to calculate the}} plastic limit state of timber glass wall with an adhesive bonded joint between glass and timber (also called panel). The mechanic model {{was taken from the}} doctoral dissertation Huveners, E. M. P. 2009, Circumferentially Adhesive Bonded Glass Panes for Bracing Steel Frames in Façades, Doctoral Dissertation. Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands, who carried out the equations for calculating the steel glass panel. We wanted to check if the derived mechanic model can also be used for timber glass panels. We used it to calculate the timber glass panel produced by Kager Hiše d. o. o. and which was experimentally tested by the Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Maribor. We focused only on one type of the adhesive joint between timber and glass, on <b>circumferential</b> adhesive <b>joint.</b> Experiments were carried out only for this type of adhesive joint and also the equations for mechanic model were derived only for this type of adhesive joint. We found out that the stiffness of the system calculated with mechanic model is in good agreement with the stiffness of the system got from experimental results in the case of appropriate selection of the modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of the adhesive (based on the working diagram of the adhesive) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{structural}} stability of adhesively supported glass panels subjected to in-plane shear walls is assessed {{by means of}} extended finite-element (FE) investigations and analytical methods. Based on past research projects, careful consideration is given to glass panels with two-side circumferential linear adhesive connections and supporting metal frames, which are frequently used in practice for facades and building envelopes. In accordance with earlier research contributions, the effects deriving from adhesive connections and supporting frames of various stiffnesses are highlighted in terms of expected Euler’s critical shear loads and ultimate buckling resistances. Further extended nonlinear incremental studies are then discussed, and the major structural effects deriving from {{the interaction between the}} glass sheets, the <b>circumferential</b> adhesive <b>joints,</b> the supporting metal frames and additional small steel supports often used to transfer the maximum compressive reaction forces to {{the structural}} background are properly highlighted. As shown, compared to classical theories of ideally simply supported or fully clamped panels under the action of in-plane shear loads, the actual boundary conditions should be carefully taken into account. At the same time, the effects deriving from multiple combinations of several geometrical and mechanical aspects should be properly assessed. In the specific case, numerically derived buckling coefficients and fitting curves of practical use are proposed for an appropriate calculation of the expected Euler’s critical load for the studied configurations. Finally, the application and validity of a normalized Eurocode-based design buckling curve recalled from literature is also assessed. Based on the rather good agreement between FE and analytical calculations, the same approach is then proposed as practical and suitable design method for the studied loading and boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of stress}} {{concentration}} zones using stand-off magnetometry {{based on the}} magnetomechanical effect has recently been applied to pipeline inspection. This study addresses the lack of scientific evidence encountered {{in the development of}} the technology by using a combination of laboratory experiments, field observations, and computer simulations to study the magnetic indication of local stress concentrations in the bulk material. It then offers new techniques to determine features of underground pipelines, and evaluates their performance using field survey data and standard inspection reports. The models proposed in this study are capable of simulating the effects of stress cycles on magnetisation of steel bars and pipes placed in the earth's magnetic field. The experimental and simulation results have shown that the magnetic indication of a local stress concentration zone (SCZ) is due to the distribution of magnetisation between the local SCZ and the surrounding area or the bulk material, which has explained the reverse in the polarity of the magnetic indication when varying the applied stress. It also implies the possibility to monitor stress conditions in ferrous material. It is proposed that the gradient magnetic field should be used in order to extract the magnetic indication from the measured magnetic field, together with a parameter K as the criteria for detection and characterisation of local SCZ using the remote magnetic field. It has found that K is linear with the initial magnetic condition induced in low field at a given stress. Inversely, at a given initial condition, variation of K with stress follows the stress-magnetisation relationship of the material. K is more sensitive with stress at stronger initial conditions. The study has also established the quantitative exponential relationship between K and the measurement distance, which implies a technique to solve for stress condition from the remote magnetic field. A study on <b>circumferential</b> welded <b>joints</b> of pipelines has found magnetic features of the welds, which implies the possibility to locate them using above-ground surveys.

40|$|Mechanical damages, like scratches, are {{commonly}} detected on {{the surfaces of}} aircraft components and structures. They can be accidentally introduced during machining or maintenance operations or {{be the result of}} wear and impacts during aircraft service. Under the action of service loads, such mechanical damage can generate fatigue cracks reducing the component fatigue life and compromising the aircraft structural integrity. The evaluation of the effect of scratches and other small mechanical defects on the structure and component fatigue lives is therefore necessary to define an inspections programme and ensure the structural safety. Conventional fatigue life prediction methods generally consider scratches tents of microns deep too shallow to appreciably affect the fatigue performances of structural components. However the discovery of the scribe marks on fuselage joints disproved that prediction. In fact several commercial airlines discovered during inspections that aircraft which have been repainted showed multiple scratches on the fuselage skin along longitudinal and <b>circumferential</b> <b>joints.</b> Those scratches, referred to scribe marks, appear to have been caused by use of sharp tools during sealant removal process prior repainting. Scratches less than 200 μm deep were capable of severely reducing the fatigue life performance under service load rendering some aircraft beyond economical repair. This thesis investigates the fatigue performances of 2024 -T 531 aluminium alloy sheets weakened by mechanically machined scratches. 2 mm thick clad and unclad samples were scribed at their gauge section using a diamond tipped tool. The scribing process produced very regular rounded V-shaped notches with an included angle of 60 ° across the sample width. Scratches from 25 μm to 185 μm deep, with 5 μm, 25 μm and 50 μm root radii were cut on the sample surfaces. Scribed sample were subsequently fatigue tested under constant amplitude tensile and bending load with a stress ratio of R= 0. 1 at a maximum stress of 200 MPa. Scribes were found to reduce the fatigue life of tension and bending samples up to 97 % compared to that of smooth unscribed specimens. Both scribe shape and size affected the fatigue life of tensile and bending aluminium samples. The sharper and the larger the notch, the shorter the fatigue life. Post failure fractography investigations were performed on sample fracture surfaces by means of optical and scanning electron microscope. Crack nucleation sites, fracture morphology and peculiar features left during crack propagation were analysed. Finally crack propagation data under different loading conditions were obtained by striation counting performed on fracture surfaces. Multiple crack initiation occurred at scribe roots usually from inclusions, defects or weak points along the root. The number and density of crack nucleation sites appeared to be determined by the scribe; increasing for notches with larger stress concentrations. Scribe geometry did not affect the fatigue growth rate but the propagation life for cracks deeper than 50 - 100 μm was influenced. Cracks nucleated from scribe marks showed a typical short crack behaviour growing faster than long cracks with the same linear elastic stress intensity factor. Finite element calculations were performed on scribed samples evaluating how the presence of scribes altered the local stress and strain fields. Monotonic elastic and elastic-plastic and cyclic elastic-plastic analyses were carried out under tensile and bending loads. Local elastic-plastic stress and strain fields in the neighbourhood of different scribes were determined by the notch shape and size. According to the occurrence of mechanical similitude conditions, scribes with the same shape but different size showed similar plastic zone and stress and strain distributions. A stabilised cyclic plastic zone was developed just at the root of scribes with a ratio between the root radius and depth ρ/d≤ 0. 2. No correlations were observed between the occurrence of a stabilised cyclic plastic zone and the sample nucleation lives defined as the number of cycles to obtain an initial crack 50 μm deep from the notch root. Traditional fatigue life prediction methods, based on the notch sensitivity factor, were not able to correctly characterise the effect of scratches few tens of microns deep on the fatigue life of 2024 -T 351 aluminium alloy components. An approach based on the critical distance theory was developed to characterise the total fatigue life reduction produced by the introduction of scribes relating the fatigue live to a critical stress range Δσlm. The critical stress range was capable of describing the effect of the elastic stress distribution produced by dissimilar notches on the nucleation and propagation of fatigue crack considering also the effect of the variation of the fatigue load nominal applied stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} concerning the use of open end drain tile on steep slopes were: To {{determine the effect of}} misalignment and velocity on pressures in a two dimensional model tile line. To predict the mechanisms of failure in open end tile lines flowing full on steep slopes. An analysis of the pressure data showed that negative pressures were statistically influenced by misalignment, but not by velocity. Positive pressures in the test joint were significantly dependent on both velocity and misalignment. A velocity times misalignment interaction was significant for all piezometers in the test section. A general prediction of pressure trends within the test joint on the basis of joint geometry and the principles of fluid mechanics was accurate. Pressure trends could be predicted for joint geometries other than the one of this investigation, using these same principles. The development of negative pressures for the joint geometry studied was dependent on full pipe flow. Observations on the tile model using soil above and below the test section indicated that full pipe flow is not likely to develop in a tile line. This is because of the flow separation occurring at misaligned joints, and because of the ease of air entry through the soil at these points. Full pipe flow would be possible only for a highly cohesive, saturated soil, and a high head on the tile line. Observations on the two dimensional model, coupled with the study of pressures within the misaligned joint indicated that several theoretically possible failure mechanisms are not likely to develop in a field installation. These are: eddying action erosion at the <b>joints,</b> <b>circumferential</b> flow erosion within a joint, “blowouts” to the ground surface, and negative pressures drawing soil into the line. The failure mechanisms most likely to occur in a tile line with misalignments are: piping erosion from one joint to another along the bottom of the tile section jetting action at the joints where misalignment occurs, and full pipe flow forcing water out at the joints as a result of extremely high heads or a restricted outlet.
