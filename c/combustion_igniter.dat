40|$|Ignition {{transients}} are a {{very important}} practical aspect {{in the design of}} solid propellant rockets, for the prediction and control of dynamic loads on the motor and on the entire vehicle. The present study is detailing a simple model and the relative numerical solution method for the analysis of ignition transient in solid propellant motors. The model is capable of providing an accurate and reliable prediction of the most significant engineering quantities (pressure and velocity in the thrust chamber) for different rocket configurations, for which currently available methods are yielding relatively unsatisfactory results: this would allow for an effective preliminary design of the motor, minimizing the need for experimental tests. A theoretical quasi-one-dimensional model is derived from basic conservation laws, taking into account the initiation of <b>combustion</b> by the <b>igniter</b> discharge signal, the heat transfer from <b>igniter</b> <b>combustion</b> products to the propellant grain surface, the flame spreading flow field in the chamber and the increase of chamber pressure up to to the quasi-steady operating condition. The set of modeling equations are then solved using a slightly modified Lax-Friedrics method. Sample results are presented for typical solid boosters of the Ariane family (Ariane 4 and Ariane 5) ...|$|R
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate <b>combustion.</b> The <b>igniters</b> are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|R
40|$|Initiation of {{chemical}} reactions liberating thermal energy in non-hypergolic propellants require ignition systems which are reliable {{as well as}} robust in nature. This necessitates the igniter and its subsystems be on par or exceed every quality criteria required for the main stage. Ignition systems which provide pilot action and flame holding in supersonic environment adds new challenges in its structural and thermal stability. The paper aims to conduct a numerical analysis of an Augmented Spark Torch Igniter required for an air breathing rocket (SCRAMJET) engine {{with the emphasis on}} the optimization of the mixing length ratio required to achieve a uniform mixture ratio distribution in the zone of the <b>igniter</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber...|$|R
40|$|The trough vortex {{phenomena}} is {{used for}} combustion of hydrogen in a supersonic air stream. This was done in small sizes suitable for <b>igniters</b> in supersonic <b>combustion</b> ramjets {{so long as the}} boundary layer displacement thickness is less than 25 % of the trough step height. A simple electric spark, properly positioned, ignites the hydrogen in the trough corner. The resulting flame is self sustaining and reignitable. Hydrogen can be injected at the base wall or immediately upstream of the trough. The hydrogen is introduced at low velocity to permit it to be drawn into the corner vortex system and thus experience a long residence time in the <b>combustion</b> region. The <b>igniters</b> can be placed on a skewed back step for angles at least up to 30 deg. without affecting the igniter performance significantly. Certain metals (platinum, copper) act catalytically to improve ignition...|$|R
40|$|Ignition {{experiments}} of Hydrogen and Ethylene {{were performed}} on direct-connected pulse combustion facility. Air stagnation temperatures were 900 K and stagnation pressures were 0. 8 MPa, the entrance Mach number was approximate 2. 0 provided by a two-dimension nozzle. The experimental results indicate that: (1) Hydrogen self-ignition won’t occur at stagnation 935 K when it is injected upstream the cavity in this combustor model. But with low input power igniter, hydrogen can be ignited reliably. (2) Ethylene cannot be ignited with igniter only even at high igniter power. Under the assistant of both igniter and pilot Hydrogen, Ethylene can be ignited reliably and maintain stable <b>combustion</b> after the <b>igniter</b> and pilot hydrogen completely turned off. (3) The lowest equivalence ratio of pilot hydrogen for successful ethylene ignition is 0. 05 below that ignition will fail. (4) When pilot hydrogen and igniters were both employed for ignition, the function of igniter is to ignite the hydrogen and the input power of igniter has no influence on ignition performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) {{program was}} {{initiated}} by NASA {{in response to}} the need for a new generation rocket motor capable of providing increased thrust levels over the existing Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) and thus augment the lifting capacity of the space shuttle orbiter. To achieve these higher thrust levels and improve motor reliability, advanced motor design concepts were employed. In the head end of the motor, for instance, the propellent cast has been changed from the conventional annular configuration to a 'multi-slot' configuration in order to increase the burn surface area and guarantee rapid motor ignition. In addition, the igniter itself has been redesigned and currently features 12 exhaust ports in order to channel hot <b>igniter</b> <b>combustion</b> gases into the circumferential propellent slots. Due to the close proximity of the igniter ports to the propellent surfaces, new concerns over possible propellent deformation and erosive burning have arisen. The following documents the effort undertaken using computational fluid dynamics to perform a flow field analysis in the top end of the ASRM motor to determine flow field properties necessary to permit a subsequent propellent fin deformation analysis due to pressure loading and an assessment of the extent of erosive burning...|$|R
40|$|Dust explosibility is {{traditionally}} described by two parameters, namely the maximum explosion pressure, P$_{max}$, and the deflagration index, K$_{St}$, usually determined through testing in a closed, pressure-resistant spherical vessel, either 20 L or 1 m$^{ 3 }$ in volume. These parameters constitute key {{variables in the}} design of explosion protection systems, such as venting, suppression or isolation systems. The potential for overdriving dust <b>combustion</b> with pyrotechnical <b>igniters</b> in the 20 -l sphere has been recognized, discussed and analyzed for many years, notably in the determination of the minimum explosible and limiting oxygen concentrations, which has led to specific guidelines regarding the ignition source strength in ASTM standards. The current paper presents new experimental evidence that the energy provided by pyrotechnical igniters may, in some instances, physically alter the dust being tested in the 20 -l sphere. K$_{St}$ values can be several times greater in the small vessel compared to those measured in the 1 -m$^{ 3 }$ chamber. Further visual evidence is provided to show that high energy ignition can produce a turbulent flame region, possibly consisting of a hybrid mixture of flammable gas (or vapor) and dust, which can propagate faster than the corresponding pure dust. The experiments suggest that K$_{St}$ values measured in the 20 -l sphere may no longer be representative of a dust deflagration in a real process environment. We recommend additional tests in a 1 -m$^{ 3 }$ chamber when a dust exhibits a low flash point, or when it's K$_{St}$ is above 300 bar m/s in the 20 -l sphere.

40|$|In {{the design}} and {{development}} of solid propellant rocket motors, the use of numerical tools able to simulate, predict and reconstruct {{the behavior of a}} given motor in all its operative conditions is particularly important in order to decrease all the planning times and costs. This work is devoted to present an approach to the numerical simulation of SRM internal ballistic during the entire combustion time (ignition transient, quasi steady state and tail-off) by means of a Q 1 D unsteady numerical simulation model, named SPINBALL (Solid Propellant rocket motor INternal BALListic). SPINBALL comes out from the updating and further development of the numerical, mathematical and physical models of the SPIT model (Solid Propellant rocket motor Ignition Transient), that allows to extend the numerical simulation of the SRM internal ballistic, from the ignition transient, to quasi steady state and tail-off. SPINBALL core model is a quasi- 1 D unsteady gasdynamics model of the internal ballistic, with source terms that take into account the contribution to the bore flowfield conditions due to the igniter, the grain propellant and thermal protections. The flow is assumed as a non-reacting mixture of perfect gases with space and time varying thermophysical properties (standard thermodynamics approach). The governing equations are discretized by a Godunov-type scheme, first or second order in space and time. The use of a such approach allows to consider the addition into the chamber due to both ablation phenomena from thermal protections and combustion reactions from the grain propellant, but even {{to take into account the}} equilibrium point of the grain propellant exothermic reactions, as function of the local pressure and the variation from that nominal condition, through the combustion efficiency. This main model is completed by several sub-models, in order to describe all the driving phenomena that lead the internal ballistic for the entire <b>combustion</b> time: an <b>igniter</b> model, an heat transfer model for convection and radiation, propellant ignition criterion, a cavity model to account submergence and slot regions, a grain combustion model with the pressure term (APN model) and the erosive term (Lenoir-Robillard model with the modifications due to Lawrence and Beddini). Some of them coming from the SPIT model. Focusing on the driving phenomena that characterize the internal ballistic over the ignition transient, it is known that, during quasi steady state and tail-off, the motor bore flowfield conditions are led mainly by the grain burning surface evolution in time and the possible nozzle throat area ablation phenomena. The grain burning surface evolution model is a 3 D numerical grain regression model (named GREG) based on a full matrix level set approach, on both rectangular and cylindrical structured grids, that gives to the gasdynamical model the evolution in time of port area, wet perimeter and burn perimeter along the motor axis and in the submergence zone. The numerical scheme for the numerical integration of the Level Set equation is built from the strong link between Hamilton-Jacobi equations and conservation laws and it is a first or second order (minmod flux limiter and Heun's method) in time and space time marching scheme based of an exact Riemann solver. The use of a 3 D model is mandatory to carry out the grain burnback analysis in the case of general and complex 3 D grain shapes, as finocyl grains, whatever bore flowfield dimensional model (0 D or Q 1 D) is adopted. GREG module can handle 3 D complex geometries directly from CAD tools, building up its initial condition as a narrow signed distance function from STL (stereolithography) files of the grain propellant and the thermal protections and insulation shapes by a completely automatic procedure. The grain burning rate can be variable, both in space and time. The use of grain propellant shape symmetries is exploited with the setting up of mirroring, or periodic boundary conditions, reducing the computational costs. The evaluation of the grain geometrical parameter, as areas, volumes and perimeters, is made with a robust second order regularization of the Dirac Delta and Heaviside functions to avoid the typical problems related with the use of the standard regularization techniques. While potentially GREG module can be completely coupled with the Q 1 D unsteady flowfield model, in this work, we will consider a decoupling between the grain burnback model and the flowfield model, in order to reduce the computational cost required. GREG model is, hence, used as a pre-processor that generates tables of pre-evaluated grain geometrical properties for a constant burning rate in time and space. During the numerical simulation, these tables of port area, wet perimeter and burning perimeter are then interpolated using the local increment of the web variable, defined by the local grain burning rate, coming from APN and LR models. The final objective is, hence, to develop an analysis/simulation capability of SRM internal ballistic for the entire combustion time, with simplified physical models, in order to reduce the computational cost required, but ensuring, in the meanwhile, an accuracy of the simulation greater than the one usually given by 0 D quasi steady models. In this framework, the comparison between the results obtained with a 0 D quasi steady chamber model and SPINBALL will be made and the effects of the increased detail level of the internal ballistic simulation on the overall prediction capability will be discussed for three SRM: Z 23 second stage of the new European launcher VEGA and two military motors, NAWC n. 6 and 13, on which there are different work in literature, and all motor data are available. Comparisons with the experimental data and with other codes results will be also made...|$|R
