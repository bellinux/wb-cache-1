5|$|On 18 January 1966, {{shortly after}} Singapore's independence, the President of Singapore {{appointed}} a Constitutional Commission helmed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> rights of racial, linguistic, and religious {{minorities in the}} nascent nation should be protected. Singapore had just been ejected from Malaysia, and had experienced {{an extended period of}} racial and religious tension resulting from the Maria Hertogh riots. This experience reinforced the need for a multiracial society based on equality among races.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E

25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> archetypical {{scattering}} experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states {{where they are}} so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} that the free field is identically zero {{is the core of}} the absorber idea. It means that the radiation emitted by each particle is completely absorbed by all other particles present in the universe. To better understand this point, it may be useful to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> absorption mechanism works in common materials. At the microscopic scale, it results from the sum of the incoming electromagnetic wave and the waves generated from the electrons of the material, which react to the external perturbation. If the incoming wave is absorbed, the result is a zero outgoing field. In the absorber theory the same concept is used, however, in presence of both retarded and advanced waves.|$|E

It currently lists CFS/ME with a highlight notice, inviting researchers to develop high-quality research proposals for funding. In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt {{that there has been}} far too much emphasis in the past on psychological research, with insufficient attention to biomedical research, and that it is vital that further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.|$|E

25|$|Finally, any {{critique}} of attachment theory needs to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> theory has connected {{with changes in}} other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to behaviour genetics and {{to the study of}} temperament (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of mentalization or Theory of Mind, the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement. The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan flew to Washington, DC, {{for talks}} on 25 October, despite {{concerns}} that the 10 October Windscale fire might prove a stumbling block in negotiations. He immediately sensed how shaken the Americans had been by sputnik. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure {{to act on the}} deployment of IRBMs by a shocked and distraught nation. Eisenhower and Macmillan agreed to form a study group headed by Sir Richard Powell, the Permanent Secretary to Ministry of Defence, and Donald A. Quarles, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited. Another study group, under Strauss and Sir Edwin Plowden, the head of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), would investigate nuclear cooperation and the exchange of nuclear information. The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.|$|E
25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. <b>Consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> design of steam engines could be improved. He {{wanted to make}} them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a {{self-contained}} unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E
500|$|The author {{went on to}} <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> phrase {{international}} comity should be defined, observing that [...] "it is often used by the United Kingdom courts to mean a rule or principle of (customary) international law, {{as opposed to a}} rule pertaining only to the common courtesy of nations". Finally, he argued that if this was the interpretation to be adopted, then Taw Cheng Kong [...] "suggests that what the Singapore courts recognize as a customary rule of international law that has been received into the common-law could determine or condition the proper interpretation to be given to a statutory provision, or could at least be relied upon to determine the true intent of Parliament".|$|E

500|$|If {{businesses}} provided {{employees with}} gross pay (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes), Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics estimated production costs could decrease by {{a minimum of}} 11.55% (partial accommodation). This reduction would be from {{the removal of the}} remaining embedded costs, including corporate taxes, compliance costs, and the employer share of payroll taxes. This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario. Bruce Bartlett states that it is unlikely that nominal wages would be reduced, which he believes would result in a recession, but that the Federal Reserve would likely increase the money supply to accommodate price increases.

500|$|The 1944 Operation Bagration in Belarus {{applied the}} {{strategic}} aims and objectives {{on a grand}} scale, to deceive the Germans about the scale and objectives of the offensive. The historian Paul Adair commented that [...] "Once the Stavka had decided upon the strategic plan for their 1944 summer offensive , they began to <b>consider</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Germans could be deceived about the aims and scale of the offensive... {{the key to the}} maskirovka operation was to reinforce the German conviction that operations would continue along this [...] axis". In particular, Stavka needed to be certain that the Germans believed the main Soviet attack would be in the south. The Soviet plan successfully kept the German reserves doing nothing south of the Pripyat marshes until the battle to the north in Belorussia had already been decided. Stavka succeeded in concealing the size and position of very large movements of supplies, as well as of forces including seven armies, eleven aviation corps and over 200,000 troop replacements. As for the strategic offensive itself, its location, strength and timing were effectively concealed. Stavka and the Red Army applied the doctrine of military deception at three levels: ...|$|E
