6000|$|... "You think I {{have lost}} my senses, with the shock," [...] Ralph said, smiling. [...] "I {{can assure you}} that that is my age. My beard and {{whiskers}} are so firmly fixed on, with <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> that I shall have an awful trouble to get them off; and my hair the same. If you feel along here, from one ear to the other, you will feel a ridge. That is the <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> that sticks all this mass of frizzled hair on.|$|R
60|$|They then {{returned}} to the hairdresser, and Ralph insisted that the beard and mustache should be fastened on not only in the ordinary manner--with springs--but with <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will be all}} right, Bob. You {{have never}} seen him outside the city, yet. Still, I shouldn't be up to any tricks with him, you know, if I were you--shouldn't put <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax</b> on his pigtail, or {{anything}} of that sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ought both to have shaved {{before you}} put those things on," [...] Captain Holland said, as they muttered exclamations of pain. [...] "You see, <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> or {{whatever}} it is, sticks to what little down there is on your cheeks and chin, and I don't wonder that it hurts horribly, pulling it off. If you had shaved first, {{you would not have}} felt any of that." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the late}} lamented Lord Glenlivat, who broke his neck at a hurdle-race, at the {{premature}} age of twenty-four, {{was at the}} University, the amiable young fellow, passing to his rooms in the early morning, and seeing Hugby's boots at his door, on the same staircase, playfully wadded the insides of the boots with <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> which caused excruciating pains to the Rev. Mr. Hugby, {{when he came to}} take them off the same evening, before dining with the Master of St. Crispin's.|$|R
60|$|There {{are those}} who would be ashamed to subject {{themselves}} to such a taskmaster, and who think {{that the man who}} works with his imagination should allow himself to wait till--inspiration moves him. When I have heard such doctrine preached, I have hardly been able to repress my scorn. To me it would not be more absurd if the shoemaker were to wait for inspiration, or the tallow-chandler for the divine moment of melting. If the man whose business it is to write has eaten too many good things, or has drunk too much, or smoked too many cigars,--as men who write sometimes will do,--then his condition may be unfavourable for work; but so will be the condition of a shoemaker who has been similarly imprudent. I have sometimes thought that the inspiration wanted has been the remedy which time will give to the evil results of such imprudence.--Mens sana in corpore sano. The author wants that as does every other workman,--that and a habit of industry. I was once told that the surest aid to the writing of a book was a piece of <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax</b> on my chair. I certainly believe in the <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax</b> much more than the inspiration.|$|R
60|$|After {{much thought}} they had decided upon a place of {{concealment}} for the quill containing Ronald's credentials, which would, they thought, defy the strictest scrutiny. A hole had been bored from the back into the heel of Ronald's boot deep enough to contain the quill, and after this was inserted in the hiding place the hole was filled up with <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> {{so that it would}} need a close examination indeed to discover its existence. Thus, although they were several times closely searched, no document of a suspicious nature was found upon them.|$|R
5000|$|Kelvin {{rejected}} {{this idea}} {{as there was}} no evidence of tidal deformation of the Earth's crust, and in response Perry made a reference to Kelvin's favourite demonstration of the slow deformation of shoemaker's wax to illustrate the supposed qualities of the presumed luminiferous aether thought then to be necessary to transmit light through space. Perry wrote that [...] "the real basis of your calculation is your assumption that the solid earth cannot alter its shape ... even in 1000 million years, under the action of forces constantly tending to alter its shape, and yet we see the gradual closing up of passages in a mine, and we know that wrinkling and faults and other changes of shape are always going on in the earth under the action of long-continued forces. I know that solid rock is not like <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> but 109 years is a long time, and the forces are great." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It {{would be}} {{injustice}} to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, {{excuse me for}} taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But {{we have to be}} careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax</b> which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it {{at the top of his}} voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.|$|R
60|$|All toys at first, I find. Up yonder, {{among the}} green holly and red berries, is the Tumbler {{with his hands}} in his pockets, who wouldn't lie down, but {{whenever}} he was put upon the floor, persisted in rolling his fat body about, until he rolled himself still, and brought those lobster eyes of his to bear upon me--when I affected to laugh very much, but in my heart of hearts was extremely doubtful of him. Close beside him is that infernal snuff-box, out of which there sprang a demoniacal Counsellor in a black gown, with an obnoxious head of hair, and a red cloth mouth, wide open, who was not to be endured on any terms, but could not be put away either; for he used suddenly, in a highly magnified state, to fly out of Mammoth Snuff-boxes in dreams, when least expected. Nor is the frog with <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax</b> on his tail, far off; for there was no knowing where he wouldn't jump; and when he flew over the candle, and came upon one's hand with that spotted back--red on a green ground--he was horrible. The cardboard lady in a blue-silk skirt, who was stood up against the candlestick to dance, and whom I see on the same branch, was milder, and was beautiful; but I can't say as much for the larger cardboard man, who used to be hung against the wall and pulled by a string; there was a sinister expression in that nose of his; and when he got his legs round his neck (which he very often did), he was ghastly, and not a creature to be alone with.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder whether}} those little silver pencil-cases with a movable almanac at the {{butt-end}} are still favorite implements with boys, and whether pedlers still hawk {{them about the}} country? Are there pedlers and hawkers still, or are rustics and children grown too sharp to deal with them? Those pencil-cases, {{as far as my}} memory serves me, were not of much use. The screw, upon which the movable almanac turned, was constantly getting loose. The 1 of the table would work from its moorings, under Tuesday or Wednesday, as the case might be, and you would find, on examination, that Th. or W. was the 23 1/2 of the month (which was absurd {{on the face of the}} thing), and in a word your cherished pencil-case an utterly unreliable time-keeper. Nor was this a matter of wonder. Consider the position of a pencil-case in a boy's pocket. You had hard-bake in it; marbles, kept in your purse when the money was all gone; your mother's purse, knitted so fondly and supplied with a little bit of gold, long since--prodigal little son!--scattered amongst the swine--I mean amongst brandy-balls, open tarts, three-cornered puffs, and similar abominations. You had a top and string; a knife; a piece of cobbler's wax; two or three bullets; a Little Warbler; and I, for my part, remember, for a considerable period, a brass-barrelled pocket-pistol (which would fire beautifully, for with it I shot off a button from Butt Major's jacket);--with all these things, and ever so many more, clinking and rattling in your pockets, and your hands, of course, keeping them in perpetual movement, how could you expect your movable almanac not to be twisted out of its place now and again--your pencil-case to be bent--your liquorice water not to leak out of your bottle over the <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> your bull's-eyes not to ram up the lock and barrel of your pistol, and so forth.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{said that}} had Thackeray succeeded in that attempt he would surely have ruined himself. No man can be fit for the {{management}} and performance of special work who has learned nothing of it before his thirty-seventh year; and no man could have been less so than Thackeray. There are men who, though they be not fit, are disposed to learn their lesson and make themselves as fit as possible. Such cannot {{be said to have}} been the case with this man. For the special duties which he would have been called upon to perform, consisting to a great extent of the maintenance of discipline over a large body of men, training is required, and the service would have suffered for awhile under any untried elderly tiro. Another man might have put himself into harness. Thackeray never would have done so. The details of his work after the first month would have been inexpressibly wearisome to him. To have gone into the city, and to have remained there every day from eleven till five, would have been all but impossible to him. He would not have done it. And then he would have been tormented by the feeling that he was taking the pay and not doing the work. There is a belief current, not confined to a few, that a man may be a Government Secretary with a generous salary, and have nothing to do. The idea is something that remains to us from the old days of sinecures. If there be now remaining places so pleasant, or gentlemen so happy, I do not know them. Thackeray's notion of his future duties was probably very vague. He would have repudiated the notion that {{he was looking for a}} sinecure, but no doubt considered that the duties would be easy and light. It is not too much to assert, that he who could drop his pearls as I have said above, throwing them wide cast without an effort, would have found his work as Assistant-Secretary at the General Post Office to be altogether too much for him. And then it was no doubt his intention to join literature with the Civil Service. He had been taught to regard the Civil Service as easy, and had counted upon himself as able to add it to his novels, and his work with his Punch brethren, and to his contributions generally to the literature of the day. He might have done so, could he have risen at five, and have sat at his private desk for three hours before he began his official routine at the public one. A capability for grinding, an aptitude for continuous task work, a disposition to sit in one's chair as though fixed to it by <b>cobbler's</b> <b>wax,</b> will enable a man in the prime of life to go through the tedium of a second day's work every day; but of all men Thackeray was the last to bear the wearisome perseverance of such a life. Some more or less continuous attendance at his office he must have given, and with it would have gone Punch and the novels, the ballads, the burlesques, the essays, the lectures, and the monthly papers full of mingled satire and tenderness, which have left to us that Thackeray which we could so ill afford to lose out of the literature of the nineteenth century. And there would have remained to the Civil Service the memory of a disgraceful job.|$|R
