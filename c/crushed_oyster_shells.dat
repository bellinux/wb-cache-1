This new area was called Middleburg, and eventually developed into {{what is now the}} town of Elmhurst, bordering Maspeth. Originally, 28 English Quakers had founded the village of Maspeth, which had sizable water and milling industries along Newtown Creek and Maspeth Creek. Two storekeepers, Nathanial Hazard and Francis T. White, sold food and clothes at the Maspeth Town Docks, at what is now 56th Terrace and Rust Street, by the late 18th century.

25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shells.</b> Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E
40|$|In {{the oyster}} {{producing}} district, the shells are being crushed {{to maintain the}} capacity of dump yard. Though the <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> has been diverted to feed, manure and soil conditioner from a past, the shell pieces are possible to also use as the construction materials. The purpose of present study is to verify the usefulness of <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> as subgrade materials by executing improvement of existing road. The construction work {{was carried out in}} March, 2002 and the widening subgrade (70 m in length, 3. 5 m in width and 0. 35 m in thickness) containing <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> was built under three mixing conditions. The surface treatment was immediately paved over the base course after base materials were compacted. Allowing passage of vehicles, we have recently investigated the deflection shape of road surface by using "falling weight deflectometer" (FWD). According to the relationship between the load and the detected deflections, the maximum deflection at loading point tended to decrease with an increase in service time. Particularly, CBR value estimated from the deflection (D_) has exceeded an object level of improvement for section including the almost dried shell pieces. These results show that the <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> can be effectively utilized as subgrade materials...|$|R

40|$|Excavating {{the ground}} which {{consists}} of the marine deposits formed during Neogen and/or Quaternary period, the acid sulfate soil occasionally appears on the execution basis. As this soil includes sulfuric acid produced with the oxidation of sulfide, the growth of plants is disturbed and it becomes difficult to improve the soil by adding a stabilizer. In general, the calcic materials such as stone powder and zeolite have been employed to neutralize the acid sulfate soil from the past. Therefore, the shells which are composed mainly of a calcium carbonate {{can also be considered}} to be useful as a material for the neutralization process. We have ascertained the stabilization effect due to the using of <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> by comparing the amount of swelling and CBR value for soil-stabilizer-shell mixture with those for soil-stabilizer mixture. Mixing <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> into the soil, pH value of the mixture gradually shifted to neutral with elapsed time and its water content decreased immediately. Furthermore, the amount of swelling which occurred during submergence curing was extremely small for soil-stabilizer-shell mixture and CBR value of this mixture was 1. 5 to 4 times larger than that of soil-stabilizer mixture. These results indicate that both surplus soil and non-industrial waste will be utilized effectively as embankment and subgrade materials at a time...|$|R
50|$|The Esplanade was {{developed}} in the 1870s to provide a site of active recreation for the inhabitants of the city. The idea of a site closer to the administrative and residential heart of the city had been a matter of concern since at least 1864, when a fund {{for the establishment of a}} new recreation ground was established. (A recreation ground, now Wellington Square, was included in the original town plan but was considered too far for most people to walk to and was largely undeveloped). Stones were placed in the river to mark out the edge of the reclamation, around 1867 -1868, but little other work was undertaken until 1870. Between 1870 and 1878 reclamation was undertaken using mud dredged up from the river bottom (dredging was used to provide <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> for marking out roads and pathways) and street sweepings.|$|R
50|$|Relatively flat shell fields, {{of about}} 6.5 ha in area, {{are in the}} {{interior}} of the shell works, separated from the shell ring by mangroves, with a series of mounds partly surrounding the shell fields. The shell fields have some very low ridges and shallow depressions and ponds. Schwadron suggests that the depressions may have been oyster roasting pits or the sites of structures. The shell fields consist primarily of small <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> with some conch and whelk shells, and many artifacts, including ceramics and shell tools. The base level of the shell fields consists of a mixture of broken and unbroken <b>oyster</b> <b>shell,</b> with no artifacts and very little soil. On top of the base is a very thin layer of <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell,</b> interpreted as an old ground surface. Possible post holes, now filled with soil, extend from this layer into the base layer. Above the old ground surface is a midden layer, consisting of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> with about 20% soil mixed in, and ceramics and shell tools. The modern surface is a sandy loam. The ceramics are classified as late Glades I period, from 500 to 750. Two shell samples yielded calibrated radiocarbon dates of 400-580 and 450-620. This time period corresponds to that in which the shell fields at Fakahatchee Key were constructed.|$|R

50|$|The Gamble Mansion {{was built}} principally by enslaved laborers and {{artisans}} using local materials {{over the course}} of five to six years. The mansion is an outstanding example of antebellum construction in the Doric Revivalist vernacular architectural style. The mansion's columns and two-foot-thick walls are made of tabby, a unique type of concrete first used by Spanish and English settlers on the Atlantic coast and Sea Islands as an alternative to clay bricks, which could not be produced {{due to a lack of}} clay in the coastal soil. Techniques for making tabby were brought to Florida by European-American planters and their African-American slaves. The workers created the material by mixing lime (extracted by burning <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shells),</b> more <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shells,</b> sand, and water. The mixture was poured into molds for hardening, and the finished product was used in the same manner as bricks. Ample supplies of oyster shells were found in middens present on the sites of former Native American coastal villages. Today, the mansion is considered a monument to the craftsmanship of the enslaved African-American artisans and laborers who constructed it.|$|E

25|$|Edo {{suffered}} badly from devastating {{fires and}} the 1657 Great Fire of Meireki {{was a turning}} point in urban design. Initially, as a method of reducing fire spread, the government built stone embankments in at least two locations along rivers in the city. Over time these were torn down and replaced with dōzō storehouses that were used both as fire breaks and to store goods unloaded from the canals. The dōzō were built with a structural frame made of timber coated with a number of layers of earthen plaster on the walls, door and roof. Above the earthen roofs was a timber framework supporting a tiled roof. Although Japanese who had studied with the Dutch at their settlement in Dejima advocated building with stone and brick this was not undertaken because of their vulnerability to earthquakes. Machiya and storehouses from the later part of the period are characterised by having a black coloration to the external plaster walls. This colour was made by adding India ink to burnt lime and <b>crushed</b> <b>oyster</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{settlers}} of the Guilford colony began {{construction of}} their minister's home in September 1639, shortly after their {{arrival in the}} area of the future Guilford colony.

50|$|The Garry Oak Ecosystem Recovery Team {{suggests}} the following control strategies, stating chemical controls {{should only be}} used as a last resort in protecting endangered species or critical habitat. Hand collecting is most effective at dusk or dawn when slugs feed most actively. Traps are also effective. Commercial traps can be used, or homemade traps can be made using beer. Fences can be used to protect small areas and can be commercial (often electrical) or easily homemade with sawdust, <b>crushed</b> eggshells, ground <b>oyster</b> <b>shells,</b> soap, cinders, or diatomaceous earth. Such fences are especially effective at protecting important seedlings or home gardens. European nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) parasitize slugs, and in European agriculture, these nematodes have been mass-produced as a biological control; however, European nematodes are neither native to North America nor commercially available. In addition to nematodes, there may be other biological control methods. Sciomyzids (marsh flies) larvae kill slugs and live in environments similar to slugs. Additionally, carabid beetles consume slug eggs. Large carabid beetles, such as Abax parallelepipedus predate slugs.|$|R

To de-termine the feasibility of recycling waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> as desulfurization/denitrification sorbents, pretreating experiments and the SO 2 /NOx removal activity were investigated. Through pretreating processes, such as cal-cination and hydration, the specific surface area and pore volume of waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were increased over those of the fresh particles, making it possible to enhance the removal capacity in acid gases. XRD analysis of calcined waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> exhibited peaks characteristic of calcium oxide, whereas raw waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> showed that the main peaks were characteristic of calcium carbonate. The optimal temperatures for calcination and hydration were 800 ∼ 850 and 90 oC, respectively.
