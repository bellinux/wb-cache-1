25|$|Louisville Metro EMS {{utilizes}} {{two levels}} of care providers. EMT-Basics (referred to as technicians or EMTs) and EMT-Paramedics (usually just called paramedics) have drastically different scopes of practice but all exist to provide care and transportation to the sick and injured. A technician specializes in ambulance operation and basic life support care as well assistance to advanced providers. Most technicians have an initial six months of training receiving at least 110 hours of formal classroom training, often reaching or exceeding 120 or 168 hours, with some training institutions requiring initial unspecified numerous clinical hours within a hospital. Basic Emergency Medical Technicians are required to pass skills training and are required to challenge the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians exam to become NREMT certified. Paramedics use complex diagnostics, perform medical procedures, and administer medications and additional advanced care that would otherwise only be provided by an emergency physician. Paramedics in Kentucky generally have three years of initial training including at least 750 hours of internship and <b>clinical</b> <b>instruction</b> in addition to about 1200 hours of formal, classroom instruction. An increasing number of paramedics possess at least an associates degree, many have bachelor's degrees.|$|E

At the time, the discipline emphasized [...] "bedside teaching" [...] and providing students experience with a broad variety of illnesses and patients. The school's rural location was deemed too remote for proper clinical training, and the school was advised to stop offering the Doctor of Medicine degree and only provide pre-clinical instruction. The class of 1914 was the last (until 1974) to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree; subsequent classes of students attended DMS {{for two years before}} transferring to other medical schools.

40|$|In 2007, the Leapfrog CPOE {{standard}} {{required that}} all clinical alert overrides {{be accompanied by}} an override reason. We {{wanted to know how}} many of the free text comments left by clinicians were actually override reasons, and how many were other types of communication. We reviewed 3583 free text comments left voluntarily by clinicians while responding to an alert in a CPOE system. Of the comments received, 58 % were override reasons, 28 % were acknowledgement of the alert, 9 % were content free and over 5 % were misdirected communication, written with intent to reach someone who did not receive the alert comments. This is particularly concerning because much of the misdirected communication contained <b>clinical</b> <b>instructions.</b> Those <b>clinical</b> <b>instructions</b> were stored with the alert rather than with any clinical orders, and thus were not viewed by anyone receiving the orders.

2500|$|Once {{they had}} taken control of the {{practice}} of medicine, the doctors on the Medical Council of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) turned their attention to the quality of medical education in the province. Marginal and untrained practitioners were banned, but the question rose of the permanence and the quality of proprietary for-profit medical schools. CPSO-imposed regulations in the 1860s to increase faculty size and raise matriculation standards. They required students to take Council-administered examinations. Toronto had two medical schools– Trinity Medical School and the Toronto School of Medicine (TSM). During the 1880s the TSM added instructors, expanded its curriculum, and focused on <b>clinical</b> <b>instruction.</b> Enrollments grew at both schools. Critics found proprietary schools lacking, especially for their failure to offer sufficient instruction in the basic sciences.|$|E

50|$|Within a few years, Saltz {{had become}} the leading surgeon in Israel. In 1961, he was {{appointed}} the director of Surgery Department A, and in 1962 he was appointed head {{of all of the}} surgery departments at Hadassah Hospital. His appointment as head of surgery began a new era for Israeli surgery. Saltz had two goals: One was to bring modern, academic surgery to Hadassah, and the other was to establish a system of surgical education, similar to that in the United States. According to the American system, the surgeon was responsible not only for the care of the patient, but also for sharing his knowledge and experience with his students. This differed from the European discipline then practiced in Israel, which was based on the personal experience of the seemingly omnipotent head of the surgery department, rather than on clinical research, current medical literature, and the resident's analysis. Thus, Saltz developed a new curriculum for the systematic training of physicians that included <b>clinical</b> consultations, <b>instructions</b> during surgery, formal post-operative assessment, and extensive weekly concilia, and caused the Medical School and its surgical training to become pre-eminent in Israel and renowned abroad.|$|R
