5000|$|Classes 59/0 and 59/1 feature {{automatic}} sanding gear which releases {{fine sand}} under the wheels when wheelslip is detected. If this {{occurs when the}} locomotive is running [...] "light engine", i.e. without pulling a train, it can become electrically isolated from the rails by the fine layer of sand, albeit temporarily, and [...] "disappear" [...] from a track circuit {{as if there were}} no train occupying the section. Drivers are therefore instructed to isolate the sanding gear (via a <b>cut-out</b> <b>switch</b> on the control panel) when running light. This anomaly is peculiar to the Class 59 and well known to signalmen. A Class 59 pulling a load does not exhibit this behaviour because the other vehicles in the train can complete the track circuit.|$|E
40|$|Key {{cellular}} {{functions and}} developmental processes rely on cascades of GTPases. GTPases of the Rab family provide a molecular ID code to the generation, maintenance and transport of intracellular compartments. Here, we addressed the molecular design principles of endocytosis {{by focusing on}} the conversion of early endosomes into late endosomes, which entails replacement of Rab 5 by Rab 7. We modelled this process as a cascade of functional modules of interacting Rab GTPases. We demonstrate that intermodule interactions share similarities with the toggle switch described for the cell cycle. However, Rab 5 -to-Rab 7 conversion is rather based on a newly characterized ‘cut-out switch' analogous to an electrical safety-breaker. Both designs require cooperativity of auto-activation loops when coupled to a large pool of cytoplasmic proteins. Live cell imaging and endosome tracking provide experimental support to the <b>cut-out</b> <b>switch</b> in cargo progression and conversion of endosome identity along the degradative pathway. We propose that, by reconciling module performance with progression of activity, the <b>cut-out</b> <b>switch</b> design could underlie the integration of modules in regulatory cascades from a broad range of biological processes...|$|E

5000|$|To satisfy safety codes {{stairlifts}} {{usually have}} <b>cut-out</b> <b>switches</b> connected to “safety edges” and other protective devices so the drive power is disconnected {{if something goes}} wrong. Modern lifts have {{a high degree of}} comfort, but safety is always paramount. [...] "Safety edges" [...] are a common feature to the power pack and footplate. [...] "Safety edges" [...] ensure that if there is any obstruction on the stairs the stairlift will automatically stop and only travel away from the obstruction.|$|R
50|$|The {{two primary}} health risks from heaters are {{the risk of}} fire {{and the risk of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning. The latter risk applies to gas and kerosene heaters but not electric heaters. The risk of fire from heaters may be mitigated by low surface temperatures (as found on oil-filled convective heaters), or by switches that cut power in the event of the device inadvertently being tipped over (often found in the bases of halogen heaters), or by thermal <b>cut-out</b> <b>switches.</b> Natural Stone Heaters do not pose a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning risk, and can be a safer alternative. However, the surface temperatures of the stone heaters can be considerable, though they may not cause an instant burn as the heat transfer is slow. For that reason they are usually mounted high on walls or ceilings, away from the reach of infants.|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{reaction}} {{networks are}} ubiquitous in biology, and their dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we present the software library pSSAlib, {{which provides a}} complete and concise implementation of the most efficient partial-propensity methods for simulating exact stochastic chemical kinetics. pSSAlib can import models encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, supports time delays in chemical reactions, and stochastic spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion systems. It also provides tools for statistical analysis of simulation results and supports multiple output formats. It has previously been used for studies of biochemical reaction pathways and to benchmark other stochastic simulation methods. Here, we describe pSSAlib in detail {{and apply it to}} a new model of the endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells, leading to the discovery of a stochastic counterpart of the <b>cut-out</b> <b>switch</b> motif underlying early-to-late endosome conversion. pSSAlib is provided as a stand-alone command-line tool and as a developer API. We also provide a plug-in for the SBMLToolbox. The open-source code and pre-packaged installers are freely available from [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{address the}} task of {{parameter}} estimation in models {{of the dynamics of}} biological systems based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from measured data, where the models are typically non-linear and have many parameters, the measurements are imperfect due to noise, and the studied system can often be only partially observed. A representative task is to estimate the parameters in a model of the dynamics of endocytosis, i. e., endosome maturation, reflected in a <b>cut-out</b> <b>switch</b> transition between the Rab 5 and Rab 7 domain protein concentrations, from experimental measurements of these concentrations. The general parameter estimation task and the specific instance considered here are challenging optimization problems, calling for the use of advanced meta-heuristic optimization methods, such as evolutionary or swarm-based methods. Results We apply three global-search meta-heuristic algorithms for numerical optimization, i. e., differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA), particle-swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), as well as a local-search derivative-based algorithm 717 (A 717) to {{the task of}} estimating parameters in ODEs. We evaluate their performance on the considered representative task along a number of metrics, including the quality of reconstructing the system output and the complete dynamics, as well as the speed of convergence, both on real-experimental data and on artificial pseudo-experimental data with varying amounts of noise. We compare the four optimization methods under a range of observation scenarios, where data of different completeness and accuracy of interpretation are given as input. Conclusions Overall, the global meta-heuristic methods (DASA, PSO, and DE) clearly and significantly outperform the local derivative-based method (A 717). Among the three meta-heuristics, differential evolution (DE) performs best in terms of the objective function, i. e., reconstructing the output, and in terms of convergence. These results hold for both real and artificial data, for all observability scenarios considered, and for all amounts of noise added to the artificial data. In sum, the meta-heuristic methods considered are suitable for estimating the parameters in the ODE model of the dynamics of endocytosis under a range of conditions: With the model and conditions being representative of parameter estimation tasks in ODE models of biochemical systems, our results clearly highlight the promise of bio-inspired meta-heuristic methods for parameter estimation in dynamic system models within system biology. </p...|$|E
