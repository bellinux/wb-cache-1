40|$|Between 1995 and 2002, we {{surveyed}} fish assemblages at seven oil platforms off southern and central California using the manned research submersible Delta. At each platform, {{there is a}} large horizontal beam situated at or near the sea floor. In some instances, shells and sediment have buried this beam and in other instances it is partially or completely exposed. We found that fish species responded in various ways to the amount of exposure of the beam. A few species, such as blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), greenstriped rockfish (Sebastes elongatus), and pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) tended to avoid the beam. However, many species that typically associate with natural rocky outcrops, such as bocaccio (S. paucispinis), cowcod (<b>S.</b> levis), <b>copper</b> (<b>S.</b> caurinus), greenblotched (S. rosenblatti), pinkrose (S. simulator) and vermilion (S. miniatus) rockfishes, were found most often where the beam was exposed. In particular, a group of species (e. g., bocaccio, cowcod, blue (Sebastes mystinus), and vermilion rockfishes) called here the “sheltering habitat” guild, lived primarily where the beam was exposed and formed a crevice. This work demonstrates that the presence of sheltering sites is important in determining the species composition of man-made reefs and, likely, natural reefs. This research also indicates that adding structures that form sheltering sites in and around decommissioned platforms will likely lead to higher densities of many species typical of hard and complex structure...|$|R

In addition, the copper(I) and silver(I) triphenylphosphine complexes of the adventitiously formed phenylhydrobis(methimazolyl) borate ligand, [M(PhBm(Me)) (PPh 3) ], have been crystallographically characterized, showing both species to have a trigonal planar primary coordination sphere, with a secondary M [...] .

The specimens obtained were analysed using a fully automatic electron backscatter diffraction technique.

The substructure characteristics displayed pronounced orientation dependence. The major texture components, namely the <b>copper,</b> <b>S,</b> brass, Goss and rotated Goss, generally contained one or two prominent families of parallel larger-angle extended subboundaries, the traces of which on the longitudinal viewing plane appeared systematically aligned along the { 111 } slip plane traces, bounding long microbands subdivided into slightly elongated subgrains by short lower-angle transverse subboundaries. Relatively rare cube-orientated grains displayed pronounced subdivision into coarse deformation bands containing large, low-misorientated subgrains.

To examine the mechanism of <b>copper</b> sulfate inhibiting <b>S.</b> parasitica, we utilized RNA-seq technology to compare differential gene expression in S. parasitica treated with or without copper sulfate. The total mapped rates of the reads with the reference genome were 90. 50 % {{in the control group}} and 73. 50 % in the experimental group. In the control group, annotated splice junctions, partial novel splice junctions and complete novel splice junctions were about 83 %, 3 % and 14 %, respectively. In the treatment group, the corresponding values were about 75 %, 6 % and 19 %. Following copper sulfate treatment, a total 310 genes were markedly upregulated and 556 genes were markedly downregulated in S. parasitica. Material metabolism related GO terms including cofactor binding (33 genes), 1, 3 -beta-D-glucan synthase complex (4 genes), carboxylic acid metabolic process (40 genes) were the most significantly enriched. KEGG pathway analysis also determined that the metabolism-related biological pathways were significantly enriched, including the metabolic pathways (98 genes), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathways (42 genes), fatty acid metabolism (13 genes), phenylalanine metabolism (7 genes), starch and sucrose metabolism pathway (12 genes).

Challinor Centre is significant for its landmark qualities within the Ipswich townscape. Challinor centre occupies one of the highest ridges in Ipswich and is a landmark within Ipswich. While the showgrounds and vegetation conceals the Centre from immediate view, it is readily recognisable from more distant vantage points.

Approaching Ipswich from the south along the Warwick Road, Blair Pavilion is prominent on the horizon. These vistas are given prominence by the openness of the site due to the minimal development of most of site and the open landscape of the golf course.
