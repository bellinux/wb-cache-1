5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel <b>Cannery</b> Row into a musical.

Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to <b>Cannery</b> Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

5|$|Robert Hume, the {{youngest}} surviving {{boy in a}} family of 12 children, was born in Augusta, Maine, on October 31, 1845.

After growing up on the Deniston farm, he went to San Francisco at the age of 18 to work in a <b>cannery</b> operated by two of his brothers. In 1867, when Hume was 22, he and his brothers, who had moved north to Oregon, opened the first <b>cannery</b> on the Columbia River near Astoria. In 1869 he married Celia Bryant, with whom he had two children. The first, a girl, died while still a baby. The second, a boy, died at age 4 in 1875, and Celia Hume died shortly thereafter.

5|$|<b>Cannery</b> Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find <b>Cannery</b> Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E

50|$|The company {{generally}} prospered {{through the}} 1930s as salmon production grew but many Alaska <b>canneries</b> were idled during World War II and never reopened. After the war, salmon runs declined {{for a variety}} of reasons including past overfishing, lax management and a general downturn in salmon survival due to a change in long-term climate cycles known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Many APA <b>canneries</b> were 50 years old and in need of major modernization but CalPack accountants questioned the investment in rebuilding <b>canneries</b> when salmon runs were in decline and consumers’ tastes were turning from salmon to more cheap and abundant tuna.|$|R

5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing <b>cannery</b> in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E

In addition, 75% of homes were damaged in Puerto San Carlos, and power was lost in many areas including Comondú and Loreto. In the town of Puerto Lopez Mateos, half of the <b>cannery</b> buildings were destroyed and every wood home was destroyed, thus leaving {{a quarter of the}} population homeless. Nearby, the storm nearly destroyed two isolated villages, Punta Abreojos village and Laguna San Ignacio. Both areas got hit by Jimena at its first landfall. Although in Bahia Asuncion damages was minor, the villages of Abreojos and San Ignacio Lagoon were badly damaged. Seventy percent of the electric network form Santa Rosalía to Ciuadad Constitución was damaged due to power outages. In both of the towns, the Mexican Red Cross branches received some damage. The roads from San José del Cabo to Tijuana was affected because any nearby creeks overflowed their banks. The airports in Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto and ports were briefly closed, but were later re-opened after the storm passed since the airports received only minimal damage.|$|E

Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of <b>Cannery</b> Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in.
