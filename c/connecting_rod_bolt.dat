He {{turned back toward the}} airport. About 2 min later, there was a loud noise, which was {{followed}} by a progressive loss of all power. Subsequently, the aircraft was damaged during an emergency landing at night in a marshy area about 1 to 2 mi from the airport. An exam of the engine revealed the #5 connecting rod cap bolt had failed, which resulted in further damage of the engine. Probable cause: Failure of the #5 <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolt.</b> Factors related to the accident were: Dark night and the soft and wet (marshy) terrain conditions in the emergency landing area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{small end}} {{attaches}} to the piston pin, gudgeon pin or wrist pin, which is currently most often press fit into the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> but can swivel in the piston, a [...] "floating wrist pin" [...] design. The big end connects to the bearing journal on the crank throw, in most engines running on replaceable bearing shells accessible via the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> which hold the bearing [...] "cap" [...] onto the big end. Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing and the big end of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> so that pressurized lubricating motor oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings. Most small two-stroke engines and some single cylinder four-stroke engines avoid {{the need for a}} pumped lubrication system by using a rolling-element bearing instead, however this requires the crankshaft to be pressed apart and then back together in order to replace a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The big end of the rod is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the big end bearing shell. Therefore, the big end [...] "caps" [...] are not interchangeable between <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> and when re{{building a}}n engine, care must be taken to ensure that the caps of the different <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> are not mixed up. Both the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> and its bearing cap are usually embossed with the corresponding position number in the engine block.|$|R
40|$|<b>Connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> {{have the}} effect of {{compressing}} the bearing cap when preload is applied, placing the journal into an out of form state when exacting levels of torque are not exercised. In this paper, this effect has been highlighted by means of practical measurements and then simulated with FEA models. A further study into ultrasonic velocity through torque to yield fasteners has highlighted as torque is increased, there is a coherent decrease in sound wave velocity. Testing also highlighted a change in Young’s modulus during the elastic region, throwing animosity to the conventional linearity of Hooke’s law. Based on current literature, a relationship linking increased hardness to a reduction in ultrasonic velocity resulted in further testing that indicated as fasteners yield, the material locally strain hardens, causing a decrease in sound velocity in the heavily yielded region. It is then regarded that high frequency ultrasonic testing can identify localised micro structural changes due to strain hardening, giving a variation in Young’s modulus during the elastic region when compared to the linearity of the conventional bulk tensile test that cannot identify such details...|$|R

ORP has recently acquired capabilities to manufacture their own bolts. To determine {{the quality of}} their product as it compares to their previous supplier, ORP produced three different types of ⅜” diameter bolts: one set of bolts made of MP 35 N, and two sets of H 11 bolts, designated H 11 A and H 11 B for their respective processing. The H 11, ARP 2000, and MP 35 N bolts were tensile tested using a custom designed test fixture. The ultimate tensile strength, percent elongation, and percent reduction in area were measured. The fracture mode of each bolt was also investigated. 30 bolts from each lot were tested, except the H 11 A, the strength of which exceeded the limitation of the test fixture. The chief purpose of this investigation was to determine if there were significant differences between the H 11 and ARP 2000 bolts, and between the MP 35 N bolts from the different companies. The data acquired proved that both heat treatments of H 11 are both significantly stronger than ARP 2000, and that there is no discernable difference in strength between the MP 35 N bolts produced by the two different companies...|$|R
40|$|Oliver Racing Parts (ORP) {{is looking}} to {{optimize}} the manufacturing process for high-strength <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolts.</b> A high yield strength is desired for the bolts because deformation {{would result in a}} loss of engine performance. A high tensile strength is also necessary to prevent catastrophic failure if deformation occurs. A high ductility as a proxy for toughness is attractive for resisting crack nucleation and growth during cyclic loading. Bolts were made of MP 35 N, a nickel-cobalt multiphase alloy; MLX- 17, a precipitation hardenable stainless steel; 8740, a low alloy steel; and H 11, a chromium hot-work tool steel. The temperature of the most important heat treatment step was varied for each material. Tensile testing was performed to determine the tensile and yield strength of the bolts. Ductility was measured through a percent reduction in area. Fracture surfaces were imaged via scanning electron microscopy to observe the mode of failure. In order of highest to lowest tensile strength: H 11 (270 ksi), 8740 (220 - 250 ksi), MLX 17 (220 – 230 ksi), and MP 35 N (130 ksi). In order of highest to lowest yield strength: H 11 (265 ksi), 8740 (205 - 230 ksi), MLX- 17 (215 – 220 ksi), and MP 35 N (85 – 120 ksi). In order of lowest to highest %RA: 8740 (21 % - 52 %), H 11 (48 %), MLX- 17 (55 % - 64 %), and MP 35 N (80 %). The low strength and high ductility of the MP 35 N bolts can be attributed to insufficient cold work, necessary for strengthening, prior to aging. It is suggested that room temperature aging or aging during the bolt forming process resulted in MLX- 17 bolts that were weaker than predicted. 8740 bolts achieved maximum strengths but at a possible cost to ductility. H 11 bolts were the strongest bolts tested...|$|R

Jin et al. proposed {{a method of}} using computer vision technology to detect small ceramic tube defects [9], using computer and computer vision, electromechanical and other technologies to develop an automatic detection system, and to achieve a small ceramic tube for automatic detection and classification. Böhm and Jech [10] scanned the surface with a small scattered light sensor using a red LED as a light source. The intensity distribution of scattered light detected depends on the topography of the reflective surface. The system can detect scratches on the high gloss metal sheet with a typical width of 1  μm and a depth of 40  nm. Kawasue and Komatsu [11] proposed a mobile robot equipped with two lasers and a CCD camera for pipeline inspection. The mobile robot can reconstruct the 3 D shape of the sewage pipeline. Since the tilt of the mobile robot {{with respect to the}} axis of the pipe is expressed as a deformation between the two circular stripes, the shape of the sewage pipe can be accurately measured regardless of the inclination of the robot. Li et al. [12] applied machine vision technology to automate the inspection and condition monitoring of railway tracks. An imaging setup framework for capturing multiple video streams was proposed for the detection of important rail assemblies such as backing plates, nails, anchor <b>rods,</b> and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bolts,</b> and for defect identification such as raised spikes, defect severity analysis and time condition analysis, and long-term forecast evaluation. The average detection rate of component detection has been initially achieved 98.2 %, the false-positive rate was 1.57 %, and the false-negative rate was 1.78 %. He and Wang [13] developed an improved small defect detection algorithm for real-time leather surface detection using an enhancement method based on discrete cosine transform (DCT). The experimental results show that the proposed small defect detection method can achieve 94 % detection rate of small defects.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{is sealed}} {{at the bottom}} with a sump that collects the falling oil during normal operation to be cycled again. The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a crankshaft that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion. The crankshaft is held in place relative to the engine block by main bearings, which allow it to rotate. Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing; the other half is a detachable cap. In some cases a single main bearing deck is used rather than several smaller caps. A <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is <b>connected</b> to offset sections of the crankshaft (the crankpins) in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft. The end of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> attached to the gudgeon pin is called its small end, and the other end, where it {{is connected to the}} crankshaft, the big end. The big end has a detachable half to allow assembly around the crankshaft. It is kept together to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> by removable <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> {{is under}} {{tremendous}} stress from the reciprocating load {{represented by the}} piston, actually stretching and being compressed with every rotation, and the load increases as {{the square of the}} engine speed increase. Failure of a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod,</b> usually called throwing a rod, {{is one of the most}} common causes of catastrophic engine failure in cars, frequently putting the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby rendering the engine irreparable; it can result from fatigue near a physical defect in the rod, lubrication failure in a bearing due to faulty maintenance, or from failure of the <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> from a defect, improper tightening or over-revving of the engine. In an unmaintained, dirty environment, a water or chemical emulsifies with the oil that lubricates the bearing and causes the bearing to fail. Re-use of <b>rod</b> <b>bolts</b> is a common practice as long as the bolts meet manufacturer specifications. Despite their frequent occurrence on televised competitive automobile events, such failures are quite rare on production cars during normal daily driving. This is because production auto parts have a much larger factor of safety, and often more systematic quality control.|$|R
50|$|The <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> are of forged {{aluminum}} and do provide some shock damping, {{which is why}} aluminum is used in place of titanium, because titanium <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> transmit {{too much of the}} combustion impulse to the big-end rod bearings, endangering the bearings and thus the crankshaft and block.

In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively.

FEA of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is done using C 50 as its base material to determine its von-Mises stress, Max shear Stress, Total Deformation and Alternating stress to cycles graph. Also the Stiffness of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is calculated...|$|R

So the reciprocating motion created by a steadily rotating crank and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is approximately simple harmonic motion:where x is the distance {{of the end of the}} <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> from the crank axle, l is the length of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod,</b> r is the length of the crank, and α is the angle of the crank measured from top dead center (TDC). Technically, the reciprocating motion of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> departs from sinusoidal motion due to the changing angle of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> during the cycle, and is expressed (see Piston motion equations) as: ...|$|R
