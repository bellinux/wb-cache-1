Studies indicate that the microwave brightness temperatures depend not only on the amount of ice water content but also on the vertical distribution of ice water content. Studies also show that the low brightness temperature at 92 GHz for large ice water content is due to cloud reflection which reflects most of the irradiance incident at the cloud base downward. Therefore the 92 GHz channel detects a low brightness temperature at the cloud top...|$|R

40|$|In {{a mobile}} {{computing}} environment, efficient allocation of wireless communication channels has a consequential {{impact on the}} performance of the system. This paper presents a distributed channel allocation algorithm based on the concept of dynamic channel boundaries. Under this scheme, each mobile service station (MSS) is assigned a contiguous <b>range</b> of <b>channels</b> which is not overlapping with the <b>channel</b> <b>ranges</b> of its neighbors. Boundaries between <b>channel</b> <b>ranges</b> of adjacent MSSs are dynamically adjustable but only through voluntary withdrawals. High efficiency is accomplished by the incorporation of two important features, namely early boundary expansion and need-based boundary redrawing. This algorithm imposes a low message volume on the fixed network. It has short response times to connection requests and achieves high channel utilization under both even and uneven load distributions. Channel utilization can be further improved by allowing a MSS to borrow channels from its neighbors. Re [...] ...|$|R
