500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{noting the}} value of the {{partnership}} framework itself, Sergey Krasnov wrote, [...] "When compared with partners acting separately, partners developing complementary abilities and resources <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration. The ISS is helping further advance near-Earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system, including the Moon and Mars." [...] A manned mission to Mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China, India and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership. NASA chief Charlie Bolden stated in February 2011, [...] "Any mission to Mars {{is likely to be a}} global effort". Currently, American legislation prevents NASA co-operation with China on space projects.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. It {{was about}} that. I thought you <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some {{information}} about the late Mr. de Mountford's past life, or his former friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|We avenged them at {{the battle}} of the Blood River indeed; but <b>could</b> vengeance <b>give</b> <b>us</b> back their lives which it had pleased the Lord to take thus fearfully? ...|$|R
3000|$|Q: To start off, you {{are seen}} as a pioneer of Cultural Linguistics. <b>Could</b> you <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a bit of history behind this field? Why did you become {{interested}} in this branch of Linguistics? [...]...|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be a desire for {{something}} frolicksome to follow upon this conversation, and in a weak moment I suggested that George should get out his banjo, and see if he <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a comic song.|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, madam," [...] {{rejoined the}} doctor. [...] "We have covenanted {{to pay the}} reward {{to the person who}} <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the {{information}} we required." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, did not he call out, {{when the}} women were coming down, howling like sirens as they were--'Have none of you a plump child that you <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> to break our fast upon?'" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{secretary}} now returned, {{and said}} the governor <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a few minutes. I think the probability {{was that he was}} curious to know what two boys and a girl could want with him.|$|E
30|$|All {{samples were}} {{evaluated}} with the BI and the PFT, both scales were {{explained to the}} patients and the scales were repeated if the participants did not understand; if a patient <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> information about themselves, we asked a carer or a relative. We obtained demographic data of the sample too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] said Corny; [...] "we just {{intend to}} have a little coronation, and to ask the people to {{remember}} that she's a queen and not a pepper-pod woman; and if you <b>could</b> just <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a paper commission, and sign it, we should--at least I should--feel a good deal easier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you believe}} it, governor," [...] says Mr. Bucket, {{struck by the}} coincidence, [...] "that when I was a boy I played the fife myself? Not in a {{scientific}} way, as I expect he does, but by ear. Lord bless you! 'British Grenadiers'--there's a tune to warm an Englishman up! <b>COULD</b> you <b>give</b> <b>us</b> 'British Grenadiers,' my fine fellow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe Songbird <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{a better}} description," [...] {{he said to}} his chum; [...] "but as Songbird isn't here, and as we can't get him on the telephone, we'll have to do the best we can." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} it was night, but the young moon and the stars in a {{cloudless}} sky, lighted up the water-way clearly, and we had no fear that Macomber <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the slip, unless he returned by land.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, hold yer noise, Paddy," [...] exclaimed Dick Barnes, [...] "an' let's have a ghost {{story from}} Tim Rokens. He b'lieves in ghosts, anyhow, an' <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a yarn about 'em, I knows, if he likes. Come along now, Tim, {{like a good}} fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't cry {{any more}} about it," [...] said Frank consolingly. [...] "Crying won't do any good, you know. Can you tell us {{where to find the}} wood-lane that cuts across to Blackburn Hill?" [...] Maggie <b>could,</b> and <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> minute directions. So, having thanked her, we left her to pursue her disconsolate way and betook {{ourselves}} homeward.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the lady}} {{said that in}} her opinion {{it would be best}} to get as many replies as they {{possibly}} <b>could</b> before selecting--'to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a wider choice. What do you think, Mr. Nyttleton?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Producer Andrew O'Connell said [...] "We {{first went}} to the London Production Fund who <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> the full grant of £15,000. Then we {{approached}} Scottish Screen but as we were not a Scots production company they <b>could</b> only <b>give</b> <b>us</b> £5,000. We got Scottish co-producers, re-applied and got £25,000. We also {{got a lot of}} deals on post production and post production finance from The First Film Foundation - who are backed by UGC and Universal".|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{a splendid}} humorist, Mr. Crewe. Five dollars wouldn't {{pay for the}} plate and the paper. A gentleman like you <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> twenty-five, and never know it was gone. You won't be wanting to stop in the Legislature, Mr. Crewe, and we {{remember}} our friends in Newcastle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} too fast for us to catch him," [...] Edmund said carelessly; [...] "and as, even if we did so, he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> no {{information}} of any use, for you may be sure he has not ventured near the town, we may well let him go on in his way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were but}} ten of them, brother Flint--but ten; {{and of those}} ten he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a full and highly {{interesting}} account. One of these days, we shall hear it all; in the mean time, it may be well enough to turn one of these houses {{into some sort of}} a garrison." ...|$|E
40|$|Stanford University and Yale University {{seminars}} for helpful comments. Our great regret is that Sherwin Rosen, our departed {{friend and}} colleague, who thought {{long and hard}} about the issues discussed in this chapter <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the benefit of his wisdom. The views expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research...|$|R
5000|$|Fourstardave {{would miss}} {{the rest of}} the year and was never the same, {{finishing}} no better than fourth in his six starts at age 10. On August 27, 1995, he was retired. O'Brien said, [...] "He's <b>given</b> <b>us</b> everything, more than a million horses <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>us.</b> I would have loved to see him go out with a win with everybody cheering for him. But I know how bad I would have felt had he run worse than last time." ...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{there was}} another issue raised by the Texas-cotton nexus: that {{of the market for}} raw cotton. One of the largest export markets for North American raw cotton in the mid-nineteenth century was to Great Britain. As long as Texas {{remained}} an independent state, it <b>could</b> <b>give</b> Southern <b>U.S.</b> cotton plantation owners competition in terms of setting prices - to force them to be more competitive.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{was once}} a sailor, they tell me, old Tom?" [...] said Hurry, in his abrupt manner, struck by one or two {{expressions}} that the other had just used, [...] "and some people believe you <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> strange accounts of inimies and shipwrecks, if you'd a mind {{to come out with}} all you know?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sherlock Holmes and I walked {{together}} to the High Street, where {{we stopped at}} the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be absent until afternoon, {{and that he was}} himself a newcomer, who <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> no information. Holmes's face showed his disappointment and annoyance.|$|E
60|$|The Duomo, {{close at}} hand, {{is one of}} the finest cathedrals in Europe. It is eight hundred years old. Its {{grandeur}} has outlived the high commercial prosperity and the political importance that made it a necessity, or rather a possibility. Surrounded by poverty, decay and ruin, it conveys to us a more tangible impression of the former greatness of Pisa than books <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
60|$|Adam. Grant heaven <b>could</b> {{once have}} <b>given</b> <b>us</b> liberty; Are we not bounded now, by firm decree, Since whatsoe'er is pre-ordained must be? Else heaven for man events might pre-ordain, And man's free will might make those orders vain.|$|R
6000|$|Only Shakspeare and Scott <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> {{medicines}} {{to make us}} {{like this}} cowardly, conceited [...] "jimp honest" [...] fellow, Andrew Fairservice, who just escapes being a hypocrite by dint of some sincere old Covenanting leaven in his veins. We make bold {{to say that the}} creator of Parolles and Lucie, and many another lax and lovable knave, would, had he been a Scot, have drawn Andrew Fairservice thus, and not otherwise.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{the sun was shining}} from a blue, blue sky, but the shadows were deadly cold, and the wind like a flat blade of ice. We went out running to the sun. The hotel <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> coffee and milk: only a little black coffee. So we descended to the sea-front again, to the Via Roma, and to our café. It was Friday: people seemed to be bustling in from the country with huge baskets.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{took the}} chance that you <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the desired information, {{because it was not}} {{reasonable}} old Beman's son should be in this section unless on business of his father's, and in these times one can well guess what that business might be. Therefore, having heard you floundering through the thicket, we drew near to listen to such conversation as you might indulge in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{extremely}} kind," [...] replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; [...] "you who {{are such a}} judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is nobody's praise that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am," [...] addressing her, [...] "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{natural thing}} would be to rush the schooner," [...] he replied. [...] "But I don't know. I telephoned the captain to go at it head down and heels in air; he {{answered}} like a little man; and I guess he's getting around. I believe, Loudon, we'll give Trent a chance. Trent was in it; he was in {{it up to the}} neck; even if he couldn't buy, he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the straight tip." ...|$|E
60|$|From the {{passports}} {{he learned}} that there was official dignity among us, and addressed the unworthy bearer of public honors as Eccellenza, and, at parting bequeathed his advantage to the conductor, commending us all in set terms to his courtesy. He hovered caressingly about us {{as long as we}} remained, straining politeness to do us some last little service; and when the diligence rolled away, he did all that one man <b>could</b> to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a round of applause.|$|R
60|$|Now, as we {{continued}} on our way, I pondered much over this new discovery and the singular appearance of these birds, of which Jack <b>could</b> only <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a very slight and vague account; and I began to long to commence our boat, {{in order that}} we might go and inspect them more narrowly. But by degrees these thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again with the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing through.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, Bob," [...] said Tom Brown, who, {{although}} he had prepared to fire in case of need, intended to have allowed his friend {{to take the first}} shot; [...] "'twould be a pity to lose our chance of a sea-cow, which is good for food, {{for the sake of a}} monster which at the best <b>could</b> only <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a fine specimen-head for a museum, for his entire body is too big to haul about through the country after us." ...|$|R
