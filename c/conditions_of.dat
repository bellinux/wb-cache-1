40|$|In 1744, the {{critical}} buckling load {{with the assumption}} of uniform cross-section without weight of column were computed by Euler. Whenever an economical solution is required, the weight of column must be considered for solution of buckling analyses. In literature, {{the critical}} buckling load and asymptotic behaviour of heavy column in <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> atmosphere have inverstigated for ten different support types. When this literature is examined, it is stated that the differential equations of for four different suppport types in <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> water is similar to <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> atmosphere. However, the differential equations of other four different suppport types in <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> water is different from to <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> atmosphere. And it is stated that the critical buckling load these different suppport types in <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> water is not calculated from <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> atmosphere. The goals of this paper are to develop self weight buckling of column at its top fixed and lower end fixed-roller supported in <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> water.

40|$|In this paper, <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> Substance Search (COS) {{algorithm}} is introduced to solve optimal reactive power dispatch problem. The <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> Substance Search (COS) {{algorithm is}} based on the simulation of the shape of substance incidence. In <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> Substance Search (COS) algorithm, individuals follow molecules which interrelate to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the corporal principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is developed by considering each <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> substance in harmony with different exploration–exploitation ratio. The evolutionary progression is alienated into three phases which emulate the three <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> substance: solid, liquid & gas. This technique can considerably improve the equilibrium between exploration–exploitation, however preserving the high-quality search ability of an evolutionary approach. The proposed <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> Substance Search (COS) algorithm has been tested on standard IEEE 30 bus test system and simulation results show clearly the improved performance <b>of</b> the projected <b>Condition</b> <b>of</b> Substance Search (COS) algorithm in reducing the real power loss and voltage stability also enhanced...|$|R
