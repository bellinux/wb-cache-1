To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so.

In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect deception, in {{everyday}} social interactions and psychological evaluations, <b>can</b> literally <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between life and death. Beyond physiological and nonverbal techniques for detecting deception, {{research has focused on}} criteria designed to evaluate the content of verbal statements to distinguish between true or actually experienced events versus internally manufactured or fabricated events. Criteria from two techniques that have received empirical support, criteria-based content analysis and reality monitoring, were used to create an 11 -item Deception Detection Checklist (DDCL). In this study, 130 college undergraduates used the DDCL to rate the exculpatory statements of two accused child molesters: one truthful, the other untruthful. The 11 items composing the DDCL, as well as a measure of perceived truthfulness, were all scored on 7 -point Likert-type scales. Nine of the 11 items on the DDCL significantly differentiated between the true and untrue statements in the predicted direction. Overall scores on the DDCL indicated that the false statement was rated as significantly more deceptive than the true statement. The DDCL possessed good reliability, and a series of factor analyses provided strong support for the construct validity of the measure. The 7 psychometrically strongest items from the DDCL included variables assessing the extent to which statements included clarity of detail, spatial details, temporal details, and contextual details, as well as the relevance, reconstructability, and realism of the statement. These results indicate that subjects were able to use this measure to reliably differentiate between true and false statements made by accused child molesters...|$|R

5000|$|Human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer {{awareness and}} prevention {{is a vital}} concept from a public and community health perspective. HPV is the sexually transmitted virus that {{is known to be}} the cause of genital warts. There are currently more than 100 different strains of HPV, half of which can cause genital infections. It is worth noting here that although it is not usually the HPV strains that cause genital warts that are associated with the oropharyngeal cancers, they are transmitted the same way through oral-genital sexual contact, and consumers should protect themselves accordingly and adhere to a routine health and dental screening schedule to monitor and maintain their health status. Learning and utilizing self-examinations of your body, checking for changes or abnormalities in your mouth while performing your oral hygiene as well as routine checks of your genitals after showering to note changes or abnormalities can enhance your awareness of changes in your health status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of all sexually active people will acquire at least one HPV infection in their lifetime. It is important that consumers seek routine dental examinations as a part of their health care to allow for dentists and primary care providers to screen them for this type of cancer, as early detection <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> all <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in treatments. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers can occur anywhere in the mouth, but occur most often in the tongue, tonsils, oropharynx (back of the throat), gums and the floor of the mouth. According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, [...] "Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located {{at the base of the}} tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat" [...] and requires a thorough exam by a dental provider or specialist preferably. Men are twice as likely than women to have oral cancer, regardless of race, as African-Americans and Caucasians are equally likely to develop oral cancer.|$|R

40|$|Governance in {{the health}} system has perhaps been the least {{explored}} building block of the health system, receiving less attention due to its vague definition and complex nature. When discussed at the country level it often focuses on single elements such as corruption or accountability and doesn’t consider wider interactions of relevance to how policies are formed. How well governed a health system is <b>can</b> often <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between <b>the</b> efficient use of resources and inefficient waste, which {{is even more important}} in a resource constrained environment. The United Republic of Tanzania has been a major recipient of donor aid over the past few decades. Tanzania’s health sector in particular {{has been the subject of}} much donor interest, especially regarding medicines. One of the first donors to support medicines was Danida who funded the essential medicines kit, and since then numerous donors have been involved in either funding medicines, designing policies around medicines selection, procurement and distribution, or direct medicines donations. Although Tanzania has largely benefited from this increase in donor support, not all of it has been designed and implemented adequately to suit the situation and needs of Tanzania. In other words, health systems governance may sometimes have been weakened by donor-interest, resulting in reduced quality of health care. The aim of this research was to contribute to a better understanding of health system governance and apply this knowledge to the Tanzanian health system. The insights gained should aid policy makers and other stakeholders to design interventions that are appropriate for the local context to ensure a stronger health system which is able to attain its goals of improving the level and distribution of health, while responding to the population’s needs and protecting them from large, often catastrophic financial expenditures. The research was carried out as part of the Governance of Health Systems project, a collaborative endeavour between the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and the Basel Institute of Governance. Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to data collected in two areas of the local Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), Ulanga District and Rufiji District. We used both primary data collection and secondary data, covering the period from 1999 – 2011. The overall findings are that despite the interest over the past decade to develop frameworks to assess governance {{in the health}} system, few have been empirically applied. The first part of this thesis focuses on developing a framework to assess governance in the health system; the second part applies this framework to a selected governance issue in Tanzania, namely the delivery of essential medicines to public health centres in Tanzania. At the national level, this investigation found that the medicines ordering system was based on a complex paper-based system which had not been designed with local capacity in mind, nor did it improve the accountability of medicines. Lack of accountability was also found at the health facility level, where over half of respondents interviewed who sought care in the public sector for fever, subsequently experienced the consequences of one form or another of non-compliant health-worker behaviour (overcharging for treatment and medicines, stocking out of the first line antimalarial, dispensing an inappropriate monotherapy).

40|$|For many noncitizens today, {{the law of}} asylum {{exists as}} the sole route to lawful {{residence}} in the United States. The safety and relief that the mere borderlines of our nation secure {{for some of the}} most desperate and oppressed are accessed only through this one body of law. Though it may not say so on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, passage through Emma Lazarus’s “golden door” 1 (or, in other cases, permission to stay {{on this side of the}} door) for “the homeless, tempesttost” 2 requires, for many, navigation through the modern obstacles of asylum law. Needless to say, there is not merely one door to this country. Nor is there a single key that opens them all. Whether a claim of asylum is successful and, therefore, whether a noncitizen is able to enjoy the refuge that this country provides, depends very much on what part of the country the noncitizen inhabits. Those seeking asylum in the vast expanse of the American Midwest may notice that the door has recently gotten smaller. In Gaitan v. Holder, 3 the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals fundamentally changed the requirements of attaining asylee status by formally requiring that a particular social group (PSG), one of the protected asylum classes in the Immigration and Nationality Act 4 (INA), possess the limiting characteristics of “social visibility” and “particularity. ” 5 At first glance, Gaitan does not appear to be the culprit in altering the asylum scheme in the Eighth Circuit, as the court merely purported to “follow” two of its own recent cases, 6 Constanza v. Holder 7 and Ortiz- Puentes v. Holder, 8 which adopted the particularity and social visibility requirements established by the Board of Immigration Appeals 9 (BIA). However, neither Constanza nor Ortiz-Puentes addressed the issue of whether the BIA acted “arbitrarily and capriciously in adding the requirements of ‘social visibility’ and ‘particularity’ to its definition of ‘particular social group. ’” 10 By answering no, the Gaitan majority unequivocally changed particularity and social visibility from being “some of the many factors in the holistic analysis of the issue to absolute prerequisites to establishing membership in a particular social group” 11 and thus took sides in the split among the federal circuits. The Eighth Circuit’s decision in Gaitan was a momentous development in federal immigration jurisprudence and will have dire effects on asylum seekers in the American Midwest. The decision illuminates a unique aspect of immigration law: one who seeks asylum on the basis of a PSG in Illinois (the Seventh Circuit) may be admitted, 13 while the same noncitizen may be excluded in Nebraska (the Eighth Circuit) for not meeting the particularity and social visibility criteria now solidified by Gaitan. This characteristic is especially important as to asylum, where decisions <b>can</b> potentially <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between life and death of the petitioner. 14 In Part II, this Note traces the relatively recent history of asylum law, with a specific focus on the particularity and social visibility requirements, to understand the basis on which the Eighth Circuit took sides in this federal circuit split. Part III of this Note criticizes the prudence of Gaitan’s holding in casually accepting the BIA’s new PSG formulation and proposes the Eighth Circuit rely on the original PSG standard set out in In re Acosta in future cases. Gaitan unjustifiably moved the Eighth Circuit to a stricter, more exclusive vision of asylum law and gave legal credence to an arbitrary and capricious PSG formulation created by the BIA. This Note proposes the Eighth Circuit overturn Gaitan insofar as it adopted the BIA’s new PSG formulation 16 and revert back to the Acosta standard that most fairly governs federal asylum law...|$|R
