40|$|Anthracoporella algal mounds, up to 22 m thick, {{occur within}} the cyclic {{sequences}} of the Lower Pseudoschwagerina Limestone (uppermost Carboniferous), Carnic Alps (Austria). Their depositional environment lay between the wave {{base and the}} base of the photic zone. The algal mounds are overlain by dark, well-bedded, cherty wackestones and packstones. The <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> contain cephalopods, thick-shelled brachiopods, and sponge spicules and lack Anthracoporella in growth position. They are typical deeper-water sediments, deposited below the photic zone. This sequence records drowning episodes; the shallow-water algal mounds were drowned by relative rise of sea level as sea-bottom production shut down below the photic zone. The sedimentological and paleontological evidence of drowning are supported by geochemical data of two measured sections. The mean sulfur content of the well-oxygenated algal limestones is 0. 02 % for both sections; the TOC values are 0. 17 % for the section AI and 0. 10 % for the section AR. The S contents of the <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> are approximately twice as high with values of 0. 48 and 0. 05 % for the respective sections. TOC values of the <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> are also significantly higher, with 0. 30 and 0. 51 % contents for the respective sections. The <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> document the termination of the mounds and the demise of reef-building algae in each cycle. This interval is therefore termed ‘shroud facies'. The rapid sea-level rise reported is a further proof for high-magnitude sea-level fluctuations in intervals of glacio-eustasy. The documented drowning mode is novel through the definable interval of drowning, the repeated events during a short time interval, the full record of pre-, syn-, and post-drowning deposits, and the unequivocal attribution to glacio-eustatic sea-level rise. This mode seems to be characteristic of an icehouse period and clearly differs from the drowning mode in greenhouse periods which is often gradual, lacks an unequivocal cause, and is often preceded by subaerial exposure...|$|R

40|$|Hemipelagic nodular limestones are a {{widespread}} facies in the Triassic of the Tethys, often considered as being deposited at rather constant sedimentation rates. The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate the sedimentation rate variability in a case-study from the Middle Triassic of the Dolomites, northern Italy, and to suggest possible causes. The nodular <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Livinallongo Fm. and correlated units were studied in four stratigraphic sections and compared to classical successions from the literature. Correlations between sections are based on ammonoid biostratigraphy and tephra stratigraphy. Correlation highlighted conspicuous changes in sedimentation rates through time and between sections, associated with sedimentological evidence of deep-water aragonite dissolution. Deep-water dissolution is believed to have resulted in small hiatuses and in a bias of ammonoid assemblages towards taxa with more resistant shells. Carbonate petrography and geochemistry provide evidence of differential diagenesis of the Livinallongo Fm. Carbonate nodules were lithified at the water–sediment interface, and their C isotope composition is regarded as a proxy of the d 13 C of Middle Triassic bottom seawater. The onset of nodular <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones,</b> occurring contemporaneously at the basin scale, and the coeval carbonate platform drowning events are tentatively explained by the inflow and local upwelling of cool deep water from Panthalassa into the western Tethys...|$|R

The chert layers are usually separated by very thin claystone layers creating a cyclic appearance. This cyclicity might correlate with Milankovic cycles. A plausible diagenetic cause can be excluded due to slump structures that incorporate several individual cycles. The cherts are mainly earthy red, but show greenish-blackish hues in places. The red coloration due to hematite {{is caused by}} the complete oxidation of iron compounds in oxygen-rich bottom waters. The red layers show Fe3+/Fe2+ > 1, whereas in the greenish layers the ratio is < 1, the coloration in the latter being tied to sericite, chlorite and maybe pyrite.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Seafloor {{processes}} are often destructive of biogenic remains, {{while at the}} same time promoting growth of authigenic minerals such as hematite, fluorapatite, glauconite, and chalcedony. Middle to Late Permian sedimentary rocks in the Sverdrup Basin are cool-water marine sandstones, shales, limestones, and cherts, rich in carbonate and siliceous biotic components. The authigenic minerals hematite, fluorapatite, glauconite, and chalcedony are abundant, from the interactions of nutrient elements (silica, phosphorus, and iron), with carbonate and siliceous biotas in ramp environments of variable energy and sediment accumulation rate. These authigenic phases represent, in part, faunas that are no longer preserved, and should not be viewed simply as diagenetic products. Early middle Permian siliciclastic rocks (the Assistance Formation) contain carbonate heterozoan biotas with widespread siderite and hematite, and local void-filling phosphate, deposited under moderate sediment accumulation rates. Sponge spicules were dissolved unless encased in hematite or siderite, and incorporated in silica cement. In contrast, more slowly deposited younger middle Permian inboard <b>cherty</b> <b>limestones</b> (the lower Trold Fiord Formation) underwent frequent physical and biological reworking, resulting in dissolution of biogenic silica and precipitation of glauconite, and carbonate fluorapatite. Sediment reworking also excavated and produced rounded glauconite and phosphate clasts; much of the glauconite was then oxidized to hematite on the seafloor. Again, unless encased in phosphate, sponge spicules were dissolved and the silica precipitated as glauconite or chalcedony.

The section was studied sedimentologically in detail and dated with radiolarians.
