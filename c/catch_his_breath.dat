25|$|In late 2006, Elefante {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to consider something he had never done in his career: <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Even with his reduced schedule, he needed a break. The brothers closed the label, and Elefante could finally take some {{time away from the}} industry. This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and review what was happening on his left.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2014, Phil Everly died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, 16 {{days before}} his 75th birthday, of lung disease. Phil's widow Patti openly blamed her husband's death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and recounted Phil spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day. She stated that although Phil had stopped smoking in 2001, his lungs had already sustained permanent damage. Phil's last public appearance was in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of Fame, and he was then struggling to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he addressed the crowd. Patti established the Phil Everly Memorial COPD Foundation in 2014.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{himself up}} with a sharp <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and stared at her}} as if he saw a ghost.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with eyes that were aswim with tears. He took a step towards her, a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>his</b> hand held out.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{majority}} of my customers," [...] Mr. Bultiwell declared, with a little <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "are as safe as the Bank of England." ...|$|R
500|$|Duckles {{examined}} the song [...] "If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue" [...] by Thomas Campion which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 {{and was also}} published in Campion's Third Book of Ayres from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer. [...] In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that {{the speed of the}} verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original. [...] Many songs are recitative-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The hemiola a consistent practice in English music of this time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, H. C. Sanders, {{owner of}} a nearby gas station, {{reported}} 20 years earlier {{he ran out of}} gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The rabbit hopped up {{on the other side of}} the log looked at him and said, [...] "Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As Kilroy {{stood on}} the street, he was lured by a man parked inside a red truck who {{apparently}} called him {{and asked him if}} he needed a ride. As he got close to the vehicle, Kilroy was grabbed by two men, Serafín Hernández García and Malio Fabio Ponce Torres, and wrestled inside the truck. Because of his size and athletic strength, Kilroy was able to break loose about two blocks down the road after one of the gangsters stopped for a few moments to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Kilroy ran from the truck but was eventually intercepted by another vehicle driven by the gangsters' allies and taken at gunpoint. He was then subdued and handcuffed {{in the back of the}} second car.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{need them}} if only Wildfire and the King--" [...] Slone broke off and grimly, with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{turned to the}} horses.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Britling {{said nothing}} for a little while. Then he spoke with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "I don't blame you," [...] he said. [...] "It was--the right spirit." ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy was {{clasping}} {{his legs}} and hiding his face on the knees. His shirt clung to him. Every rib was visible. His emaciated back was shaken in repeated jerks by the panting <b>catches</b> of <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then after a {{pause in}} which to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> he let himself down to the ground.|$|E
60|$|The priest heard Lorison <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> painfully, and a {{faint smile}} flickered across his own {{clean-cut}} mouth.|$|E
60|$|Neale paused, as {{much from}} the squeeze Allie {{suddenly}} gave him as for an instant's rest to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said, with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "you can't mean it, Carrie. In {{spite of}} what you told me, I {{had been trying to}} believe the thing was out of the question." ...|$|R
60|$|Evans looked up, {{and their}} eyes met; then, with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> he turned away, and after some {{hesitation}} went to his locker, and bringing out a new suit, bought for the edification of Miss Jones, handed it silently to the mate.|$|R
60|$|Then with {{a sudden}} audible <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> he stopped short. Captain Blood's right hand had reemerged from the breast of his doublet, {{bringing}} with it a long pistol with silver mountings richly chased, which he levelled within a foot of the Deputy-Governor's head.|$|R
6000|$|... "My gracious, this {{is getting}} at close range!" [...] burst out Dick, when he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> again. [...] "Uncle Randolph, they meant to kill us!" ...|$|E
60|$|The flattered {{and happy}} woman put {{her lips to}} his ear and whispered a princely name. It made him <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> it lit his face with exultation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you and Ralph safe?" [...] was the question, {{as soon as}} the {{man could}} <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> for he had been running with all the {{swiftness}} at his command.|$|E
60|$|He had to {{stop talking}} to <b>catch</b> at <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> arm twisted into Raut's with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards the railway {{as though he was}} possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks' pull with all his strength.|$|R
6000|$|He {{knocked out}} his pipe at last, {{and walked slowly}} and ponderously upstairs. He grinned again as he passed {{the door of the}} housekeeper’s room, and then, with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{clutched}} heavily at the banister as a soft female voice bade him [...] "Good-night." ...|$|R
60|$|The fierce flame fluttered like a silk flag, {{throwing}} {{an angry}} swaying glare mingled with moving shadows over the poop, {{lighting up the}} concave surfaces of the sails, gleaming on the wet paint of the white rails. And young Powell turned his eyes to windward with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Pretty quiet around here, {{this time}} of night,” remarked Roger, as he paused to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> for they had been walking fast. “There doesn’t {{seem to be a}} soul in sight.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{cool water}} nearly scalded {{him before he}} could swim out, but {{fortunately}} he was near the bank and he quickly scrambled upon the land {{and sat down to}} <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! {{but that}} was a narrow escape and no mistake," [...] was the comment of the big youth, after he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "I thought sure he had me by the foot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|That same evening - no day is {{so long as}} the day of {{a murder}} - I met Ortheris with the dogs, and he plunged defiantly {{into the middle of the}} matter. [...] "I'll be one o' the witnesses," [...] said he. [...] "I was in the {{verandah}} when Mackie came along. 'E come from Mrs. Raines's quarters. Quigley, Parsons, an' Trot, they was in the inside verandah, so they couldn't 'ave 'eard nothing.

60|$|Her motions {{became more}} animated, more human. With feet which seemed never {{to meet the}} earth, she glided toward the corner where John was standing. He caught the {{smoldering}} fire in {{her eyes as she}} danced within a few feet of him. He felt a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Some subtle and only half-expressed emotion shook his whole being, seemed to tear at the locked chamber of his soul.|$|R
60|$|With a sharp <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{he stood}} motionless. Inside the room the candle, {{fluttering}} in the draught, showed dimly the grotesque {{attitudes of the}} sleepers. Beyond the door there seemed to his over- wrought imagination a strange and stealthy unrest. He tried to whistle, but his lips were parched, and in a mechanical fashion he stooped, and began {{to pick up the}} cards which littered the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] groaned Andy, as {{he stopped}} to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "We are stuck as hard {{as if we were}} planted here, and it looks as if we would have to remain here for some time." ...|$|E
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> He never {{finished}} his sentence. There was a moment's breathless and disappointed silence. If {{only he had}} known it, sympathy was almost entirely with him. Anna was no favourite at No. 13 Montague Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the most}} trying {{experience}} I've had yet," [...] he murmured to himself, as he at last {{dropped into a}} slow walk to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Those people are not thieves, but they are next door to it." ...|$|E
60|$|He reddened {{under her}} clear gaze, dropped his head, and fumbled {{with his new}} sombrero, {{and there was a}} <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Madeline saw <b>his</b> {{powerful}} brown hand tremble. It affected her strangely that this stalwart cowboy, who could rope and throw and tie a wild steer in less than one minute, should tremble at a mere question. Suddenly he raised his head, and at the beautiful blase of his eyes Madeline turned her own away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am in the}} twenty-third year of my life here,' he said, with a <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{that was}} not so much a sob as an irrepressible sound of self-approval, the {{momentary}} outburst of a noble consciousness. 'It is all I could do for my children--I have done it. Amy, my love, you are by far the best loved of the three; I have had you principally in my mind--whatever I have done for your sake, my dear child, I have done freely and without murmuring.' ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{standing}} by the fireplace, his face buried in his hands, and she could tell by the <b>catch</b> of <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> that he was weeping. All the pity of her woman's nature went out to that silent and repenting figure dimly seen in the failing light. She put out her hand with a gesture of sympathy, and it rested for an instant upon his velvet sleeve. The next he had clasped it between his own, and she made no effort to release it.|$|R
