5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by Draža Mihailović, Majors Boško Todorović and Dangić, {{became aware of}} the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E

25|$|Like their American counterparts, Australian Catalinas were {{employed}} in search and rescue operations to recover downed aircrews. Following the Surrender of Japan in September 1945, RAAF Catalinas were used to deliver medical supplies to liberated POW camps before flying survivors back to Australia. On 30 August 1945 a flight of 9 RAAF Catalinas landed in Singapore bearing medical supplies and documents {{in preparation for the}} Japanese surrender, becoming the first allied forces to enter the island since 1942, days before the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Tiderace. In total, Australia operated 168 Catalinas during the war.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, {{was all part of}} a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than a}} trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be much easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
500|$|Even before Operation Deny Flight began, {{a number}} of US {{officials}} lobbied for a large role for NATO air power in Bosnia. In particular, as part of Bill Clinton's platform during his 1992 campaign for President of the United States he promised a [...] "lift and strike" [...] policy, which included the use of air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. After the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Deny Flight, US officials, including President Clinton, pushed for an expanded mission. After the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen Plan on 6 May 1993, Clinton and other US officials intensified these calls and they discussed {{the possibility of using}} large-scale strikes to coerce the Serbs into acceptance. Ultimately, no such strikes were approved or carried out, but American officials became more open to the idea of using air power for coercion.|$|E

500|$|In June 1941, {{just after}} the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Barbarossa, Hitler decreed that the Waffen-SS could recruit foreigners for service on the Eastern Front. He wanted a legion to be raised {{from each of the}} {{occupied}} countries of Western Europe, but Himmler was only interested in recruiting [...] "Germanic" [...] people into the Waffen-SS. Himmler decided that there were large numbers of potential pro-German but nationalistic recruits available from the [...] "Germanic" [...] races in occupied countries, and directed Berger to explore this manpower source. As a result of Himmler's decision, the Wehrmacht was permitted to recruit Frenchmen, Spaniards and Croats, while Dutch, Flemish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish men were Berger's domain. The [...] "national legions" [...] each numbered 1,000, except the Netherlands Legion, which had a maximum strength of 2,000. In November 1941, the Netherlands Legion and Flemish Legion had completed light infantry training and were sent to join the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade on the Leningrad Front. While they swore a personal oath to Hitler and were subject to SS rules and regulations, they were not members of the SS, and wore national symbols place of the sig runes. Berger {{even went so far as}} to recommend to Himmler that Flemings no longer be treated as foreigners, but be given full citizenship rights as Germans.|$|E
500|$|Croatia {{captured}} approximately 300 JNA {{officers and}} soldiers, who {{were taken to}} Rijeka after their capture. They were later exchanged for Croatian POWs captured by the JNA in the Battle of Vukovar and elsewhere in Croatia. A large quantity of small arms and ammunition was captured as well as seven tanks and twelve [...] mortars. After the battle, the artillery bombardment of Gospić continued from positions around Divoselo and Lički Čitluk, approximately [...] south of Gospić. Skirmishes in Lika continued until January 1992 as each side sought to improve their positions on the ground, especially around Gospić and Otočac. On 23 September, a Croatian advance to the south was stopped by JNA and SAO Krajina forces, consisting of an infantry battalion and the Krajina Express armored train, which were defending a JNA storage depot in Sveti Rok. The JNA secured the depot and captured Lovinac on 26 September. By the end of September, Croatian defensive positions around Otočac were sufficiently reinforced that only minor attacks were launched and primarily {{near the village of}} Drenov Klanac. In late October and early December, fighting intensified around Divoselo near Gospić, but no territory changed hands. The intensity of artillery bombardment of Gospić peaked on 1 November 1991, when 3,500 artillery shells struck the town. In December, the JNA Knin Corps proposed to the JNA General Staff to advance from Gračac in an attempt to capture Gospić and Otočac, but the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement and ceasefire of 2 January 1992 largely halted further fighting, until the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Medak Pocket in September 1993.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} Israeli {{achievements}} of these battles, and indeed, Operation Yoav, {{was the creation of}} a permanent land corridor between the Israeli Negev enclave {{and the rest of the}} country, following the capture of Huleiqat on October 20. This allowed for the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Moshe on October 21, which saw the capture of Beersheba, the [...] "capital of the Negev", by the Negev Brigade. Another point of significance was the creation of the basic guidelines for what would later become the Fallujah Pocket (the area of Fallujah – Iraq al-Manshuyya), and the general cutting off of the western wing of the Egyptian expeditionary force from its eastern wing.|$|E

2500|$|The Second Army altered its corps frontages {{soon after}} the attack of 20 September so that each attacking {{division}} could be concentrated on a [...] front. Roads and light railways were built behind the new front line to allow artillery and ammunition to be moved forward, beginning on 20 September; in fine weather this was finished in four days. As before Menin road, bombardment and counter-battery fire began immediately, with practice barrages fired daily as a minimum. Artillery from the VIII Corps and IX Corps in the south conducted bombardments to simulate attack preparations on Zandvoorde and Warneton. Haig intended that later operations would capture {{the rest of the}} ridge from Broodseinde, giving the Fifth Army scope to advance beyond the ridge north-eastwards and allow the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Hush.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1964, Lieutenant Colonel Risner took {{command of}} the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, an F-105D Thunderchief {{fighter-bomber}} unit based at Kadena AB, Okinawa, {{and part of the}} 18th Tactical Fighter Wing. The following January he led a detachment of seven aircraft to Da Nang Air Base to fly combat strikes that included a mission in Laos on January 13 in which he and his pilots were decorated for destroying a bridge, but Risner was also verbally reprimanded for losing an aircraft while bombing a second bridge not authorized by his orders. [...] On February 18, 1965, as part of an escalation in air attacks directed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that resulted in the <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Rolling Thunder, the 67th TFS began a tour of temporary duty at Korat RTAFB, Thailand, {{under the control of the}} 2d Air Division.|$|E

Müller served at Rouen, Prague and Kiel before the end of World War II. In 1947 he was apprehended by the Allies and put on trial as a war criminal in December 1947, {{for his role in the}} atrocities committed in Nordmark at the KZ Hassee–Kiel slave labor camp where 500 prisoners died between May 1944 and the end of the war. Müller was sentenced to 20 years of hard labor, but was released 5 years later due to amnesty laws.
