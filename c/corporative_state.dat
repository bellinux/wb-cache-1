The revolt was suppressed with support by the Bundesheer and right-wing Heimwehr troops under Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, ending with the ban of the Social Democratic Party and the trade unions. The path to dictatorship completed on 1 May 1934, when the Constitution was recast into a severely authoritarian document by a rump National Council.|$|R

The thesis provides with a brief survey of the system of these tools in the states analyzed with the thesis, i. e. United Kingdom as a residual welfare state, France as a <b>corporative</b> welfare <b>state</b> and Sweden as a social democratic welfare state. The practical part of the thesis is dedicated to the comparative analysis of the systems of the benefits in these states. Based on the results of comparative analysis, recommendations for measures and changes in the current Czech system are made. The recommendations reflect the needs and priorities of current family policy in the Czech Republic. The final part of the thesis was focused on detailed analysis of selected tools with a view to evaluate to which extent these tools contribute to the desired income equality between families with children and without children. Detailed adjustments in the system of the benefits, which were identified and suggested in the thesis, were evaluated by chosen experts in the given area.

40|$|In {{this article}} a process-tracing {{approach}} {{is used to}} explore how different factors {{have contributed to the}} development of healthcare policy in Bolivia, in light of the current proposal to introduce a unified public healthcare system. The main findings are that although international relations and state bureaucrats have been crucial to the process of formulating policies, the introduction of comprehensive reform will depend on the ability of groups who currently lack access to the healthcare system to form progressive coalitions promoting universalism, as well as the ability of those who benefit from the current arrangements to maintain the status quo. The ability to introduce comprehensive reforms is thus connected to the ongoing processes of decentralisation and democratisation of political decision-making in Bolivia. Although <b>state</b> - <b>corporative</b> welfare <b>state</b> institutions {{have been shown to be}} difficult to transform, low coverage levels in such systems combined with a process of increasing political inclusion of previously marginalised groups poses serious challenges to the status quo as the social aspect of citizenship is brought up on the agenda. In order to achieve universal coverage of the healthcare system, however, basic social rights of all citizens must be institutionalised at the same time as the scope and quality of services must be secured in order to avoid segmentation and to encourage the financial participation of the formal and middle income sectorsBolivia, Health care, Social policy, Institutional change, Power resources, Policy diffusion. ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} deepen {{the current state}} of {{knowledge}} concerning Portuguese consumer cooperatives. The analysis is focused on the period between the first legislation on co-operatives promulgated in 1867 and the fall of the dictatorship in 1974. Portugal is not considered an example of success in consumer co-operation. Instead, successive generations of co-operators have stressed the difficulties experienced in developing a sustainable and integrated co-operative movement. This interpretation has also been adopted in the historiography. It has been argued that the debility of the national co-operative movement is partly explained by the feeble industrialization and the low proportion of the working class within the Portuguese population. The crisis of liberalism in {{the last decade of the}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, conservative reaction, and the rise of fascism and the implementation of a <b>corporative</b> and authoritarian <b>state</b> in Portugal also need to be considered. Finally, the bicephalous character of Portuguese industrialization and urbanization - with a significant development only in Lisbon and Porto - prevented the creation of a national network. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Under his direction a new DNVP manifesto appeared in 1931, demonstrating the shift to the right. Amongst its demands were immediate restoration of the Hohenzollern monarchy, a reversal of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, compulsory military conscription, repossession of the German colonial empire, a concerted effort to build up closer links with German speaking people outside Germany (especially in Austria), a dilution {{of the role of the}} Reichstag to that of supervisory body to a newly established professional house of appointees reminiscent of Benito Mussolini's <b>corporative</b> <b>state</b> and reduction in the perceived over-representation of Jews in German public life.|$|E
50|$|On a wider {{scale the}} Fascist {{economic}} policy pushed the country towards the <b>corporative</b> <b>state,</b> {{an effort that}} lasted well into the war. The idea {{was to create a}} national community where the interests of all parts of the economy were integrated into a class-transcending unity. Some see the move to corporatism in two phases. First the workers were brought to heel over 1925-27. Initially the non-fascist trade unions and later (less forcefully) the fascist trade unions were nationalized by Mussolini’s administration, and placed under state ownership, conforming to Vladimir Lenin’s earlier policies to eliminate independent labor unions in the Soviet Union. Under this labor policy, Fascist Italy enacted laws to make union membership compulsory for all workers. This was a difficult stage - the trade unions were a significant component of Italian fascism, from its radical syndicalist roots, and they were also a major force in Italian industry. The changes were embodied in two key developments. The Pact of the Vidoni Palace in 1925 brought the fascist trade unions and major industries together, creating an agreement for the industrialists to only recognise certain unions and so marginalise the non-fascist and socialist trade unions. The Syndical Laws of 1926 (sometimes called the Rocco Laws, after Alfredo Rocco) took this agreement a step further; in each industrial sector there could be only one trade union and employers organisation. Labour had previously been united under Edmondo Rossoni and his General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations, giving him a substantial amount of power even after the syndical laws, causing both the industrialists and Mussolini himself to resent him. Thereby, he was dismissed in 1928 and Mussolini took over his position as well.|$|E
5000|$|British strategists {{regarded}} Portuguese non-belligerency as [...] "essential to keep Spain {{from entering}} the war {{on the side of}} the Axis". Britain recognised Salazar's important role on 15 May 1940, when Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed him that the University's Hebdomadal Council had [...] "unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you Salazar to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law". The same Life magazine article of July 1940 that praised Salazar's work on behalf of the Portuguese nation commented, [...] "this year, for the first time in centuries, Portugal is important to America. It is the funnel through which to pour all the exchanges - of people and messages and diplomacy - between America and Europe. The war, by cutting the lines of intercourse to Northern Europe, has made Portugal what might say geography intended - not a faraway corner of Europe but its front door." [...] In September 1940, Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar to congratulate him for his policy of keeping Portugal out of the war, avowing that [...] "as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question." [...] Sir Samuel Hoare, the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during World War II, and lauded him for it. Hoare averred that [...] "Salazar detested Hitler and all his works" [...] and that his <b>corporative</b> <b>state</b> was fundamentally different from a Nazi or fascist state, with Salazar never leaving a doubt of his desire for a Nazi defeat. Historian Carlton Hayes, a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during the war. He met Salazar in person and also praised him, expressing a similar opinion to Hoare's in his book Wartime Mission in Spain. In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, Sir Ronald Campbell, wrote, paraphrasing Salazar, that [...] "strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis." ...|$|E

In his functionas Dean of the Faculty of Law (1938 – 1943), for instance, he upheldthe traditional Austrian way of making new appointments to vacantchairs, a procedure which was contrary to the national socialist‘Führerprinzip’. He also proved stamina when various partyorganizations tried to influence him. This also meant that he didnot leave his post as Dean at a time when attempts were made fromdifferent sides to remove him from his office because of his nonconformism. He left when the opposition against him had come toan end.

He felt hurt when he was dismissed from university after 1945, an act he considered dishonourable. However, thisdid not stop him from remaining true to academia – especially to the Austrian Academy of Sciences – by being immenselyproductive until the end of his life.

40|$|In April 1933 a new {{constitution}} was adopted in Portugal, establishing the Estado Novo (New State) regime, following the military dictatorship imposed in 1926. In September of the same year, a set of decrees was published, setting {{the foundations of the}} <b>corporative</b> <b>state.</b> One of those decrees determined the criteria to be adopted in the construction of Affordable Houses by the central government or with its support. That was the start of a housing programme that lasted {{until the end of the}} regime in 1974 and that was based on the single-family house. Although it was in tune with similar laws from the Primeira República (First Republic, established in 1910), the choice for the single-family house reveals a conscious choice and an ideological statement by the regime. Several representatives were sent throughout Europe, even to "communist Russia", to study housing programmes, and the small house was selected as a symbol of a Portuguese way of life, inspired in a mythical rural setting and in an obsession with a past that never existed outside of the nationalist imaginary. The house represented in that Programme an ideal family and an ideal individual; it represented, in fact, the ultimate goal of the regime: setting an apolitical community, without further aspirations and comfortable with its place in society. In the first years of the Estado Novo, the architectural design of the affordable house is charged with the ideology of the state. This paper will focus on an analysis of the first years of the Affordable Houses Programme, revealing how the House and housing design were key factors in the creation of a state image, in a State that wished to be simultaneously New and conservative...|$|E
