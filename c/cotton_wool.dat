5|$|Villermé {{published}} {{works on}} the conditions in prisons in France, {{and the benefits of}} helping prisoners return to outside life when their sentences ended. Another concerned the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life of working class people. His best known work was concerned with workers in the <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool,</b> and silk industries, including the children that worked in the mills.|$|E
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of <b>Cotton,</b> <b>Wool</b> and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool,</b> and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E

5|$|The {{biology is}} poorly known; {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} castes were described {{for the first time in}} 2012. The genus is known mainly from isolated workers found in Winkler or Berlese samples. Tatuidris workers have peculiar mandibular brushes and a powerful sting, which led Brown & Kempf to speculate that Tatuidris might be specialist predators of active or slippery arthropod prey. Until 2011, no observations of live specimens were registered. Details of a first collection event of a small live colony (3 workers and 4 gynes) by Thibaut Delsinne in a mid-elevation forest in southeastern Ecuador suggest that Tatuidris may well be a highly specialized predator, as colonies kept in captivity did not accept any food item offered to them. Food items rejected by the ants included live and dead termites, millipedes, mites, various insect parts, sugar water, tuna, biscuits, live and dead fruit flies (Drosophila), live springtails, live myriapods (Chilopoda and Diplopoda), live and dead Diplura, small live spiders, small live pseudoscorpions, one small snail, uncooked hen egg (i.e. piece of <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> soaked with fresh whisked hen egg), ant larvae (Gnamptogenys sp.), and live ant workers (Cyphomyrmex sp., Brachymyrmex sp.). Potential food items (arthropods) for Tatuidris were taken from soil samples and Winkler samples collected at the site where Tatuidris was a priori determined to be present.|$|E

50|$|Applying {{cyanoacrylate}} to {{some natural}} {{materials such as}} <b>cotton,</b> leather or <b>wool</b> (<b>cotton</b> swabs, cotton balls, and certain yarns or fabrics) results in a powerful, rapid exothermic reaction.

25|$|Cloth {{production}} {{moved away}} from the cottage into manufactories. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool</b> and worsted was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialised in weaving fabric was called a weaving shed.|$|E

Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|E

25|$|The major {{agricultural}} products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials. Specific foods include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meats and spices. Fibers include <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool,</b> hemp, silk and flax. Raw materials include lumber and bamboo. Other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as resins, dyes, drugs, perfumes, biofuels and ornamental {{products such as}} cut flowers and nursery plants. Over {{one third of the}} world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.|$|E

Kabul's economy {{was influenced by}} the America and has increased by almost 3500% after shrinking for 25 years. A new currency was introduced to Afghans which helped the economy. New business was in the new regime. Many American industries were interested in the new Kabul and many new companies have since then opened their branches in Kabul. The Kabul City Centre Mall was built and has nearly 100 shops.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Whitehaven was {{exporting}} its coal {{mainly to}} Ireland and to replace the tobacco trade Whitehaven turned to importing sugar from Barbados, <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> from Antigua and coffee and cocoa from St Lucia. There is little evidence to suggest that Whitehaven was involved in the slave trade. Due to the coal trade Whitehaven was, after London, the second port of England in terms of tonnage of shipping from 1750 to 1772. Even by 1835 Whitehaven was still the fifth placed port with 443 ships registered, but by {{the end of the}} 19th century only 68 vessels were registered.|$|E

25|$|Geo{{textiles}} {{form one}} of the two largest groups of geosynthetics. They are textiles consisting of synthetic fibers rather than natural ones such as <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool,</b> or silk. This makes them less susceptible to bio-degradation. These synthetic fibers are made into flexible, porous fabrics by standard weaving machinery or are matted together in a random non woven manner. Some are also knitted. Geotextiles are porous to liquid flow across their manufactured plane and also within their thickness, but to a widely varying degree. There are at least 100 specific application areas for geotextiles that have been developed; however, the fabric always performs at least one of four discrete functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and/or drainage.|$|E
25|$|Lewiston was a {{slow but}} {{steadily}} growing farm town throughout its early history. By the early-to-mid-19th century, however, as water power was being honed, Lewiston's location on the Androscoggin River would prove {{to make it a}} perfect location for emerging industry. In 1809, Michael Little built a large wooden sawmill next to the falls. Burned in 1814 by an arsonist, it was later rebuilt. In 1836, local entrepreneurs—predominantly the Little family and friends—formed the Androscoggin Falls Dam, Lock & Canal Company:...for the purpose of erecting and constructing dams, locks, canals, mills, works, machines, and buildings on their own lands and also manufacturing <b>cotton,</b> <b>wool,</b> iron, steel, and paper in the towns of Lewiston, Minot, and Danville.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|E
