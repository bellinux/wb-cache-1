40|$|We tested three {{predictions}} {{regarding the}} joint evolution of pollen performance and mating system. First, {{due to the}} potential for intense intrasexual competition in outcrossing populations, we predicted that outcrossers would produce faster-growing pollen than their selfing relatives. Second, if elevated competition promotes stronger selection on traits that improve pollen performance, then, among-plant variation in pollen performance would be lower in outcrossers than in selfers. Third, given successive generations of adaptation to the same maternal genotype in selfers, we predicted that, in selfing populations (but not in outcrossing ones), pollen would perform better following self- than <b>cross-pollinations.</b> We tested these predictions in field populations of two pairs of Clarkia (Onagraceae) sister taxa. Consistent with our predictions, one outcrosser (C. unguiculata) exhibited faster pollen germination and less variation in pollen tube growth rate (PTGR) among pollen donors than its selfing sister species, C. exilis. Contrary to our predictions, the selfing C. xantiana ssp. parviflora exhibited faster PTGR than the outcrossing ssp. xantiana, and these taxa showed similar levels of variation in this trait. Pollen performance following self- vs. <b>cross-pollinations</b> did not differ within either selfing or outcrossing taxa. While {{these findings suggest that}} mating system and pollen performance may jointly evolve in Clarkia, other factors clearly contribute to pollen performance in natural populations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pollen {{and seed}} {{dispersal}} in herbaceous insect-pollinated plants are often restricted, inducing strong population structure. To what extent this influences mating within and among patches is poorly understood. This study investigates {{the influence of}} population structure on pollen performance using controlled pollinations and genetic markers. METHODS: Population structure was investigated in a patchily distributed population of gynodioecious Silene vulgaris in Switzerland using polymorphic microsatellite markers. Experimental pollinations were performed on 21 hermaphrodite recipients using pollen donors at three spatial scales: (a) self-pollination; (b) within-patch cross-pollinations; and (c) between-patch <b>cross-pollinations.</b> Pollen performance was then compared with respect to crossing distance. KEY RESULTS: The population of S. vulgaris was characterized by {{a high degree of}} genetic sub-structure, with neighbouring plants more related to one another than to distant individuals. Inbreeding probably results from both selfing and biparental inbreeding. Pollen performance increased with distance between mates. Between-patch pollen performed significantly better than both self- and within-patch pollen donors. However, no significant difference was detected between self- and within-patch pollen donors. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that population structure in animal-pollinated plants is likely to influence mating patterns by favouring <b>cross-pollinations</b> between unrelated plants. However, the extent to which this mechanism could be effective as a pre-zygotic barrier preventing inbred mating depends on the patterns of pollinator foraging and their influence on pollen dispersal...|$|R

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the <b>cross-pollination</b> of flowers.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes <b>cross-pollination</b> with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making <b>cross-pollination</b> more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} the German {{academic}} and natural historian Joseph Kölreuter (1733–1806) extended this work by noting {{the function of}} nectar in attracting pollinators {{and the role of}} wind and insects in pollination.

One hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, Christian Sprengel (1750–1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in pollination, the adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination, and the prevalence of <b>cross-pollination,</b> even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that <b>cross-pollination</b> is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E
50|$|Cornus {{florida is}} easily {{propagated}} by seeds, which are sown {{in the fall}} into prepared rows of sawdust or sand, and emerge in the spring. Germination rates for good clean seed should be near 100% if seed dormancy is first overcome by cold stratification treatments for 90 to 120 days at 4 C. Flowering dogwood demonstrates gametophytic self-incompatibility, meaning that the plants can’t self-fertilize. This is important for breeding programs as it means {{that it is not}} necessary to emasculate (remove the anthers from) C. florida flowers before making controlled <b>cross-pollinations.</b> These pollinations should be repeated every other day, as the flowers must be cross-pollinated within one or two days of opening for pollinations to be effective.|$|R

5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T.

5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires <b>cross-pollination</b> between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cross-pollination,</b> {{also called}} allogamy, occurs when pollen is {{delivered}} from the stamen of one flower to {{the stigma of}} a flower on another plant of the same species.
