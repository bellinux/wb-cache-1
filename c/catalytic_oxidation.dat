5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Conducting <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidations</b> {{of organic}} {{substrates}} in {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} as reaction medium {{is one of the}} most promising strategy for the creation of fundamental chemical transformations that are environmentally benign. There is extensive literature on the use of supercritical carbon dioxide as solvent for unselective hydrocarbons auto-oxidations. Conversely, only a limited number of reports deal with selective oxidations carried out by molecular oxygen or by other primary oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, monopersulfate, etc. In this paper recent developments in selective <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidations</b> are reviewed ed in particular those processes in which is formed a metal derivatives, by action of a terminal oxidant which could be oxygen or an organic or inorganic peroxide, capable of selectively oxidizing various substrates...|$|R
25|$|Alkenes are {{oxidized}} with a {{large number}} of oxidizing agents. In the presence of oxygen, alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce carbon dioxide and water. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> with oxygen or the reaction with percarboxylic acids yields epoxides. Reaction with ozone in ozonolysis leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two aldehydes or ketones. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO4 (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield ketones or carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|Oxidations using oxoammonium salts may {{be carried}} out either in the {{stoichiometric}} or catalytic mode under acidic or basic conditions. This section describes {{the most commonly used}} conditions for the stoichiometric and <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> of alcohols to carbonyl compounds with oxoammonium salts. Although a wide variety of alcohols may be oxidized using TEMPO, competitive oxidation of more electron-rich functionality sometimes takes place. In addition, the site selectivity of oxidation of polyols may differ depending on the conditions used.|$|E
25|$|Detailed balance {{states that}} in {{equilibrium}} each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process and requires reversibility of all elementary processes. For many real physico-chemical complex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidation,</b> most enzyme reactions etc.), detailed mechanisms include both reversible and irreversible reactions. If one represents irreversible reactions as limits of reversible steps, then it become obvious {{that not all}} reaction mechanisms with irreversible reactions can be obtained as limits of systems or reversible reactions with detailed balance. For example, the irreversible cycle A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1 cannot be obtained as such a limit but the reaction mechanism A1 -> A2 -> A3 <- A1 can.|$|E

25|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} (or incineration) {{can also}} be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> at ~2,000 ppmV.|$|E
500|$|Nitric acid (HNO3) {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid) and was first discovered by the alchemists in the 13th century. It is made by <b>catalytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the United States of America, over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes self-ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows: ...|$|E

When the Ru/RuO 2 nanoparticles were loaded on metal oxide supports (CeO 2, TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3), the structure of Ru core and RuO 2 shell remained unchanged on CeO 2 support, whereas Ru core was preferred to be oxidized to RuO 2 on TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3.
