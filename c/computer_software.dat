In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator, Myst and Command & Conquer, and it was number six among all <b>computer</b> <b>software.</b> By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel , and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling <b>computer</b> <b>software</b> programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than 1 million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using <b>computer</b> <b>software</b> to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in GalÃ¡pagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by <b>computer</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E
