5000|$|A {{commonly}} explored {{consequence of}} shared leadership is team effectiveness or team performance, {{which can be}} measured either by self-reports of team members or by outsider ratings, such as supervisor or <b>client</b> <b>ratings.</b> [...] Performance is also sometimes measured more objectively, by using a commonly agreed-upon scale or rubric to rate the execution of a task. Many studies have found {{a positive relationship between}} shared leadership and team effectiveness and performance. Similarly, other studies have explored the extent to which shared leadership can predict a team's effectiveness or performance, and have found that it is a significant predictor—often a better predictor than vertical leadership.A meta-analysis by Nicolaides and colleagues (2014) found that one reason why shared leadership relates to performance is through increasing team confidence. Interestingly, the researchers also found that shared leadership contributed to performance, over and above the effects of vertical leadership.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to explore the impact of {{resistance}} on client perceptions of therapist empathy, and examine client-rated empathy as a mediator {{of the impact of}} resistance on therapy outcomes in the context of 44 therapist-client dyads receiving cognitive-behavioural therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Trained observer ratings of resistance were utilized to identify the level of resistance present in an early therapy session, and corresponding <b>client</b> post-session <b>ratings</b> of therapist empathy were used.

The same concept {{is used by}} search engine marketing companies to suggest keyword terms to their clients to improve the <b>client’s</b> <b>ratings</b> for different search engines. This paper presents and evaluates a corpus based method to find similar terms. The corpus is generated by scraping websites in different categories. A feature selection method is developed that rewards category specific terms and penalizes terms shared by two or more categories. The similarity measure is decomposed into three distinct components, namely contextual, functional and lexical similarities. The contextual similarity measure finds terms that {{are found in the}} same context. Functional similarity finds terms on co-occurrence basis while the lexically similar terms share one or more words.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the strength of the}} real relationship (RR) in relation to session quality, therapist immediacy (T-IMM), and client experiencing level (C-EXP) in six psychotherapy dyads over the course of time-limited treatment. Six clients and three therapists completed measures of RR and session quality immediately after each session. Trained judges rated the amount, appropriateness, depth, quality and resolution of T-IMM and the peak and mode level of C-EXP using audio recordings and transcripts post-treatment. This study used the Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; Kenny & Cook, 1999), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to analyze the data due to nesting and interdepence. No significant associations were detected between therapist or <b>client</b> <b>ratings</b> of RR and session quality, between therapist ratings of RR and T-IMM, or between therapist or <b>client</b> <b>ratings</b> of RR and C-EXP. Client perceptions of RR were significantly related to T-IMM rating dimensions, though not significantly related to T-IMM amount or occurrence. The results indicate that regardless of the amount, when therapist immediacy is used appropriately, with depth, quality or resolution, clients perceive stronger real relationships with their therapists. Implications for practitioners and researchers regarding the findings are discussed. In addition, due to the unique racial/ethnic minority (REM) composition {{of the majority of the}} dyads, cultural implications for research and practice are considered...|$|E

40|$|Both {{interpersonal}} {{dependency and}} the importance of the therapeutic alliance to successful psychotherapy outcomes have been widely studied. However, these two areas of study rarely have been viewed conjointly despite the reportedly large number of clients with dependency who present for treatment. This study elucidated the relationship between interpersonal dependency and the therapeutic alliance. Additional hypotheses explored client-therapist agreement on alliance strength in relation to client interpersonal dependency. Participants were graduate student therapists (N = 26) and their individual psychotherapy clients (N = 40) in a training clinic at a large, southwestern university. Within their first three sessions of psychotherapy, participating clients told nine Thematic Apperception Test stories and completed structured self-report measures of adult attachment, social desirability, and psychological symptoms. Interpersonal dependency was scored from the TAT stories, using the TAT Oral Dependency (TOD) scoring system developed by Masling, Rabie, and Blondheim (1967) and Huprich (2008). Three sessions following initial data collection, participating clients and their therapists completed structured self-report measures of the therapeutic alliance. Analyses revealed that interpersonal dependency was not significantly associated with client and therapist alliance ratings or the congruence between client and therapist alliance ratings. However, specific scoring categories of the TOD were associated with client alliance scores in opposing directions. In contrast to hypotheses, self-reported attachment-related dependency was significantly related to <b>client</b> alliance <b>ratings</b> and to the congruence between therapist and <b>client</b> alliance <b>ratings.</b> <b>Clients</b> with higher levels of self-reported attachment-related dependency rated the alliance less favorably, in agreement with their therapists, than did clients with lower levels of attachment-related dependency.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} client attachment style {{as a predictor}} of (a) therapist interventions in an early, middle, and late session of psychotherapy; (b) client and therapist post-session ratings of the working alliance over the course of therapy; and (c) client and therapist post-session ratings of the real relationship over the course of therapy. A total of 41 clients and 14 therapists completed measures prior to and throughout open-term courses of psychotherapy ranging from 8 to 106 sessions. Client attachment style was measured using the anxiety and avoidance subscale scores from the Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). Therapist interventions were coded by trained observers using the Psychotherapy Q-Set (PQS; Jones, 2000). A factor analysis of therapist interventions revealed four factors: Therapist Facilitative Approach (TFA), Therapist Psychodynamic versus Behavioral Interventions (TPB), Therapist Supportive Approach (TSA), and Therapist Process Comments (TPC). Client attachment avoidance was positively associated with Therapist Supportive Approach (TSA), such that therapists were more likely to use directly supportive interventions with clients who endorsed higher levels of attachment avoidance at the outset of therapy. Otherwise, <b>client</b> attachment <b>ratings</b> were not significantly associated to overall levels of therapist interventions or change in therapist interventions over the course of therapy. Neither client attachment anxiety nor avoidance significantly predicted initial levels, mean levels, or patterns of change in <b>client</b> or therapist <b>ratings</b> of the working alliance or the real relationship over the course of psychotherapy. The findings are discussed in the context of findings and methodological differences from other investigations of client attachment, therapist interventions, and <b>client</b> and therapist <b>ratings</b> of the working alliance and the real relationship.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between client emotional intelligence, insight, transference, and session outcome in a single session of ongoing counseling. Thirty therapists completed a total of 86 <b>client</b> <b>ratings.</b> The results suggest that client emotional intelligence is related to insight and transference. In most cases, emotional intelligence predicted the level of transference above and beyond the predictive power of insight. In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that emotional intelligence is related to session outcome. Moreover, the findings suggest that insight is a partial mediator of certain dimensions of emotional intelligence and session outcome. Attention, a subscale of emotional intelligence, and negative transference interact to predict session outcome. Overall, the results did not support the transference X insight interaction effect on session outcome that was hypothesized.

Relationships among these characteristics and clients ’ session outcome ratings (Real Relationship Inventory and Working Alliance Inventory) were examined using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Likelihood of disclosure occurrence and certain disclosure types and characteristics were related to client post-session ratings of the real relationship and the working alliance.

40|$|Background - There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the therapeutic alliance {{is one of the}} most consistent predictors of retention and outcomes in drug treatment. Recent psychotherapy research has indicated that there is a lack of agreement between client, therapist and observer ratings of the therapeutic alliance; however, the clinical implications of this lack of consensus have not been explored. Aims - The aims of the study are to (1) explore the extent to which, in drug treatment, clients and counsellors agree in their perceptions of their alliance, and (2) investigate whether the degree of disagreement between clients and counsellors is related to retention in treatment. Methods - The study recruited 187 clients starting residential rehabilitation treatment for drug misuse in three UK services. <b>Client</b> and counsellor <b>ratings</b> of the therapeutic alliance (using the WAI-S) were obtained during weeks 1 - 12. Retention was in this study defined as remaining in treatment for at least 12 weeks. Results - <b>Client</b> and counsellor <b>ratings</b> of the alliance were only weakly related (correlations ranging from r = 0. 07 to 0. 42) and tended to become more dissimilar over the first 12 weeks in treatment. However, whether or not clients and counsellors agreed on the quality of their relationship did not influence whether clients were retained in treatment. Conclusions - The low consensus between client and counsellor views of the alliance found in this and other studies highlights the need for drug counsellors to attend closely to their clients' perceptions of the alliance and to seek regular feedback from clients regarding their feelings about their therapeutic relationship...|$|R

This study examines how a therapist’s spinal alignment, defined as {{the organization of the}} three primary body weights (the skull, thorax, and pelvis) around a vertical plumbline, affects clients ’ perceptions of themselves. As measured by the Counselor Rating Form (Barak & LaCrosse, 1975), in this study <b>client</b> <b>ratings</b> of a therapist’s trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertise did not differ significantly between when the therapist was sitting in spinal alignment and when sitting with a ten degree slouch.

40|$|While {{the quality}} of the working {{alliance}} between therapist and client might be the best predictor of treatment outcome, are there other factors that contribute to therapeutic outcome? The literature supports a case for a relationship between working alliance or therapeutic outcome, and therapist characteristics such as attitudes, personality variables and attachment style. This pilot study investigated the effect of therapist characteristics on client-rated working alliance and functioning over the course of psychological therapy. Findings indicated that high scores for the therapist attitude of 2 ̆ 7 adjustment 2 ̆ 7 - characterised by a view that the curative factors in psychotherapy require a more active, educative, and leading role of the therapist - predicted positive symptom outcome over time.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveInternet-delivered {{cognitive}} behavior therapy (ICBT) {{has been}} developed and tested for treating persons with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A new form of CBT focuses on acceptance (of internal experiences or difficult psychological content), mindfulness and valued actions. To date this form of CBT has not been delivered via the internet for persons with GAD. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the functionality of a new internet-delivered acceptance-based behavior therapy for GAD, and to test the effect of the intervention in an open pilot trial. MethodsFollowing exclusion of two patients we included 14 patients diagnosed with GAD from two primary care clinics. At 2 – 3 months follow-up after treatment 10 patients completed the outcome measures. The treatment lasted for an average of 15 weeks and consisted of acceptance-based techniques, behavior therapy components and homework assignments.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this exploratory study {{into the nature}} of empathy were two-fold. First, to investigate the association between two measures of counsellor empathy, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI), rated from the perspectives of counsellors and clients and the Truax/Carkhuff Accurate Empathy Scale (TCAE) rated from the perspectives of observers, counselling supervisors and counsellors. Secondly, to investigate whether there was a relationship between empathy and dyadic compatibility (as measured by the FIRO-F scales), or empathy and the occasions, nature and degree of counsellor and client perceived similarity to the other (as described in post-counselling interviews). Sixty counsellor-client dyads (24 dyads across 1 - 3 sessions per dyad) were videotaped during counselling. Counsellors and clients were then interviewed independently, subsequent to each counselling session. The results of the study were described in three sections. Part 1 reported that while the BLRI and the TCAE scale both exhibited a high degree of reliability, they appeared to be measures of different constructs. Results of a factor analysis suggested that not only must the two instruments be treated as independent measures of empathy, but that ratings made from differing counselling perspectives (counsellor, client, external judge) using the same instrument, must also be treated independently. <b>Client</b> <b>ratings</b> of perceived similarity to their counsellors, and <b>client</b> <b>ratings</b> of counsellor (BLRI) empathy were highly correlated although there was no correlation between counsellors' perceived similarity to clients, and counsellor, observer or supervisor ratings of empathy. There was no correlation between FIRO-F dyadic compatibility and either perceived similarity or empathy. Part II involved an intensive case 3 tudy comparison of specific dyadic rating patterns across measures of empathy, with patterns obtained from a content analysis of counsellor interview responses to questions on the occasions, nature and degree of similarity perceived between self and other. A complex matrix of findings was obtained which suggested that the link between empathy and counsellor perceived similarity to clients was not uniform and differed across both levels of empathy and perceived similarity. Part III presented an historical review of the nature of empathy, undertaken in order to clarify and interpret earlier reported findings. It was suggested that conceptualizations of empathy have altered markedly over time, {{largely as a result of}} researcher's and counselling trainer's need for observable, measurable and trainable processes within counselling. An eight phase model of the process by which empathic understanding may occur was presented, and the manner and extent to which the model could be deemed accountable for the findings of the present study was discussed. It was suggested that the divergent state of research associated with empathy may be largely attributable to the emphasis placed on one or several phases of the process to the exclusion of other phases. Suggestions for further research were offered, and the question was raised as to whether either the BLRI or the TCAE scale were in fact tapping any of the phases of empathy described in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the {{importance}} of the therapeutic alliance in therapy has been established, with meta-analyses indicating an effect size of between. 22 and. 26 for the alliance on outcome. However, relatively few findings have been reported regarding factors associated with strong alliance, thus limiting clinicians' understanding of alliance development. In this review, client and therapist factors related to alliance were considered. Factors related to the alliance reviewed were attachment/interpersonal functioning; severity/type of presenting problem; personality factors and therapist technique and experience. Evaluation of current research findings indicated they are limited by their focus upon factors associated with, or perspectives of, only one member of the therapeutic dyad at anyone time. The research study carried out aimed to investigate further the relationship between client and therapist personality and the alliance, considering for the first time both members of the dyad together. Client personality factors were found to correlate with <b>client</b> <b>ratings</b> of the alliance and therapist personality factors were found to correlate with therapist alliance ratings. Relationships were also identified between client/therapist personality and the other member of the dyad's alliance rating. In addition, relationships were identified between client-therapist personality similarity and client/therapist working alliance ratings. Implications of the results for clinicians engaged in psychological therapy, issues regarding recruitment and other study limitations are discussed. Possible areas of future research are highlighted, with particular emphasis of the strength of the dyadic approachEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Although {{transactional}} analysis (TA) {{theory has been}} used by psychotherapists since its introduction by Eric Berne in the 1960 s, the ego state functioning constructs, a seminal part of the theory, have not been adequately validated. Previous research has focused on whether therapy using TA methodology works. This study tested the TA ego state constructs by measuring client change occurring during psychotherapy and comparing those changes with predictions from the TA theory. Fifty-six subjects, who were clients at a university counseling center in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, were tested before and after therapy using two standardized instruments, the Adjective Check List (ACL) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and client and therapist global ratings of success of therapy. Critical Parent, Nurturing Parent, Adult, and Adapted Child ego state scores from the ACL all changed in the predicted directions and reached statistical significance. Free Child ego state score changes did not reach statistical significance. Ego state scores correlated with BSI Global Severity Index in predicted directions and all correlations except Critical Parent were statistically significant. Changes in ego state scores did not correlate with client and therapist ratings of success with one exception [...] Nurturing Parent was related to <b>Client</b> <b>ratings</b> of success. Changes in ego state scores did not correlate with subject pretest symptomatology, number of sessions, or the therapist 2 ̆ 7 s level of experience. Limitations of the study and recommendations for further research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study extends {{research}} on contextual characteristics associated with positive outcomes within traditional youth settings to examine program characteristics, resources and positive development opportunities that exist within programs for homeless youth and youth {{at risk for}} homelessness. One hundred and thirty-three youth (42 boys and young men; 91 girls and young women) from six community agencies completed questionnaires created to assess youth ratings of program dimensions associated with positive development. Relationships were examined among dimension <b>ratings,</b> <b>client</b> characteristics and overall satisfaction. Regression analyses revealed {{significant main effects for}} participant age, appropriate structure, empowerment, and positive social norms, and two age by dimension interactions. Older youth who were more satisfied with agency programming produced higher ratings for agency structure, while for younger youth, satisfaction was positively associated with ratings for agency safety.

40|$|A behavioral-analytic {{assessment}} {{approach was}} conducted to identify social skill deficits in visually-handicapped adolescents. The investigation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, a role-play test of social skill relevant to visually-handicapped persons was derived empirically using separate samples of professional and paraprofessional staff. Also, situation-specific criteria for evaluating levels of social skill were established. The second phase involved validation of the role-play test by determining {{the extent to which}} it discriminated visually-handicapped from nonhandicapped participants. Further, the first empirical data concerning the specific nature of interpersonal skill deficits in the blind were obtained in this part of the study. Results indicated that blind Ss showed deficiencies in selected verbal and nonverbal social skill components. However, their performance was not uniformly deficient. Indeed, visually-handicapped <b>clients</b> received higher <b>ratings</b> on a global skill measure. Overall, these findings support the notion that many blind individuals experience problems in social adaptation and underscore the need for further research in this area...|$|R
