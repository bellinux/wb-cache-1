60|$|Action was imperatively necessary, and he {{braced himself}} for the effort. The {{schooner}} was lying with her anchor up-stream, {{but he did not}} think {{it would be possible to}} heave her over it and break it out unless he waited until the others arrived, and it would then be a lengthy and, what was more to the purpose, a noisy operation. The anchor must be sacrificed, but there was the difficulty that in the dark he could hardly expect to find a shackle on the cable. Running forward with the Siwash, he pulled out a <b>chain</b> <b>stopper,</b> and then shipping the windlass levers found with vast relief that it would work. It would make a horribly distinct clanking, he knew, but that could not be helped, and the next thing was to discover whether the end of the chain was made fast below, for it is very seldom that a skipper finds it necessary to pay out all his cable.|$|E
50|$|The devil's claw is {{a device}} that {{is used as a}} <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> to grab and hold an anchor chain. It {{consists}} of a turnbuckle, usually attached {{at the base of the}} anchor windlass, and a metal hook with two curved fingers that grab one link of a chain.|$|E

40|$|The {{rheology}} of a reversible supramolecular polymer is {{studied by}} comparing the effects {{of an increase in}} temperature and the addition of <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers.</b> The dependence of the zero-shear viscosity and the terminal relaxation time on temperature is exponential, and the activation energy for viscous flow can be calculated. Above a critical stopper fraction, power laws describe the stopper dependence of the viscosity and relaxation time. A simple model for the effect of the addition of <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers</b> on the average degree of polymerization adequately describes the results. A comparison of flow curves at several temperatures and stopper fractions reveals considerable differences between solutions with the same zero-shear viscosity. These are mainly associated with differences in the terminal relaxation time. A mechanism of shear-induced alignment and subsequent elongation of chains is proposed, with which the experimental results are consistent...|$|R

Depletion forces were measured directly by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. The range of the depletion force is consistent with existing independent experimental data. The interaction can be tuned by adding monofunctional <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers</b> to the solution, a possibility which is unique to supramolecular polymers.

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{achieving}} the desired molecular weight is by {{addition of a}} small amount of monofunctional monomer, a monomer with only one functional group. The monofunctional monomer, often referred to as a <b>chain</b> <b>stopper,</b> controls and limits the polymerization of bifunctional monomers because the growing polymer yields chain ends devoid of functional groups and therefore incapable of further reaction.|$|E

40|$|A set of {{fluorene}} oligomers {{has been}} synthesized by stepwise palladium-catalyzed (Suzuki) couplings of fluorene monomers. Ureidopyrimidinones (UPy), functional groups that can dimerize via quadruple hydrogen bonds, {{were attached to}} {{both ends of the}} oligofluorenes. The resulting bis-UPy-terminated oligomers self-assemble into supramolecular chain polymers. For comparison, oligofluorenes of the same oligomer lengths but without terminal hydrogen-bonding groups were synthesized. Chains of hydrogen-bonded fluorenes can be simply endcapped by a variety of <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers,</b> molecules that have one UPy group. In this manner, we have endcapped the hydrogen-bonded fluorene chains with either oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) or perylene bisimide. Energy-transfer experiments in solution and the solid state demonstrate that oligofluorenes can donate energy to a variety of energy acceptors, but that this energy transfer occurs most effectively when the donor fluorene is hydrogen-bonded to the acceptor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{combined}} electrochemical, rheological and light scattering measurements {{to investigate the}} viscoelastic character of solutions of (2, 4 -bis (2 -ethylhexylureido) toluene) (EHUT) in toluene {{in the presence of}} two ionic liquids: (trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate “Cyphos 110 ”) and (tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate “aph 4 -cph 12 ”) used to substantially increase the solution conductivity required for the electrochemical study. The heterogeneous rate constant k 0 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple, the diffusivity (DFc), and the equivalent capacitance values of the double layer were measured in the presence {{and in the absence of}} EHUT. For Cyphos 110, the viscosity of solutions increases in the presence of EHUT, but the diffusion current exhibited no fluctuations. By opposition, for aph 4 -cph 12, strong fluctuations of the diffusion current allowed to assign a viscoelastic character to the solutions when EHUT is added. Rheological and light scattering measurements revealed that the two ionic liquids act as <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers</b> for EHUT supramolecular chains. However, aph 4 -cph 12 maintains the viscoelastic character of the EHUT solution whereas Cyphos 110 destroys the supramolecular structure...|$|R
40|$|Posed {{with the}} {{challenge}} of engineering and characterising nanoscaled objects, this thesis reports on the development of self assembling (cyclic peptide) -polymer conjugates as a versatile supramolecular route to complex nanostructures. A variety of conjugates was synthesised by microwave assisted copper(i) -catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, covalently coupling alt(d,l) α cyclic peptides with synthetic polymers. The product of self assembly was then characterised in solution by small angle neutron scattering. Manipulating the grafted polymer and the chemical functionality of the peptide influenced the stability of the assembly, but was observed to be dependent on the solvating media. H-bonding and solvation strengths of a variety of solvents and mixtures produced nanotubes with lengths > 110 nm or as short as 10 nm. Partially N methylated cyclic peptides (NMeCPs) and NMeCP-polymer conjugates were explored as compounds to limit self assembly. While the dimerisation of NMeCPs could be observed by size exclusion chromatography, lateral aggregation was also observed. NMeCP-polymer conjugates formed large (400 nm) extended structures with small (1 nm) domains as characterised by differential scanning calorimetry, light and neutron scattering. Monotopic NMeCP species were then investigated as <b>chain</b> <b>stoppers</b> for nanotubes, with the intent of controlling the nanotube length and adding functionality to the tube ends. No change to the geometry of the assembly could be observed, even up to a molar ratio of 1 : 4 ([CP]/[NMeCP], 80...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSupramolecular {{polymers}} are linear {{chains of}} low molar mass monomers {{held together by}} reversible and directional non-covalent interactions, which can form gels or highly viscous solutions if the self-assembled chains are sufficiently long and rigid. The viscosity of these solutions can be controlled by adding monofunctional compounds, which interact with the chain extremities: chain stoppers. We have synthesized new substituted ureas and thioureas and tested them as chain stoppers for a bis-urea based supramolecular polymer. In particular, the bis-thiourea analogue of the bis-urea monomer is shown not to form a supramolecular polymer, but a good <b>chain</b> <b>stopper,</b> {{because it is a}} strong hydrogen bond donor and a weak acceptor. Moreover, all substituted ureas tested reduce the viscosity of the supramolecular polymer solutions, but the best <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> is obtained when two hydrogen bond acceptors are placed in the same relative position as for the monomer and when no hydrogen bond donor is present...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Li-ion {{battery is}} used widely in many {{industrial}} areas, and formation {{is a necessary}} process in battery manufacture. After formation, the performance of Li-ion power batteries can be activated. In the process of production, the key technology in the formation has been changed. The technology of formation and holding independently for each battery is turning into the formation after being clamped and then holding now. Therefore, {{the design of the}} automatic production line must base on the battery groups after being clamped. This text will introduce a new production line for the formation of Li-ion battery, mainly discuss the formation of clamped batteries, and how to realize the automation of the production line. The line uses the three-dimensional multi-layer frameworks, speed-fold <b>chains</b> and <b>stoppers.</b> The speed-fold <b>chain</b> is a new type of conveyor chain, and known as "flexible manufacturing unit".

40|$|International audienceData {{related to}} the {{comparison}} of the mechanical properties of the different stoppers used in the wine industry are scarce. This study aims at comparing the effect of hydration (from 0 to 100 % relative humidity at 25 A degrees C) on the mechanical properties of four widely used types of stoppers: natural corks, agglomerated corks, technical stoppers and synthetic (co-extruded) stoppers. For both natural and agglomerated corks, the Young's modulus was significantly and similarly affected by hydration, with a constant plateau value up to 50 % relative humidity (RH) and a mean value around 22 and 14 MPa, respectively. For higher RH, the increase in water content leads to {{a decrease in the}} material rigidity (Young's modulus < 10 MPa), which is attributed to water clusters formation between polymer <b>chains.</b> Technical <b>stoppers</b> revealed a similar profile, but with a much smaller impact of the water content and with overall lower Young's moduli values, around 5 MPa, throughout the RH range. The stiffness of synthetic closures was not affected by hydration, in agreement with the hydrophobic behavior of polyethylene. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis allowed us to identify a glass transition temperature (T (g)) in cork (around 0 A degrees C), and another one in agglomerated cork and technical stoppers (close to - 45 A degrees C, corresponding to additives). All together, {{for the first time the}} data highlight the comparative mechanical properties of such materials of the wine industry, and the progressive loss of the "cork-like" behavior of cork composites when other components are mixed with cork...|$|R

The well-known copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition between azide functions placed {{at the ends of}} the polyether <b>chains</b> and alkyne-bearing <b>stopper</b> precursors was employed during the final kinetically controlled template-directed synthesis of the five oligorotaxanes, which were characterized subsequently by ^ 1 H NMR spectroscopy at low temperature (233 K) in deuterated acetonitrile. The secondary structures, as well as the conformations, of the five oligorotaxanes were unraveled by spectroscopic comparison with the dumbbell and ring components. By focusing attention on the changes in chemical shifts of some key probe protons, obtained {{from a wide range of}} low-temperature spectra, a picture emerges of a high degree of folding within the thread protons of the dumbbells of four of the five oligorotaxanes—the fifth oligorotaxane represents a control compound in effect— brought about by a combination of C-H···O and π–π stacking interactions between the p-electron-deficient bipyridinium units in the rings and the π-electron-rich 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene units and polyether chains in the dumbbells.

40|$|Trans-b-nitrostyrene (b-NS) {{is used as}} <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> in styrene type {{polymerization}} reactions. Interestingly, NS displays promising anti-tumour potential, due to its profound pro-apoptotic properties. We {{have previously}} demonstrated that b-NS-triggered formation of DNA strand breaks (SBs), particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs), participates in apoptosis induction. DSB-formation, as determined in the neutral comet-assay, was {{comparable to that of}} the topoisomerase II (TopoII) poison etoposide. Therefore, we investigated whether b-NS-induced DNA-damage is also based on inhibition of the breakage-resealing process of TopoII action. b-NS, in contrast to ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), induced no DNA-damage in an acellular comet-assay, indeed pointing to an enzyme-linked process of DNA-breakage.

40|$|The linear {{viscoelasticity}} {{of solutions}} of a hydrogen bonded reversible supramolecular polymer {{in the presence}} of a <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> was studied by rheometry and by dynamic light scattering using probe particles. The use of chain stoppers enabled the independent variation of the degree of polymerisation and the monomer concentration, and the effect of both parameters on rheology was investigated. Scaling exponents were obtained for the chain length and concentration dependence of the zero-shear viscosity and the terminal relaxation time, and these were compared to theoretical values. The results indicate that the reversible supramolecular polymer is semiflexible, and that both breaking and reptation of chains contribute to the stress relaxation. The parameters from macroscopic rheometry were compared to microscopic values obtained from probe particle diffusion. The particles probe the macroscopic viscoelastic parameters if their size is large compared to the correlation length in the system and to the (persistence) length of the polymer chains...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} an organocatalytic {{system in which}} buffering of the molecular catalyst by supramolecular interactions results in a robust system displaying concentration-independent catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate the design principles of the supramolecular buffering by ring-chain competition using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Our analysis shows that supramolecular buffering of a molecule is caused by its participation as a <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> in supramolecular ring-chain equilibria and we reveal here the influence of various thermodynamic parameters. Model predictions based on independently measured equilibrium constants corroborate experimental data of several molecular systems in which buffering occurs via competition between cyclization, growth of linear chains and end-capping by the chain-stopper. Our analysis reveals that the effective molarity is the critical parameter in optimizing the broadness of the concentration regime in which supramolecular ring-chain buffering occurs {{as well as the}} maximum concentration of the buffered molecule. To conclude, a side-by-side comparison of supramolecular ring-chain buffering, pH buffering and molecular titration is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of chain stoppers to solutions of hydrogen-bonded reversible supramolecular polymers was studied by vapor pressure osmometry and static and dynamic light scattering. Vapor pressure osmometry showed that {{within the range of}} concentrations studied the average degree of polymerization is independent of the overall monomer concentration and roughly inversely proportional to the mole fraction of chain stoppers, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The correlation length as measured by static light scattering has a maximum at the overlap concentration in solutions without chain stoppers. In the presence of a fixed fraction of chain stoppers, the results coincide with those without chain stoppers at low and high concentrations, but there is a plateau in the correlation length at intermediate concentrations. From the data, information about the association constant and the persistence length of the chains is obtained. The effectiveness of the <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> is discussed, and the results from osmometry and static light scattering are compared. Dynamic light scattering was used to measure the time autocorrelation function. From the characteristic decay time, the hydrodynamic correlation length was calculated. For solutions above the overlap concentration, the distribution of decay times showed a second peak at longer times. It is not yet fully understood what the mechanism behind this slow mode i...|$|E
40|$|The BSR (Buoy for Supporting Risers) {{concept is}} {{composed}} by a submerged buoy {{anchored to the}} sea bottom by tethers and intended to support risers coming from the bottom (probably SCRs – Steel Catenary Risers) {{and going to the}} floating platform (probably with flexible jumpers). For the case under analysis here, the main dimensions of the BSR prototype are 27. 2 m length x 27. 2 m width x 5. 0 m depth. The paper describes all final full scale installation step so that the BSR may be considered a suitable technology. The installation indeed was the great challenge of this design due the size of the hull. The present work also evaluates numerically and experimentally a specific new manner to install the BSR with the support of auxiliary mooring lines among with the four tethers connected to it. One of the installation premises was to make use of Anchor Handling Supply Vessels instead of Crane Vessels. After this numerical analysis, the work went on by performing model tests that simulates the operation in a deep water model basin using 1 : 40 scale. The model test anticipated several problems such as the <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> weakness in the operation and others as discussed in this paper.

40|$|Beta-Nitrostyrene (NS) {{is used as}} <b>chain</b> <b>stopper</b> in styrene type {{polymerization}} reactions for plastics, rubber, and resins production. In addition, NS possesses antifungal, antibacterial and insecticidal activities. NS also {{displays a}} promising anti-tumour potential, due to its profound pro-apoptotic properties, but there exist only limited and conflicting data on genotoxicity. In the present study, we demonstrated concentration-dependent DNA-damage in HL 60 -leukaemia and L 5178 YTK+/- mouse-lymphoma cells by NS treatment (5 - 25 µM) in the alkaline comet-assay. L 5178 YTK+/- cells were more and human lymphocytes less sensitive to NS treatment than HL 60 -cells. Increase in mean tail moment (over 10 -fold at 25 µM in HL 60 -cells) was already maximal after 30 min and correlated well with cytotoxicity and the pro-apoptotic effect of NS. To further investigate mechanisms involved in NS-triggered DNA-damage, we performed neutral comet-assays, indicating the involvement of double strand breaks. Interestingly, the NS derivative 2 -dinitrostyrene displayed a more pronounced potency for both DNA-damage and apoptosis induction. This was perhaps due to a more pronounced generation of reactive nitrogen species, measured in GH 3 cells by dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation and nitrite generation. Furthermore, cells incubated with NS and aphidicolin as nucleotide excision repair inhibitor, exhibited increased mean tail moments compared to cells exposed to NS without aphidicolin. Thus, NS also seemed to possess alkylating properties, leading to repair-dependent strand break detection in the comet-assay. L 5178 YTK+/- cells, pre-incubated for 24 h with L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine to deplete glutathione, displayed significantly enhanced DNA-damage {{in the presence of}} NS, being in line with a decreased pro-apoptotic effect of NS in N-acetylcysteine pre-incubated GH 3 cells. Thus, NS toxicity was dependent on cellular GSH content, suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species in NS-caused DNA-damage, a mechanism also known for nitroaromatic compounds. In conclusion, the strong clastogenic potential of NS in isolated cells seemed to involve different mechanisms of DNA-damage, which have to be further investigated...|$|E
