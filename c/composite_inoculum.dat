All calves developed severe enteric colibacillosis. When they were 4 days old stunting and fusion of villi {{were seen in}} the distal half of the small intestine and were associated with adhesion of the challenge organism to the mucosa. Two uninfected control calves kept under similar conditions, did not develop diarrhoea and had no lesions. It is generally recognised that distinct septicaemic and enteric forms of colibac-illosis can occur naturally in neonatal calves [12]. Although colisepticaemia has been reproduced experimentally [5, 131 the enteric form has been difficult t o reproduce. Colostrum-deprived calves often die from terminal septicaemia [7] whereas colostrum-fed calves often d o not develop diarrhoea [14]. Thus, the pathology of enteric colibacillosis is poorly documented. Some authors stress that the intestine of diarrhoeic calves is often histologically normal [l], whilst another has stated {{that there may be}} haemorrhagic enteritis [l l]. This author, however, used a <b>composite</b> <b>inoculum</b> containing both septicaemic and enteropathogeni...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{addition}} of an indigenous mycorrhizal complex, coming from soils of Gouré and of Glomus intraradices in a non sterile culture substrate were assessed on five woody species, among which 3 acacias (A. nilotica, A. raddiana, A. senegal), Bauhinia rufescens and Prosopis chilensis, in a tree nursery and on a sand dune of Gouré. In the nursery, species underwent a water stress by interrupting the watering during six days. Foliar hydration has been determined in order to evaluate the respective effects of the mycorrhizal inoculation for water loss limitation. Mycorrhizal root colonization has been determined as well as plant height and total biomass. In a field experiment, inoculated and non inoculated species have been planted on a mechanically prefixed sand dune portion in order to evaluate the effects of mycorrhizal inoculations on growth in the field. Results in nursery showed that (i) the non sterile soil would contain some endogenous AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) as infectious as those in soils with mycorrhizal additions; (ii) addition of Glomus intraradices would be efficient to stimulate total biomass and (iii) natural mycorhization would be as efficient as both mycorrhizal addition for growth stimulation and water loss limitation by transpiration. Results on site confirm the comparable effectiveness of the natural mycorhization and mycorrhizal additions. Although {{the addition}} of G. intraradices appears to be slightly superior by some aspects on some species, the observed effects do not justify preferring it, when compared to indigenous <b>composite</b> <b>inoculum</b> or to natural mycorhization in this zone.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the role of cellular recombination and positioning in the emergence of biofilm communities. This involved monitoring a biofilm community cultivated in a flow cell and subjected to cyclic environmental transitions from labile to refractory substrates. Laser microscopy of flow cells revealed that transitions from labile to refractory substrates resulted in a decrease in the thickness and percent area coverage of the biofilm communities. Repeated inoculation of flow cell communities with a <b>composite</b> <b>inoculum</b> resulted in {{an increase in the number}} and diversity of emigrants as well as greater thickness and area coverage of the biofilms than when the communities were inoculated only at the beginning of the experiment. This suggested that juxtapositioning through organismal recombination enhanced the growth of biofilm communities subjected to environmental stresses. Repeated environmental cycling also enhanced the growth of biofilm communities, suggesting that the functionality of cellular positioning may have accrued from one cycle to another, representing a form of heritable community-level information. Patterns of emigration that emerged during adaptation of biofilm communities to substrate transitions showed the appearance and disappearance of discrete sets of organisms. In addition, when biofilm communities cultivated using tryptic soy broth (TSB) were plated on benzoate-containing agar, higher plating efficiencies were detected at lower dilutions. This was concomitant with the formation of satellite colonies around primary colonies of benzoate-resistant bacteria. Plating assays and radiolabeled-benzoate mineralization experiments revealed that efficient benzoate degradation by the primary colonies protected the satellite strains against inhibitory concentrations of sodium benzoate. This protection also occurred during batch and flow cell cultivation. When a microbial community derived from a pristine soil environment was subjected to a substrate shift from TSB to benzoate, inclusion of a benzoate-degrading strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (BD 1) enhanced community stability. This suggested that bacteria may respond to environmental stresses as sets of spatially-related organisms as opposed to functioning exclusively as individuals. The emergence of protective synergisms also suggests that strategies based on association between microorganisms should be a consideration in food preservation, human health as well as in biodegradation...|$|E
