40|$|GaAs {{epitaxial}} layers {{with low}} electron concentrations {{were obtained from}} an alkylgall ium and arsine system by use of triethylgall ium. The high-est Hall mobihty of <b>the</b> layer, <b>with</b> an electron concentration f 7. 0 • 1013 /cm 8 at 77 ~ was 120, 000 cmz/V sec. Carrier concentration and carrier type of the layer could be changed {{in the range of}} from 1012 to, ~ 1016 /cm 3 by changing the arsine to triethyl gallium mole ratio introduced into a deposition zone. This fact was expected to be due to the amphoteric impurity sharing between the arsenic and the gallium sites of GaAs crystal. Although the extension of carrier concentration to the lower range resulted from impurity compensation, mobility data of the layers of electron concen-trations higher than about 1014 /cm 3 were almost the same as those from the usual AsCJ~-Ga-H 2 system. Dominant acceptor impurities observed in the photolummescence m asurements were discussed and were correlated with amphoteric silicon and carbon impurities.

40|$|Past {{research}} examining {{the effect of}} self-construal on persuasion has shown that advertising appeals that are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> consumers' chronically accessible (chronic) self-construal as well as appeals that are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> temporarily accessible (latent) self-construal are both persuasive. In two studies, we identify brand commitment as a moderating variable that determines the effectiveness of appeals <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consumers' chronic or latent self-construal. Under high commitment, appeals <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chronic self-construal were more effective. In contrast, under low commitment, appeals <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> primed (independent or interdependent) self-construal were more effective. These findings were robust across independent and interdependent self-construal contexts. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
