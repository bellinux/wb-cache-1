40|$|Due to grave {{potential}} human, {{environmental and}} economical consequences of <b>collisions</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance {{has become an}} important safety concern in navigation. To {{reduce the risk of}} <b>collisions</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> appropriate <b>collision</b> avoidance actions need to be taken in accordance with the regulations, i. e., International Regulations for Preventing <b>Collisions</b> <b>at</b> <b>Sea.</b> However, the regulations only provide qualitative rules and guidelines, and therefore it requires navigators to decide on collision avoidance actions quantitatively by using their judgments which often leads to making errors in navigation. To better help navigators in collision avoidance, this paper develops a comprehensive collision avoidance decision making model for providing whether a collision avoidance action is required, when to take action and what action to be taken. The model is developed based on three types of collision avoidance actions, such as course change only, speed change only, and a combination of both. The model has potential to reduce the chance of making human error in navigation by assisting navigators in decision making on collision avoidance actions...|$|R
