5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

500|$|Researchers of {{mathematics}} {{education at the}} University of Michigan have included the true-or-false prompt [...] "0 is an even number" [...] in a database of over 250 questions designed to measure teachers' <b>content</b> <b>knowledge.</b> For them, the question exemplifies [...] "common knowledge ... that any well-educated adult should have", and it is [...] "ideologically neutral" [...] in that the answer does not vary between traditional and reform mathematics. In a 2000–2004 study of 700 primary teachers in the United States, overall performance on these questions significantly predicted improvements in students' standardized test scores after taking the teachers' classes. In a more in-depth 2008study, the researchers found a school where all of the teachers thought that zero was neither odd nor even, including one teacher who was exemplary by all other measures. The misconception had been spread by a math coach in their building.|$|E
2500|$|Pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> is {{understood}} as the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater {{to the needs of}} their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> operates in reference to a specific knowledge domain, we can turn to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> can be considered a “developmental construct” [...] initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [...] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language [...] that include {{but are not limited to}} syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [...] subject area” [...] these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. [...] The two main aspects of pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps [...] as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.|$|E

This process is a specific way of expressing their design learning process, within the curriculum {{in which they are}} interacting.

Sustainable development (SD) should be treated as a priority in the specific Technological Pedagogical <b>Contents</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (TPACK) research, since SD is a technical and social issue. In this paper we study the methods used in two Masters of Arts courses to teach SD. The design students' statements are psychologically and semiotically analysed. Examination of the students' verbal and non-verbal utterances or iconic and non-iconic signs show hesitant, diverse and weak-structured statements. Numerous indecisions emphasize their contradictory conceptions of SD. The lack of SD specifications in the syllabi opens a wide space of discursive perceptivity, in which students build their own design idiolect. They acquire design skills and abilities challenging the design PCK. In this way, we can use these skills and the students' understanding of SD to develop the TPACK. In comparison to previous studies on SD learning, this paper emphasizes the need for combining these approaches to structure 'design didactics'...|$|R
2500|$|Education theorist Bill Ayers has {{commented on}} the {{limitations}} of the standardized test, writing that [...] "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, <b>content</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning." [...] In his book, The Shame of the Nation, Jonathan Kozol argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of [...] "cognitive decapitation." [...] Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideas of}} {{democracy}} and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey {{makes a strong case}} for the importance of education not only as a place to gain <b>content</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that [...] "to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities" [...] (My pedagogic creed, Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that [...] "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity {{on the basis of this}} social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".|$|E
