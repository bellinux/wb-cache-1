40|$|Painful {{legs and}} moving toes (PLMT) {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} characterized by spontaneous neuropathic pain and peculiar involuntary movements in the lower limbs, especially the toes and feet. As it is a relatively rare disorder worldwide, the exact pathophysiology still remains a mystery. Until recently, numerous methods of <b>clinical</b> <b>treatments</b> have been tried; however, the success rate of the therapies is still very low. Here, we report a case of PLMT and also summarize the recent clinical and research literatures regarding clinical presentation, electrophysiological features, etiology, treatment methods, and prognosis of this disorder. Doctors {{should be aware of}} this rare syndrome in a patient with painful and/or restless legs. On the other hand, multiple <b>clinical</b> <b>treatments</b> should be tried, even those which usually produce a poor outcome...|$|R

25|$|The TCAs show {{efficacy}} in the <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{a number}} of different types of chronic pain, notably neuralgia or neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. The precise mechanism of action in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the opioid system in the brain downstream via serotonergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation, among other properties. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, though not in the instant relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches.|$|E

25|$|A 1967 study where a judge {{randomly}} assigned (ordered) offenders to either <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment,</b> AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group. After one year 68% {{in the clinic}} group were rearrested, 69% in the AA group were rearrested, and 56% were rearrested in the group receiving no treatment. No {{statistically significant differences between}} the three groups were discovered in recidivism rate, in the number of subsequent rearrests or in time elapsed prior to rearrest. Like the Brandsma study, the results are inaccurate since the studies did not stop people not assigned to AA treatment from going to AA meetings.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin {{combination}} chemotherapy is {{the cornerstone}} of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. Oxaliplatin is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{were used}} in the past in the <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> of ADHD, though they are not {{typically}} used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin, Attentin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} the TCAs {{were the first}} choice for {{pharmacological}} treatment of clinical depression. Although they are still considered to be highly effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI moclobemide. However, tricyclic antidepressants are possibly more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants {{are thought to have}} fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> and potentially lethal overdose (see therapeutic index) are far wider in comparison.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are used}} {{primarily}} in the <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used {{in the treatment of}} a number of other medical disorders, including anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), Neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, trichotillomania, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial cystitis (IC), nocturnal enuresis (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|A nerve {{guidance}} conduit (also {{referred to}} as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, {{as opposed to an}} autograft) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries. When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.|$|E
30|$|As an {{immediate}} {{consequence of the}} increased diagnosis of this neoplasia, a great therapeutic arsenal has been used, which includes surgical, radiotherapeutic and <b>clinical</b> <b>treatments</b> (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, among others) (Ewertz & Jensen 2011).

50|$|The {{definition}} of telemedicine is somewhat controversial.

25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At {{the end of the}} 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol, and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period. Vaillant noted that <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E
500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} currently the most effective <b>clinical</b> <b>treatment</b> for psychostimulant addictions. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.There is accelerating evidence that physical exercise is a useful treatment for preventing and reducing drug addiction... In some individuals, exercise has its own rewarding effects, and a behavioral economic interaction may occur, such that physical and social rewards of exercise can substitute for the rewarding effects of drug abuse.... The value of this form of treatment for drug addiction in laboratory animals and humans is that exercise, if it can substitute for the rewarding effects of drugs, could be self-maintained {{over an extended period}} of time. Work to date in [...] regarding exercise as a treatment for drug addiction supports this hypothesis.... Animal and human research on physical exercise as a treatment for stimulant addiction indicates that this is one of the most promising treatments on the horizon.}} In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. [...] One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or [...] immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.|$|E
