40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{modification of}} peat through thermal and oxidation processes was carried out, {{in order to}} obtain new, inexpensive and active material for purification of different types of waters. During the modification, surface chemical compounds of Shilov type were formed. Batch adsorption properties and suitability of physicochemically modified peat (PCMP) for odor removal were tested in aqueous solutions of H 2 S and <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Additionally, PCMP was tested in the removal of As(V) which is hazardous ingredient in contaminated waters. Possible mechanisms of pollutants binding include interactions, which lead to formation of adducts and clathrates. All these processes are elucidated in detail. The results showed that the obtained material can be used for the removal of sulphide, <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> and As(V) from different types of waters.

40|$|Science and {{technology}} has advanced to such {{extent that the}} size of devices and machines used for making daily work easy has reduced greatly. As such, fabrication of devices on planar surfaces is catching more attention and traditional methods have become obsolete. Fabrication at small-scale has been made easier and inexpensive by the use of a relatively novel technique called self-assembly. The present work is divided into two parts: formation of fractal self-assembly patterns from <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> in acidic medium, and from sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa) in alkaline medium. When droplets of colloidal suspensions are evaporated, a dense ring-like deposition is formed; a phenomenon known as coffee-ring effect. Since it takes place by the outward flow within the drop and an overall evaporative flux which causes circulation towards the centre of drop, a coffee-ring like structure is formed. According to theory, by varying the particle concentration and the alkali used, the structure morphology can be varied. In this work, formation of self-assembled structures from <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> particles and polyelectrolyte chains of CMCNa by drying of microliter-sized droplets on glass surface has been investigated by optical microscopy. Results of this work show that tree-like branched structures are formed after evaporation of drops of the reaction mixture. Various factors influence the structure formation, such as particle concentration, alkali concentration, pH of the solution, drop volume, reaction and drying temperatures, and drying time. Different alkali and acid concentrations when used for the reaction bring about change in morphology of the structures in the reaction mixture...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{separation}} and quantitative determination of aromatic amines frequently used {{in the manufacture of}} sulfur dyes by gas chromatography and liquid ehromategraphy with ultraviolet detection at 260 nm. Sensitives is approximately the same in both methods. The actual amount of free amines is examined in 14 sulfur dyes by gas chromatography without previous treatment of the specimens as the the ether extraction gives lower values. Results found are considered to be very satisfactory. ¿The determination of amines by liquid chromatography implies pre-acid treatments to samples to precipitate the dye and to set a pre-column in order to prevent the deterioration of the chromatography column by the <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: Alcoholics {{are more}} likely to have infections, mainly in the {{respiratory}} system. Alcohol seems to inhibit the immune system. Despite the extensive literature related to alcoholism, data related to the immune system are still not conclusive. The objective of this study was to verify the influence of acute alcohol intake on colloid distribution in the organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Methods: Thirteen male Swiss mice were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 5) – control, and Group 2 (n = 8) – animals that received 0. 5 ml ethanol 50 %, 30 minutes before the experiment. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> labeled with 99 Tcm was used to evaluate colloid distribution in the liver, spleen and lungs. Colloid clearance was assessed as well. Gamma camara was used to measure the radioactivity of these organs and of a blood clot. Rresults: No difference was found in the presence of colloid in the organs of both groups. The liver showed the highest phagocytic function, followed by the spleen and lungs (p = 0. 021 for Group 1 and p = 0. 003 for Group 2). A minimum amount of radiation remained in the blood in both groups. Cconclusions: According to the experiential conditions of this work, acute intake of alcohol did not interfere with the phagocytic function of the mononuclear phagocyte system in mice...|$|E
40|$|Coastal waters support {{approximately}} 90 {{per cent}} of global fisheries {{and are therefore}} an important food reserve for our planet. Eutrophication of these waters, due to human activity, leads to severe oxygen depletion and the episodic occurrence of hydrogen sulphide-toxic to multi-cellular life-with disastrous consequences for coastal ecosytems. Here we show that an area of approximately 7, 000 km(2) of African shelf, covered by sulphidic water, was detoxified by blooming bacteria that oxidized the biologically harmful sulphide to environmentally harmless <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> and sulphate. Combined chemical analyses, stoichiometric modelling, isotopic incubations, comparative 16 S ribosomal RNA, functional gene sequence analyses and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} indicate that the detoxification proceeded by chemolithotrophic oxidation of sulphide with nitrate and was mainly catalysed by two discrete populations of gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Chemolithotrophic bacteria, accounting for approximately 20 per cent of the bacterioplankton in sulphidic waters, created a buffer zone between the toxic sulphidic subsurface waters and the oxic surface waters, where fish and other nekton live. This {{is the first time that}} large-scale detoxification of sulphidic waters by chemolithotrophs has been observed in an open-ocean system. The data suggest that sulphide can be completely consumed by bacteria in the subsurface waters and, thus, can be overlooked by remote sensing or monitoring of shallow coastal waters. Consequently, sulphidic bottom waters on continental shelves may be more common than previously believed, and could therefore have an important but as yet neglected effect on benthic communities...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) was {{commissioned}} by the Senate Department of Urban Development, Berlin, {{to carry out the}} investigations regarding the mass balance of the sulphur containing components of three selected groundwater samples from an industrial contaminated site in Berlin. The soil and groundwater contamination was caused by chemical waste of the former industrial site. The information on content of different organically bound sulphur compounds, <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> and dissolved sulphides is of great importance for the layout and dimensioning of groundwater cleaning plants (active carbon, catalyst). It was therefore decided to carry out investigations {{in order to be able}} to estimate the mass balance of sulphur content of ground water from three different sampling points, which represent the typical specific contamination prior to the process of calling tender for the cleaning of groundwater. Within the frame of this investigation - both the group parameters as total sulphur content, purgeable and adsorbable organically bound sulphur (POS, AOS) and extractable high and semi-volatile organic sulphur compounds as well as the main organic individual sulphur contaminants are to be determined after identification with GC-MS and GC-AED. Our approach for the estimation of sulphur mass balance together with the applied procedures and methods are described in this report. The results achieved are then discussed, compared, evaluated and checked for plausibility and correctness. (orig.)

The enrichment cultures performed in a gas-lift bioreactor were inoculated with a black smoker chimney sample collected on TAG site on the mid-Atlantic ridge. To mimic {{as close as possible}} environmental conditions, the cultures were performed in oligotrophic medium with nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide (N(2) /H(2) /CO(2)) gas sweeping. Also, the temperature was first settled at a temperature of 85 degrees C and <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> was added. Then, the temperature was lowered to 60 degrees C and sulphur was omitted. Archaeal and bacterial diversity was studied in both culture and natural samples. Through 16 S rRNA gene sequences analysis of the enrichment cultures microorganisms affiliated to Archeoglobales, Thermococcales were detected in both conditions while, Deferribacterales and Thermales were detected only at 65 degrees C in the absence of sulphur. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism and quantitative PCR permit to study the microbial community dynamic during the two enrichment cultures. The effect of environmental changes (modification of culture conditions), i. e. temperature, medium composition, electron donors and acceptors availability were shown to affect the microbial community in culture, as this would happen in their environment.

40|$|SUMMARY: Bordelella {{pertussis}} incubated {{in liquid}} media is prevented from multi-plying by autoclaved cysteine and is rapidly killed by another substance, possibly a peroxide. The inhibition by autoclaved cysteine is overcome by serum albumin and the inhibition by ‘peroxide ’ is overcome by red blood corpuscles, haemin, or ferrous sulphate sterilized by filtration. In a medium containing casein hydrolysate and yeast extract, logarithmic growth may continue for a 5 0 hr. a t one rate and then may {{change to a}} slower rate which continues for a further 20 - 30 hr. before growth stops. The initial growth rate can be maintained throughout by adding high con-centrations of whole blood. The yield of organisms {{is proportional to the}} concentra-tion of glutamic acid up to 0. 3 yo (w/v). It is possible that growth at greater concen-trations is stopped by the high pH value caused by the oxidation of glutamate. Omission of casein hydrolysate decreases the yield of bacteria. A larger yield is obtained by the use of a large inoculum of bacteria with adherent blood. Until 1939, Bordetella pertussis could not be grown in liquid media unless blood or tissue extracts were added. In that year Hornibrook (1939) obtained growth in a casein hydrolysate medium containing starch and cysteine. Small inocula would not grow in this medium, and in the modified medium introduced by Cohen & Wheeler (1946) the organism did not grow unless the initial inoculum was more than 106 bacteria/ml. of medium. Cultures have been grown from 1000 or fewer organisms/ml. in casein hydrolysate previously treated with charcoal and fat solvents (Fisher, 1948) or with charcoal a t different pH values (Jebb & Tomlinson, 1955). Proom (1955) showed that <b>colloidal</b> <b>sulphur</b> and sulphides and heated cysteine are important inhibitors of the growth of B. pertussis and when steps are taken to exclude these corn-pounds small inocula will grow in Cohen & Wheeler’s medium (see Rowatt...|$|E
