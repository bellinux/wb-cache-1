40|$|Objective: Developing country clinicians {{are aware}} of the {{discourse}} of evidence-based medicine but heavily constrained in their ability to access and apply new knowledge. This study aimed to obtain primary descriptive data about access to and application of reproductive health-related medical knowledge in developing countries. Design: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Setting: India and Yemen. Sample: Forty-one doctors working in obstetrics, gynaecology, general practice and family planning services. Methods: Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. A theory-driven approach was conducted to carry out thematic analysis. Results: Doctors felt the need to update their knowledge but this was not always achieved due to time and financial constraints. Alternative knowledge sources were described including the Internet, scientific meetings, medical family networks and speciality medical societies but access to these was limited by the expense of equipment, unfamiliarity with the technology and restricted advertisement of scientific meetings and conferences. Institutional hierarchy and <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> were identified as barriers to change. Demoralisation was a common obstacle. On the positive side, involvement in medical education was a powerful driver for seeking new knowledge and applying research evidence to clinical practice. Conclusions: Priorities are to identify needs specific to different countries and medical settings in the developing world, access for all to full text journals and educational activities that fully engage practitioners {{in the early stages of}} their careers. Clinical teachers are the nodal group with the strongest incentive to obtain and use new knowledge...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} a {{comparative}} {{reading of the}} plays True West (premiered in 1980) and Welcome to the Blue Hell (premiered in 1994) {{is based on the}} analysis of the topoi of revolt and exile as structural centres of the plays. This approach is interesting because of the temporal (the 1980 s and the 1990 s) and poetical (transition, dysfunctional family, symbolic value of popular culture) proximity and cultural diversity. Similarity between the two plays is evident in the lack, or reduction, of the traditional dramatic plot as demonstrated by Souriau’s system of dramatic forces. The topos of exile is primarily observed through comparing the places where the plays are set [...] family homes in the suburbs, symbolic places detached from "cultural (urban) centres", with all the related stereotypes and standard features. The same topos is then examined through characters’ standpoints: psychological escapism into the past (the childhood in True West, socialism and pre-war era in Welcome to the Blue Hell), into the future (contemplating departing to desert in True West), or into the alternative present (Hollywood show business in True West, being unable to go to the football match in Welcome to the Blue Hell). Psychological and cultural exile raises the question of the meaning of “the true West” for the characters. For Saul, a producer, it might be the Hollywood pop culture; for Austin, the American dream and striving for success achieved through hard work; for Lee, complete freedom; for their father, living isolated in the desert. Welcome to the Blue Hell focuses on the topos of rebellion as resistance to the dominant consumer culture, as well as ideological and cultural <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> living under the same roof, all being presented on stage through sports fan counterculture in their everyday life – in front of the TV set which broadcasts the football match between Dinamo and Hajduk...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question of to what extent growing numbers of older {{people who might have}} similar preferences regarding public intergenerational transfers (family and pension policies) will limit the scope of future social policy reforms in Germany. We are interested in to what extent the shift in the country's demography will trigger a so-called "gerontocracy. " As a theoretical framework, we combine Mannheim's concept of political generations with a demographic life-course approach. According to Mannheim, growing numbers of a societal group, combine with unified preferences within the group, enhance the group's political power. To empirically test this hypothesis, we use three analytical steps: First, we analyse the future age composition of the German population, including familial characteristics, using a micro-simulation approach. The results suggest that the number of older people will grow substantially over the coming decades, particularly the share of older people who will remain childless and who will not be married. Second, we analyse preferences regarding redistributive social policies according to age, parity, and marital status, based on recent survey data. Generalised Linear Models and Generalised Additive Models are applied to examine what the effects of fdemographic indicators are on these preferences. Results show that older people are less in favour of transfers ot the younger generation than their younger counterparts. This is particularly true of childless interviewees. Third, we explore {{the extent to which these}} developments are likely to have an impact on the political sphere. How do policy makers perceive ageing and the preferences structures found? How do elderly interest groups define their roles in light of these results? In-depth interviews with these stakeholders provide a mixed picture: whereas most interviewees are convinced that older people have gained more power due to their bigger population share, there is little awareness of differences in policy preferences between various demographic groups. The biggest challenge for social policy makers is, therefore, to find ways to mediate between these two interesrs. if they fail to do so, a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> might become a realistic scenario for Germany...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the issue of {{theoretical}} and methodological principles and key provisions of the discourse of gender inequality in feminine sociology. It has been stated by the author that the analysis of the ideological aspects of gender discourse, which appeared at the XXI century, is oriented to the search of contemporary gender ideology of egalitarianism and tolerance that would take root in the mentality of different societies. Analysis of ideas of different ideologies and cultures suggests that any ideology can only perform a positive function when {{it is based on the}} values of the culture. Otherwise it does not receive social support. The study of the ideological aspects of gender discourse in feminist sociology has shown that in the process of gender socialization man and woman should pass pre-ideological (before adulthood) and post-ideological stages. In such situation, gender orientation values are formed in several ways (legal, economic, religious), gender norms influence the assimilation and evaluation, and only subsequently change the gender behavior and gender acquiring competence. It has been stipulated in the article that the modern world is characterized by multivariate cultures and patterns of gender socialization. In feminist sociology it has been decided to allocate three basic types of gender ideologies and their corresponding patterns of gender socialization: a) patriarchal gender ideology and socialization, which are characterized by a lack of awareness, significant changes, a sense of continuity of life, self-mastery behaviors that meet all standards of culture; b) modernist gender ideology and socialization, characterized by such prevailing model of behavior as the adoption of new norms of behavior, activity and independence in women’s behavior, adults can learn from children, children try to develop their own style of behavior that is different from the behavior of their parents, <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations,</b> lots of social mobility; c) contemporary gender ideology and socialization, characterized by the fact that the future for both sexes is unpredictable and uncontrollable, the lack of understanding between parents and children; gender differences standards for parents and children.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} fictional character Kitty Pryde from the X-Men comic book series during {{the tenure of}} writer Chris Claremont. Claremont's work on the character primarily involves the years 1980 - 1990, though a return to writing the character in the 2000 s is also discussed when relevant. The thesis question revolves around {{the definition of the}} bildungsroman genre and whether Claremont's narrative arc for Kitty Pryde's character fulfills that definition. Jerome Hamilton Buckley's 1974 book Season of Youth: The Bildungsroman from Dickens to Golding is used as the primary authority for the bildungsroman genre, and more specifically a list of nine criteria that Buckley deems particularly key to the definition of the genre. Each of the nine criteria is looked at in depth, demonstrating where and how they {{can be found in the}} narrative, if at all. However, because Buckley's perspective and criteria come from a time of less diversity, examination from a feminist and minority perspective is also added with ideas from Rita Felski and Stella Bolaki. Combining Buckley's initial list of nine criteria with more modern criticism, these ideas are then used to analyze Kitty Pryde's narrative arc and to determine whether it can be seen as a bildungsroman. The findings support reading Claremont's narrative arc of the Kitty Pryde character as a bildungsroman. Three of Buckley's nine key themes are identified as particularly prevalent in the narrative: the search for a vocation, ordeal by love, and the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations.</b> Three more key themes are found to be less prevalent but still clearly present: the search for a working philosophy, the larger society, and alienation. Because Buckley's definition for the bildungsroman genre requires the presence of six of his nine key themes, the presence of the aforementioned six thus validate the reading of the narrative as a bildungsroman. The text also provides some suggestions for finding the three least applicable key themes within the narrative, but because their presence is not necessary to fulfill the definition of the bildungsroman, they are not rigorously examined. In addition to fulfilling Buckley's key themes, the paper also discusses the more modern minority-oriented views. It is shown how the narrative can be read in terms of a journey to diverge from norms, as per Felski's ideas of the unique qualities of the specifically female bildungsroman. As Kitty Pryde's narrative can be shown to conform to the bildungsroman ideas of both Buckley and Felski, the thesis question is thus answered positively: Chris Claremont's X-Men can indeed be read as Kitty Pryde's bildungsroman...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyses literary {{configurations of}} the relationship between the generations in German family histories after 1945. It starts with the presumption that quarreling with the unalterable family affiliation is at the core of the relation of the younger generation to their parents who were responsible for the crimes during the period of National Socialism. The younger generation, who would like to dissociate itself from their parents morally and politically, is captured by ambivalence. This ambivalence between affiliation and distance, between continuity and break, is at the center of this analysis. My research shows that German literature after 1945 creates an extremely creative space for the children and grandchildren of the perpetrators of National Socialism. They develop different strategies to cope with the tension between continuity and break in the generational relationship and try out various narrative forms. These strategies and narrative forms are analysed using selected German novels and narratives from the 1970 s until the beginning of the 21 st century. In addition to exploring the literary works, the different historical contexts and the corresponding commemorative cultures are also taken into account in order to find possible coherences between literary texts and sociohistoric conditions. First, the so far dominant interpretations of the so-called „Väterliteratur” (fathers’ literature) of the 1970 s and 80 s are questioned. A precise text analysis shows the heterogeneity of these texts when it comes to their position within the discourse about the relationship between the generations. The homogenity of these novels and stories as it has been insinuated by most research so far is only true for the basic subject-matter. The texts (by Sigfrid Gauch, Christoph Meckel, Ruth Rehmann and Brigitte Schwaiger) are rather examples of diverse individual strategies to translate ambivalence into aesthetic form. By focusing on the interdependence of literary production and sociopolitical contexts, the analysis includes a comparative exploration of both East and West German novels and narratives and thereby illustrates the significant correlation between literary patterns and sociopolitical constellations. It shows that the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>generations</b> in West Germany presumably caused anthropologically, is rather a result of historical circumstances. The examination of four East German texts (by Christa Wolf, Klaus Schlesinger and Monika Maron) demonstrates that the different sociopolitical background – the tabooization of perpetration – results in specific narrative forms. Finally the changes in commemorative culture and historiography after the fall of the Berlin Wall are explored: It is shown that the generational relationship remains a dominant reference framework in literature for revisiting German history of the 20 th century: In the so- called „Familienromane“ (family novels) (by Uwe Timm, Stephan Wackwitz and Dagmar Leupold) as well as in texts written by the third generation (Tanja Dückers and others) at the beginning of the 21 st century, the ambivalence between succession and dissociation, between continuity and break, stays virulent. While the basic conflict with regard to contents has largely remained unchanged, literary forms of dealing with ambivalence and the ways how these are expressed aesthetically in dependence on their commemorative and historical contexts have transformed significantly. In addition to approaches that try to resolve the ambivalence between continuity and break in favor of one of the two, more and more narrative strategies that face the inevitable tension can be found. They cope with ambivalence without trying to resolve it...|$|E

40|$|W. G. Sebald {{is widely}} {{perceived}} as a literary phenomenon, and critics assert the uniqueness of his prose fiction, and {{its position in the}} context of post-war German literature. In this study, I challenge the widely-held view that the narrative prose of W. G.

Exploration of Sebald’s prose fiction within a generational paradigm reveals significant connections between his writing and the literary, social, and political preoccupations that define the earlier, ambivalent writing <b>of</b> his <b>generation.</b> My study challenges the widespread perception of Sebald’s uniqueness, as well as the tendency to mystification that exists in critical appreciation of Sebald’s writing. Situating Sebald in a generational context has significant implications for our reading of his work: it allows us to identify his narrative prose as a belated, intensified, and elaborately figurative confrontation with the inheritance that troubled his second-generation cohort. My readings show that Sebald’s narrative prose continues to reflect the ambivalence towards national identity and recent traumatic history that marks the <b>conflicted</b> writing <b>of</b> his <b>generation,</b> born during or shortly after the war, and expressed in the anti-authoritarian writing of the 1960 s, the intergenerational <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> the Väterliteratur, and the neo-Romantic writing of the 1980 s.

It will be, however, no easy task to carry out this kind of reform, because the reform requires a politically unacceptable step: to request those generations already receiving pensions and those who have paid pension premiums to accept reductions in the amount of pension that the government has pledged to pay. One possible means to deal with this problem is to withdraw the reserve funds, which are now over 100 trillion yen. However, withdrawal of the reserves would reduce the opportunity <b>of</b> future <b>generations</b> to use the funds and yields on investment of the funds. Any attempt to reform the pension system will cause <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interests between <b>generations.</b> This is why the government should positively disclose the outlook for its pension finance, mainly net pension liabilities, and information about intergenerational disparities to provide the public with data for objective discussions on a more desirable form of public pension. net pension liabilities, intergenerational equity...|$|R

50|$|The {{demand for}} {{presenting}} rural life reappeared, but such films were produced with the world-view <b>of</b> the new <b>generation.</b> Protagonists looked at peasant {{life as a}} thing of the past, and while they respected old morals, and were nostalgic, they were critical about not only the social relations of past decades, but the general helplessness of their predecessors, dismaying their submission and lack of revolt. Reckoning with the past, breaking with the lifestyle of the father were the themes of numerous movies of the decade (Oldás és kötés, Feldobott kő, Tízezer nap). Instead of the ballad-like, detailed rendering of country life, new directors used more stylized methods, signaling the standoff from the old ways. The theme <b>of</b> generational <b>conflict</b> appears in more light-hearted, entertaining forms {{in the second half of}} the decade, often in collaboration with popular pop-bands (Ezek a fiatalok, Szerelmes biciklisták). Directors from the old generation also dealt with themes that looked at the past, and while omitting the element <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> <b>generations,</b> they too explored the question of individual destiny and history, historical determination, and moral decisions in such cases (Párbeszéd, Húsz óra, Hideg napok), often utilizing modernistic tools like paralleling viewpoints and interpretations.|$|R
