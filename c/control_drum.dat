40|$|The {{strategy}} for qualifying a FSP system {{could have a}} significant programmatic impact. The US has not qualified a space fission power system since launch of the SNAP- 10 A in 1965. This paper explores cost-effective options for obtaining data that would be needed for flight qualification of a fission system. Qualification data could be obtained from both nuclear and non-nuclear testing. The ability to perform highly realistic nonnuclear testing has advanced significantly throughout the past four decades. Instrumented thermal simulators were developed during the 1970 s and 1980 s {{to assist in the}} development, operation, and assessment of terrestrial fission systems. Instrumented thermal simulators optimized for assisting in the development, operation, and assessment of modern FSP systems have been under development (and utilized) since 1998. These thermal simulators enable heat from fission to be closely mimicked (axial power profile, radial power profile, temperature, heat flux, etc.) and extensive data to be taken from the core region. For transient testing, pin power during a transient is calculated based on the reactivity feedback that would occur given measured values of test article temperature and/or dimensional changes. The reactivity feedback coefficients needed for the test are either calculated or measured using cold/warm zero-power criticals. In this way non-nuclear testing can be used to provide very realistic information related to nuclear operation. Non-nuclear testing can be used at all levels, including component, subsystem, and integrated system testing. FSP fuels and materials are typically chosen to ensure very high confidence in operation at design burnups, fluences, and temperatures. However, facilities exist (e. g. ATR, HFIR) for affordably performing in-pile fuel and materials irradiations, if such testing is desired. Ex-core materials and components (such as alternator materials, <b>control</b> <b>drum</b> drives, etc.) could be irradiated in university or DOE reactors to ensure adequate radiation resistance. Facilities also exist for performing warm and cold zero-power criticals...|$|E
40|$|Power is a {{critical}} consideration in planning exploration of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and places beyond. Nuclear power is an important option, especially for locations {{in the solar system}} where sunlight is limited or environmental conditions are challenging (e. g., extreme cold, dust storms). NASA and the Department of Energy are maintaining the option for fission surface power for the Moon and Mars by developing and demonstrating technology for a fission surface power system. The Fission Surface Power Systems project has focused on subscale component and subsystem demonstrations to address the feasibility of a low-risk, low-cost approach to space nuclear power for surface missions. Laboratory demonstrations of the liquid metal pump, reactor <b>control</b> <b>drum</b> drive, power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution technologies have validated that the fundamental characteristics and performance of these components and subsystems are consistent with a Fission Surface Power preliminary reference concept. In addition, subscale versions of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, using electric resistance heating in place of the reactor fuel, have been built and operated with liquid metal sodium-potassium and helium/xenon gas heat transfer loops, demonstrating the viability of establishing system-level performance and characteristics of fission surface power technologies without requiring a nuclear reactor. While some component and subsystem testing will continue through 2011 and beyond, the results to date provide sufficient confidence to proceed with system level technology readiness demonstration. To demonstrate the system level readiness of fission surface power in an operationally relevant environment (the primary goal of the Fission Surface Power Systems project), a full scale, 1 / 4 power Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is under development. The TDU will consist of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, a sodium-potassium heat transfer loop, a power conversion unit with electrical controls, and a heat rejection system with a multi-panel radiator assembly. Testing is planned at the Glenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 6 starting in 2012, with vacuum and liquid-nitrogen cold walls to provide simulation of operationally relevant environments. A nominal two-year test campaign is planned including a Phase 1 reactor simulator and power conversion test followed by a Phase 2 integrated system test with radiator panel heat rejection. The testing is expected to demonstrate the readiness and availability of fission surface power as a viable power system option for NASA's exploration needs. In addition to surface power, technology development work within this project is also directly applicable to in-space fission power and propulsion systems...|$|E

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{providing}} funding to the Department of Energy (DOE) to assess, develop, and test nuclear technologies {{that could provide}} surface power to a lunar outpost. Sufficient testing of this fission surface power (FSP) system {{will need to be}} completed to enable a decision by NASA for flight development. The near-term goal for the FSP work is to conduct the minimum amount of testing needed to validate the system performance within an acceptable risk. This report attempts to assess the current modeling capabilities and quantify any bias associated with the modeling methods for designing the nuclear reactor. The baseline FSP system is a sodium-potassium (NaK) cooled, fast spectrum reactor with 93 % 235 U enriched HEU-O 2 fuel, SS 316 cladding, and beryllium reflectors with B 4 C control drums. The FSP is to produce approximately 40 kWe net power with a lifetime of at least 8 years at full power. A flight-ready FSP is to be ready for launch and deployment by 2020. Existing benchmarks from the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Program (ICSBEP) were reviewed and modeled in MCNP. An average bias of less than 0. 6 % was determined using the ENDF/B-VII cross-section libraries except in the case of subcritical experiments, which exhibited an average bias of approximately 1. 5 %. The bias increases with increasing reflector worth of the beryllium. The uncertainties and sensitivities in cross section data for the FSP model and ZPPR- 20 configurations were assessed using TSUNAMI- 3 D. The cross-section covariance uncertainty in the FSP model was calculated as 2. 09 %, which was dominated by the uncertainty in the 235 U(n,?) reactions. Global integral indices were generated in TSUNAMI-IP using pre-release SCALE 6 cross-section covariance data. The ZPPR- 20 benchmark models exhibit strong similarity with the FSP model. A penalty assessment was performed to determine the degree of which the FSP model could not be characterized by available ZPPR- 20 benchmark data. The uncertainty in the FSP covariance data was reduced from 2. 09 % to 0. 29 %, where the bulk of the uncertainty was from the Be(n,n) reaction. Advanced analysis techniques using ZPPR- 20 C data should provide sufficient information to preclude the necessity of a cold critical of the FSP. Further testing to reduce uncertainties in the beryllium and uranium cross-section data should reduce the overall uncertainty in the computational models. The utilization of parameterization analysis software with perturbation techniques can help in understanding the computational uncertainty and relative systematic effects of parameters such as <b>control</b> <b>drum,</b> reflector, and material worth, temperature effects, and reaction rate measurements...|$|E

Reentry was studied by sequential {{use of an}} orbital trajectory and a heat analysis computer program. Two heating models were used. The first model assumed a thermal equilibrium condition between the stagnation point aerodynamic heating and the radiative cooling of the skin material surface. The second model allowed for infinite conductivity of the skin material. Four reentering configurations were studied representing stages of increased SP- 100 breakup: (1) radiator, shield and reactor, (2) shield and reactor, (3) reactor with <b>control</b> <b>drums,</b> and (4) reactor without <b>control</b> <b>drums.</b> Each reentering configuration was started from a circular orbit at 116 km having an inertial velocity near Mach 25.

Oxidation of the niobium skin material was calculated to cause an increase in surface temperature of less than ten percent. The concept of thermite analogs for enhancing reactor reentry dispersal was assessed and found to be feasible in principle. A conservative worst-case hazards analysis was performed for radioactive and nonradioactive toxic SP- 100 materials assumed to be dispersed during end-of-life reentry.
