40|$|Customs {{maritime}} surveillance {{history has been}} influenced by numerous reports that often identified the need for management changes or infrastructure changes. This thesis analyses {{the evolution of the}} Australian Customs Services 2 ̆ 7 role in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{maritime surveillance}} and border protection. The analysis framework is built around policy, financial and legal influences and developments. The thesis recommends implementing a comprehensive harmonized strategy for early detection and effective responses. This thesis argues that there are only two organisations capable of sustaining an effective maritime surveillance and enforcement capacity and they are the Australian Customs Service (Customs) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The suggestion that a single Australian <b>coastguard</b> <b>organisation</b> is another option is analysed in this thesis and discounted. The thesis looks at Customs evolution in maritime surveillance and border protection from pre-Federation to mid 2005 and forecasts some alternatives that could advance maritime surveillance and protection policy. This thesis is important because competing world priorities, including terrorism versus trade, in turn, can lead to rapid policy competition for government funding, which can lead to poor policy choices...|$|E

40|$|Where {{national}} boundaries allow, any {{country with a}} coastline {{has the right to}} enforce its maritime interest over a territorial zone up to 12 nm off shore and may patrol an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 200 Nm off shore. Countries with successful economies achieve this through <b>coastguard</b> <b>organisations</b> backed up by naval resources and huge defence budgets. However, some countries are restricted by their economies and are therefore constrained in the range of cover that they are able to provide. This provides the market with a vessel, that at relatively low cost, can be used to police the countries EEZ whilst allowing the versatility to cover a range of further operational requirements that may be needed to defend national interests. To this end the proposed vessel is designed around the following key criteria: •	A robust vessel giving low through life costs •	A need to be highly versatile in the roles it may perform •	The ability to be modified from its primary role with the minimum of time and expense This report identifies how the criteria is to be met {{through the use of a}} fixed set of vessel parameters including the hull form, powering and command and control systems with the versatility achieved through the introduction of changeable wet and dry mission modules. To further maximise versatility these modules are to be sized to the internal capacity of haulage minicons and are able to be removed from their containers and plug directly into, and interact with, the existing vessel systems. The objective of this design is to provide a good balance between the performances in the primary role, which the vessel will undertake through most of its life, and a range of secondary roles...|$|R
