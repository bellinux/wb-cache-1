40|$|The {{introduction}} of a “single list” of eligible collateral common to all Eurosystem credit operations on January 1, 2007, replaced the two-tier framework in place until then. Euro area <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> (i. e. bank loans) have become eligible for use as collateral under the single list, provided they fulfill conditions specified by the ECB.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between federal program recipients and interest groups. It is argued here that interest groups attempt to <b>claim</b> <b>credit</b> for federal program benefits. <b>Claiming</b> <b>credit</b> efforts are the activities interest group leaders engage in {{that are designed to}} call attention to the group and generate program recipient support of the group. More directly, <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for program benefits is offered as another means for an interest group to solve its collective action problem. Here, instead of interest group leaders having to produce and provide selective benefits, they are expected to take advantage of their involvement with particular federal programs to resolve their maintenance problems. It is further argued that effective <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> must have affective, evaluative, and behavioral impacts on program recipients. The <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> model is explored at both the macro-level and micro-levels. Interest group leaders were surveyed to determine whether they engaged in <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for particular programs. Recipients of these same programs were also surveyed in order to determine their relationship with the groups that speak on behalf of their program(s). Key determinants of {{the relationship between}} interest groups and program recipients are found to be: the nature of the federal program benefit (particularistic versus collective); the presence of other interest groups; and the <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> activities of the interest group...|$|R
5000|$|The Adimadhyantham-IFFK {{controversy}} {{started off}} {{from the fact that}} the film was initially co-edited by an IFFK official Beena Paul Venugopal. Later the editing work was handed over to another person, for obscure reasons, and the film did not credit Beena Paul Venugopal as a co-editor either. What originated as a <b>credit</b> <b>claim,</b> later led to the expulsion of Adimadhyantham from the list of films in the competition section of the International Film Festival of Kerala, of which Beena Paul Venugopal is a managing official. This amounted to an unexpectedly huge scandal because Adimadhyantham was the only Malayalam film selected to the competition section of the 16th IFFK. The expulsion was through the direct intervention of Priyadarshan, chairman of the Chalachithra Academy, and the rejection was defended publicly by K. B. Ganesh Kumar, Minister for Cultural Affairs. [...] This raised a controversy and K. B. Ganesh Kumar, the Minister for Cultural Affairs, claimed that the film was rejected because, only a rough-cut version was submitted. He produced a DVD in the press conference to prove his argument, while the selection committee maintained that a finished film was, in fact, submitted to the committee and that they had seen the complete film before selecting it. This flared up the controversy and the matter was pulled to the High Court of Kerala. The court rejected the plea on technical grounds (lack of English subtitles during submission of the film, a rule never strictly followed in the preceding years). An appeal moved to the Division Bench was also rejected on the same grounds leaving an IFFK without a Malayalam film to compete. Later, upon flaring up of the scandal, K. B. Ganesh Kumar conceded to include the film in the non-competing category, limited to just two screenings. The left oriented cultural organization Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham took the issue up and waged a protest at one of the IFFK venues. The issue came up in the open forum discussion on the second day of the festival, and the delegates engaged in heated arguments with Priyadarshan. In the end, Priyadarshan apologised for the problems. After the protests, Adimadhyantham was screened in the festival under [...] "Malayalam Cinema today" [...] section on 13 December 2011. Prior to that, the film was premiered on 4 December 2011.|$|E
40|$|Credit claims (or bank loans) {{represent}} {{a large share}} of the collateral accepted by the Eurosystem in its credit operations in recent years. Hence the techniques and procedures used in the use of credit claims as collateral have become significant elements of the monetary policy implementation mechanism in the euro area. The procedures involved in <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> collateralisation, however, are generally more complex than those for marketable assets traded in regulated markets or in other markets accepted by the Eurosystem. While several types of credit claims are eligible as Eurosystem collateral, each type of <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> has different characteristics which require specific considerations in the eligibility assessment. This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in the use of credit claims as collateral and relates these to some measures taken by both the public and the private sector aimed at facilitating their use in the euro area. The paper also elaborates on the syndicated loan market in the euro area as this market is sizeable, while it appears that the use of such loans as collateral remains limited...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} for valuation of single-name credit derivatives, and recuperates, in some cases generalizing, a few of known results in credit risk theory. Valuation is viewed {{with respect to a}} given state price density and relative to a general numeraire. Default probabilities and recoveries are considered as processes adapted to a subfiltration, following Jeanblanc and Rutosksy [JR], or, in the special case of Cox processes, Lando [L]. A result of Duffie and Singleton [DS] on pricing bonds with recovery in terms of loss ratio is reproduced. The notion of coadapted change of numeraire is introduced, and its invariants are studied. The concept of a <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> is formalized by introducing notions of T-claims, τ-claims, and T-streams. Application is made to credit default swaps and swaption, and the latter is approximated by a Black-Scholes formula due to Schönbucher[S]. 1...|$|E

Some of the well established groups with hundreds of human cases to their <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> that they no longer see an abnormal postoperative bleeding tendency. Undoubtedly they have succeeded in empirically estab-lishing a successful routine, and are careful not to vary from it even to a minor degree without carefully checking the effect. Other teams, believing that they are copying the leaders in complete detail, are not always success-ful, presumably because of minor variations in technic. Our group has devoted considerable attention to the effect of various extracorporeal technics on the blood coagulation system in an effort to explain the causes of abnormal bleeding and thus to derive a successful pro-gram of prevention and management.

40|$|Political speeches are {{powerful}} communicative capital. Speeches signal policy positions, preferences and priorities to other legislators, executives and constituents. Current literature diverges on the prime factor that influences political speech. One {{body of literature}} claims institutions influence speech. The authority and constraints of political offices condition speeches’ purpose. Legislators use speeches to <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> and executives to agenda set. A second body focuses on gender. These authors unanimously find that female legislators speak with a “feminine style”, emphasizing traditional women’s issues including healthcare, education and social spending. The institutional literature that examines executive speech ignores gender. The gender-based literature only examines legislators, ignoring executives. The overlap, female executive speech, has not been studied. There {{has never been a}} female US national executive, but female executives on the state level, governors, are a valuable resource. Using an original data set of 668 State of the State addresses given by US governors 2001 - 2016, I attempt to answer whether gender conditions executive speech. My textual analysis suggests that institutions are more important, and that regardless of gender, governors emphasize similar issues in their speeches. However, male governors address national issues more frequently than female governors who tend to focus on state-specific issues...|$|E

40|$|Why {{and how do}} class {{cleavages}} become politicized {{in party}} systems? The recent tenure of left governments in South America has seen the party system realigned along the class cleavage in Venezuela but not in Brazil or Chile. This article argues that different approaches to expanding social protection— “mobilizational ” in Venezuela and “technocratic ” in Brazil and Chile—explain divergent outcomes. Mobilizational policies incentivized social organization among beneficiaries and allowed for linkages between these organizations and left parties, facilitating <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> and recruitment by the left. Tech-nocratic policies targeted atomized beneficiaries with no room for partisan involvement, making <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> and recruitment difficult. Case-based evidence illustrates these mechanisms whereas survey analysis using genetic matching confirms that mobilizational and technocratic programs exerted strikingly different effects on support for left parties.
