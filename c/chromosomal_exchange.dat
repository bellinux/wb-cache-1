40|$|Epidemiology {{has shown}} an {{association}} between exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) and childhood leukaemia. The causal nature and biological basis of this association are however questionable. Studies with aneuploid cell lines raised the hypothesis that ELF EMF may act as a coleukaemogen by compromising DNA damage response to genotoxic agents such as ionising radiation. We examined this hypothesis using g-ray-induced dicentric chromosome exchange in human lymphocytes. The results from 12 h post-g-ray exposure to fields of 0. 23, 0. 47 and 0. 7 mT provide no support to the hypothesis. The power {{of the study was}} sufficient to exclude an ELF enhancement of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> of 10 – 15 % (2 SE) ...|$|E

The frequency of these aberrations was estimated in peripheral lymphocytes from hospital workers in Bushehr Port, occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation (54 subjects) and age and sex matched controls. A total of 34 (23 males & 11 females) subjects had unstable genetic aberrations (50 chromosomal-type & 31 chromatid type) but only 7 subjects in control group had unstable genetic aberrations. When compared with controls, exposed workers showed {{a significant increase in}} structural chromosomal-type aberrations (p< 0. 001 OR= 11) <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> being the most frequent alteration. Chromatid deletion (18 cases) and ring chromosome (4 cases) were seen only in exposed group. There was no association between smoking status, sex, age, level of education or working years.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between cell reproductive death and exchange frequency in SW- 1573 human lung tumour cells with and without incorporated iodo-deoxyuridine (IdUrd) following irradiation of plateau-phase cultures with y-rays. METHOD: Linear-quadratic (LQ) analysis was performed for the data on clonogenic survival and on the frequency of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> studied with {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} in chromosomes X and 2. RESULTS: Differences in the LQ parameters alpha and beta of both non-sensitized and sensitized chromosomes were found. In both chromosomes {{an increase in the number}} of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> in IdUrd-radiosensitized cells compared with non-sensitized cells was observed. The alpha-enhancement factors of 1. 7 and 1. 9 for the X-chromosome and for chromosome 2, respectively, are similar. For the X-chromosome, the beta coefficient increased by a factor of 3. 9 and for chromosome 2 by a factor of 1. 4. After correction to a full genome equivalence, no significant difference in alpha was found between chromosomes X and 2 for both control and sensitized cells. In contrast, an almost 2. 8 times higher beta was found for the sensitized X-chromosome compared to this value for chromosome 2. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the linear-quadratic analysis of dose-response relationships offers insights into the correlation between cell survival and induction of exchanges in non-sensitized and radiosensitized cell...|$|R

40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that chemicals- and radiation-induced carcinogenesis might require at least two specific chromosomal events that must coincide within a single target cell: (i) induction of chromosomal changes, possibly mutations, that are recessive and therefore latent in diploid somatic cells and (ii) aberrant mitotic segregation events that will convert the heterozygous cell, created by the first process, into a homozygous or hemizygous cell through chromosomal rearrangements. Hence, we tested the prediction that an inhibitor of induced carcinogenesis may inhibit {{one or both of}} these chromosomal events by studying the effects of antipain, a protease inhibitor and known inhibitor of carcinogenesis, on N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) -induced mutagenesis, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and cell killing in V 79 Chinese hamster cells. We show that antipain inhibited MNNG-induced <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> and all other chromosomal aberrations exclusively. This results leads us to postulate that MNNG-induced DNA lesions cause chromosomal aberrations which arise through an antipain-sensitive cellular process, that some chromosomal rearrangement is a rate-limiting step in carcinogenesis, and that mutagenesis alone, if required, is not sufficient to accomplish carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|We present {{analytical}} methods {{to estimate the}} recombinational history of chromosomes in a human population. Our analysis, similar to those utilized in Drosophila, {{can be used to}} construct meiotic maps based upon crossover frequencies observed in family data. We apply this method of exchange estimation to a population of paternally and maternally inherited chromosomes 21. The patterns of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> estimated by this type of analysis are comparable to those obtained by the more technically difficult method of cytologically counting chiasmata among human male meiotic events (sperm). This type of analysis can be applied to both male and female meiosis, circumventing many technical problems inherent to cytological counting. Moreover, the distribution of exchange locations along a chromosome for each exchange type (i. e., single, double, or triple exchanges) can be examined individually, an advantage compared to examination of genetic maps that only provide a summary of these distributions. We discuss how this analysis can be used to examine various assumptions concerning meiotic exchange in humans and investigate properties of the analysis that contribute to the accuracy of the results...|$|E
40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} repair starts with Double-strand Breaks (DSBs) followed by crossing-over and recombination. The expected frequency of meiotic <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> {{in the region}} of chromosome XII encoding ribosomal DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is 3. 5 to 5 events per cell per meiosis. However interchromosomal meiotic recombination in the rDNA gene is very rare, suggesting repression of DSB and crossing-over. On the other hand, mitotic events such as intrachromosomal recombination producing 3 μm rDNA circles (which accumulate with cellular age) and unequal sister chromatid exchanges appear to be quite common. This study looked at the rDNA breakage in the strain ORD 1181, a rad 50 S mutant with SK 1 background, which does a relatively fast and near synchronous meiosis. The fine analysis of the rDNA array was performed using restriction endonuclease enzymes that do not cleave within the rDNA array. The results suggest that {{there are at least two}} hot regions for chromosome breakage within the rDNA array. According to our previous studies we suggest that the DSB hot regions are in one homologue. However, there is possibility that other homologue is involving in DSB too...|$|E

At this stage there is no simple explanation to account for all types of inactivation patterns encountered in the 14 balanced and 15 unbalanced cases of X-autosome translocations reported to date. Selection of X inactivation is not an inherent characteristic of the X chromosome per se, and it is not dependent on the direction of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange,</b> as was suggested previously.

40|$|Archaea, like {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, contain proteins involved in various mechanisms of DNA repair, highlighting {{the importance of}} these processes for all forms of life. Species of the order Sulfolobales of hyperthermophilic crenarchaeota are equipped with a strongly UV-inducible type IV pilus system that promotes cellular aggregation. Here we demonstrate by fluorescence in situ hybridization that cellular aggregates are formed based on a species-specific recognition process and that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates <b>chromosomal</b> marker <b>exchange</b> with high frequency. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Knockout strains of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius incapable of pilus production could not self-aggregate, but were partners in mating experiments with wild-type strains indicating that one cellular partner can mediate the DNA transfer. Since pilus knockout strains showed decreased survival upon UV treatment, we c onclude that the UV-inducible DNA transfer process and subsequent homologous recombination represents an important mechanism to maintain chromosome integrity in Sulfolobus. It might also contribute substantially to the frequent <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>exchange</b> and horizontal gene transfer in these archaea in their natural habitat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) is a main {{driving force of}} bacterial evolution and innovation. This phenomenon was long thought to be marginal in mycoplasmas, {{a large group of}} self-replicating bacteria characterized by minute genomes as a result of successive gene losses during evolution. Recent comparative genomic analyses challenged this paradigm, but the occur-rence of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> had never been formally addressed in mycoplasmas. Here, we demonstrated the conjugal transfer of large chromosomal regions within and among ruminant mycoplasma species, with the incorporation of the incoming DNA occurring by homologous recombination into the recipient chromosome. By combining classical mating experiments with high-throughput next-generation sequencing, we documented the transfer of almost every position of the mycoplasma chromo-some. Mycoplasma conjugation relies on the occurrence of an integrative conjugative element (ICE) in at least one parent cell. While ICE propagates horizontally from ICE-positive to ICE-negative cells, chromosomal transfers (CTs) occurred in the oppo-site direction, from ICE-negative to ICE-positive cells, independently of ICEmovement. These findings challenged the classical mechanisms proposed for other bacteria in which conjugative CTs are driven by conjugative elements, bringing into the spot-light a newmeans for rapid mycoplasma innovation. Overall, they radically change our current views concerning the evolution of mycoplasmas, with particularly far-reaching implications given that over 50 species are human or animal pathogens...|$|R

The ratio of simple to complex type exchanges increased with LET from 18 to 51 %.

In order to distinguish whether such exchanges are derived from intergenomic recombination or translocation, 13 genotypes of an interspecific hybrid, which were previously used as parents to generate sexual polyploids, were selected for a detailed meiosis analysis. In all genotypes under study, variable numbers of bivalents (0 – 12) resulting from homoeologous pairing were observed. But in two genotypes (006001 - 6 and 006001 - 13), a multivalent which was either a quadri- or a trivalent, as well as a bivalent involving two Asiatic chromosomes, was observed. Two Asiatic chromosomes in 006001 - 6 which were non-homologous were always found to be associated together, and formed trivalent or quadrivalent with chromosomes from homoeologous genome. This indicated that there was a duplication between these two Asiatic chromosomes. Such a duplication might have resulted from the segregation of a chromosomal translocation between two non-homologous chromosomes in the Asiatic parent ‘Connecticut King’ which was transmitted to the progeny (006001 - 6). With the exception of two genotypes, in 11 genotypes that formed variable frequencies of bivalents, the homoeologous chromosome pairing and chiasma formation were similar to that between homologous chromosomes. After from the analysis of anaphase I stages it was evident that the expected types of chiasma formation involving non-sister chromatids gave rise to two strand single, two strand double, three strand double, four strand double and multiple exchanges. Whereas these events resulted from locus specific homoeologous exchanges, the translocations resulted from an aberrant form of non-homologous <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> of segments.

The results showed striking inter and intraspecific variability, with {{the location of the}} rDNA clusters restricted to sex chromosomes with two patterns: either on one (X chromosome) or both sex chromosomes (X and Y chromosomes).

The rDNA variation in closely related species and the intraspecific polymorphism in Rhodnius ecuadoriensis suggested that the chromosomal position of rDNA clusters might be a useful marker to identify recently diverged species or populations.

In unirradiated U 2 OS osteosarcoma and HeLa cancer cells, a fast confined and Brownian-like motion of DNA repair protein foci was observed, {{which was not}} altered by radiation. By analyzing the motional activity of GFP- 53 BP 1 foci in live cells up to 12 -h after irradiation, we detected an additional slower mobility of damaged chromatin sites showing a mean square displacement of ≈ 0. 6 μm 2 /h after exposure to densely- or sparsely-ionizing radiation, most likely driven by normal diffusion of chromatin. Only occasionally, larger translational motion connected to morphological changes of the whole nucleus could be observed. In addition, there was no general tendency to form repair clusters in the irradiated cells. We conclude that long-range displacements of damaged chromatin domains do not generally occur during DNA double-strand break repair after introduction of multiple damaged sites by charged particles. The occasional and in part transient appearance of cluster formation of radiation-induced foci may represent a higher mobility of chromatin along the ion trajectory.

For all of these endpoints, RBE peaks at around 100 to 200 keV/μm before it decreases at very high-LET. However, the quality of chromosome damage is different when heavy ions are compared to sparsely ionizing radiation. Large differences in gene expression are observed between x-rays and HZE ions, thus reflecting differences in damages response pathways. Qualitative differences in the type of gene mutations have also been reported. Novel multicolor fluorescence painting techniques of human chromosomes have clearly demonstrated that high-LET α-particles and Fe-ions induce many more complex rearrangements will ultimately lead to cell death. In fact, only a small fraction of the initial damage is transduction of late chromosomal damage has also been measured in the progeny of human lymphocytes that were exposed with much higher frequency in the progeny of cells that were exposed to heavy ions compared to gamma rays.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Spectral {{karyotyping}} is {{a diagnostic}} tool that allows visualization of chromosomes in different colors using the FISH technology and a spectral imaging system. To assess {{the value of}} spectral karyotyping analysis for identifying constitutional supernumerary marker chromosomes or derivative chromosomes at a national reference laboratory, we reviewed the results of 179 consecutive clinical samples (31 prenatal and 148 postnatal) submitted for spectral karyotyping. Over 90 % of the cases were requested to identify either small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) or <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchange</b> material detected by G-banded chromosome analysis. We also reviewed clinical indications of those cases with marker chromosomes in which chromosomal origin was identified by spectral karyotyping. Our results showed that spectral karyotyping identified the chromosomal origin of marker chromosomes or the source of derivative chromosomal material in 158 (88 %) of the 179 clinical cases; the identification rate was slightly higher for postnatal (89 %) compared to prenatal (84 %) cases. Cases in which the origin could not be identified had either a small marker chromosome present at a very low level of mosaicism (< 10 %), or contained very little euchromatic material. Supplemental FISH analysis confirmed the spectral karyotyping results in all 158 cases. Clinical indications for prenatal cases were mainly for marker identification after amniocentesis. For postnatal cases, the primary indications were developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). The most frequently encountered markers were of chromosome 15 origin for satellited chromosomes, and chromosomes 2 and 16 for non-satellited chromosomes. We were able to obtain pertinent clinical information for 47 % (41 / 88) of cases with an identified abnormal chromosome. We conclude that spectral karyotyping is sufficiently reliable for use and provides a valuable diagnostic tool for establishing the origin of supernumerary marker chromosomes or derivative chromosomal material that cannot be identified with standard cytogenetic techniques. </p...|$|E

In plants, interdisciplinary approaches combining phylogenetic and molecular genetic perspectives have enhanced our awareness of the myriad genetic interactions made possible by polyploidy. Here, processes and mechanisms of gene and genome evolution in polyploids are reviewed. Genes duplicated by polyploidy may retain their original or similar function, undergo diversification in protein function or regulation, or one copy may become silenced through mutational or epigenetic means. Duplicated genes also may interact through inter-locus recombination, gene conversion, or concerted evolution. Recent experiments have illuminated important processes in polyploids that operate above the organizational level of duplicated genes.

LET values for these ions ranged from 51 to 184 keV/micron and doses ranged from 10 to 200 cGy. The effect of either aluminum or polyethylene shielding on the induction of chromosome aberrations was investigated for each ion. Chromosome exchanges were measured using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with whole chromosome probes in cells collected at G 2 and mitosis in first division post irradiation after chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin-A.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a new method for FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes in suspension. Materials and methods: Metaphase chromosomes in suspension were isolated from a Chinese hamster x human hybrid cell line, 314 - 2 (1) Y, and a human cell line, GM 130 B. During suspension hybridization, specific chromosomes were labeled {{from these two}} cell lines using either biotin-labeled human genomic DNA, a directly labeled human pancentromere DNA probe or a chromosome # 1 locus-specific probe. Results: The method allows, for the first time, recovery {{of large numbers of}} isolated individual hybridized chromosomes with good morphology for both human x hamster hybrid and human cell lines. The results showed that 46 - 73 % of the starting number of total chromosomes can be recovered after a FISH in suspension procedure. The well-preserved morphology of hybridized metaphase chromosomes allowed (1) rapid detection of individual human and hamster chromosome aberrations, (2) rapid counting of the painted human chromosomes and (3) fast, clear detection of chromosome region-specific probes. This method offers a new tool to assay chromosomes and DNA: it offers the possibility to develop new techniques for sorting chromosomes based on FISH signals, for early detection and screening of genetic diseases and for bulk measurement of both balanced or unbalanced <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> and rearrangements.

2500|$|Gene {{transfer}} and genetic exchange {{have been studied}} in the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium volcanii and the hyperthermophilic archaeons Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. [...] H. volcani forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells {{that appear to be}} used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction. [...] When S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius are exposed to DNA damaging agents, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Cellular aggregation mediates <b>chromosomal</b> marker <b>exchange</b> and genetic recombination with high frequency. Cellular aggregation is thought to enhance species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination.|$|R
40|$|When {{cells of}} two auxotrophic mutants of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are mixed and {{incubated}} on solid medium, they form stable genetic recombinants {{which can be}} selected, enumerated, and characterized. Any {{of a variety of}} auxotrophic markers can recombine with each other, and the phenomenon has been observed at temperatures of up to 84 degrees C. The ability to <b>exchange</b> and recombine <b>chromosomal</b> markers appears to be an intrinsic property of S. acidocaldarius strains. It occurs between two cell lines derived from the same parent or from different parents and also between a recombinant and its parent. This is the first observation of <b>chromosomal</b> marker <b>exchange</b> in archaea from geothermal environments and provides the first functional evidence of generalized, homologous recombination at such high temperatures...|$|R

50|$|In {{organisms that}} use <b>chromosomal</b> {{crossover}} to <b>exchange</b> DNA and recombine genes, errors in alignment during meiosis {{can also cause}} mutations. Errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment making some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way. These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequence—duplications, inversions or deletions of entire regions, or the accidental exchanging of whole parts between different chromosomes (called translocation).|$|R

S. solfataricus cells aggregate preferentially with other cells of their own species. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. suggested that UV-inducible DNA transfer is likely an important mechanism for providing increased repair of damaged DNA via homologous recombination. This process can be regarded as a simple form of sexual interaction.|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} with {{a composite}} probe for human chromosome 4 and a probe that stained all centromeres was used to study gamma-ray induced breakage, rejoining and misrejoining in prematurely condensed chromosomes in human lymphocytes. Dose-response curves for the induction {{of all types of}} aberrations in prematurely condensed human chromosomes 4 were determined immediately after irradiation and after 8 h postirradiation incubation. In addition, aberrations were measured after various incubation times from 0 to 18 h after a dose of 7 Gy. Unrejoined chromosome breaks were the most frequent type of aberration observed immediately after irradiation. Approximately 15 % of total aberrations observed were chromosome exchanges. After 8 h postirradiation incubation, the frequency of breaks in prematurely condensed chromosomes declined to about 20 % of the initial value, and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> became the most frequent aberration. Results of metaphase analysis were similar to those for prematurely condensed chromosomes after 8 h incubation with the exception that a significantly lower frequency of fragments was observed. Symmetrical and asymmetrical interchanges were found at similar frequencies at all doses. No complex exchanges were observed in lymphocyte chromosomes immediately after exposure. They accounted for about 1 % of total exchanges in metaphase chromosomes at doses < 3 Gy and about 14 % at 7 Gy. Incomplete exchanges amounted to approximately 15 % of total exchanges at all doses. The kinetics of break rejoining was exponential, and the frequency of exchanges increased with kinetics similar to that observed for the rejoining of the breaks. This increase in the total exchanges {{as a function of the}} time between irradiation and fusion was due to a rapid increase in reciprocal interchanges, and a slower increase in complex exchanges; the frequency of incomplete exchanges increased initially, then decreased with prolonged incubation to the level observed in metaphase. It is concluded that the formation of each kind of chromosome aberrations follows different kinetics...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a theoretical model for evaluating radiation-induced <b>chromosomal</b> <b>exchanges</b> by explicitly taking into account interphase (G(0) /G(1)) chromosome structure, nuclear organization of chromosomes, the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and the subsequent rejoinings in a faithful or unfaithful manner. Each of the 46 chromosomes for human lymphocytes (40 chromosomes for mouse lymphocytes) is modeled as a random polymer inside a spherical volume. The chromosome spheres are packed randomly inside a spherical nucleus with an allowed overlap controlled by a parameter Omega. The rejoining of DSBs is determined by a Monte Carlo procedure using a Gaussian proximity function with an interaction range parameter sigma. Values of Omega and sigma have been found which yield calculated results of interchromosomal aberration frequencies that agree {{with a wide range}} of experimental data. Our preferred solution is one with an interaction range of 0. 5 microm coupled with a relatively small overlap parameter of 0. 675 microm, which more or less confirms previous estimates. We have used our model with these parameter values and with resolution or detectability limits to calculate yields of translocations and dicentrics for human lymphocytes exposed to low-LET radiation that agree with experiments in the dose range 0. 09 to 4 Gy. Five different experimental data sets have been compared with the theoretical results. Essentially all of the experimental data fall between theoretical curves corresponding to resolution limits of 1 Mbp and 20 Mbp, which may reflect the fact that different investigators use different limits for sensitivity or detectability. Translocation yields for mouse lymphocytes have also been calculated and are in good agreement with experimental data from 1 cGy to 10 cGy. There is also good agreement with recent data on complex aberrations. Our model is expected to be applicable to both low- and high-LET radiation, and we include a sample prediction of the yield of interchromosomal rejoining in the dose range 0. 22 Gy to 2 Gy of 1000 MeV/nucleon iron particles. This dose range corresponds to average particle traversals per nucleus ranging from 1. 0 to 9. 12...|$|R
