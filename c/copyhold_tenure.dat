[...] Chatfeild's son, Robert junior, acquired the freehold of the land in 1740; he passed it to the trustees of the chapel, who were said in 1901 to have [...] "a singularly open trust deed ... when the number of trustees are reduced to five they are required to choose 12 more to act with them, the property to be applied to such charitable uses as [...] think most proper".|$|E

50|$|After discussing, {{in their}} logical order, other {{freehold}} interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests less than freehold - namely, tenancies for terms {{of years and}} tenancies at will. With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenures,</b> which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R

50|$|The hamlet was not {{mentioned}} in Domesday Book in 1086 because it formed part of the manor of Monks Risborough. It was later subinfeudated (i.e. granted as a feudal sub-manor) to a military subtenant and was held by knight-service by the 13th century. It continued as a separate sub-manor, paying a quit-rent to the manor of Monks Risborough until <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenure</b> was abolished in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Copyhold</b> <b>tenure</b> {{was a form}} of {{customary}} tenure of land common in England from the Middle Ages. The land was held according to the custom of the manor, and the mode of landholding took its name {{from the fact that the}} [...] "title deed" [...] received by the tenant was a copy of the relevant entry in the manorial court roll. A tenant who held land in this way was known as a copyholder.|$|E
50|$|To {{this end}} {{his name is}} {{associated}} with the Fines and Recoveries Abolition Act 1833; the Inheritance Act 1833; the Dower Act 1833; the Real Property Limitation Act 1833; the Wills Act 1837; the <b>Copyhold</b> <b>Tenure</b> Act 1841; and the Judgments Act 1838. The second was called for by the preference which the common law gave to a distant collateral over the brother of the half-blood of the first purchaser; the fourth conferred an indefeasible title on adverse possession for twenty years (a term shortened by Lord Cairns in 1875 to twelve years); the fifth reduced the number of witnesses required by law to attest wills, and removed the distinction which existed in this respect between freeholds and copyholds; the last freed an innocent debtor from imprisonment only before final judgment (or on what was termed mesne process), but the principle stated by Campbell that only fraudulent debtors should be imprisoned was ultimately given effect to for England and Wales in 1869.|$|E

50|$|Customary {{freehold}} is in English law {{a species}} of tenure which may {{be described as a}} variety of copyhold. It is also termed privileged copyhold or <b>copyhold</b> of frank <b>tenure.</b> It is a tenure by copy of manorial roll, but not expressed to be at the will of the lord. It is, in fact, only a superior kind of copyhold, and the freehold is in the lord. It is subject to the general law of copyholds, except where the law may be varied by the custom of the particular manor.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} different customary manorial tenures on the land transfer activities of rural tenants between 1645 and 1705. The study of land transfer has formed part of the attempt by historians to establish how and why England developed from family-based subsistence farming into large-scale commercialised agriculture before many of its Continental neighbours. A key element in any study of land transfer is the property rights of those undertaking the transfers. England had a variety of customary tenures, and little research has focussed on how they operated and impacted on rural tenant transfer behaviour in the early modern period. This study uses evidence from eight manors in Hampshire with four different types of tenure to explore how they affected what land transfer options the tenants had, and how transfers were used to further family and economic objectives. The types of <b>tenure</b> were <b>copyhold</b> of inheritance; copyhold for three lives; copyhold for three lives where the first could act alone; and a form of customary freehold. The main documentary sources are manorial records augmented by parish, probate, survey and taxation material. The tenurial and landholding structure of the manors is established for 1645 using the Cromwellian Parliamentary Surveys of confiscated ecclesiastical estates. The analysis of subsequent tenant land transfers through to 1705 then {{examines the}}ir volume and any correlation with prices and population movements. The permanent transfers of death/inheritance and the inter vivos land market are analysed to assess {{the extent to which}} tenants were attached still to family, or taking part in an active extra-familial investment and sales market; and whether this led to changes over time in farm holding size and distribution. The temporary transfers of sub-letting of land and sub-tenure of dwellings are then analysed. The latter has not been studied before, and uses the Hearth Tax returns to compare occupiers of dwellings with formal tenants. Finally a detailed study of mortgages is made. Previous studies of the use of land as collateral for a mortgage loan have often overlooked the rural tenant as a participant in the credit market, and changes in the laws of usury {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century produced a significant uptake of mortgaging in the seventeenth, which makes this study timely. The research reveals that the tenants were very active with their transfers, but that the way in which they were active was determined by <b>tenure.</b> Those with <b>copyhold</b> of inheritance <b>tenure</b> had many options including inheritance, sale, mortgaging, sub-letting, splitting holdings, and conditional surrenders to provide for old age or several children. Those with copyhold for lives were restricted to after-death transfers, shuffling of reversion lives, or sub-letting. However, they adapted, and while Inheritance-tenured tenants adopted mortgages with enthusiasm, Lives tenants sub-let on a large scale. Both thereby acquired financial support from their lands, so that although the land-family bond was not absent, the bond was strongest in terms of using the land as an economic asset. The sub-letting of dwellings enabled Lives tenants to accommodate a landless workforce, where their tenure prevented the splitting of parcels for sale as manorial smallholdings. Aggressive accumulation of land was largely absent, and purchasers of land and mortgage lenders were overwhelmingly local. Some polarisation of holding size was found, but sub-tenure meant that actual farmed units were probably very different. It is concluded that differences in tenure significantly shaped the transfer behaviour of the tenants, so that any future research involving customary tenants must take tenure into account. However, their economic ambitions were found to be similar whichever tenure they had, so that they had to take different means to the same end...|$|R

50|$|Humphreys's major work, Observations on the Actual State of the English Laws of Real Property, {{with the}} {{outlines}} of a Code (London, 1826, 2nd edit. 1827), gave him {{a reputation as a}} legal reformer. Fox is said to have suggested the work, but it came from association with Charles Butler and with the school of analytical jurists led by Jeremy Bentham and John Austin. Bentham wrote a flattering notice in The Westminster Review. Changes that Humphreys proposed were opposed at the time, but most were later adopted in the 19th century: shortened forms of conveyance, registration of title, abolition of <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenure,</b> {{increase in the number of}} judges, improvement of procedure, the alteration of the law of descents, and others. Edward Burtenshaw Sugden, John James Park, and others published criticisms of Humphreys's proposals, but his scheme was praised by James Kent in America. The need for radical change in the land laws was recognised by the appointment in 1827 of the real property commission. Humphreys also wrote Suggestions respecting the Stamp Duties affecting Real and Personal Property, published posthumously in 1830, and other pamphlets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tenure of}} the freeholders was {{protected}} by the royal courts. After the Black Death, labour was in demand and so it became difficult for the lords of manors to impose duties on serfs. However their customary tenure continued and in the 16th century the royal courts also began to protect these customary tenants, who became known as copyholders. The name arises because the tenant was given {{a copy of the}} court's record of the fact as a title deed. During the 19th century manor courts were phased out. In 1925, <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenure</b> formally ended with the enactment of Law of Property Acts, 1922 and 1924, converting copyhold to fee simple. Although copyhold was abolished, the title of Lord of the Manor remains, and certain rights attached to it will also remain if registered under the Land Registration Act 2002, which Act ended manorial incidents unprotected by registration at HM Land Registry after October 2013. [...] The Land Registration Act 2002 does not affect the existence of unregistered lordships after October 2013, only the rights that would have previously been attached to the same.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{definite}} {{records of}} the Evesham Custom first appear in the early-mid 19th century, some commentators {{in the past have}} assumed that the rights originated from [...] "some earlier epoch". The ruralist writer H. J. Massingham, who was familiar with the operation of the Custom, expressed a belief that the tenant rights of Evesham were a direct descendant of those of the [...] "small masters" [...] who from the early mediaeval period practised cultivation in open fields owned by the Abbey. Massingham commented that after the 1874 agricultural depression, the area's large landlords split their farms up and let smaller parcels of land to labourers who were protected by the survival of ancient customary rights and by the local influence of Joseph Arch. [...] J. M. Martin has noted that an [...] "archaic" [...] form of life leasehold was practised in Pershore by the estates of the Duke of Westminster, where wills of the 18th century spoke of a [...] "tenant right of renewing", and that a similarly archaic form of <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenure</b> was found in Shipston-on-Stour on land belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester. Both had survived in areas where large estates had to manage many small tenancies, as in Evesham, and it is possible that a similar local tradition was the source of the rights enjoyed by the Vale of Evesham's market gardeners. Another view states that the Custom originated on a single small estate {{at the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently spread throughout the district.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} supposed {{that there are}} no copyhold lands in Ireland, though at one time they were not altogether unknown.

It is, I believe, certain that these are now the only copyhold lands in Ireland, and as this tenure will cease to exist in Ireland by the sale, under the Irish Church Act, of the lands in the manor of Kilmoon, some account of the manor may be of interest to the Statistical Society...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} 16 adjacent parishes in the Somerset Levels which illustrate {{important aspects of}} agrarian history in the early modern period. Land use in the Levels allowed a type of farming whereby small farmers could produce a surplus and participate in progressive, commercial farming, while the manorial structure and the secure <b>copyhold</b> <b>tenure</b> aided the tenants and supported {{the development of a}} group of landholders living on rents and other unearned income. Economic and tenurial independence, plus an absence of resident gentry, produced a parallel independence in religious and political thought and action. The Introduction describes the settlements, topography, markets, population, the distribution of wealth, and non-agricultural occupations. Chapter 2 considers the manorial structure and landholders, the formation of sub-manors, customary tenure, the level of fines, forfeiture, manor courts and the position of manorial lords, and the increasing use of copyholds as investments. Land use and husbandry are then described, including field systems, different types of husbandry and the farming systems followed. The incomes of small farmers are calculated; commercial leasing, sub-letting, and incomes from rent are considered, together with the role of small farmers in the economy and in agricultural change. Chapter 5 discusses the transmission of land and goods through pre-mortem transfer, disposal of free and copyhold land, and disposal of personal property by will. The payment and economic effects of legacies are also considered. The position of women under both common law and manorial custom is then treated, showing the responsibility given to women as their husbands' successors, financial advantages of marriage, women In economic and social life, and the economic effects of widow's right. Chapter 7 describes the involvement of countrymen in events of the 17 th century, the growth of political divisions in local society, the end of religious uniformity, and the generation of deep commitments which led to armed rebellion under Monmouth...|$|E
