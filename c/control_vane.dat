50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a fuel {{distributor}}, which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a <b>control</b> <b>vane</b> through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|E

This inlet flow control is designed to minimize the engine fan face distortion levels and first five Fourier harmonic half amplitudes while maximizing the inlet pressure recovery. Numerical simulations of the BLI inlet are computed using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solver, OVERFLOW, developed at NASA. These simulations are used to generate the numerical experiments for the DOE response surface model. In this investigation, two DOE optimizations were performed using a D-Optimal Response Surface model. The first DOE optimization was performed using four design factors which were vane height and angles-of-attack for two groups of vanes. One group of vanes was placed {{at the bottom of the}} inlet and a second group symmetrically on the sides. The DOE design was performed for a BLI inlet with a free-stream Mach number of 0. 85 and a Reynolds number of 2 million, based on the length of the fan face diameter, matching an experimental wind tunnel BLI inlet test. The first DOE optimization required a fifth order model having 173 numerical simulation experiments and was able to reduce the DC 60 baseline distortion from 64 % down to 4. 4 %, while holding the pressure recovery constant. A second DOE optimization was performed holding the vanes heights at a constant value from the first DOE optimization with the two vane angles-of-attack as design factors. This DOE only required a second order model fit with 15 numerical simulation experiments and reduced DC 60 to 3. 5 % with small decreases in the fourth and fifth harmonic amplitudes.

Improvements in electronics in the last 50 years have allowed many flight control functions to become automated, with the pilot continuously monitoring flight parameters from within the vehicle cockpit. With the advent of small unmanned air vehicles (UAV's) which are limited in size and weight-carrying capacity, a pilot is now able to fly an airborne vehicle from a distant ground-fixed position. Miniature electronic instruments control or direct vehicle movements either through pilot commands or autonomously.
