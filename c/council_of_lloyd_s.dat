40|$|Assignment {{messages}}" are maximally general {{messages to}} describe substitutable preferences {{by means of}} a linear program. With "integer assignment messages," there exist integer-valued Walrasian allocations, extending a result <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley and Martin Shubik (1971). Any pure Nash equilibrium profile of the Walrasian mechanism with participants limited to assignment messages is also a Nash equilibrium of the unrestricted Walrasian mechanism. Assignment exchanges are generalizations of single-product double auctions and are related to ascending multi-product clock auctions and the Vickrey mechanism. Assignment messages also have additional applications in mechanism design. (JEL D 44, D 82) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} three prototypical models of noncooperative {{oligopoly}} in markets with {{a continuum of}} traders : the model of Cournot-Walras equilibrium of Codognato and Gabszewicz (1991), the model of Cournot-Nash equilibrium <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley, and the model of Cournot-Walras equilibrium of Busetto et al. (2008). We argue that these models are all distinct and only the Shapley's model with a continuum of traders and atoms gives an endogenous explanation of the perfectly and imperfectly competitive behavior of agents in a one-stage setting. For this model, we prove a theorem of existence of a Cournot-Nash equilibrium. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{introduces}} bicooperative {{games and}} develops some general values on the vector space of these games. First, we define biprobabilistic values for bicooperative games and observe {{in detail the}} axioms that characterize such values. Following the work of Weber [R. J. Weber, Probabilistic values for games, in: A. E. Roth (Ed.), The Shapley Value: Essays in Honor <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988, pp. 101 – 119], these axioms are sequentially introduced observing the repercussions they have on the value expression. Moreover, compatible-order values are introduced and there is shown {{the relationship between these}} values and efficient values such that their components are biprobabilistic values...|$|R

2500|$|In {{contract}} {{salvage the}} owner of the property and salvor enter into a salvage contract prior to the commencement of salvage operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract. [...] This can be a fixed amount, based on a [...] "time and materials" [...] basis, or any other terms that both parties agree to. [...] The contract may also state that payment is only due if the salvage operation is successful (a.k.a. [...] "No Cure, No Pay"), or that payment is due even if the operation is not successful. By far the commonest single form of salvage contract internationally is <b>Lloyd's</b> Standard Form <b>of</b> Salvage Agreement (2011), an English law arbitration agreement administered by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's,</b> London.|$|R
