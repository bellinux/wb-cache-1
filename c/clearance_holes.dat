50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E

The uniaxial symmetry non-circular hole is optimized based on finite element method (FEM), in which the maximum first principal stress is taken as the objective function. After optimization, the stress concentration is evidently relieved; the maximum first principal stress and the maximum von Mises stress on the critical area are reduced by 30. 39 % and 25. 34 % respectively, showing that the uniaxial symmetry non-circular hole is capable of reducing the stress level of bolt <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> on the turbine disk...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a series of static tests on resin {{injected}} bolted joints with pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material. The aim is to characterise a method of connection that could be fatigue and slip resistant. For comparison, tests are also carried out on standard bolted connections without resin and with 2 mm <b>clearance</b> <b>holes.</b> Slip in joints is a major issue in bridge engineering, which has to be controlled if the structural scheme is to perform satisfactorily over its service life. The transfer of connection force in FRP joints, by way of frictional force, say by using High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts, cannot be relied upon [1], because steel bolting is known to lose its pre-tension with time due to the viscoelastic properties of the FRP. The aim of our preliminary study is to offer a potential solution to developing a suitable slip resistant connection. Tests are conducted on double lap-shear joints according to Annex G of BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008 [2]. The hexagon injection bolts and bottom washer are prepared as per Annex K of the same standard. A new top washer has been designed and tested to ensure smooth resin filling in the cavity between bolt (M 16) and 2 mm hole clearance. It is expected that resin injected bolting will provide a mechanical fastening system that has locking capabilities. If successful the outcome of our research will address the challenge of durability and will ensure longer service lives for joint limit states under bridge loading.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the short- and long-term behaviour of injected bolted connections (IBCs) with oversize holes for various injection materials. A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, {{as a result of}} which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal <b>clearance</b> <b>holes,</b> but no explicit results are available for connections with oversize or slotted holes. The use of oversize or slotted holes may be beneficial for the (re-) erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such oversize or slotted holes are on the connection behaviour. First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout- and (epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with oversize holes is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.

One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs.

40|$|The Tile Calorimeter {{is one of}} {{the main}} hadronic calorimeters to be used in the ATLAS {{experiment}} at CERN [1, 2]. It is a steel/scintillator sampling calorimeter which is built by stacking 64 segments in azimuth and 3 separate cylinders to provide a total structure whose length is approximately 12 m and whose diameter is a little over 8. 4 m. It has a total weight of about 2630 metric tons. Important features of this calorimeter are: A minimum gap (1. 5 mm) between modules in azimuth; Pockets in the structure to hold the scintillator tiles; Recessed channels at the edges of the module into which the readout fibers will sit; and Holes in the structure through which a radioactive source will pass. The mechanical structure for one of the 3 calorimeter sections, the Extended Barrel (EBA) was constructed at Argonne. A schematic of the calorimeter sampling structure and the layout of one of the 64 segments, termed a module, are shown in figure 1. Each module comprises mechanically of a precision machined, structural girder to which 10 submodules are bolted. One of these submodules, the ITC, has a customized shape to accommodate services for other detector elements. Each submodule weighs 850 Kg and the assembled mechanical structure of the module weighs approximately 9000 Kg (a fully instrumented Extended Barrel modules weighs {approx} 9600 Kg). A crucial issue for the tile calorimeter assembly is the minimization of the un-instrumented gap between modules when they are stacked on top of each other during final assembly. The design goal was originally 1 mm gap which was eventually relaxed to 1. 5 mm following a careful evaluation of all tolerances in the construction and assembly process as shown in figure 2 [3]. Submodules for this assembly were produced at 4 locations [4] using tooling and procedures which were largely identical [5]. An important issue was the height of each submodule on the stacking fixture on which they were fabricated as this defines the length along the girder for installation, with a design gap between submodules on the girder of 0. 3 mm. During production we relaxed this tolerance to + 0. 3, - 1. 5 mm. The height summary for submodules used at Argonne is shown in Appendix I. About 10 submodules fell outside the positive height envelope (due to the raw plate thickness being out of specification) and we constructed some custom short submodules to allow their use in module assembly. The structural girders were produced commercially following the Quality Control plan agreed to with the Tile Calorimeter collaboration and shipped to Argonne. The crucial tolerances on the girder are the key into which submodules are placed as well as the flatness of the key surface which are used in aligning submodules such that the azimuthal surface lies wholly an envelope of + 0. 75 mm from nominal [6]. Another important characteristic of the girder are <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> through which the wavelength shift fibers pass to couple the light to photomultipliers located inside the girder, as described in [2]. Since these fiber bundles must be located to high precision, rather than position the holes in the steel to this precision, tooling was developed by which the precision pieces are glued into the girder [7]. This is shown in figure 3. More details on the pieces used to accomplish this interface to the readout electronics are discussed in [2]...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examines various aspects on connections and joints in Pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (PFRP) structures. The work {{is divided into two}} experimental investigations on the determination of pin-bearing strength and the characterisation of dowel connections and joint for the Startlink Lightweight Building System (SLBS). To support the development of a strength formula for bearing resistance in bolted connections two pin-bearing strength test series were conducted to study the effects of load orientation and hot-wet conditioning. The limitations of existing standard test methods are exposed from a critical review to show that they do not specify the need for a <b>clearance</b> <b>hole,</b> the range of bolt diameters and PFRP thicknesses found in practice. Because the size of tension coupons is found to be too big to be cut from standard structural profiles an alternative test method, having a smaller coupon size, is needed for every pin-bearing strength to be quantified by testing. Reported in this thesis are test results using an in-house test method that requires a maximum blank coupon of 100 mm × 125 mm. Characteristic strength are determined using Annex D 7 of Eurocode 0. Pin-bearing strengths for load orientations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 45 and 90 o, to the direction of pultrusion are obtained for a web material taken from a standard wide flange section of 9. 53 mm thick. In the test matrix there were four sizes of pin diameter from 9. 7 mm to 25. 4 mm and a minimum <b>clearance</b> <b>hole</b> of 1. 6 mm. The in-house test method is shown to satisfactorily determine pin-bearing strength. Another finding from this study is that the Hankinson formula cannot be applied to establish pin-bearing strength at any orientation on knowing the two characteristic strengths at 0 o and 90 o. To characterise the effect of hot-wet conditioning 0, 45 and 90 o specimens were immersed under water for 3000 hours at 40 ° C. It is found that the average reduction in characteristic strength is in the range of 18 to 31...|$|R

In order to give an impulse to standardiza-t ion and to ga in more insight in the biomechanics of the push-out test, a finite element analysis of this test was per-formed. This study focused on the influ-ence of test conditions on the push-out results. The influence of the following four parameters on the interface stress distribution was tested: (a) <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig, (b) Young's modulus of the implant; (c) cortical thick-ness; and (d) implant diameter. The dis-tance between the implant and the support jig turned out to be very critical for the occurrence of peak stresses in the inter-face. Variations of the Young's modulus of the implants resulted {{in a wide range of}} interface shear stresses. Variation of the cortical thickness showed a reciprocal relationship between cortical thickness and interface shear stress. However, the interface stress distribution remained uniform under the specific test circum-stances. These findings also hold for vari-ations in implant diameter. The present investigation shows that the <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig, and the Young's modulus of the implant are parameters which most strongly influence the inter-face stress distribution. The <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig is the most criti-cal parameter, but also the parameter that can be control led most easily. Lack of standardization with regard to these parameters can lead to uninterpretable test results.

It {{is important that the}} cylindrical alignment hole closely fit the diameter of the pencil, to keep the pencil from wobbling, which would cause stepped or lurching cut-depths and point breakage. Another important feature is a larger <b>clearance</b> <b>hole</b> {{at the end of the}} cone allowing sections of the pencil lead which break away to be removed with only minor inconvenience. Prism sharpeners can be bare or enclosed in a container to collect the shavings, while some enclosed sharpeners may be harder to clear in the event of a blockage. A few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, rotating the cutting blade instead of rotating the pencil. Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, requiring the pencil to be sharpened again. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, making sharpening attempts difficult. If the alignment hole is too small, the pencil cannot be inserted, while if it is too large, the tip of the pencil repeatedly will break off. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened.|$|R

40|$|The study {{presented}} {{focuses on}} the development of a novel timber joint. Traditional timber joints with mechanical fasteners, particular dowel type fasteners, such as bolts exhibit a low strength and an unreliable stiffness and ductility caused by the presence of <b>hole</b> <b>clearance</b> and the unpredictable splitting of timber. The novel joint tackles all of these shortcomings. Local reinforcement glued to the timber members in the jointed area prevents unexpected splitting and results in the enhancement of the strength. By choosing a steel (gas) tube instead of a solid fastener, that fit in an over-sized hole, and by expanding the diameter after assembly of the joint, easy assembly and no <b>hole</b> <b>clearance</b> is insured. Due to the ductile behaviour of the reinforcement and the plastic deformation capacity of the tube the ductility of the joint is guaranteed. To assess the performance of this joints a comprehensive study was performed and reported in this article. Summarising the experimental results, it can be stated that densified veneer (ply) wood is an excellent mate. rial to reinforce the timber joint. It possesses a high embedding strength and stiffness compared to softwood and is able to sustain the high concentrated loads imposed by the tubes. It is demonstrated that the new joint possess a reliable and high strength and stiffness capacity in monotonic loading. When certain requirements are fulfilled the joint shows a superior behaviour in cyclic loading.
