50|$|Before {{investing}} in the installation of a meteorological measurement mast tower, wind engineers use the WDG software to generate Virtual Met Masts (VMM) at any area of interest and get 30+ years of hourly wind data (speed and direction). These data {{can be used to}} run pre-feasibility analyses and generate conceptual layouts for any wind turbine types. Doing so, site selection & ranking decision-making is based on optimized installed <b>capacity</b> (<b>MW)</b> and capacity factor numbers (MWh/year) even before having on-site mast data. The software has other interesting features (Micrositing, MCP, extreme wind speed analyses...) {{that can be used to}} build more profitable wind farms (by reducing uncertainties) over the long-term (IEC standards).|$|E

50|$|Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center is {{the solar}} parabolic-trough {{component}} {{of an integrated}} solar combined cycle 1150 MW plant, in western Martin County, Florida, just north of Indiantown, built by Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). The ISCC plant {{is part of the}} Martin Plant site which consists of 5 units. Unit 1 & Unit 2 are 800 MW steam electric generating units that use natural gas and low-sulfur residual oil. Unit 3 & Unit 4 are 500 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle units. Unit 8 is a natural gas fired 4-on-1 combined cycle unit with a nominal capacity of 1150 MW. Light oil is used as backup. Unit 8, placed into commercial operation in 2005, is integrated with the solar plant. Unit 8 features four 170 MW gas turbines, one 470 MW steam turbine, and a single condenser and cooling tower.The single solar field circuit heats 4 steam generators, after each gas turbine. The Martin solar thermal facility is designed to provide steam for FPL's existing Martin Unit 8 combined cycle unit, thus reducing FPL's use of natural gas. No additional <b>capacity</b> (<b>MW)</b> will result from the operation of the solar thermal facility.The Solar Energy Center has an array of approximately 190,000-mirror parabolic troughs on about 500 acre of the Martin County plant.The solar collectors feed heat to the existing steam plant, displacing gas generated electricity at an estimated rate of 155,000 MWh per year. The 2012 solar-derived production was about 89,000 MWh of power, according to records filed with the state’s Public Service Commission, which was 42% less than projected when the plant got approval. It is to consider that the solar component can generate electrical energy only if the four gas turbines are in operation, otherwise the 470 MW steam turbine will not move. When gas turbines are stopped, the solar heat is used to keep the steam turbine in temperature, in order to facilitate a more rapid start-up. Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project. Construction began in 2008 and was completed by the end of 2010.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the effect of test sample diameter on the peak load carrying capacity of cable bolts in varying conditions. It was previously found that peak load varies with the diameter of test sample up to 300  mm and further that confinement has a significant impact on load. In this study test samples were varied over a larger range of diameters up to 500  mm in test samples having strengths of 32  MPa and 66  MPa using a plain strand Superstrand cable bolt and a nutcage high <b>capacity</b> <b>MW</b> 9 cable bolt. The test work confirmed that there are differences in anchorage performance in material of different strength between the two cable bolts and importantly that a 300  mm diameter sample size is required when comparing different types of cable bolts design...|$|E
40|$|Some {{important}} real-time {{tasks of}} the independent system operator (ISO) are the monitoring and control of power system events (load deviations and contingencies). These events are usually managed by the ISO using operating reserve ancillary services. These services represent an additional <b>capacity</b> (<b>MW)</b> available in generators and some interruptible loads. Generators must change their operating points in order that this capacity can remain available. These changes might lead to efficiency losses in energy production. In systems with {{a high percentage of}} hydroelectric production, hydroelectric plants need to know the impact of ancillary services on their profits. This work therefore analyzes the cost of efficiency losses due to operating reserve availability in hydroelectric generators. A method to calculate this cost component is proposed using a unit commitment dispatch for a single hydroelectric plant. This dispatch is performed without considering the operating reserve availability and is compared with the traditional dispatch, which takes into account the availability of operating reserve. The proposal is used to calculate the cost of efficiency losses on a Brazilian hydroelectric generator. We found that the cost of efficiency losses can be considerable when compared to the incomes of a hydroelectric plant in the short-term market...|$|E

40|$|Dramatic {{changes in}} the {{structure}} and operation of US bulk-power markets require new analytical tools. The authors developed the Oak Ridge Competitive Electricity Dispatch (ORCED) model to analyze a variety of public-policy {{issues related to the}} many changes underway in the US electricity industry. Such issues include: policy and technology options to reduce carbon emissions from electricity production; the effects of electricity trading between high- and low-cost regions on consumers and producers in both regions; the ability of the owners of certain generating units to exercise market power as functions of the transmission link between two regions and the characteristics of the generating units and loads in each region; and the market penetration of new energy-production and energy-use technologies and the effects of their adoption on fuel use, electricity use and costs, and carbon emissions. ORCED treats two electrical systems connected by a single transmission link ORCED uses two load-duration curves to represent the time-varying electricity consumption in each region. The two curves represent peak and offpeak seasons. User specification of demand elasticities permits ORCED to estimate the effects of changes in electricity price, both overall and hour by hour, on overall electricity use and load shapes. ORCED represents the electricity supply in each region with 26 generating units. The two regions are connected by a single transmission link. This link is characterized by its <b>capacity</b> (<b>MW),</b> cost ({cents}/kWh), and losses (%). This report explains the inputs to, outputs from, and operation of ORCED. It also presents four examples showing applications of the model to various public-policy issues related to restructuring of the US electricity industry...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} for task one of the tail event {{analysis}} project for BPA. Tail event refers {{to the situation in}} a power system when unfavorable forecast errors of load and wind are superposed onto fast load and wind ramps, or non-wind generators falling short of scheduled output, the imbalance between generation and load becomes very significant. This type of events occurs infrequently and appears on the tails of the distribution of system power imbalance; therefore, is referred to as tail events. This report analyzes what happened during the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reliability event on February 26, 2008, which was widely reported because of the involvement of wind generation. The objective is to identify sources of the problem, solutions to it and potential improvements that can be made to the system. Lessons learned from the analysis include the following: (1) Large mismatch between generation and load can be caused by load forecast error, wind forecast error and generation scheduling control error on traditional generators, or a combination of all of the above; (2) The capability of system balancing resources should be evaluated both in <b>capacity</b> (<b>MW)</b> and in ramp rate (MW/min), and be procured accordingly to meet both requirements. The resources {{need to be able to}} cover a range corresponding to the variability of load and wind in the system, additional to other uncertainties; (3) Unexpected ramps caused by load and wind can both become the cause leading to serious issues; (4) A look-ahead tool evaluating system balancing requirement during real-time operations and comparing that with available system resources should be very helpful to system operators in predicting the forthcoming of similar events and planning ahead; and (5) Demand response (only load reduction in ERCOT event) can effectively reduce load-generation mismatch and terminate frequency deviation in an emergency situation...|$|E
