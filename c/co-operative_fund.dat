However, results highlight the importance of upholding the distinct co-operative identity encompassed by the co-operative values and principles. The article concludes that it is the areas of co-operative financing, the distribution of returns and the role of co-operative institutions needing most addressing.

The Ferret is one of a number of recent digital start-ups seeking to explore new ways of funding and sustaining investigative journalism against a backdrop of declining levels of such journalism from the mainstream media. Despite this, to date there has been very little detailed, empirical work into subscription or membership models of funding journalism. This article begins to address this by presenting the results of an online survey of The Ferret’s subscribers. The findings are discussed in the context of recent work from international scholars about paying for online news and new business models for public interest journalism. The results suggest that subscribers tend to be middle aged or older, to the left of the political spectrum and motivated mainly by a desire to support the production of investigative journalism – rather than gain exclusive access to its content. The article concludes by arguing that recruiting such people offers a potentially sustainable membership model for investigative journalism platforms, whereby journalism for the benefit of society is funded by the few...|$|R

5000|$|The Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg was {{actually}} an annexationist himself, {{but refused to}} support the annexationists in public. Under the constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, but one of those powers was the right to pass budgets. In 1912 elections, the Social Democrats won {{a majority of the}} seats to the Reichstag. In 1914, the Social Democrats split into two factions with the Independent Social Democrats opposing the war and the Majority Social Democrats supporting the war under the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany. However, the Majority Social Democrats were opposed to the annexationists and to secure their co-operation in passing budgets, Bethmann Hollweg refused to support the annexationists in public. Bethmann Hollweg's Septemberprogramm-drafted in September 1914 {{at a time when the}} fall of Paris was believed to be imminent as the German armies had almost reached the French capital and to be issued when Paris fell-was remarkably similar to the Hugenberg-Class memo. Believing that he was not one of them, Hugenberg like the rest of the annexationists spent the years 1914 to 1917 attacking Bethmann Hollweg as essentially a traitor. In 1915, Hugenberg published a telegram to Class in the name of the united chambers of commerce of the Ruhr demanding that Wilhelm II dismiss Bethmann Hollweg and if the Kaiser was unwilling that the military depose Bethmann Hollweg, stating if the Reich failed to achieve the annexationist platform once the war was won that it would cause a revolution from the right that would end the monarchy. It was Hugenberg's interest in mobilizing support for the annexationists and bringing down Bethmann Hollweg that led him into the media as Hugenberg started to buy newspapers and publishing houses in 1916 to create more organs for the expressions of his imperialistic views. After buying the Scherl newspaper chain in July 1916, Hugenberg announced at the first meeting of the board under his management that he had only brought the Scherl corporation to champion annexationist and Pan-German war aims, and that any editor opposed to his expansionistic views should resign now before he before fired them. Besides for his membership in the Pan-German League, Hugenberg had a more personal reason for being an annexationist. Together with his friends Emil Kirdorf, Hugo Stinnes and Wilhelm Beukenberg Hugenberg founded a number of corporations to exploit the occupied parts of Belgium and northern France in 1916-17. These companies were favored by the Army which ruled occupied Belgium and France as both Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff-both firm annexationists-appreciated Hugenberg's willingness to spend millions of marks to mobilize public support for their cause. In 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Hugenberg founded two corporations, the Landgesellschaft Kurland m.b.H and Neuland A.G that had a total budget of 37 million marks to establish <b>co-operative</b> <b>funds</b> that would make loans to the hundreds of thousands of German farmers that he expected to be soon settled in Eastern Europe. [...] Hugenberg remained at Krupp until 1918 when he set out to build his own business and during the Great Depression he was able to buy up dozens of local newspapers. Hugenberg's increasing involvement in Pan-German and annexationist causes together with his interest in building a media empire caused him to depart from Krupp, which he found to be a distraction from what really interested him. [...] These newspapers became the basis of his publishing firm Scherl House and, after he added controlling interests in Universum Film AG, Ala-Anzeiger AG, Vera Verlag and the Telegraphen Union, he had a near monopoly on the media which he used to agitate against the Weimar Republic amongst Germany's middle classes.|$|R
40|$|Since 2008, the German {{open-ended}} {{real estate}} fund (GOEREF) industry has experienced a critical phase of suspensions of redemption of fund shares, announced fund terminations and, eventually, introduction of a new regulation. With assets under management of over EUR 80 billion, GOEREFs are the dominant indirect real estate investment vehicle in Germany.

Both net asset values (NAVs) and potential secondary market prices of the shares of funds with suspended redemptions are used. The resulting total return patterns are analysed on an index basis for fund groups that best represent the most important investor groups for GOEREFs. Groups that comprised a higher number of funds with suspended redemptions were considerably worse off and less attractive in an asset allocation context than the others given the often much lower secondary market prices. However, changes in return and risk must also be considered in terms of NAVs.

40|$|Chronicle of the Governors' Association is a {{combined}} history/field research project investigating {{the sustainability of}} a so-called Institution for Collective Action. The co-operative association “To Our Avail”, {{the main focus of}} our research, is an expression of such an institute. By examining the functioning of this 110 -year-old <b>co-operative</b> sickness <b>fund</b> we have aimed to identify the qualities that have ensured the long-term existence of the Association. The main research question was if longevity can be regarded as the outcome of the co-operative structure and which factors have, for good or for worse, played a role in this. The Association “To Our Avail” has operated since 1905 as a communal sickness fund for entrepreneurs in Nieuwendam, a town which {{has become part of the}} city of Amsterdam. The association is part of the so-called Second Wave of the co-operative Movement, initiated in Germany by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch. The research that supports the project Chronicle of The Governors' Association is divided into three periods of which the first one covers the foundation years and the rise of the Society from 1905 till 1939. The second period deals with the Welfare-State: 1966 - 1985 and the third and final chapter covers the period 2005 - 2016 of which the latter years were dominated by the American Financial Crisis of 2008. This crisis resulted in a fundamental rethink among citizens and local communities worldwide, sparking a renewed interest in the idea of co-operatives and commonality. This is therefore a period which can be defined as the Third Wave of the co-operative Movement. Chronicle of The Governors' Association has thus become a narration of the local and the common, juxtaposed against the setting of the bigger social movements in the 20 th century. The project Chronicle of the Governors' Association was initiated by the Dutch Foundation Journey of the Razzia (Stichting Reis van de Razzia) in the context of its research programme “Journey through the Hinterland”. The project was supported by the research group ‘Institutions for Collective Action’, led by Prof. Tine de Moor of the University of Utrecht...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In the 19 th century, {{farming in}} South Africa {{included}} vibrant small scale farms that were market responsive and competitive. Legislation enacted {{in the early}} 20 th century adversely affected these farmers while supporting the development of large commercial farmers. The extensive government support for the White farmers {{was seen as a}} mode of increasing national output as well as creating food self-sufficiency, but at the same time, this decreased food security for the Black population. Major changes in the South African government in 1994 attempted to address these inequalities, amongst other, by supporting small-scale farmers. However, the gap between White and Black producers has been closing very slowly. Small-scale farming faced a wide range of enterprise development challenges. As a response to these challenges, the Government enacted the New Co-operative Act No. 14 of 2005 to promote sustainable small business development by introducing the provision of incentives for agricultural co-operatives. This study has sought to determine the challenges and opportunities that are encountered in sustaining enterprise development and has used the Matabane Secondary Agricultural Co-operative (MSAC) as a case study. The goal is to develop strategies which can minimise the challenges and exploit the opportunities that will enable MSAC to realise its ultimate goal of improving livelihoods and reducing poverty. A review of current literature provided the secondary data for the study. The literature indicated the importance of social and physical capital in the sustainability of enterprise development. Social capital, in the context of sustainability of livelihoods, is defined as networks with shared norms, values and understandings that facilitate co-operation within the group. It can also be seen as the ability of the co-operative or group to secure benefits through membership in networks and other social structures (Finkelstein et al., 2007, Porters, 2000). Physical capital refers to any non-human asset made by humans and then used in the production process (Finkelstein et al, 2007, Porters, 2000). Primary data was collected using structured questionnaires delivered to 37 members of the MSAC. Thirty one members responded and were interviewed personally by the researcher. The questions were designed to investigate the challenges and opportunities faced by members and how they relate to social and physical capital. The results were analysed quantitatively using both descriptive and chi-squared statistical analysis. The results reflect the challenges and opportunities for enterprise development as perceived by co-operative members. The analysis explored this in terms of social and physical capital. The predominant challenges described were lack of access to finance and lack of mechanisation. The greatest opportunities seen were related to the bonds, bridges and linkages formed by co-operative members. Based on the assessment of the study, several recommendations were made. The introduction of a <b>Co-operative</b> Development <b>Fund</b> (CDF) would support and strengthen the co-operative financially, addressing both the issues of lack of access to finance and lack of mechanisation. On-site training programmes would enhance the members’ ability to participate in the decision making process of the co-operative and better manage their operations. The study has further shown that a lack of, or limited intra-governmental co-ordination proved {{to be one of the}} major challenging factors. It would be advantageous to organise an intergovernmental information service whose purpose would be to co-ordinate activities and pool resources of different agencies in their efforts to achieve common goals...|$|R
