40|$|This paper {{considers}} 3 D imaging {{of moving}} objects and introduces {{a technique that}} exploits visible and x-ray images to recover dense 3 D models. While recent methods such as tomography from cone-beam x-ray can advantageously replace more expensive and higher-dose CT scanners, they still require specific equipment and immobilised pa-tients. We investigate an alternative strategy that combines a single x-ray source {{and a set of}} <b>colour</b> <b>cameras</b> to capture rigidly moving samples. The <b>colour</b> <b>cameras</b> allow for coarse marklerless motion tracking, which is further refined with the x-ray information. Once the sample poses are correctly estimated, a dense 3 D attenuation model is recon-structed from the set of x-ray frames. Preliminary results on simulated data compared to ground-truth as well as actual in-vivo experiments are presented...|$|R

2500|$|Three {{navigation}} {{cameras were}} {{on board the}} rover: Two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal pixels × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks), coupled with five laser stripe projectors, which enabled stereoscopic images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90°. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this <b>colour</b> <b>camera</b> were arranged in such a way, {{that out of the}} 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue. As all cameras had lenses made out of zinc selenide, which blocks light below a wavelength of 500nm, no blue light actually reached these [...] "blue/infrared" [...] pixels, which therefore recorded only infrared.|$|E

5000|$|G.E. ceased {{production}} of its 3 x I.O., the type PC-25 in 1966. Meanwhile, {{the company had}} brought out, in 1965, a 4-tube vidicon camera, the GE PE-24, for film scanner use. [...] This was followed by an all-Plumbicon 4-tube camera, the type PE250, which used conventional relay optics, rather than the prism optics of some other <b>colour</b> <b>cameras.</b> This camera was later followed by the PE350 and PE400, which continued to use the 4-tube format. (G.E. maintained, at that time, that 4-tube cameras gave the best pictures).|$|R

40|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} appears {{for almost}} all lenses for imaging based on white light. The effect degrades image quality for both b/w and <b>colour</b> <b>cameras.</b> This paper discusses the possibilities of modelling chromatic aberration with self-calibrating bundle adjustment for high-precision photogrammetric 3 D point measurement using all three channels of a true colour image. After a survey on common types of digital colour sensors, wave-length dependent imaging errors of usual lenses are discussed. Consequently, different options for the correction of the occurring effects are derived. The resulting effect on image and object accuracy is verified by various test field calibrations using different combinations of digital <b>colour</b> <b>cameras</b> and lenses. For standard imaging configurations in close-range photogrammetry, a significant enhancement of inner precision {{by a factor of}} 1. 7 can be proven. It can be shown that the length measurement error for standardized imaging configurations can be improved slightly whereby final results are still on investigation. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{optronics}} of the FLW 100 {{are located}} in a container mounted behind the ammo box, located left of the gun. The sensors include a CCD <b>colour</b> <b>camera</b> with x10 magniciation, which offers an identification range of up to 1.5 km, and an uncooled thermal imager with a 640x480 resolution. The identification range of the thermal imager is 1 km.|$|E
40|$|Modern digital <b>colour</b> <b>cameras</b> {{are faced}} with a number of {{challenges}} in producing high-quality images, including noisy sensor measurements and chromatic aberration due to dispersion in the optics. In addition, most digital <b>colour</b> <b>cameras</b> use a single sensor combined with a set of colour filters to capture red, green and blue wavelengths of light at different spatial locations in a mosaic-like pattern. Hence, some form of interpolation, often called demosaicking, is required to produce a full colour image. These image restoration tasks are formulated as ill-posed inverse problems and solved through a regularisation inspired by the total variation (TV) denoising algorithm of Rudin, Osher and Fatemi. This leads to convex variational problems and edge-preserving image restorations. To solve these problems, an efficient primal-dual algorithm from convex analysis is adopted. In addition to some standard image restoration problems, we apply these methods to chromatic aberration and demosaicking. A TV-based demosaicking model is developed based on a decomposition of the image into luminance and chrominance components which are then regularised separately. The proposed method demonstrates improved results for demosaicking a set of standard test images...|$|R

5000|$|Following their visit, EMI quickly made an {{experimental}} 4-tube camera by cobbling together parts from an EMI Type 203 image orthicon studio camera with parts from an EMI Type 204 three-vidicon industrial <b>colour</b> <b>camera</b> [...] This camera was demonstrated to the BBC {{and received a}} lukewarm reception there. It produced sharp pictures, as expected, but there were problems with colorimetry. [...] Pictures of this camera {{can be found on}} various websites (it is not a pretty camera!). A production version of this camera, the EMI 2000, contained a similar complement of pick-up tubes, but was never built.|$|E

5000|$|EMI {{engineers}} {{visited the}} USA in 1963, {{in order to}} view RCA's new four-tube <b>colour</b> <b>camera,</b> the TK42. Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental camera using the same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by the cannibalization of parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image Orthicon monochrome studio camera, for the luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial <b>colour</b> <b>camera,</b> for the colour channels. This camera contained 3 Vidicon tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass dichroic mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated {{into the body of}} the experimental camera. The camera was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels. The experimental camera was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception. At that time, the BBC was evaluating an early Philips 3-tube camera which used some newly available Plumbicon pick-up tubes. It had been set up by BBC engineers to give highly saturated colour pictures and they were unimpressed by the 'tinted' pictures of the EMI camera. [...] In order to better judge the performance of the then existing cameras, the BBC organized comparison tests between the experimental EMI camera, a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera. In these tests, the colorimetry of the pictures from the EMI camera compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.|$|E
50|$|Before {{encoding}} {{video to}} MPEG-1, the color-space is transformed to Y'CbCr (Y'=Luma, Cb=Chroma Blue, Cr=Chroma Red). Luma (brightness, resolution) is stored separately from chroma (color, hue, phase) and even further separated into {{red and blue}} components. The chroma is also subsampled to 4:2:0, meaning it is reduced by one half vertically and one half horizontally, to just one quarter {{the resolution of the}} video.This software algorithm also has analogies in hardware, such as the output from a Bayer pattern filter, common in digital <b>colour</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
