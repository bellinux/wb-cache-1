50|$|In {{virtue of}} the {{particular}} nature and social importance of the industrial sector in which it operates, Sigma-Tau considers it fundamentally important to act in absolute respect of ethical principles and existing legislation, and {{make every effort to}} reach the highest quality standards. To this end, in 2002 Sigma-Tau adopted a Code of Ethics that clearly defines the behavioural rules and ethical principles that must be adhered to by everyone - employees, consultants, suppliers, <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> alike. Open-ended contracts are offered to 99% of employees, in testimony to the policy operated by the company to create stable and lasting relations with its workforce. This aspect is also reflected in the period of employment of staff, which averages around 17 years, highlighting the bond of loyalty and trust formed between the company and its staff. In 1967 Sigma-Tau became equipped with a water conditioning plant. Since 2005, the commitment to reduce impact on the environment in the elimination of solvents in aid of water in many preparations has produced continuing reduction in CO2 emissions that have fallen from 5,932 tons to 5,587 in 2007. Since 2007, Sigma-Tau has begun waste sorting and choosing eco-compatible materials. In the same year, in which Sigma-Tau’s environmental costs amounted to around 600,000 euros, a reduction of 8% in the quantity of industrial wastewater was confirmed.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{issues related to the}} {{financial}} viability of development have become increasingly important to the English planning system. As part of a wider shift towards the compartmentalisation of planning tasks, expert consultants are required to quantify, in an attempt to rationalise, planning decisions in terms of economic ‘viability’. Often with a particular focus on planning obligations, the results of development viability modelling have emerged as {{a key part of the}} evidence base used in site-specific negotiations and in planning policy formation. Focussing on the role of <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> other <b>stakeholders,</b> this paper investigates how development viability is tested in practice. It draws together literature on the role of calculative practices in policy formation, <b>client</b> feedback <b>and</b> influence in real estate appraisals <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> engagement <b>and</b> consultation in the planning literature to critically evaluate the role of <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> other interest groups in influencing the production and use of development viability appraisal models. The paper draws upon semi-structured interviews with the main producers of development viability appraisals to conclude that, whilst appraisals have the potential to be biased by <b>client</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> interests, there are important controlling influences on potential opportunistic behaviour. One such control is local authorities’ weak understanding of development viability appraisal techniques which limits their capacity to question the outputs of appraisal models. However, this also is of concern given that viability is now a central feature of the town planning system...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{support systems}} (DSSs) can help clients by {{presenting}} design solutions using virtual reality, and by offering relevant feedback such as costs, energy usage, distances and density. Using these systems, <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> can run 'what-if' scenarios on different design solutions {{and see the}} consequences of their changes.

Therefore this paper explores the use of ontologies. The use of an ontology enables further reuse of software components and software models. With this approach, several parts of software components can be reused and put together to quickly develop a customised DSS.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, geoscientists have been {{increasingly}} engaged in providing answers to complex environmental problems with significant societal, political, and economic consequences. Today, these scientists have to perform under increasingly greater visibility to <b>stakeholders</b> <b>and</b> the general public. Their activities are much more scrutinized with regards to economic pressure, litigation support and regulatory compliance than in the past. Their current work is built on decades of past work {{and in many cases}} will continue for decades to come. Stakeholders are increasingly evaluating raw data rather than just examining summaries in final reports. They also need assurance that proper data control and data quality procedures were followed. Geoscientists are now faced with a new paradigm, i. e. with the challenge of cost effectively collecting, managing, analyzing, and synthesizing enormous volumes of multidisciplinary and complex information. In addition, these data must be processed and disseminated in a way that allows the public to make informed and rational assessments on decisions that are proposed or have been made. The new paradigm is clear - <b>client</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> needs must be better met, and the systems used to store and generate data must meet these needs. This paper addresses the challenges and the implications of this new paradigm on geosciences information management in the 21 st Century.

40|$|Business {{sustainability}} is {{all about}} serving the needs of one’s customers, <b>clients,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> across the globe in a socially responsible and, thus, concomitantly an economic efficacious manner. Business is expected to achieve its core economic value in conformity with the values of morality and legality. That is, business must act in a profitable, legal, and moral manner. Today, moreover, {{above and beyond the}} responsibility to act legally and morally in the pursuit of profit is the notion of social responsibility, which typically is called “corporate social responsibility” (CSR). The law defines legal accountability; ethics determines moral accountability, but ascertaining the definition, nature, extent of, and rationales for the value of social responsibility emerges as an even more challenging task.

To answer such questions requires serious contemplation as to why their organization exists and how it remains relevant to its major <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> For garrison commanders, the first answer may be obvious based on the revised (in February 2011) mission of IMCOM to "provide Soldiers, Civilians and their Families with a quality of life commensurate {{with the quality of}} their service. " The latter question is much more elusive and gets to the heart of sustainability. Installations not only sustain the operational force; with their people, commanders provide essential support to community members in a responsible manner. It is therefore essential that garrison leaders consider the workforce as the enabling element of sustainable installations.
