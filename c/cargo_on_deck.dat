500|$|On {{the night}} of 19November 1918, when the steamer left Gränna it was loaded with iron stoves, plowshares, sewing {{machines}} and barrels of produce. All the cargo did not fit into the hold and a significant portion was stored unsecured on deck, making the ship top-heavy. The weather was bad {{and by the time}} the steamer was at sea a full storm was raging; the wind caused the <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> to shift, some of it falling overboard, further destabilizing the ship. The ship capsized and went down, stern first, just [...] from the next port, Hästholmen, killing all 24 people on board, including the Bauers. Most of the passengers had been trapped in their cabins.|$|E
50|$|The barge {{contains}} a spacious hold that was formerly used for transporting petroleum products, {{however it is}} now used exclusively to carry general <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> <b>deck.</b> Recent manifests have included wood chips and structural steel.|$|E
50|$|At least 80 {{people died}} when the ship, also {{carrying}} a large cargo of apples, capsized {{in the middle}} of the lake. The ship was on a trip from Grand Haven, Michigan, to Chicago, Illinois, and was spotted at 8:00 am on October 16 in heavy seas. Some time later, probably due to a shift in the <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> caused by the waves, it capsized and drifted northwest. On the 17th, debris including a piano came ashore in Holland, Michigan, while apples and wood debris were found at Saugatuck.|$|E
5000|$|The Interislander runs a {{train ferry}} (called rail ferries locally), , across Cook Strait between Wellington and Picton, {{carrying}} both road and rail <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> separate <b>decks.</b> [...] and Kaiarahi also serve this route, but carry road vehicles only.|$|R
5000|$|Combi {{aircraft}} carry <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> {{the main}} <b>deck</b> behind the passengers’ area with side loading {{and in the}} belly.|$|R
50|$|The loading, stowage and {{securing}} of general <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> and under <b>deck,</b> including special surveys of heavy or large items.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{two types}} of ships are used, the older, less-seen cargo ship and the more usual tugboat. While both types also haul barges, the cargo ship also carries <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> <b>deck.</b> Most Arctic {{communities}} {{do not have a}} port and cranes to unload the supplies but may have a simple dock. Where the community does not have a dock, the ship either must ground itself or the barges. Supplies are then removed by forklift truck which is also carried on board. The interior of the barges are used to carry fuel and other supplies are carried in containers on deck.|$|E

Most of the passengers had been trapped in their cabins.|$|E
50|$|A third ASDS barge, {{using the}} Marmac 303 barge, was built during 2015 in a Louisiana shipyard, and the barge transited the Panama Canal in June 2015 {{carrying}} its wing extensions as <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the <b>deck</b> because the ASDS, when complete, {{would be too}} wide {{to pass through the}} canal.|$|R
50|$|The barge was {{designed}} as a tanker barge to carry petroleum products, mostly fuel oil, in eight below-deck cargo tanks, in addition to <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the main <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each vessel has {{an overall}} length of 138.75m, {{a beam of}} 19,60m and a draught of less than 2m at forward and less than 5m at aft when fully loaded. The {{displacement}} of the vessel is 7,125t and the load carrying capacity is 1,180t, including a mix of vehicles or <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> open <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ConRo vessel is {{a hybrid}} of a RORO and a {{container}} ship. This type of vessel has a below-deck area used for vehicle storage while stacking containerized freight <b>on</b> the top <b>decks.</b> ConRo ships, {{such as those in}} the fleet of Atlantic Container Line, can carry a combination of 1,900 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers, up to 1,000 TEU of heavy equipment, project and oversized <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> three <b>decks,</b> and up to 2,000 automobiles <b>on</b> five <b>decks.</b> Separate internal ramp systems within the vessel segregate automobiles from other vehicles, Mafi trailers, and break-bulk cargo.|$|R
5000|$|Designed to {{hold baggage}} {{as well as}} freight, these {{compartments}} are called [...] "cargo bins", [...] "holds", or occasionally [...] "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may {{be referred to as}} <b>cargo</b> <b>decks</b> <b>on</b> the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors {{on the outside of the}} aircraft.|$|R
50|$|All that {{is needed}} to operate the kite is a winch and a storage area located towards the front of the ship, which can be fitted with little {{modification}} and at low cost. A sail, however, requires a mast to be installed, which is much more expensive and reduces the <b>cargo</b> area <b>on</b> the <b>deck</b> of the ship.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 747-200B Combi is {{a variant}} of the {{aircraft}} that permits the mixing of passengers and airfreight <b>on</b> the main <b>deck</b> according to load factors on any given route and Class B cargo compartment regulations. Flight 295 had 140 passengers and six pallets of <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the main <b>deck.</b> The master waybills stated that [...] of baggage and <b>cargo</b> were loaded <b>on</b> the plane. A Taiwanese customs official performed a surprise inspection of some of the cargo; he did not find any cargo that could be characterised as suspicious.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is not the}} {{differences}} but the loss of them that gives rise to violence and chaos... The loss forces men into a perpetual confrontation, one that strips them of all their distinctive characteristics – in short, of their [...] "identities." [...] Language itself is put in jeopardy. 'Each thing meets/ In mere oppugnancy:' the adversaries are reduced to indefinite objects, [...] "things" [...] that wantonly collide with each other like loose <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the <b>decks</b> of a storm-tossed ship. [...] The metaphor of the floodtide that transforms the earth's surface to a muddy mass is frequently employed by Shakespeare to designate the undifferentiated {{state of the world}} that is also portrayed in Genesis.|$|R
50|$|When the PLA Air Force {{started to}} test {{parachute}} extraction, these two design flaws caused a near disaster. The aircraft was flying too fast, {{and when the}} parachute started to extract cargo from the hold, the <b>cargo</b> rolled <b>on</b> the <b>deck</b> until {{it got to the}} 10 degree downward slope, and there it became airborne while still inside the aircraft. The cargo hit the top of the <b>cargo</b> door <b>on</b> the way out, making it clear that the Y-8 could not do parachute cargo extraction.|$|R
5000|$|Syrma {{arrived at}} Seeadler Harbor on 7 March; {{unloaded}} her cargo and tow; {{and began the}} return voyage to San Francisco on the 23d. She arrived on 13 April and remained there until 8 June when she sailed for Hawaii with YF-738 in tow. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 May, released the tow, and sailed the next day for Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. Tarawa was reached on the 28th. The ship unloaded her <b>cargo</b> and took <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> for the Marshall Islands and left the next day.|$|R
60|$|He {{had struck}} his head twice; he was dazed a little. He seemed to hear yet so plainly the clatter and bangs {{of the iron}} slice flying about his ears that he {{tightened}} his grip to prove to himself he had it there safely in his hand. He was vaguely amazed at the plainness with which down there {{he could hear the}} gale raging. Its howls and shrieks seemed to take on, in the emptiness of the bunker, something of the human character, of human rage and pain--being not vast but infinitely poignant. And there were, with every roll, thumps, too--profound, ponderous thumps, as if a bulky object of five-ton weight or so had got play in the hold. But {{there was no such thing}} in the <b>cargo.</b> Something <b>on</b> <b>deck?</b> Impossible. Or alongside? Couldn't be.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 March 1847, the Sovereign was wrecked in the South Passage off Amity Point, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland {{with the}} loss of 44 lives; there were 10 survivors. While the actions of Captain Cape in the {{disaster}} were praised by the survivors, many questions were subsequently raised about the fitness of the vessel for the voyage. An inspection of the wreck showed that the planking and fastenings were not in good condition; the inner planking was described as [...] "perfectly rotten". The engines were said to be suitable for river navigation but not for an ocean voyage to Brisbane. The storage of <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the <b>deck</b> was the direct cause of some deaths. There were no lifeboats (not being required at that time). The other concern was the use of the South Passage with its surf and shoals; while it was the shortest route from Sydney, it was not the safest entrance to Moreton Bay.|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand SAFE Air moved {{rail freight}} from Wellington (the North Island) across the Cook Strait to Blenheim (the South Island) and back, using Bristol Freighters, {{starting}} in 1951. The airline later reconfigured its aircraft to accept palletised <b>cargo</b> loaded <b>on</b> patented [...] "cargons". This {{was a first}} anywhere in the aviation world.Cargons were loaded near the rail yards and their load was calculated and arranged to remain within the aircraft's load and centre of gravity limits. They were then trucked {{to the airport and}} placed on the Freighter using a mechanical loading device. The loader accepted cargons from horizontal-tray road vehicles and then raised them {{to the level of the}} aircraft's <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> <b>on</b> electrically powered screw-jacks. The pallets could then be rolled into the nose of the aircraft. Other adaptations allowed the carrying of horses and other high-value large animals.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} into the tragedy discovered that the ship had nine hundred 5 gal cans of Astral lamp oil stored <b>on</b> <b>deck,</b> in direct contravention of maritime regulations which forbade the transport of such a dangerous <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> a passenger ship.|$|R
50|$|Two cargo holds and spaces, with a {{total of}} about 217,000 cubic feet, could be {{accessed}} by hatches <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> or by <b>cargo</b> ports <b>on</b> the vessel's side.|$|R
2500|$|William Turpel, {{owner of}} a marine railway in Victoria, testified that his company had hauled Sechelt {{out of the water}} on March 14, 1911 to repair her propeller, which, because one blade had been lost, the {{opposite}} blade had to be removed to keep the shaft in balance. In his opinion, without plenty of ballast, the boat was too tall and narrow to be a good sea boat. Harold G. Jarvis, her surviving owner testified to the contrary, that he felt, as an experienced seaman, that Sechelt was perfectly suitable for the Victoria-Sooke run and that when he and Captain James had inspected her when she was hauled out at Turpel's yard, they both found her to be in [...] "first-class" [...] condition. He did not consider the vessel top-heavy, and stated she had made several trips just before her loss in worse weather conditions, which on the 24th he characterized as [...] "fresh" [...] but not a gale. He said that on March 24, 1911, he had been aboard the vessel before she sailed. All the cargo was stowed as low as possible <b>on</b> the main <b>deck,</b> and no <b>cargo</b> was carried <b>on</b> the upper <b>deck,</b> nor did they ever carry <b>cargo</b> <b>on</b> the upper <b>deck.</b> He could not give an opinion as to the cause of the loss of the vessel, but thought it must have been due to a sudden accident or mechanical problem which caused her to veer out of control broadside to the wind.|$|R
50|$|A {{convertible}} version, {{the seats}} {{can be removed}} and <b>cargo</b> placed <b>on</b> the main <b>deck.</b>|$|R
25|$|The poop deck {{was above}} the cabin of Master Jones, on the ship's highest level above the stern on the aft castle. The poop house was <b>on</b> this <b>deck,</b> {{which may have been}} for passengers' use either for {{sleeping}} or <b>cargo.</b> <b>On</b> normal merchant ships, this space was probably a chart room or a cabin for the master's mates.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Officer/First mate (often {{called the}} Chief mate in the United States) {{is the head}} of the <b>deck</b> {{department}} <b>on</b> a merchant vessel, second-in-command after the ship's Master. The Chief mate's primary responsibilities are the vessel's cargo operations, its stability, and supervising the deck crew. The mate is responsible for the safety and security of the ship, as well as the welfare of the crew on board. The chief mate typically stands the 4-8 navigation watch as OICNW (officer in-charge of the navigational watch), directing the bridge team. Some crews have additional Third mates, which allow the Chief mate to not stand navigational watch, and focus more <b>on</b> <b>cargo</b> and <b>deck</b> operations. Additional duties include maintenance of the ship's hull, cargo gears, accommodations, life saving appliances and firefighting appliances. The chief mate also trains the crew and cadets on various aspects like safety, firefighting, search and rescue, and various other contingencies. The chief officer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the master.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> {{refers to}} being {{next in line}} to bat. In a {{professional}} game, the batter who is <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> traditionally waits in a location in the foul territory called the <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> circle.|$|R
50|$|In January 2014, {{the ship}} was docked Turku Repair Yard, Naantali. The Taxfree shop, Buffet Serenade, and Bistro Maxime {{restaurant}} <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 6 were extensively rebuilt, {{as well as the}} Sunflower Oasis <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 12 and the shops <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 7.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{all public}} spaces on board were located <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 6, with most {{passenger}} cabins <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 5, additional cabins {{on the sides}} of the car <b>deck</b> <b>on</b> <b>decks</b> 3 & 4, and deluxe cabins <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 7. Originally the interiors were decorated in contemporary modernist style, with bright colours combined with dark brown, psychedelic patterns in curtains and dark wood veneer used on many walls, particularly in the cabins.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{steamboat}} was {{not very}} large. There was no saloon <b>on</b> <b>deck,</b> and no awning, but only seats <b>on</b> <b>deck,</b> and many people sitting on them.|$|R
5000|$|Facilities {{consisted}} of a small general store and gift shop, a coffee shop <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 2, an [...] "English"-themed bar <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> 4 with an evening DJ, and a cocktail bar and hot tub <b>on</b> the upper <b>deck.</b>|$|R
60|$|The crew {{assembled}} hastily <b>on</b> <b>deck,</b> {{and most}} of them were under the belief that a frightful hurricane was pending; but the captain, coming <b>on</b> <b>deck,</b> soon explained the phenomena.|$|R
5000|$|Late on the {{afternoon}} of 23 July, while the carrier lay alongside Pier 7, NOB Norfolk, 32 Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots reported on board [...] "for temporary duty". At 06:30 the following day, Wasps crew watched an interesting <b>cargo</b> come <b>on</b> board, hoisted <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> by the ship's cranes: 30 P-40Cs and three PT-17 trainers from the AAF 33rd Pursuit Squadron, 8th Air Group, Air Force Combat Command, home-based at Mitchel Field, New York. Three days later, four newspaper correspondents - including the noted journalist Fletcher Pratt — came on board.|$|R
50|$|Loch Ard {{departed}} England on 1 March 1878, {{bound for}} Melbourne, commanded by Captain Gibb {{and with a}} crew of 17 men. It was carrying 37 passengers and assorted <b>cargo.</b> <b>On</b> 1 June, the ship was approaching Melbourne and expecting to sight land when it encountered heavy fog. Unable to see the Cape Otway lighthouse, the captain was unaware how close he was running to the coast. The fog lifted around 4am, revealing breakers and cliff faces. Captain Gibb quickly ordered sail to be set to come about and get clear of the coast, but {{they were unable to}} do so in time, and ran aground on a reef. The masts and rigging came crashing down, killing some people <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> and preventing the lifeboats from being launched effectively. The ship sank within 10 or 15 minutes of striking the reef.|$|R
