40|$|Options for vehicle {{configurations}} {{are reviewed}} in which nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) propulsion {{is used for}} a reference mission to Mars. The scenario assumes an opposition-class Mars transfer trajectory, a 435 -day mission, {{and the use of}} a single nuclear engine with 75, 000 lbs of thrust. Engine parameters are examined by calculating mission variables for a range of specific impulses and thrust/weight ratios. The reference mission is found to have optimal values of 925 s for the specific impulse and thrust/weight ratios of 4. 0 and 0. 06 for the engine and total stage ratios respectively. When the engine thrust/weight ratio is at least 4 / 1 the most <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> <b>parameter</b> is engine specific impulse for reducing overall stage weight. In the context of this trans-Mars three-burn maneuver the NTR engine with an expander engine cycle is considered a more effective alternative than chemical/aerobrake and other propulsion options...|$|E

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) is an advanced low-temperature combustion technology {{being considered for}} internal combustion engines due to its potential for high fuel conversion efficiency and extremely low emissions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). In its simplest form, HCCI combustion involves the auto-ignition of a homogeneous mixture of fuel, air, and diluents at low to moderate temperatures and high pressure. Previous {{research has indicated that}} fuel chemistry has a strong impact on HCCI combustion. This paper reports the preliminary results of an experimental and modeling study of HCCI combustion using n-heptane, a volatile hydrocarbon with well known fuel chemistry. A Co-operative Fuel Research (CFR) engine was modified by the addition of a port fuel injection system to produce a homogeneous fuel-air mixture in the intake manifold, which contributed to a stable and repeatable HCCI combustion process. Detailed experiments were performed to explore the effects of <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> such as intake temperature, compression ratio, air/fuel ratio, engine speed, turbocharging, and intake mixture throttling on HCCI combustion. The influence of these parameters on the phasing of the low-temperature reaction, main combustion stage, and negative temperature coefficient delay period are presented and discussed. A single-zone numerical simulation with detailed fuel chemistry was developed and validated. The simulations show good agreement with the experimental data and capture important combustion phase trends as <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> are varied.

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{presents}} {{design considerations}} {{to be taken}} in designing of a low temperature differential double-acting Stirling engine for solar application. The target power source will be a thermosiphon solar water heater with integrated storage system, which will supply a constant source temperature of 70 8 C. Hence, the system design is based on a temperature difference of 50 8 C, assuming that the sink is kept at 20 8 C. During the preliminary design stage, the <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> of the <b>engine</b> design are determined according to the Schmidt analysis, while the third order analysis was used during the design optimisation stage in order to establish a complete analytical model for the engine. The heat exchangers are designed to be of high effectiveness and low pressure-drop, and are made from a 0. 015 m tube, while the porosity of the steel wool of 0. 722 is used for the regenerator matrix. Upon optimisation, the optimal engine speed is 120 rpm with the swept volume of 2. 3 l, and thus the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> are found to be the bore diameter of 0. 20 m. In addition, the volumes of heater, cooler and regenerator are 1. 3 l, 1. 3 l and 2. 0 l volumes, respectively...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the gas in the engine is highest just before the turbine, and the ability for the turbine to withstand these temperatures {{is one of the}} primary restrictions on total dry engine thrust. This temperature is known as the Turbine Entry Temperature (TET), one of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> operating <b>parameters.</b> Because a combustion rate high enough to consume all the intake oxygen would create temperatures high enough to overheat the turbine, the flow of fuel must be restricted to an extent that fuel rather than oxygen becomes the limiting factor in the reaction, leaving some oxygen to flow past the turbine. After passing the turbine, the gas expands at a near constant entropy, thus losing temperature. The afterburner then injects fuel downstream of the turbine and reheats the gas. In conjunction with the added heat, the pressure rises in the tailpipe and the gas is ejected through the nozzle at a higher velocity. The mass flow is also slightly increased by the addition of the fuel.|$|R

40|$|A {{gas turbine}} engine control system {{maintains}} a selected level of engine performance despite the failure or abnormal operation {{of one or more}} <b>engine</b> <b>parameter</b> sensors. The control system employs a continuously updated engine model which simulates engine performance and generates signals representing real time estimates of the <b>engine</b> <b>parameter</b> sensor signals. The estimate signals are transmitted to a control computational unit which utilizes them in lieu of the actual <b>engine</b> <b>parameter</b> sensor signals to control the operation of the engine. The estimate signals are also compared with the corresponding actual <b>engine</b> <b>parameter</b> sensor signals and the resulting difference signals are utilized to update the engine model.

50|$|Airworthiness Standards and Certification Specifications (§ 23.149 and § 25.149) {{require the}} {{manufacturer}} {{to determine a}} minimum control speed at which the airplane is controllable after failure of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> and publish this speed in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual. The published Minimum Control Speeds (VMC's) of the aircraft are measured while the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> fails or is inoperative, hence, {{the effect of the}} failure of the <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> is included in the published VMC's. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual VMC that the pilot experiences in-flight will be a bit lower, which is safer, but this decrement is not documented. The <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> {{is just one of the}} factors that influences the VMC's of the aircraft. The published VMC's are therefore safe, whatever engine fails or is inoperative. Hence, (airline) pilots should not have to know about the criticality of an <b>engine.</b> The <b>critical</b> <b>engine</b> is defined in Aviation Regulations for use by airplane tail design engineers for sizing the tail, and by experimental test pilots for measuring VMC's in-flight. Other factors, like bank angle and thrust, have a much greater effect on VMC's than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} artificial neural networks virtual sensors in emissions prediction and control for a gasoline engine. Tailpipe emissions and <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> were first measured experimentally to form a comprehensive database for network training and testing. Individual predictive models were constructed using the optimization layer-by-layer neural network. Simulation results demonstrated that the networks, as virtual sensors, can accurately predict the <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> and emissions quantitatively and qualitatively with RMS errors below 9 %. The second part of this paper then presents a virtual sensor control model which is {{the combination of the}} two individual emissions and engine predictive models developed previously. The main objective of this part is to control the exhaust emissions within the desired limits by predicting optimum <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> with the use of artificial neural network virtual sensors. Results showed that the emissions levels were successfully controlled within the defined limits, with maximum tolerance of 6 %. This first part of this paper demonstrated that with the use of artificial neural network virtual sensors, emissions and <b>engine</b> <b>parameters</b> can be accurately predicted. Hence with accurate virtual sensors, emissions were then controlled within the desired limits by optimizing the <b>engine</b> <b>parameters.</b> This proposed work demonstrated a viable and accurate methodology in emissions predictive and control.
