40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new type}} of dynamical model for hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters in which gas moves simultaneously in both radial directions. <b>Circulation</b> <b>flows</b> are consistent with (1) the failure to observe cooling gas in X-ray spectra, (2) multiphase gas observed near the centers of these flows and (3) the accumulation of iron in the hot gas from Type Ia supernovae in the central galaxy. Dense inflowing gas cools, producing a positive central temperature gradient, as in normal cooling flows. Bubbles of hot, buoyant gas <b>flow</b> outward. <b>Circulation</b> <b>flows</b> eventually cool catastrophically if the outward flowing gas transports mass but no heat; to maintain the circulation both mass and energy must be supplied to the inflowing gas over a large volume, extending to the cooling radius. The rapid radial recirculation of gas produces a flat central core in the gas iron abundance, similar to many observations. We believe the <b>circulation</b> <b>flows</b> described here are the first gasdynamic, long-term evolutionary models that are in good agreement with all essential features observed in the hot gas: little or no gas cools as required by XMM spectra, the gas temperature increases outward near the center, and the gaseous iron abundance is about solar near the center and decreases outward.

The tested pulsating heat pipe, consisting of 6 turns, is fully made of {{quartz glass tubes}} with 6 mm outer diameter and 2 mm inner diameter. The filling ratio is 70 %. Wall temperature fluctuations of several key positions are recorded under a series charge of heat inputs.

In comparison, the triple effect system is used when high levels of effective evaporation are needed with minimum labour. In this design, the liquid enters the third effect at a low temperature {{and moves to the}} second stream in which concentration is increased due to the previous evaporation effect.

50|$|A new {{software}} upload in September 2008 necessitated a brief shutdown of the NICMOS cooling system. Several attempts {{to restart the}} cooling system were unsuccessful due to issues with the cryogenic circulator. After waiting more than six weeks for parts of the instrument to warm up, and theorized ice particles to sublimate from the neon circulating loop, the cooler once again failed to restart. An Anomaly Review Board (ARB) was then convened by NASA. The ARB concluded that ice or other solid particle migrated from the dewar to the circulator during the September 2008 restart attempt and that the circulator may be damaged, and determined an alternative set of startup parameters. A successful restart at 13:30 EST on 16 December 2008 led to four days of cooler operations followed by another shutdown. On 1 August 2009, the cooler was restarted again; NICMOS was expected to resume operations in mid-February 2010 and operated through October 22, 2009, at which point a lock-up of Hubble’s data handling system caused the telescope to shut down. The <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> rate to NICMOS was greatly reduced during this operating period confirming blockage in the circulation loop. Continued operation at reduced flow rates would limit NICMOS science so plans for purging and refilling the circulation system with clean neon gas were developed by NASA. The circulation loop is equipped with an extra neon tank and remotely operated solenoid valves for on-orbit purge-fill operations. As of 2013, these purge-fill operations {{have not yet been}} performed.|$|E
40|$|Natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flows</b> {{can develop}} within a reactor coolant system (RCS) during certain severe reactor accidents, {{transferring}} decay {{energy from the}} core {{to other parts of}} the RCS. The associated heatup of RCS structures can lead to pressure boundary failures; with notable vulnerabilities in the pressurizer surge line, the hot leg nozzles, and the steam generator (SG) tubes. The potential for a steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) is of particular concern because fission products could be released to the environment through such a failure. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) developed a program to address SG tube integrity issues in operating pressurized water reactors (PWRs) based on the possibility for environmental release. An extensive effort to evaluate the potential for accident-induced SGTRs using SCDAP/RELAP 5 at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) was directed as one part of the NRC program. All SCDAP/RELAP 5 calculations performed during the INEEL evaluation were based on station blackout accidents (and variations thereof) because those accidents are considered to be one of the more likely scenarios leading to natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flows</b> at temperatures and pressures that could threaten SG tube integrity (as well as the integrity of other vulnerable RCS pressure boundaries). Variations that were addressed included consideration of the effects of RCP seal leaks, intentional RCS depressurization through pressurizer PORVs, SG secondary depressurization, DC-HL bypass flows, U-tube SG sludge accumulation, and quenching of upper plenum stainless steel upon relocation to the lower head. Where available, experimental data was used to guide simulation of natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flows.</b> Independent reviews of the applicability of the natural circulation experimental data, the suitability of the code, and the adequacy of the modeling were completed and review recommendations were incorporated into the evaluation within budget and schedule limitations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> {{in solid}} breeder blanket designs with poloidal coolant channels under a LOFA condition. Analyses couple the flow transient behaviors with transient heat transport models. While two-phase natural circulation {{exists in the}} system, a homogenous mixture model is used. The results of example calculations performed for an ITER solid breeder design concept indicate that in a 3 -loop system with an elevation head (AZ) of 20 m, {{the removal of the}} afterheat (energy stored in the blanket elements and decay heat) depends on two-phase natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> with a quasi-equilibrium flow quality of 26 % at the outlet of the blanket segment. However, if the available hydrostatic head is about 15 m or less, the amount of natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> is reduced ue to significant increases of friction and acceleration losses in a two-phase ystem. To rely on natural <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> as an afterheat removal mechanism, the design of coolant system with its flow channels should be addressed analytically and experimentally to permit stable steady-state operation under conditions of the presence ofvapor in the coolant channels. 1...|$|E
