50|$|Though {{electricity}} generation capabilities are comparable between all {{these types of}} reactor, due to the aforementioned features, and the extensive experience with operations of the LWR, it is favored {{in the vast majority}} of new nuclear power plants. In addition, light-water reactors make up the vast majority of reactors that power naval nuclear-powered vessels. Four out of the five great powers with nuclear naval propulsion <b>capacity</b> <b>use</b> light-water reactors exclusively: the British Royal Navy, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, the French Marine nationale, and the United States Navy. Only the Russian Federation's Navy has used a relative handful of liquid-metal cooled reactors in production vessels, specifically the Alfa class submarine, which used lead-bismuth eutectic as a reactor moderator and coolant, but the vast majority of Russian nuclear-powered boats and ships use light-water reactors exclusively. The reason for near exclusive LWR use aboard nuclear naval vessels is the level of inherent safety built into these types of reactors. Since light water is used as both a coolant and a neutron moderator in these reactors, if one of these reactors suffers damage due to military action, leading to a compromise of the reactor core's integrity, the resulting release of the light-water moderator will act to stop the nuclear reaction and shut the reactor down. This capability is known as a negative void coefficient of reactivity.|$|E

Recently, however, domestic inflation pressures have remained subdued despite near record levels of <b>capacity</b> <b>use.</b> This raises the question of whether the link between high capacity utilization and inflation has been broken. This paper explores the issue econometrically by testing the stability over time of two alternative specifications – a standard Phillips curve and one that incorporates changes in inflation regimes. Both specifications indicate that although there existed a positive and stable relationship between <b>capacity</b> <b>use</b> and inflation prior to the mid- 1980 s, this relationship breaks down after that time. Indeed, after 1986, econometric tests reject the hypothesis that capacity utlitization rates can provide any information about changes in inflation...|$|E

40|$|As {{a way of}} {{increasing}} the percent of <b>capacity</b> <b>use</b> of grain related facilities, discriminatory pricing system is attended. In order to introduce the system, {{it is necessary that}} the elasticity of demand for rice drying service to utility fee varies among rice farmers. But, there has been no study that tried {{to examine the relationship between}} the elasticity and characteristics of farmer (e. g. size of paddy rice field). This article aimed to explore the possibility of introducing a discriminatory pricing system to grain related facilities for increasing the percent of <b>capacity</b> <b>use.</b> Through a choice-based conjoint analysis of rice farmer's choice of rice drying types, following results are obtained. First, factors which determine rice farmer's choice are utility fee, length of staying at facility (staying time), closing time of receiving harvested paddy rice from farmers, size of paddy rice filed, occupation of drying equipment, and main crop. Besides, labor and conflict of harvesting paddy rice with operation of other crops are included for large farmers. Second, marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for staying time and closing time per hour are 190 yen and 101 yen per 60 kg, respectively. The reason which MWTP for staying time is greater than that for closing time is that rice farmers can't do anything while staying at facility. Third, the utility fee elasticity varies among size of paddy rice filed. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that discriminatory pricing with respect to size of paddy rice filed makes possible to increase the percent of <b>capacity</b> <b>use...</b>|$|E
40|$|The 60 -year-old Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} has deeply influenced {{the evolution of}} the Palestinian economy. In the last two decades political instability and the Israeli closure policy have generated protracted economic stagnation and poor capital formation. The paper describes the consequences on the Palestinian economy of existing high transaction costs and market fragmentation. We propose a simple one-sector Post-Keynesian model that describes Palestine as a demand-driven economy. We show that high transaction costs and market fragmentation discourage investment by curtailing expected profitability, reducing the size of the market and depressing entrepreneurs' animal spirits. In the short run, these two factors induce low levels of capacity utilization and low rates of capital accumulation. The situation is even more worrying in the long run when entrepreneurs can revise their expectations. Depressed animal spirits and low levels of <b>capacity</b> <b>use</b> give rise to a low-growth trap from which Palestine can hardly escape. We also highlight the possible positive impact of the removal of high transaction costs and of market fragmentation, and the ensuing beneficial effects on the long-run equilibrium values of capital accumulation and <b>capacity</b> <b>use.</b> The conclusions place these analytical results into the historical situation of the Palestinian economy, and consider what is needed, politically and economically, in order to establish a sustained development process...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally Dutch {{hospitals}} are organized in a functional way. Nowadays, {{hospitals are}} in the middle of a transition towards a process-oriented organization. In a process-oriented hospital, services are organized around the needs of specific patient groups. In order to accelerate the transition, patient logistics is made one of the priorities of the national quality improvement programme Better Faster. The logistic sub-programme consists of three improvement projects: Working Without Waiting list, Operating Theatre and Business Process Redesign. Aim of the programme is to realize considerable performance improvements in terms of <b>capacity</b> <b>use</b> and service delivery to patients. The programme also supports the development towards a process-oriented organization. This article describes the programme’s feasibility and the accompanying factors for success- and failure of the development towards the process-oriented organisation by comparing the program theory to insights from (inter) national literature. Different theorists agree on the nature of necessary steps, but there is no consensus on their sequence. It is uncertain whether proposed improvement actions, aimed at optimal <b>capacity</b> <b>use,</b> optimal service delivery and development towards a process-oriented organisation, have to be implemented simultaneous or step by step. However, it is more than likely, regardless of the eventual sequence, implementation of the projects will lead to conflicting interests, that threaten the general conditions for their successful implementation.
