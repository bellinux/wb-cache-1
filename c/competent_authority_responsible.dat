40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and reliability of}} the EU ETS depends for a substantial part {{on the level of}} compliance in each of the 31 participating states. A lack of compliance in even one or just a few participating countries may harm the functioning of the ETS in the entire EU. So far, attention for compliance of the EU ETS has been mainly focused on harmonization of the MRV-process and {{on the role of the}} verifiers in the MRV-process. Little or no attention is paid to enforcement of the EU ETS by the <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> in the participating states. We have researched whether in the third phase the compliance mechanism of the EU ETS has sufficiently improved in terms of effectiveness with a specific focus on the role of competent enforcement agencies in the participating countries. From empirical research in a number of EU Member States, we conclude that the final, essential element of the compliance cycle, i. e., administrative and criminal enforcement by the domestic authorities in the Member States is not overall effective. In order to increase resilience and reliability of the EU’s central instrument to achieve future climate change targets, we suggest that more efforts should be undertaken to harmonize the practice of the national <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for the enforcement of the EU ETS...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for the {{implementation}} of the Seveso Directive in their countries have, amongst others, the task of reviewing the safety reports of Seveso-type installations. This activity involves the examination of the hazard identification as well as the results of the frequency and consequence assessment of the identified accident scenarios. This verification activity might be very cumbersome and time consuming if the models and software tools used by the Authority are different from those used by the Operator. This is {{due to the lack of}} interoperability among the large number of software tools available for risk analysis, all considered acceptable by the scientific community. Considering that a relevant percentage of input data requested by the different tools is common, the software interoperability would strongly and effectively reduce the burden of work of authorities. Furthermore, the software interoperability in risk analysis would be very valuable also to operators and to models and software developers. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of a feasibility study, recently completed by the authors, aimed at identifying the main problems associated with the definition of a common data exchange format for a fundamental phase of the risk analysis procedure: the assessment of accident consequences.

40|$|In Europe, about 353 km 3 {{of water}} are {{abstracted}} {{every year from}} natural resources. Water resources are used for very diverse activities including, energy production, agriculture, domestic uses and industry. Competing uses between the different sectors can lead to overabstraction where demand exceeds resources availability. The 2012 Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Water Resources identified non-authorised water abstractions, i. e. water abstractions without permits or exceeding the authorised amounts, {{as a cause of}} overabstraction and advocates the surveillance of water abstractions in each Member State. This thesis report aims at studying the potential of Earth Observation technologies to detect non-authorised water abstractions. It briefly introduces the existing legal framework for water abstraction in Europe in order to better understand current challenges for the detection of non-authorised water abstraction and tries to assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} methods, for the detection of illegal withdrawals, relying on Earth Observation-derived data. The combination of field measurements with Earth Observation-derived information addresses a certain number of issues experienced with the traditional field measurements alone approach (e. g. time and cost efficiency). However, it does not solve other issues related to governance and administrative aspects and heavily relies on weather and climatic conditions, which make Earth Observation methods non compatible with some regions in the European Union (EU). Besides this approach requires having access to a large number of data and major efforts are necessary to ensure a good coordination and communication between the different <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for the management of water abstractions and the entities which own the required data...|$|R

The methodology in the field of safety analysis including associated assessment criteria and procedures has evolved rapidly since implementing the new regulations [2]. New aspects relating to analysis and assessment methodologies are summarized in this paper. All relevant chemical, physical and technical properties of the materials used are assessed in detail in relation to clear and comprehensible documentation with respect to the qualification. BAM requires without exception, clear and detailed descriptions of the concepts and the aims for the primary mechanical and thermal demonstrations. The consequences of the safety concept choice on the package design safety analysis must be clear {{at the beginning of the}} type testing. The concept significantly influences the depth of an experimental or calculation proof. All relevant boundary conditions with respect to TS-R- 1 [2] must be taken into account, e. g. the assessment of stresses, strains and fracture mechanical considerations from- 40 °C until maximum operational and thermal accident temperature. In the containment analysis, BAM requires detailed and comprehensive qualification of seals as well as a calculation of an activity release based on well specified release values, depending on the radioactive contents. Concerning quality assurance, a fully aligned program for manufacturing, assembling, operation and maintenance is necessary to get the compliance control with the SAR before starting any manufacturing process...|$|R

These Guidelines, developed by the EWGLUP and agreed by the Member States at the 16 th meeting of the Committee of <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (Porvoo, October 2006), were adopted by the European Commission on 7 June 2007. A preliminary research, exploring the state-of art of the implementation of Art 12 within the 25 Member States (MS) was conducted in 2004 by the Major Accident Hazard Bureau of JRC {{in the form of a}} questionnaire-based survey. Final results were collected, analysed and finally updated up to spring 2007. A group of MS ¿ the Netherlands, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom ¿ was selected for further analysis and invited to comment and revise the result of the investigation. The European Working Group on Land-Use Planning has, in addition to the development of Guidelines for implementation of Article 12 of the Seveso II Directive, as amended by Directive 105 / 2003 /EC, taken part at the development of this document as a supporting tool addressing the issue of LUP in the context of hazardous facilities. The document provides supplementary information material describing in detail 'good LUP practices' available within selected Member States and it has a twofold objective. Firstly, it reports the results of the survey concerning 'good practice' for LUP in the context of the Seveso II. Secondly, it proposes implementation Roadmaps fulfilling Art. 12 requirements. In that context it should be noted that its character is purely descriptive and informative and it cannot be used for guidance or normative purposes. At the same time, it is believed that the structured information provided can substantially help the Seveso <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> and planning authorities to deal with the land-use planning issue.

40|$|Abstract Background Hygiene {{inspections}} on passenger {{ships are}} important {{for the prevention of}} communicable diseases. The European Union (EU) countries conduct hygiene inspections on passenger ships {{in order to ensure that}} appropriate measures have been taken to eliminate potential sources of contamination which could lead to the spread of communicable diseases. This study was implemented within the framework of the EU SHIPSAN project and it investigates the legislation applied and practices of hygiene inspections of passenger ships in the EU Member States (MS) and European Free Trade Association countries. Methods Two questionnaires were composed and disseminated to 28 countries. A total of 92 questionnaires were completed by <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for hygiene inspections (n = 48) and the creation of legislation (n = 44); response rates were 96 %, and 75. 9 %, respectively. Results Out of the 48 responding <b>authorities</b> <b>responsible</b> for hygiene inspections, a routine programme was used by 19 (39. 6 %) of these to conduct inspections of ships on national voyages and by 26 (54. 2 %) for ships on international voyages. Standardised inspection forms are used by 59. 1 % of the authorities. A scoring inspection system is applied by five (11. 6 %) of the 43 responding authorities. Environmental sampling is conducted by 84. 1 % of the authorities (37 out of 44). The inspection results are collected and analysed by 54. 5 % (24 out of 44) of the authorities, while 9 authorities (20. 5 %) declared that they publish the results. Inspections are conducted during outbreak investigations by 75 % and 70. 8 % of the authorities, on ships on national and international voyages, respectively. A total of 31 (64. 6 %) and 39 (81. 3 %) authorities conducted inspections during complaint investigations on ships on international and on national voyages, respectively. Port-to-port communication between the national port authorities was reported by 35. 4 % (17 out of 48) of the responding authorities and 20. 8 % (10 out of 48) of the port authorities of other countries. Conclusion This study revealed a diversity of approaches and practices in the conduct of inspections, differences in the qualifications/knowledge/experience of inspectors, the legislation applied during inspections, and the lack of communication and training among many EU countries. An integrated European inspection programme involving competent expert inspectors in each EU Member States and special training for ship hygiene delivered to crew members and inspectors would help to minimize the risk of communicable diseases. Common inspection tools at a European level for hygiene inspection practices and port-to-port communication are needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scheme}} of the {{notification}} of new substances (Directive 67 / 548 /EEC) polymers are subject to special rules. The term polymer was further defined in the 7 th amendment (92 / 32 /EEC) of the Directive. This change means that some substances which {{were considered to be}} polymers under the reporting rules when the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS) was being established are no longer considered to be polymers under the 7 th amendment. Polymers were not reportable for EINECS. As all substances which are not present in the EINECS inventory are notifiable, all "no-longer polymers" should in theory be notified. However, at the time when the 7 th amendment was adopted, the Council of Ministers made it clear that these no-longer polymers should not, retrospectively, become subject to notification. To facilitate the work of national <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> and the industry the Commission was requested to draw up a list of no-longer polymers. Substances to be included in this list have been on the EU market between September 18, 1981, and October 31, 1993 and satisfy the requirement that they were considered to be polymers under the reporting rules for EINECS but are no longer considered to be polymers under the 7 th amendment. Therefore to create the no-longer polymer list industry was asked to submit their candidates. The attached list is based on these submissions. The list is not an exhaustive list. The <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> are the <b>responsible</b> bodies, who shall decide whether a substance is a no-longer polymer or not but as a basis, they have decided that all the substances included in the attached list are to be regarded as no-longer polymers.
