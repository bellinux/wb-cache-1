They go to the {{hospital}} to gain answers, and it is revealed that Mercedes baby had died and they ask her to prepare for induced labour. Mercedes is devastated and later goes to find Joe for support but is left further heartbroken when his half-brother, Jason Roscoe (Alfie Browne-Sykes), tells her that he has left the village following their argument. She is left to face giving birth alone, but is relieved when her family arrive to support her. After giving birth to her son who she decides to name Gabriel, Mercedes is left overwhelmed with grief and the funeral costs. Theresa decides to help raise money for the funeral by doing a naked photo shoot. However, even after the money for the funeral had been gathered, Mercedes is still left heartbroken and distraught. Theresa then decides to make a phonecall to Myra, informing her of the situation and begs her to <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> <b>At</b> Gabriel's funeral, Myra finds Mercedes sitting on the outside bench, and comforts her as she apologize to her for faking her death last year. Mercedes is delighted to see her and they make amends. Her family arrange a mini memorial service for Gabriel at their home where she says goodbye to him. When Joe finds out that Gabriel has died, he finds Mercedes and reveals he is still in love with her and they decide to go on holiday together. On New Year's Eve, Mercedes tells Joe the truth that he is Gabriel's father. Joe is devastated and breaks up with her, and sleeps with Lindsey in retaliation. He later reconciles with Mercedes.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{credited}} her longevity {{to eating}} a fried egg sandwich every day. However doctors reputedly {{thought it could}} be due to her job as a clerk at an engineering firm for fifty years, which she retired from at the age of 75. The company was based on top a steep hill in Woodhouse, Leeds. [...] "She would walk up that hill, <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> lunchtime and then back up it" [...] commented a grandson. Baldwin's daughter believes her mother's longevity was due to no drinking, no smoking and hard work. Baldwin spent time in hospital in her 70s due to cataracts.|$|E

2500|$|According to two American {{officials}} {{who are involved in}} Afghan issues said that the senior American commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen wanted to keep a significant military capability through the fighting season ending in fall 2013, which could translate to a force of more than 60,000 troops until the end of that period. The United States has not [...] "begun considering any specific recommendations for troop numbers in 2013 and 2014," [...] said George Little, the Pentagon spokesman. [...] "What is true is that in June 2011 the president made clear that our forces would continue to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> a steady pace as we transition to an Afghan lead for security. That it still the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|Living in {{such close}} {{proximity}} caused numerous frictions between soldiers and residents. In 1679, a magistrate complained that citizens {{had to give}} over [...] "three, four, five or six beds, along with linen and blankets" [...] to [...] "soldiers who were most often violent, drunk, and difficult, who mistreated them [...] stole their linen and furniture, and chased them from their own homes". Ruffian soldiers would <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> night drunk, leaving the house doors open being noisy. The Spanish troops were apparently particularly undisciplined. When lodging in barracks was introduced, discipline improved considerably, though conflicts with residents did not disappear entirely. In the 18th century, there were still examples of Austrian officers who moved into rooms more spacious than the ones they had been assigned; others would bring girls of low repute to their house at night, to the alarm of their civilian landlords.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's a nice thing to play and <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> the end of the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas {{and fell in love with}} her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep. [...] I used to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> nights from a banquet or something and people would call me sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E
