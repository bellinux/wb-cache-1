40|$|For {{a growing}} number of indications, <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common due in part to their superior efficacy, as compared to monotherapies. In fact, in the case of infectious diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> are now the standard of care. With the emergence of drug-device combinations, genetic testing, and individualized medicine, this trend towards <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> is likely to continue to grow. In this context the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> is a critical component that needs to be understood by medical practitioners, payors and policy makers. There are three factors to consider in the pricing of combination therapies: the characteristics and structure of the market in which the combined product is sold, the absence or presence of market exclusivity, and the prices of the components of the combined product, when sold individually. When {{one or more of the}} components of the combined product has market exclusivity, additional factors such as exclusionary bundling, tying, and double marginalization may come into play. (cont.) In this thesis I discuss <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> describe the factors that can affect the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> and then attempt to identify the relationships among component pricing, market forces, market exclusivity and the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> To illustrate these relationships empirically, I will analyze data from a sample of unified combined drugs, a subset of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> The results of this analysis are consistent with a hypothesis that, for combination drugs with a patented ingredient, the elimination of double marginalization by efficient transfer pricing and economic and exclusionary bundling, lowers the price of the unified combination drug relative to the price of its constituents. b y Sundar Subramaniam.

40|$|OBJECTIVES The {{morphogen}} pathways Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch {{are attractive}} targets for antifibrotic therapies in systemic sclerosis. Interference with stem cell regeneration, however, may complicate {{the use of}} morphogen pathway inhibitors. We therefore tested the hypothesis that <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> with low doses of Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch inhibitors maybe safe and effective {{for the treatment of}} fibrosis. METHODS Skin fibrosis was induced by bleomycin and by overexpression of a constitutively active TGF-β receptor type I. Adverse events were assessed by clinical monitoring, pathological evaluation and quantification of Lgr 5 -positive intestinal stem cells. RESULTS Inhibition of Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch signalling dose-dependently ameliorated bleomycin-induced and active TGF-β receptor type I-induced fibrosis. <b>Combination</b> <b>therapies</b> with low doses of Hedgehog/Wnt inhibitors or Hedgehog/Notch inhibitors demonstrated additive antifibrotic effects in preventive as well as in therapeutic regimes. <b>Combination</b> <b>therapies</b> were well tolerated. In contrast with high dose monotherapies, <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> did not reduce the number of Lgr 5 positive intestinal stem cells. CONCLUSIONS Combined inhibition of morphogen pathways exerts additive antifibrotic effects. <b>Combination</b> <b>therapies</b> are well tolerated and, in contrast to high dose monotherapies, may not impair stem cell renewal. Combined targeting of morphogen pathways may thus help to overcome dose-limiting toxicity of Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch signalling...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Guided tissue {{regeneration}} (GTR) and enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) are two popular regenerative {{treatments for}} periodontal infrabony lesions. Both {{have been used}} in conjunction with other regenerative materials. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on treatment effects of GTR, EMD and their <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> Material and Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CENTRAL databases up to and including June 2011. Treatment outcomes were changes in probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and infrabony defect depth. Different types of bone grafts were treated as one group and so were barrier membranes. Results: A total of 53 studies were included in this review, and we found small differences between regenerative therapies which were non-significant statistically and clinically. GTR and GTR-related <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> achieved greater PPD reduction than EMD and EMD-related <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> <b>Combination</b> <b>therapies</b> achieved slightly greater CAL gain than the use of EMD or GTR alone. GTR with BG achieved greatest defect fill. Conclusion: <b>Combination</b> <b>therapies</b> performed better than single therapies, but the additional benefits were small. Bayesian network meta-analysis is a promising technique to compare multiple treatments. Further analysis of methodological characteristics will be required prior to clinical recommendations.

Despite the complexity of TBI, research aimed at therapy development has almost exclusively focused on single therapies, {{all of which have}} failed in multicenter clinical trials. Therefore, in February 2008 the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with support from the National Institute of Child Health and Development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, convened a workshop to discuss the opportunities and challenges of testing <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> for TBI. Workshop participants included clinicians and scientists from a variety of disciplines, institutions, and agencies. The objectives of the workshop were to: (1) identify the most promising <b>combinations</b> of <b>therapies</b> for TBI; (2) identify challenges of testing <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> in clinical and pre-clinical studies; and (3) propose research methodologies and study designs to overcome these challenges. Several promising <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> were discussed, but no one combination was identified as being the most promising. Rather, the general recommendation was to combine agents with complementary targets and effects (e. g., mechanisms and time-points), rather than focusing on a single target with multiple agents. In addition, it was recommended that clinical management guidelines be carefully considered when designing pre-clinical studies for therapeutic development. To overcome the challenges of testing <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> it was recommended that statisticians and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration be included in early discussions of experimental design. Furthermore, it was agreed that an efficient and validated screening platform for candidate therapeutics, sensitive and clinically relevant biomarkers and outcome measures, and standardization and data sharing across centers would greatly facilitate the development of successful <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> for TBI.

40|$|The authors {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the superiority of angiotensin system blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (A+C) over other <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> in antihypertensive treatment. A meta-analysis in 20, 451 hypertensive patients from eight randomized controlled trials was conducted to compare the A+C treatment with other <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> in terms of blood pressure (BP) reduction, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. The results showed that BP reduction {{did not differ significantly}} among the A+C <b>therapy</b> and other <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> in systolic and diastolic BP (P=. 87 and P=. 56, respectively). However, A+C therapy, compared with other <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> achieved a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular composite endpoints, including cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (risk ratio [RR], 0. 80; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 70 - 0. 91; P<. 001), but similar all-cause mortality (RR, 0. 90; 95 % CI, 0. 77 - 1. 04; P=. 15) and stroke rates (RR, 0. 90; 95 % CI, 0. 77 - 1. 04; P=. 09). Moreover, A+C therapy yielded a 4. 21 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) lower estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction than other combinations (P<. 001). Finally, A+C therapy showed a similar incidence of adverse events as other <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> (P=. 34) but presented a significantly lower incidence of serious adverse events (RR, 0. 85; 95 % CI, 0. 73 - 0. 98; P=. 03).
