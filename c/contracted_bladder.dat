40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} to what extent adult rats can produce new <b>contracting</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle and to see if such newly formed bladder tissue possesses characteristic mechanical properties or whether the ability to recover mechanically is so pronounced that the prehistory of the bladder is unimportant. Subtotal cystectomy was performed in adult female rats, leading to a pronounced decrease in total bladder weight. At 10 weeks, bladder weight had normalized. The histological appearance of such bladders was similar to that of the controls. Active and passive length-tension relations for the detrusor muscle were determined in controls and up to 10 weeks after surgery. Immediately after surgery active and passive forces showed a leftward shift and maximum active force decreased markedly. With time the length-tension curves shifted back to normal, but a decreased active force still remained at 10 weeks. Detrusor actin concentration and detrusor myosin/actin ratio were unaffected by the subtotal cystectomy. Intermediate filament protein/actin ratio showed a significant but transitory increase. We conclude that there is a remarkable recovery of detrusor muscle function after subtotal cystectomy, leading to a normalization of optimum length for active force and a net synthesis of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins. The ability to produce active force does, however, not fully recover...|$|R
30|$|The empty, or <b>contracted,</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> lies entirely {{within the}} bony pelvis and is {{considered}} extraperitoneal. The full bladder extends above {{the protection of the}} pelvic inlet into the peritoneum to about the level of the umbilicus. The bladder dome, also the most mobile part of the bladder, is particularly susceptible to injury at its posterior-superior extension point [1]. The rupture mechanism {{has been described as a}} burst rupture due to increased intrabladder pressure. The dome is unique in its isolated peritoneal reflection so that rupture in this area most likely results in intraperitonal urinary contamination [4].|$|R

Marquez admitted he smoked for three decades before quitting in the 1970s. His son and lawyer, David Marquez, maintained {{that he had not}} inhaled deeply when he smoked, that the ventilation system at Rikers Island was inadequate, and that by the time he went to Rikers he hadn't smoked in 23 years.

5000|$|In humans, the ureters {{arise from}} the pelvis of each kidney, and descend {{on top of the}} psoas major muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. Here, they cross in front of the common iliac arteries. They then pass down along the sides of the pelvis, and finally curve {{forwards}} and enter the bladder from its left and right sides {{at the back of the}} bladder. This is classically depicted as running [...] "posteroinferiorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis and then curve anteromedially to enter the bladder". The orifices of the ureters are placed at the postero-lateral angles of the trigone of the bladder, and are usually slit-like in form. In the <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> they are about 2.5 cm. apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder these measurements may be increased to about 5 cm.|$|E
40|$|A case of <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> in {{a patient}} with {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE) was reported. The patient was a 37 -year-old {{woman who had been}} diagnosed as SLE in 1970 and had been treated for that disease for two years. She had complained of diarrhea and abdominal pain since June in 1977 and was suspected of relapse of SLE. On August, she complained of micturition pain and pollakisuria besides and visited our clinic On September 9, 1977. Drip infusion pyelography demonstrated <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Cystoscopy showed edematous, mass at the trigone of the bladder. Analgesics, antispasmodics, antidearrheal drugs and antibiotics were given to her. But the symptoms were not alleviated. With steroid all the symptoms disappeared immediately. Furthermore, <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis was alleviated and edematous mass of the bladder was reduced. In this way, the pathological changes of the bladder progressed in according to the clinical course of SLE.

50|$|During urination, {{detrusor}} {{muscles in}} {{the wall of the}} <b>bladder</b> <b>contract,</b> forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra.

40|$|Elderly men {{are prone}} to {{developing}} Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, such as a weak urinary stream, frequent (nocturnal) voiding and incomplete emptying of the bladder. The two most probable causes for these symptoms are a weakly <b>contracting</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle or Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO), frequently caused by Benign Prostatic Enlargement. The most frequently used urodynamic method to diagnose this condition is an invasive pressure-flow study: measurement of bladder pressure during voiding using a catheter inserted in the bladder via the urethra. In this thesis an alternative non-invasive diagnostic method is presented. This method is based on turbulence in the urinary stream, induced by an obstruction (enlarged prostate) in the urethra. This turbulence can be recorded using a simple microphone placed at the perineum (between scrotum and anus). In a realistic biophysical model of the urethra we {{have shown that the}} sound frequency spectrum (characterized by ! three parameters) was uniquely and monotonically related to the degree of the obstruction. In a population of healthy male volunteers the variability of perineal sound recording within volunteers was found to be smaller than between volunteers: volunteers can be distinguished on the basis of perineal sound recording. From these findings and the three parameters being uniquely and monotonically related to the degree of the obstruction it can be concluded that perineal sound recording is a promising method for a cheap, simple and quick non-invasive diagnosis of BOO and clinical validation is strongly indicated...|$|R
50|$|Muscles {{surrounding}} the urethra (the tube that takes urine {{away from the}} bladder) have the job of keeping the passage closed, preventing urine from passing out of the body. If the <b>bladder</b> <b>contracts</b> strongly and without warning, the muscles {{surrounding the}} urethra {{may not be able}} to keep urine from passing. This often happens as a consequence of urinary tract infection and is more common in girls.|$|R
40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} {{generally}} manifested with gross hematuria {{and this is}} the most common urinary tract neoplasm in Korea, but it is very rare to find it combined with a <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder.</b> A case of <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> was suspected as being recurred urinary tuberculosis; because of her past history, the urine analysis and cystoscopic findings seemed to resemble the chronic inflammation associated with urinary tuberculosis, and the transurethral biopsy reported only chronic inflammation.

40|$|We {{compared}} the density {{and function of}} M- 2 and M- 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the urinary bladder of young adult (3 months) and old (23 months) male Wistar rats. Old rats had a reduced density of muscarinic receptors (96 +/- 10 vs. 156 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein), but competition experiments with the M- 3 -selective darifenacin did not indicate alterations in the relative roles of M- 2 and M- 3 receptors, with the former being more abundant. The amount of immunodetectable alpha-subunits of various G-proteins potentially linked to muscarinic receptor function was unchanged. The potency of carbachol to <b>contract</b> <b>bladder</b> strips was also unaltered; its maximum effects {{as well as those}} of a single KCl concentration were unchanged if raw data or those corrected for strip length were analysed, but somewhat reduced when those corrected for strip weight were analysed. Antagonistic effects of atropine, the M- 2 -selective Ro 320 - 6206 and the M- 3 -selective darifenacin were unchanged. Agonistic effects of the M- 3 -sparing agonist 4 -(2 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydro-benzoimidazol- 1 -yl) -[1, 4 ']bipiperidinyl- 1 '-carboxyl ic acid ethyl ester were similarly poor in young and old rats. Additional experiments were concomitantly performed in submandibular glands from the same animals. While total muscarinic receptor density in submandibular glands was not significantly affected by age (56 +/- 5 vs. 61 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein), the relative contribution of M- 3 receptors significantly declined from 68 +/- 3 % to 57 +/- 2 % based upon darifenacin competition curves. We conclude that aged Wistar rats express fewer muscarinic receptors in their urinary bladder, but there is no change in the relative abundance of M- 2 and M- 3 receptors; this is accompanied by only minor if any alterations in receptor responsiveness. In contrast, submandibular gland expresses similar receptor numbers in young and old rats, but slightly fewer M- 3 receptors in old animal...|$|R
40|$|Urine, {{produced}} in the kidneys, is temporarily stored in the urinary bladder. Under appropriate circumstances, the <b>bladder</b> muscle (detrusor) <b>contracts</b> and expels the urine through the bladder neck and urethra. The course of voiding mainly depends on the contractility of the detrusor and the urethral resistance. Upon stimulation initiated by the central nerve system, the detrusor shortens which increases the pressure in the bladder. At the same time, the muscle fibres in the bladder neck and in the urethral wall relax which reduces the urethral resistance. When the pressure in the bladder {{is higher than the}} pressure in the urethra, urine pushes the urethra open and voiding starts. When the bladder is empty, the detrusor contraction stops, the urethra closes and the kidneys refill the bladder. In men, the prostate enlarges with increasing age, mostly as a result of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As the prostate surrounds the urethra, and may thus obstruct it, a poor urinary flow (or flow rate) and frequent voiding are typical symptoms relating to BPH. In general, these symptoms are called Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). At present, 25 % of the Dutch men aged 40 and above are known to have these symptoms. In men older than 65 years, this percentage is increased to 33 %. In the Netherlands only, the population of interest approximates 1 million. This number will increase as the population is ageing. In some cases, a poor flow rate is caused by a weakly <b>contracting</b> <b>bladder</b> and not by an enlarged prostate. In these patients, the efficacy of a surgical procedure aimed at the relief of an obstruction is doubtful. To test if a low flow rate results from an increased urethral resistance, the pressure in the bladder during voiding needs to be measured. A high bladder pressure combined with a low flow rate indicates that a patient has an obstructed urethra. A low bladder pressure combined with a low flow rate indicates that a patient has a weakly contracting detrusor...|$|R

40|$|The {{patient was}} a 49 -year-old male. He {{had a history}} of {{asymptomatic}} hematuria that had occurred 3 years previously. The hematuria and pollakisuria developed again from about March, 1989, and he was hospitalized for bladder tamponade in April. Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were performed because a <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> and bilateral hydronephrosis were detected. He was then admitted to our hospital on June 21. The cause of the <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder</b> was not evident, despite extensive examination. A replacement ileocystoplasty constructed by Shishido's method was used to replace the <b>contracted</b> <b>bladder.</b> A U-shape pouch was prepared by detubularization of 25 cm of the ileum and this pouch was anastomosed to the incised end of the bladder neck after subtotal cystectomy. The ureter and ileum were then anastomosed using Coffey's method. The bladder capacity and the maximum urinary flow rate after 1 year were 350 ml and 13 ml/sec, respectively, and residual urine was not noted after urination even following abdominal pressure. Urinary incontinence was not noted either...|$|E

50|$|For example, {{a patient}} {{complaining}} of urinary urgency (or {{rushing to the}} toilet), with increased frequency of urination can have overactive bladder syndrome. The cause of this might be detrusor overactivity, in which the bladder muscle (the detrusor) <b>contracts</b> unexpectedly during <b>bladder</b> filling. Urodynamics {{can be used to}} confirm the presence of detrusor overactivity, which may help guide treatment. An overactive detrusor can be associated with urge incontinence. The American Urogynecologic Society does not recommend that urodynamics are part of initial diagnosis for uncomplicated overactive bladder.|$|R
50|$|Retrograde {{ejaculation}} {{occurs when}} semen, which would, in most cases, be ejaculated via the urethra, is redirected to the urinary bladder.

When the bladder sphincter does not function properly, retrograde ejaculation may occur. It can also be induced deliberately by a male as a primitive form of male birth control (known as coitus saxonicus) or as part of certain alternative medicine practices.|$|R

50|$|Surge {{suppressors}} perform surge relief {{by acting}} as a pulsation dampener. Most suppressors have a metal tank with an internal elastic bladder in it.

The gas in the bladder is supplying the system with its set point.

40|$|We herein {{presented}} {{the results of}} twenty-one closed loop ileocystoplasties which were performed solely for the <b>contracted</b> tuberculous <b>bladder</b> during the 10 year period beginning in 1963. In general the results, except two deaths; an operative mortality rate of 9. 5 percent, have been fairly encouraging. After ileocystoplasty, hydronephrosis improved in 11 kidney units, remained unchanged in nine and was reversely deteriorated in one. In the group of 12 patients with impaired preoperative renal function, there were eight improvements and two deteriorations. The other two patients' renal function remained unchanged. One patient, {{in the group of}} patients with normal preoperative renal function, was considered to have become worse following the operation. Early and late complications were reviewed; there were one acute renal failure and one obstructive anuria as serious early complications, and two ileo-cystostomy stenoses, one acute intestinal obstruction, one spontaneous perforation of the ileal segment, three urinary tract stones and two metabolic acidoses associated with electrolyte imbalance as severe late complications. The inquiries by mail indicated that closed loop ileocystoplasty may afford nearly complete symptomatic relief except for a weak pulsive force of the ileobladder to evacuate urine, and persistent mucus formation. The <b>contracted</b> tuberculous <b>bladder</b> is gradually becoming less common, as tuberculous diseases are succumbing to antituberculous chemotherapy. However, it is sporadically found in Japan, where tuberculosis is found to be much more liable in bladder contractions than any other etiology. As the contraction progresses {{to such a degree that}} the upper urinary tracts are affected, the kidneys gradually lead to destruction. Surgical correction is necessary in order to reverse the threat of this deterioration and to relieve the patient from such complaints as frequent miction and/or overflow incontinence. Ileocystoplasty, one of the available surgical corrections, has been widely used for bladder contractions with various etiologies. However, it is not without criticism. Extensive literature has grown up in which various series of the operation have been reported from a number of urological centers, some of them drawing attention to several drawbacks of this operation in contrast to other kinds of intestinocystoplasty. Until two years ago, when we adopted the colocystoplasty operation, we had performed closed loop ileocystoplasties for ten years.

It was reported that Brahe had written his own epitaph, [...] "He lived like a sage and died like a fool." [...] A contemporary physician attributed his death to a kidney stone, but no kidney stones were found during an autopsy performed after his body was exhumed in 1901, and the 20th-century medical assessment is that his death is more likely to have resulted from uremia.|$|R
