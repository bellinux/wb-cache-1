25|$|Ruppersberger, {{along with}} Michigan Republican Mike Rogers, co-sponsored the <b>Cyber</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Sharing and Protection Act, {{designed}} to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies. More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT, IBM and Intel. Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act {{for a lack of}} civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, and thereby creates a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012. It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18, 2013, by a bipartisan vote of 288-127. Of the 92 Democrats who supported the bill, many of them cited significant privacy improvements over the 2012 version.|$|E

40|$|Social media {{analytics}} is {{a critical}} research area spawned by the increasing availability of rich and abundant online user-generated content. So far, social media analytics has {{had a profound impact}} on organizational decision making in many aspects, including product and service design, market segmentation, customer relationship management, and more. However, the cybersecurity sector is behind other sectors in benefiting from the business intelligence offered by social media analytics. Given the role of hacker communities in cybercrimes and the prevalence of hacker communities, there is an urgent need for developing hacker social media analytics capable of gathering <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> from hacker communities for exchanging hacking knowledge and tools. My dissertation addressed two broad research questions: (1) How do we help organizations gain <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> through social media analytics on hacker communities? And (2) how do we advance social media analytics research by developing innovative algorithms and models for hacker communities? Using <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> as a guiding principle, emphasis is placed on the two major components in hacker communities: threat actors and their cybercriminal assets. To these ends, the dissertation is arranged in two parts. The first part of the dissertation focuses on gathering <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> on threat actors. In the first essay, I identify and profile two types of key sellers in hacker communities: malware sellers and stolen data sellers, both of which are responsible for data breach incidents. In the second essay, I develop a method for recovering social interaction networks, which can be further used for detecting major hacker groups, and identifying their specialties and key members. The second part of the dissertation seeks to develop <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> on cybercriminal assets. In the third essay, a novel supervised topic model is proposed to further address the language complexities in hacker communities. In the fourth essay, I propose the development of an innovative emerging topic detection model. Models, frameworks, and design principles developed in this dissertation not only advance social media analytics research, but also broadly contribute to IS security application and design science research...|$|R

40|$|Threat {{intelligence}} is {{the provision of}} evidence-based knowledge about existing or potential threats. Benefits of threat intelligence include improved efficiency and effectiveness in security operations in terms of detective and preventive capabilities. Successful threat <b>intelligence</b> within the <b>cyber</b> domain demands a knowledge base of threat information and an expressive way to represent this knowledge. This purpose is served {{by the use of}} taxonomies, sharing standards, and ontologies. This paper introduces the <b>Cyber</b> Threat <b>Intelligence</b> (CTI) model, which enables cyber defenders to explore their threat intelligence capabilities and understand their position against the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. In addition, we use our model to analyze and evaluate several existing taxonomies, sharing standards, and ontologies relevant to <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence.</b> Our results show that the cyber security community lacks an ontology covering the complete spectrum of threat intelligence. To conclude, we argue the importance of developing a multi-layered <b>cyber</b> threat <b>intelligence</b> ontology based on the CTI model and the steps should be taken under consideration, which are the foundation of our future work. © 2017 IEEE.
