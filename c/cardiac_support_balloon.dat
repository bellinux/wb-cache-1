40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} the effects on global cardiac function and myocardial energetics of limiting progressive dilatation after infarction {{by means of a}} woven polyester jacket <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device. We hypothesized that placement of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device results in a decrease in myocardial wall stress and improvement in cardiac function and myocardial energetics. MethodsTo investigate the effect of passive constraint on left ventricular function and mechanics, a total of 10 sheep were studied with pressure-volume analysis and magnetic resonance imaging. A baseline study was followed by the creation of an anterior infarct. After 1 week, the animals underwent a second study. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device was then placed over the epicardium in 5 sheep; the remaining animals served as controls. A terminal study was performed at 2 months after the infarct. ResultsThe <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device group at the terminal study exhibited a decrease in end-diastolic volume (control 110. 3 ± 19. 8 mL vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device 67. 6 ± 4. 7 mL, P =. 006) and an improved ejection fraction (control 15. 5 % ± 5. 7 % vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device 29. 46 % ± 4. 42 %, P =. 008) relative to the control group. Myocardial energetics were also enhanced in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device group, as evidenced by the significant improvements in potential energy (control 2015 ± 503 mL · mm Hg/beat vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device 885 ± 220 mL · mm Hg/beat, P =. 006), efficiency (control 39. 4 % ± 13. 6 % vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device 59. 8 % ± 8. 5 %, P =. 044), and oxygen consumption (control 0. 072 ± 0. 013 mL O 2 /beat vs <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device 0. 052 ± 0. 007 mL O 2 /beat, P =. 034). ConclusionPassive constraint with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device after infarct prevents further remodeling and may stimulate reverse remodeling in heart failure secondary to acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest that in human beings placement of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device after a large anterior myocardial infarction may be effective in halting the remodeling process that often leads to end-stage heart failure. If proved effective, placement of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device after large heart attacks has the potential to decrease the incidence of heart failure that results after large myocardial infarctions...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a growing health problem, {{affecting}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with rapidly increasing costs for the health care system. In spite of recent improvements in pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure is still poor. Heart failure is associated with numerous processes and changes in left ventricular structure and function often referred to as left ventricular remodelling. The Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device is a mesh-like polyester device designed to arrest and reverse these processes thereby facilitating left ventricular reversed remodelling in heart failure. We have explored the effect of passive containment surgery using the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device in heart failure patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Following application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device reduced <b>cardiac</b> dimensions, increased functional capacity, decreased levels of circulating plasma levels of Endothelin- I and improved quality of life was demonstrated. Furthermore, the possible beneficial effect on reduction on left ventricular dilatation with application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device concomitant with aortic valve replacement in patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation was evaluated. No additive beneficial effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device were found in these patients when compared to patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement as the sole procedure. The acute effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device in experimental porcine myocardial infarction were investigated. No acute effect on hemodynamics, coronary vasomotor function, Endothelin- I levels or infarction size was demonstrated following application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device at induction of acute experimental myocardial infarction. Based on the findings in these studies it is concluded that application of the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device is safe, simple and without apparent negative effects. In heart failure patients with ventricular dilatation the Acorn Cor Cap <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device represents a novel and interesting amendment to current surgical treatment options with likely beneficial effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} we devote to {{problems}} {{of patients with}} the implanted system HeartMate II, which is now approved as a support for an indication to bridging the time to heart transplantation and for a destination therapy for patients with a refractory heart failure. We also devote to the access of nurses to these patients. The theoretical part of the thesis is generally devoted to mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> and indications to their introduction. Next part describes HeartMate II, specifics of the nursing care for a patient who is after implantation mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II and limitations, which follow for a patient at home. The target {{of the work is}} to: 1. Find out, what the priorities of needs of the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> are in a nursing care. 2. Find out, how the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> perceives himself and his future. 3. Find out possibilities of nursing interventions to a saturation of needs by priorities of patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports.</b> For the qualitative part of the empirical research the method of questioning with technique a semi-structured interview with opened questions was chosen. The research group consists of four patients after the implantation of left-hand mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> HeartMate II. In this part we were finding out answers to four research questions. 1. Which damaged needs are predominant by patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports?</b> 2. Do patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> have enough information about possible complications related to the life after the implantation of a mechanical support? 3. How does the patient with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> perceive his future? 4. How does the patient with the mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II perceive himself? Then results of research were analyzed and written into schemes. In the quantitative part of the research four hypotheses were determined. 1. Interventions of nurses during a nursing care which is oriented to monitoring of vital functions are predominant over the orientation of needs that are changed by the life with a mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support.</b> 2. Nurses are available to answer to patients with mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>supports</b> questions which are related to a service of the device HeartMate II. 3. Nurses are well informed about possible complications after the implantation of the left-hand mechanical support. 4. Nursing interventions of nurses are predominant over interventions of {{the other members of the}} team during the care of patient after the implantation of the left-hand mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support.</b> The research group of the research consists of nurses, who are working at the department with beds, the intensive care unit of clinic of a cardiovascular surgery and at the resuscitation department of an anaesthesiology and resuscitation in IKEM. 95 respondents were addressed. The returnability of questionnaires was 69 % from the beginning number. On the basis of the result of the research we think that targets were fulfilled. Patients have enough information about complications related with the life with the mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> HeartMate II. Patients consider a satisfaction of psychical needs, especially the feeling of a safety and a security, as a priority, although they are highly specific problems. In this view a psychotherapeutic access and a therapeutic communication of a nurse with a patient are important. We are going to hand results of the research over to the management of IKEM.

40|$|BackgroundThe <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device {{supports}} {{the heart and}} mechanically reduces left ventricular (LV) diastolic wall stress. Although {{it has been shown}} to halt LV remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its lack of biological effects. In contrast, the slow-release synthetic prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 enhances reversal of LV remodeling through biological mechanisms such as angiogenesis and attenuation of fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that ONO- 1301 plus a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device might be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. MethodsTwenty-four dogs with induced anterior wall infarction were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups at 1  week postinfarction as follows: <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device alone, <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device plus ONO- 1301 (hybrid therapy), ONO- 1301 alone, or sham control. ResultsAt 8 weeks post-infarction, LV wall stress was reduced significantly in the hybrid therapy group compared with the other groups. Myocardial blood flow, measured by positron emission tomography, and vascular density were significantly higher in the hybrid therapy group compared with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device alone and sham groups. The hybrid therapy group also showed the least interstitial fibrosis, the greatest recovery of LV systolic and diastolic functions, assessed by multidetector computed tomography and cardiac catheterization, and the lowest plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P < . 05). ConclusionsThe combination of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device and the prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 elicited a greater reversal of LV remodeling than either treatment alone, suggesting the potential of this hybrid therapy for the clinical treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure...|$|R

The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine whether combining a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device with cell-based therapy could prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling, more than either therapy alone. MethodsThe present study was completed in 2 parts. In the first part, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rodent femurs and seeded on a collagen-based scaffold. In the second part, myocardial infarction was induced in 60 rats. The 24 survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: control, stem cell therapy, <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device, and a combination of stem cell therapy and <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device. Left ventricular function was measured with biweekly echocardiography, followed by end-of-life histopathologic analysis at 6 weeks. ResultsAfter myocardial infarction and treatment intervention, the ejection fraction remained preserved (74. 9 - 80. 2 %) in the combination group at an early point (2 weeks) compared with the control group (66. 2 - 82. 8 %). By 6 weeks, the combination therapy group had a significantly greater fractional area of change compared with the control group (69. 2 % ± 6. 7 % and 49. 5 % ± 6. 1 % respectively, P = . 03). Also, at 6 weeks, the left ventricular wall thickness was greater in the combination group than in the stem cell therapy alone group (1. 79  ± 0. 11 and 1. 33  ± 0. 13, respectively, P = . 02).

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to evaluate in a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial the safety and efficacy of mitral valve surgery with and without the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device (Acorn Cardiovascular, St Paul, Minn) in patients with New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure. BackgroundAlthough mitral valve surgery has been performed successfully in patients with heart failure, the safety and long-term efficacy have not been established in a multicenter prospective trial. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>support</b> devices that reduce ventricular wall stress and promote beneficial reverse remodeling have been proposed as a new treatment option as a stand-alone procedure and {{as an adjunct to}} mitral valve surgery. MethodsA subgroup of 193 patients were enrolled in the mitral valve repair or replacement stratum of the Acorn Clinical Trial; 102 patients were randomized to the mitral valve surgery alone group (control) and 91 patients were randomized to mitral valve surgery with implantation of the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device. Patients were followed for a median duration of 22. 9 months. ResultsFor the entire mitral valve surgery group, the 30 -day operative mortality rate was only 1. 6 % at 30 days. Mitral surgery was associated with progressive reductions in left ventricle end-diastolic volume, left ventricle end-systolic volume, and left ventricular mass, and increases in left ventricle ejection fraction and sphericity index, all consistent with reverse remodeling. Recurrence of clinically significant mitral regurgitation was uncommon. Quality of life, exercise performance, and New York Heart Association functional class were all improved. Finally, the addition of the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device led to greater decreases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic volume, a more elliptical shape, and a trend for a reduction in major cardiac procedures and improvement in quality of life compared with mitral surgery alone. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that there is clear benefit to the surgical elimination of mitral regurgitation and that there is additional benefit with the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device. Given the improvement in left ventricle structure and function, along with a low mortality rate, physicians should strongly consider offering mitral valve surgery in combination with the CorCap <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device to patients with heart failure who are on an optimal medical regimen...|$|R
40|$|Although heart-lung {{machines}} and cardiac assist devices {{have been used}} successfully for acute and chronic <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> for decades, controversies still remain concerning the benefits of pulsatile and non-pulsatile perfusion. The core of the debate is whether enough energy is generated by the artificial pulse to keep capillary beds open and cell metabolism stabilized during acute or chronic cardiac sup-port. In other words, does artificial pulsatility exist in the microcirculation: small vessels of less than 100 m in diam-eter? Many investigators have tried to use different tools and biomarkers to reflect directly or indirectly {{the state of the}} microcirculation when comparing the two different perfusion modes during acute and chronic <b>cardiac</b> <b>support.</b> However, the results are controversial. First, direct observa-tion {{of the state of the}} microcirculation during acute and chronic <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> is limited; and reports concerning direct observation of the microcirculation with different perfusion modes in contemporary literature are rare. Secondly, different investigators have used their own crite-ria to define pulsatile flow. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient methodologies, enabling direct observation of the microcirculation during acute and chronic <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> and also establish common crite-ria that will precisely quantify the pulsatile flow in terms of energy equivalent pressure (EEP) and surplus hemody-namic energy (SHE) levels. Using these critical parameters may explain how excess energy is created by pulsatile flow and maintains perfusion through the microcirculation by ensuring capillary patency.

40|$|ObjectiveNonischemic dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} with functional mitral regurgitation {{carries a}} poor prognosis. Mitral valve surgery with implantation of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device can treat mitral regurgitation and promote left ventricular reverse remodeling. This observational study evaluates clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of an individualized medico–surgical approach, focusing on mitral regurgitation recurrence and left ventricular reverse remodeling. MethodsSixty-nine consecutive patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV) with functional mitral regurgitation (grade 3 +/ 4 +) and left ventricular remodeling (end-diastolic volume 227 ± 73 mL, ejection fraction 26 % ± 8 %) underwent restrictive mitral annuloplasty (median ring size 26), with (n =  41) or without (n =  28) a <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device and optimal postoperative medical treatment. Patients were clinically and echocardiographically evaluated {{at up to}} 3. 1 years’ median follow-up. ResultsEarly mortality was 5. 8 %. Actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 86 % ± 4 %, 79 % ± 5 %, and 63 % ± 7 %. New York Heart Association class improved from 3. 1 ± 0. 4 to 2. 0 ± 0. 5 (P < . 01). <b>Cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device implantation in addition to mitral valve surgery, applied in patients with more advanced left ventricular remodeling, resulted in similar clinical outcome, greater left ventricular end-diastolic volume decrease (33 % vs 18 %; P = . 007), and in a trend toward less recurrent mitral regurgitation of grade 2 + or more (actuarial freedom at 3 years 89 % ± 8 % vs 63 % ± 11 %; P = . 067).

40|$|Heart {{transplantation}} {{in patients}} after implantation of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> devices entails an extremely {{high risk for}} perioperative bleeding. Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII is presently used to reduce the volume of bleeding in this patient group. There are parallel data on its administration-induced thromboembolic events in the literature. This paper describes a case of using a prothrombin complex concentrate in a patient during explantation of a left ventricular bypass system and subsequent orthotopic heart transplantation {{in the presence of}} significant hypocoagulation. At the end of a surgery, 1200 IU of the agent was used at a remaining bleeding rate of more than 1000 ml/hour. Within the first 24 hours after surgery, the rate of discharge drainage was less than 100 ml/hour. A control plain chest X-ray study revealed massive left-sided hydrothorax on day 2 postsurgery. The left pleural cavity was revised under thoracoscopic guidance and 1000 ml of blood clots were evacuated. Although the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate did not guard against re-intervention, its use seems a promising strategy in life-threatening bleedings in patients after explantation of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> devices.

30|$|Introduction Veno-arterial extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is used {{to provide}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> in patient suffering refractory cardiogenic shock.

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{is one of}} the most common {{diseases}} worldwide with increasing incidence. Although drug therapy is quite effective, the mortality of patients with progressive heart failure is still high. The loss of systolic myocardial function leads to an increase of wall stress and to an activation of the neuroendocrine system with a long term progression. The aim of the study is the radiological evaluation of a new surgical technique, the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device (CorCap, <b>Cardiac</b> <b>Support</b> Device; Acorn Cardiovascular Inc., St. Paul, MN). The key goal of this surgical procedure is reduction of the wall stress and reversion of the remodelling effect due to the biocompatible compliant mesh graft which is wrapped around the ventricles. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are referred to electron beam computer tomography (EBCT) before surgery and twice after the mesh graft implantation. Analysed parameters are volumes of the left and right ventricles, ejection fraction and the myocardial wall thickening. The advantage of EBCT lies in the short acquisition time per CT section as well as the possibility to examine patients with contraindications for MRI. The analysis indicates a significant decrease of left and right ventricular volumes after surgery with simultaneous increase of ejection fraction and regional contractility. Ventricular filling shows no evidence of constriction. In summary, the <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> device leads to a short and mid term normalization of functional parameters in both ventricles although it is still unclear whether the new therapy is associated with an increase in survival...|$|R

30|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a highly}} specialised form of advanced life support that can be utilised in critically ill patients who require short-term respiratory and/or <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> [1 – 3]. Whilst there are numerous access and cannulation options available for ECMO, they can be classified into two groups: central access and peripheral access [4, 5]. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography play {{a fundamental role in}} the management of patients supported with mechanical support devices, including ECMO [6 – 10]. Malpositioning of access and return cannulae or inflow/outflow cannulae of any form of mechanical support can have significant adverse consequences. It may cause ineffective delivery of haemodynamic support, haemolysis, increase the risk of ‘suckdown’, acute pulmonary oedema or cardiac trauma. Imaging guidance is important during cannulae insertion and optimal positioning of mechanical <b>cardiac</b> <b>support</b> devices [11, 12] and especially for peripheral cannulae for VV ECMO. Correct access and return cannulae placement in this form of support is required to prevent recirculation and optimise oxygenation.|$|R

Results show that the strength of the leading vortex ring is lower in a DCM ventricle than in a healthy ventricle.
