5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (<b>cobalt</b> <b>yellow)</b> is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E

50|$|Bernard {{most likely}} painted this {{painting}} from memory, modeled after a trip he took with Paul Gauguin in 1888 to Brittany. The painting has five Breton women {{and one man}} gathering around a wall. Their faces are pointed down toward the cobblestone wall. Their heads are covered in traditional Pont-Aven coiffes {{and they are in}} traditional Brittany wear. The painting is proliferated with bright <b>cobalts,</b> <b>yellows,</b> greens, and reds, and are chosen for effect, rather than accuracy in representation. The women all have slight facial features, but they are indistinguishable. Bernard uses harsh, graphic outlines to help define the features on the women's outfits and faces. The man is dressed in all green, and facing the rest of the women. The characters are boldly flat, recalling Bernard's love of Japanese prints. The placement of the figures shows Bernard's disregard to traditional rules, including scale or perspective.|$|R

50|$|Aureolin (sometimes called <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Yellow)</b> is a pigment {{sparingly}} used in oil {{and watercolor}} painting. Its color index name is PY40 (40th entry on list of yellow pigments). It was first made in 1848 by Nikolaus Wolfgang Fischer in Breslau and its chemical composition is potassium cobaltinitrite. The investigation by Gates gives the exact modern procedures for the preparation of aureolin and also the methods for its identification in paintings.|$|E

50|$|YAG for {{a period}} was used in jewelry as a diamond and other {{gemstone}} simulant. Colored variants and their doping elements include: green (chromium), blue (<b>cobalt),</b> red (manganese), <b>yellow</b> (titanium), purple (neodymium), pink, and orange. As faceted gems they are valued (as synthetics) for their clarity, durability, high refractive index and dispersion. The critical angle of YAG is 33 degrees. YAG cuts similar to natural garnet, with polishing being performed with alumina or diamond (50,000 or 100,000) on common polishing laps. YAG has low heat sensitivity.|$|R
25|$|Most floats are {{shades of}} green {{because that is the}} color of glass from {{recycled}} sake bottles (especially after long exposure to sunlight). However, clear, amber, aquamarine, amethyst, blue and other colors were also produced. The most prized and rare color is a red or cranberry hue. These were expensive to make because gold was used to produce the color. Other brilliant tones such as emerald green, <b>cobalt</b> blue, purple, <b>yellow</b> and orange were primarily made in the 1920s and 30s. The majority of the colored floats available for sale today are replicas.|$|R

30|$|Alternatively {{the artist}} might {{have resorted to}} a rarer pigment called ‘blue-green chrome’. This pigment with an {{approximate}} formula of Cr 2 O 3 ·CoO·Al 2 O 3, also mentioned by Newman [13] and Wehlte [14] appears to be made from a fusion of chromium, cobalt and aluminium oxides, and this would explain the presence of Cr and Co. An alternative and perhaps a more likely explanation for the co-location of both cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) could be the use of cerulean blue, then mixed with yellows such as <b>cobalt</b> <b>yellow</b> or an iron (Fe) oxide yellow, and also with chromium (Cr) oxide to achieve a green/blueish colour.|$|E
40|$|On the sea off {{southern}} Kyushu, fluorescent fish-attracting lamps {{are coming}} {{to be used in}} square net (Hachida-ami) fishing. The fluorescent tubes of various colours (green, day-light, <b>cobalt,</b> blue, <b>yellow</b> and red) were specially made for this investigation. By means of a very sensitive photo-meter with 5 kinds of filters, the lumens of the fluorescent tubes were measured respectively and their distributions in various wave-lengths were determined approximately. The coloured fluorescent tubes were proved to be highly effective. Even 100 -watt fluorescence tubes were measured in high lumen. For example, the green 100 -watt fluorescent tube was equivalent to 300 - 400 watt of incandescent lamps in photo-energy output. The bluish or greenish coloured fluorescent tubes have more quantities of photoenergy than incandescent lamps in the range of long wave-length, and, on the other hand, the latters have more quantities of energy than the former in short wave-length. By the reason that fish may be found of bluish light, we can anticipate that these color-lamps will be highly effective in attracting of fish. ...|$|R

30|$|Zhizo beads {{are drawn}} <b>cobalt,</b> <b>yellow,</b> blue-green or green tubes and {{generally}} {{larger than the}} other plant ash beads (2.5 – 13  mm in diameter and up to 20  mm long). All the beads classified as Zhizo fall in the soda-lime group (group C) in Fig.  3, compatible with plant ash glass. However, XRF measurements of six of the beads, selected because they had different Raman spectra, show {{that they do not}} match Zhizo beads in composition. The absence of Mg in four beads (db 1, db 4, lb 1, lb 3) disqualifies them as plant ash glasses and the two that do contain magnesium are disqualified for other reasons. The high lead content and glass composition of Mag-z-db 2 are compatible with some European classified beads (db 21, lb 25 and w 8) and the cobalt colouring the bead is associated with silver, manganese, nickel and arsenic, similar to European classified beads (db 21, db 30, db 31 and db 32). This is in contrast to the cobalt colouring Zhizo beads with a higher ratio of Co/As (> 1) or cobalt associated with high iron and low manganese content (Mn/Fe <  0.1) as found in Jingdezhen glazes, both originating from east of the Euphrates [29, 30]. Mag-z-db 4, a wound bead, contains high aluminium levels and malayite (Cr-Sn sphene), a phase also detected in some soda glass beads recovered at the Antsiraka Boira necropolis on Mayotte Island (twelfth-thirteenth century) [28]. The cobalt colouring this bead is associated with a high amount of Mn and the ratio of Co/Mn is about 0.3 reported for cobalt minerals from Far East Asia (China and Vietnam) [31]. As not one of the beads analysed with XRF could be placed in the Zhizo series we assume that the three beads not analysed with XRF also have a European origin.

40|$|Three {{types of}} antimony-based, opaque ceramic colours {{were used in}} the faience {{workshop}} of Le Bois d'Épense during {{the first decades of the}} 19 th century; that is, yellow, tawny and green. Yellow is generated by lead antimonate crystals (Naples Yellow), which are incorporated into an uncoloured glass matrix. According to SEM–EDS measurements, these pigments contain iron. The tawny colour is the optical result of the combined presence of similar yellow, iron-bearing lead antimonate particles in a Fe-rich, brownish glass matrix. The green opaque colour is produced by the combination of a blue <b>cobalt</b> glass and <b>yellow</b> Pb–Sn–Fe-antimonate crystals. Cores of zoned pigments lighten the recipes, according to which the pigments were produced. First, they were synthesized by calcination, ground and then mixed with a colourless, brown or blue glass powder. The resulting powder mixture was added to a liquid agent and used as high-temperature ceramic colour...|$|R

50|$|Uriarte {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{producers}} of Talavera pottery in Mexico. This is a kind of majolica, named after the city of Talavera de la Reina which had developed in Spain from Arab and Chinese origins and brought to Mexico after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. While majolica was made in a number of places in Mexico, it became highly refined in the Puebla city area, especially from 1650 to 1750. Talavera work is distinguished by the fine clays found in this area, fired with a tin and lead glaze at high temperatures. This glaze is off white to slightly yellow. The decorations are done only in black, <b>cobalt</b> blue, blue, <b>yellow,</b> green, red and sometimes deep rose, with the design slightly fuzed with the glaze which crazes. Authentic Talavera is still made by the same 16th century methods as in the colonial period and all done by hand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more sized wove papers, and brushes (called [...] "pencils") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were {{first published in}} this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; The Elements of Drawing, a watercolor tutorial by English art critic John Ruskin, {{has been out of}} print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be [...] "rubbed out" [...] (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Contemporary breakthroughs in chemistry have made many new pigments available, including prussian blue, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, viridian, <b>cobalt</b> violet, cadmium <b>yellow,</b> aureolin (potassium cobaltinitrite), zinc white, and a wide range of carmine and madder lakes. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{external}} reflection FTIR device, {{which enables}} nondestructive analyses {{in the region}} from 4000 - 450 cm- 1 with a measuring point diameter of approximately 5 mm, was tested for the identification of pigments and binding media in two modern paintings and several mockups with traditional pigment-binding media combinations. Comparative measurements were carried out with minute samples using a diamond cell for transmission FTIR microscopy. The results were interpreted by comparison to database spectra measured in transmission mode. The appearance of distorted peaks in raw reflection spectra impedes a direct comparison with the collected spectra in the transmission mode. Best matches with database spectra were obtained applying the Kramers-Kronig transformation to the reflection spectra of substances showing narrow bands, particularly {{in the region of}} about 1900 to 580 cm- 1. In the case of modern paintings a good match between transmission and reflection data could be achieved in the fingerprint region. It was possible to identify organic pigments PY 3 (Pigment Yellow 3) and PR 4 (Pigment Red 4) as well as calcite and PVAc (polyvinyl acetate). The identification of materials used for preparation of the mockups was successful for lead white, calcite, Prussian blue, indigo, ultramarine, azurite, malachite, Arabic gum and linseed oil, whereas the transformed spectra of <b>cobalt</b> blue, Naples <b>yellow</b> and especially of smalt and the proteinaceous binding media could not be identified using database spectra...|$|R
