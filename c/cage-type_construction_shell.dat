40|$|The present work {{outlines}} a study whose {{objective was}} to assess the possible use of advanced composite materials to helicopter fuselage structure. The study used the CH- 53 D as a baseline design for comparison of composite with current conventional construction. Boron/epoxy and graphite/epoxy appeared to be the prime candidate materials for the major portion of the primary structure, while Kevlar- 49 /epoxy was the prime candidate material for secondary structure. A single-laminate shear-carrying skin combined with stringers and frames in an all-molded construction was considered the most promising concept for the airframe shell construction; foam-stabilized graphite/epoxy stringer was considered the prime concept for stringer <b>construction.</b> <b>Shell</b> <b>construction</b> and assembly concepts are discussed, and comparison of weight and material between current CH- 53 D airframe and the composite airframe shows that the latter may represent an 18 % weight saving. Based on a fleet requirement of 600 vehicles, the operating cost for a fleet of helicopters constructed with the composite material airframe flying 500 hours a year per aircraft over a ten-year service life was calculated, indicating a $ 337, 000 saving per helicopter...|$|R

In contrast, coconut fiber does not improve the fatigue life of the modified bituminous mixes. In general, the previous research illustrates that coconut shell and coconut fiber significantly improves the engineering properties of asphalt mixtures when mixed with modified bitumen...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction,</b> an important and intriguing concept in contemporary architecture, has been used in many structures around the world. Famous architects such as Nervi, Toroja, Candela, Saarinen and Yamasaki have molded concrete into long spans of thin shell roofs. Domes, barrel vaults, conoids and free forms along with the newest form of <b>shell</b> roof <b>construction,</b> the hyperbolic paraboloid, constitute architectural concepts which have rapidly gained acceptance among architects and building owners. Thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction</b> began first in Italy and Spain, later spreading to the western hemisphere, notably Mexico. In the United States widespread application of thin <b>shell</b> roof <b>construction</b> has been hampered by the high cost of labor and materials required for the elaborate formwork. Building codes are also in need of revision to include provisions for thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the possible potential use of portland cement mortar modified with latex and fiber glass as a covering material for thin shell structures.
