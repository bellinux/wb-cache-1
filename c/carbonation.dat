5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and <b>carbonation</b> in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural <b>carbonation</b> effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced <b>carbonation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a {{noticeable}} <b>carbonation</b> (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of <b>carbonation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that <b>carbonation</b> gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
25|$|Drinks like {{ginger ale}} and root beer are often brewed using yeast to cause <b>carbonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbonation,</b> or neutralisation, is a {{chemical}} reaction between {{carbon dioxide in}} the air and calcium hydroxide and hydrated calcium silicate in the concrete.|$|E
25|$|Some {{soft drinks}} contain {{measurable}} amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation {{used to build}} the <b>carbonation.</b> In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for <b>carbonation,</b> {{but there is some}} speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.|$|E
25|$|Controlled {{permeability}} formwork (CPF) is {{a method}} of preventing the corrosion of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during concrete placement. CPF {{has been used in}} environments to combat the effects of <b>carbonation,</b> chlorides, frost and abrasion.|$|E
25|$|Because PET is an {{excellent}} water and moisture barrier material, plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for soft drinks (see <b>carbonation).</b> For certain specialty bottles, such as those designated for beer containment, PET sandwiches an additional polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) layer to further reduce its oxygen permeability.|$|E
25|$|Ambo Mineral Water {{began to}} be packed in plastic bottles {{relatively}} recently, and prior to this was packed exclusively in glass bottles. New products introduced circa November 2014 were Ambo flavored water, which was formulated in several flavors, and Ambo Lite, a product with a lower mineral and <b>carbonation</b> content.|$|E
25|$|The {{economics}} of mineral <b>carbonation</b> at scale {{are now being}} tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in Newcastle, Australia. New techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the GreenMag Group and the University of Newcastle and funded by the New South Wales and Australian Governments to be operational by 2013.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} takes {{a significant}} amount of time because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air is low. The <b>carbonation</b> reaction requires the dry cement to be exposed to air, and for this reason the slaked lime is a non-hydraulic cement and cannot be used under water. This whole process is called the lime cycle.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} testing a {{structure}} for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with phenolphthalein indicator solution. This solution turns pink when in contact with alkaline concrete, {{making it possible to}} see the depth of <b>carbonation.</b> Using an existing hole does not suffice because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.|$|E
25|$|Several serpentinite {{deposits}} {{are being}} investigated as potentially large scale CO2 storage sinks {{such as those}} found in NSW, Australia, where the first mineral <b>carbonation</b> pilot plant project is underway. Beneficial re-use of magnesium carbonate from this process could provide feedstock for new products developed for the built environment and agriculture without returning the carbon into the atmosphere and so acting as a carbon sink.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of Champagne and many sparkling wines requires a second fermentation {{to occur in}} the bottle in order to produce the <b>carbonation</b> necessary for the style. A small amount of sugared liquid is added to individual bottles, and the yeast is allowed to convert this to more alcohol and carbon dioxide. The lees are then ricked into the neck of the bottle, frozen, and expelled via pressure of the carbonated wine.|$|E
25|$|Americans alone {{dispose of}} 130 billion bottles and cans every year, and 340 billion {{beverage}} bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide. According to SodaStream, use of home <b>carbonation</b> systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution {{caused by the}} transport of bottled drinks. According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.|$|E
25|$|The sugar was {{originally}} added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add <b>carbonation</b> or alcohol to the beverage, as the sugar {{did not have}} the time to ferment. Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and lambic, but is not always a light beer. The use of meertsbier has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed as cheap or light. Today, faro is bottled, sweetened, and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by Cantillon, Boon, Lindemans or Mort Subite.|$|E
25|$|Soft {{drinks are}} made by mixing dry or fresh {{ingredients}} with water. Production of soft drinks can be done at factories or at home. Soft drinks can be made at home by mixing a syrup or dry ingredients with carbonated water, or by lacto-fermentation. Syrups are commercially sold by companies such as Soda-Club; dry ingredients are often sold in pouches, in a style of the popular U.S. drink mix Kool-Aid. Carbonated water is made using a soda siphon or a home <b>carbonation</b> system or by dropping dry ice into water.|$|E
25|$|The Charmat method {{takes place}} in {{stainless}} steel fermentation tanks that are pressurized. The fresh yeast and sugar mixture {{is added to the}} wine which rapidly stimulates fermentation in the pressurized environment. The wine is then cooled, clarified and bottled using a counter pressure filler. The process of carbon injection (or <b>carbonation),</b> the method used to make soda pop fizzy, does not involve initiating a secondary fermentation but rather injecting carbon dioxide gas directly into the wine. This method produces large bubbles that quickly dissipate and is generally only used in the cheapest sparkling wines.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trenches}} at launch pad 39A that channels flames {{away from the}} shuttle during lift-off was significantly damaged. The subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage {{was the result of}} <b>carbonation</b> of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the refractory bricks in place. These had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters. Repairs to the trench were completed before the STS-125 mission's then scheduled launch attempt on 8 October 2008. In fact STS-125 finally launched in May 2009, and in the meantime STS-126 (November 2008) and STS-119 (March 2009) had both been successfully launched from pad 39A.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{weathering}} {{refers to}} chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques. Examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ <b>carbonation</b> of silicates. Ultramafic rock, for example, {{has the potential}} to store thousands of years worth of CO2 emissions according to one estimate. Ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement, such as, grinding, dispersing and dissolving olivine, limestone, silicates, or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO2 sequestration. Enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options. One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the CarbFix project in Iceland.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, after various {{changes of}} ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group. In 1998, SodaStream {{was bought by}} Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home <b>carbonation</b> systems supplier. In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany. Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries. In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability. Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the <b>carbonation.</b> The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|E
500|$|After packaging, {{the bottles}} were stored {{from three to}} five weeks at [...] {{in a dark room}} as the yeast {{continued}} to ferment the remaining sugars in the beer. [...] The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in the bottles and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of <b>carbonation.</b> [...] During this period, an average of four to five percent of the bottles would burst due to <b>carbonation</b> levels exceeding the strength of the bottles.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie ( [...] ; other names: Grätzer, Grodzisz) is a {{historical}} style of beer from Poland that is typically made from oak-smoked wheat malt. [...] The beer {{can be described as}} having a clear, light golden color, high <b>carbonation,</b> low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma. [...] The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment the beverage. [...] The beer was nicknamed [...] "Polish Champagne" [...] because of its high <b>carbonation</b> levels, and because it was valued as a high-quality beverage to be used for special occasions.|$|E
500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances {{the sweetness of}} the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by <b>carbonation</b> will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie is brewed from {{wheat malt}} {{that has been}} dried by {{circulating}} oak smoke through the grains. [...] The smokiness of the grain and the mineral profile of the water used to brew the beverage gives the style its characteristic flavor. [...] Polish breweries historically used locally grown hops {{and one or two}} strains of brewer's yeast in its production. [...] Before packaging, the beer is filtered to produce a bright, clear appearance. [...] The beer is packaged before all of the fermentable sugars have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers. [...] Fermentation continues after packaging, and the carbon dioxide that is produced remains dissolved in the beer, resulting in a very high level of <b>carbonation</b> in the final product.|$|E
500|$|The {{taste is}} light and crisp, with some bite from the <b>carbonation.</b> [...] Brewing and tasting notes from a 1914 {{publication}} described Grodziskie as a [...] "rough, bitter beer ... with an intense smoke and hop flavor", {{but by the}} late 20th century, the style's flavor had likely evolved to include less hop flavor and bitterness. [...] Modern recreations of this style {{tend to focus on}} smoky flavor resulting from the oak-smoked malt, described as [...] "somewhat acrid to semi-sweet", but literature from the 1960s states that a significant proportion of the beer's unique flavors are produced by its malting and brewing process and special strains of brewer's yeast that were used in its production. [...] The flavor may also contain a mild wheat graininess noticeable in the background.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the main}} {{technologies}} proposed, {{three of them}} stand out: causticization with alkali and alkali-earth hydroxides, <b>carbonation,</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{forerunner of}} the machine, the [...] "Apparatus for aerating liquids", {{was created in}} 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd., and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household). Flavoured {{concentrates}} such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla, were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial <b>carbonation</b> machines, and the first machine for home <b>carbonation</b> of drinks was produced in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} by reacting {{naturally occurring}} Mg and Ca containing minerals with [...] to form carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notabl {{is the fact}} that carbonates have a lower energy state than , which is why mineral <b>carbonation</b> is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of [...] into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, conventional <b>carbonation</b> pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable <b>carbonation</b> route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, draught beer {{started to be}} served from {{pressurised}} containers. Artificial <b>carbonation</b> {{was introduced in the}} United Kingdom in 1936, with Watney’s experimental pasteurised beer Red Barrel. Though this method of serving beer did not take hold in the U.K. until the late 1950s, it did become the favored method in the rest of Europe, where it is known by such terms as en pression. The <b>carbonation</b> method of serving beer subsequently spread {{to the rest of the}} world; by the early 1970s the term [...] "draught beer" [...] almost exclusively referred to beer served under pressure as opposed to the traditional cask or barrel beer.|$|E
2500|$|Ultramafic mine {{tailings}} are a readily available source of fine-grained metal oxides that {{can act as}} artificial carbon sinks to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry. Accelerating passive [...] sequestration via mineral <b>carbonation</b> may be achieved through microbial processes that enhance mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation.|$|E
2500|$|Non-hydraulic cement, such as {{slaked lime}} (calcium oxide mixed with water), hardens by <b>carbonation</b> in the {{presence}} of carbon dioxide which is naturally present in the air. First calcium oxide (lime) is produced from calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) by calcination at temperatures above 825°C (1,517°F) for about 10 hours at atmospheric pressure: ...|$|E
2500|$|Today, White Zinfandels are {{considered}} part of the [...] "blush wine" [...] category of noticeably sweet, pale pink wines that often have very slight <b>carbonation</b> to give the wine a balance of acidity and some [...] "liveliness". Very often winemakers will blend aromatic varierties like Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Muscat to add to the fruity nose of the wine.|$|E
