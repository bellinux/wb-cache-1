5|$|Apart {{from the}} candela, all the base units will {{be defined in}} terms of {{universal}} physical <b>constants,</b> but without an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the <b>constants</b> and the base units. Thus six physical <b>constants</b> will be needed to define the six base units.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} <b>constants</b> {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical <b>constants,</b> from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these <b>constants</b> is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. <b>Constants</b> whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical <b>constants.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table catalogues {{the notable}} changes in determination of fundamental physical <b>constants.</b> The <b>constants</b> {{are expressed in}} direct measurements and fixed <b>constants</b> to minimize and determine the uncertainty. Some <b>constants</b> in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the relative uncertainty by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative uncertainty of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an uncertainty is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E

5|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} can {{be described}} quantitatively {{in terms of the}} inhibitor's binding to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic <b>constants</b> of the enzyme. In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation <b>constants</b> Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical <b>constants</b> that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these <b>constants</b> have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical <b>constants</b> lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental <b>constants</b> were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the case}} for flat superspace, adding a <b>constant</b> to either the Kähler or super{{potential}} is now physical. A <b>constant</b> shift to the Kähler potential changes the effective Planck <b>constant,</b> while a <b>constant</b> shift to the superpotential changes the effective cosmological <b>constant.</b> As the effective Planck <b>constant</b> now depends upon {{the value of the}} chiral superfield X, we need to rescale the supervierbeins (a field redefinition) to get a <b>constant</b> Planck <b>constant.</b> This is called the Einstein frame.|$|R
