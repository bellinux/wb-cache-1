5|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} independent assessment {{carried out by the}} Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group, and made available to the public in October 2011, found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics, the urban heat island effect did not bias the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS. The Berkeley Earth group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911°C, and their results <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> those obtained from earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Maiden {{described}} variety lucida in 1902, and Bailey described variety glabrescens in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on {{the basis}} of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey's description more <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as Ficus rubiginosa forma glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E

It distinguishes between and <b>closely</b> <b>matches</b> all intervals involving up through the 12th overtones, {{with the exception of the}} greater undecimal neutral second (11:10). Although not as accurate, it can be considered a full 15-limit tuning as well.|$|R

5|$|Ruiz {{also noted}} that these {{subspecies}} differed in their preference of soil substrate. He first noted this while attempting to find the population of plants from which Humboldt and Bonpland had collected their type specimens in 1803. Although Ruiz {{was able to find}} many populations of the species growing in the areas that Humboldt and Bonpland had visited in the vicinity if Mina de Moran, only one population, the only one growing on limestone, matched H.B.K.'s description and their type and isotype specimens now housed in the herbarium of the French national museum of natural history. The other populations in the area grew on substrate of igneous origin and more <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> Hooker's 1846 description of P. orchidioides. These latter plants then became the new variety, P. moranensis ssp. neovolcanica.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
25|$|Large {{groups of}} Yellow Turbans roamed through China {{for years after}} the rebellion's defeat, most of them {{eventually}} joining {{the army of the}} warlord Cao Cao, whose agrarian reform policies <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> Zhang Jue's own programme.|$|E

25|$|Macaulay's minute largely {{coincided with}} Bentinck's views and Bentinck's English Education Act 1835 <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> Macaulay's {{recommendations}} (in 1836, a school named La Martinière, founded by Major General Claude Martin, {{had one of}} its houses named after him), but subsequent Governors-General took a more conciliatory approach to existing Indian education.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2005, Hennepin County and the Twins {{announced}} that they had reached a deal on financing. It <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> {{what would be the}} eventual funding solution.

25|$|In general, {{because the}} smaller semitone {{can be viewed}} as the {{difference}} between a minor third and a major third, and the larger as the difference between a major third and a perfect fourth, tuning systems that <b>closely</b> <b>match</b> those just intervals (6/5, 5/4, and 4/3) will also distinguish between the two types of semitones and <b>closely</b> <b>match</b> their just intervals (25/24 and 16/15).|$|R

25|$|The Republican base in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and suburbanites in the east. McCain <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group. However, in 2008, suburbanites in Northern Virginia and in the Richmond/Hampton Roads areas abandoned the Republican Party in droves, and it was simply impossible for McCain to win the state without their support.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, {{a further}} 300 houses were {{constructed}} at Wendouree West. Private {{housing in the}} adjacent suburb of Wendouree <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. Charles, Prince of Wales visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.|$|E
25|$|For a given result, {{the rule}} of how the two teams' points are {{calculated}} changes as the initial ratings change, from being based on teams' own ratings when one team is far stronger, to being based on the opponent's ratings when the teams are <b>closely</b> <b>matched,</b> back to being based on own ratings when the other team is far stronger. However, despite these sudden changes in the rule, the number of points awarded for each result changes smoothly as the initial ratings change.|$|E

25|$|The city of Canterbury was raided in the {{so-called}} Baedeker Blitz soon after the regiment arrived in the area, and thereafter the AA defences of Southern England were severely tested by the Luftwaffes 'hit-and-run' attacks along the South Coast from the summer of 1942. The AA Divisions were disbanded on 30 September and replaced by AA Groups that more <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> the organisation of RAF Fighter Command. 27th AA Brigade took responsibility for all S/L units under 2 AA Group covering South East England, though 8th S/L Bty was often operationally attached to 71 AA Brigade in 2 AA Group.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This {{was achieved by}} creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to look up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, whose visual patterns most <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.|$|E
25|$|The race {{then moved}} to the January 29 Florida primary. This would be a test for McCain among core Republican voters, as unlike New Hampshire and South Carolina, independents and Democrats {{would not be able}} to vote in the Republican primary. McCain, Giuliani and Romney were <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> in pre-election polls, and the contest was seen as {{important}} to each campaign, as it was the last primary before Super Tuesday, when 41% of the total delegates were up for grabs. It was also the first time that Rudy Giuliani would seriously compete for delegates since a partial effort in New Hampshire, and the first primary after Fred Thompson withdrew his candidacy.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 General Election, Fleetwood {{was joined}} with Lancaster and some Over Wyre {{locations}} {{to form the}} new Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency. Conservative member Eric Ollerenshaw was elected in a tight race. From 1997 to 2010, Fleetwood was included with Thornton, Poulton and parts of Blackpool, {{as part of the}} Blackpool North and Fleetwood parliamentary constituency. During that time the seat was held by Labour's Joan Humble. Prior to 1997, Fleetwood was part of the constituencies of Fylde North and Wyre, whose boundaries more <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> those of Wyre Borough, and which consistently returned a Conservative member. In the 2015 general election a majority vote saw Fleetwood become a Labour town once again, represented by Cat Smith.|$|E
25|$|The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group {{carried out}} an {{independent}} assessment of land temperature records, which examined {{issues raised by}} skeptics, such as the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, {{and the risk of}} data selection bias. The preliminary results, made public in October 2011, found that these factors had not biased the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre together with the Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT) and NASA's GISS in earlier studies. The group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911°C, and their results <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> those obtained from these earlier studies. The four papers they had produced had been submitted for peer review.|$|E
25|$|Needing a {{location}} to shoot all takeoffs and landings for the 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High, including the spectacular B-17 Flying Fortress belly landing sequence {{early in the}} film, director Henry King selected Ozark since its dark runways more <b>closely</b> <b>matched</b> wartime bases in England {{as opposed to the}} light-colored runways at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the primary shoot location. Since the field had been allowed to overgrow during its inactive status, it was also an ideal location for the character Harvey Stovall to post-war reminisce about his World War II service (which is seen {{at the beginning of the}} film) before the crew mowed and dressed the field to start the rest of shooting.|$|E
