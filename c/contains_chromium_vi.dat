This study aims to generate PIM, separate the metal ion <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> using PIM and {{determine the effect of}} the concentration of the feed phase, the thickness of the membrane and the amount of usage of the membrane for ion <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> diffusion. Polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) was made by mixing Aliquat 336 -TBP as carrier compounds, PVC as the base polymer, DBE as a plasticizer and THF as a solvent. PIM membrane was placed between the source of analyte as a feed phase and result of the separation as a receiver phase. Feed phase was electroplating waste metal <b>containing</b> <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> at pH 4, while the receiver phase was a 2 N NaCl solution with a pH 6. 7. The change of variables in this study were the concentration of the feed phase at various dilution i. e., 100 x, 50 x and 10 x, the thickness of the membrane i. e., 25 μm, 20 μm and 10 μm, and the time of membrane using i. e., 1, 2 and 3 times. The concentration of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> diffused after separation process was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The stability of membrane was observed by analyzing the presence of membrane’s component in the feed phase and in the receiver phase. The analysis was conducted by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to determine the morphology of membrane surface. The results showed that the chromium ion concentration diffused from the feed phase was 99. 24 %, meanwhile the 85. 88 % of it diffused to the receiving phase. The highest Cr(VI) ions diffusion was occured at the first use of PIM membrane with a thickness of 10 μm and the concentration of the feed phase was 10. 55 ppm (resulted from 100 times dilution).

These properties bring {{opportunities for the}} development of high quality paper, film and membrane. The morphology and properties of BC can be altered during the fermentation process. The in situ modifications were done by the addition of additives not specifically required for growth of the bacteria in the fermentation medium. Therefore, active materials can be incorporated into bacterial cellulose films for different applications. In this research, the pandan extract was added to the fermentation medium to produce Bacterial Cellulose-Pandan film.

The {{most frequently used}} primer paints for these applications <b>contain</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>VI</b> (Cr VI) {{in the form of}} barium chromate and strontium chromate. Due to aircraft size and the nature of these tasks, control of Cr VI exposures is often difficult. Numerous studies of chromate related industries have identified worker exposures in excess of the OSHA PEL of 5 μg/m 3. Long-term analysis of chromate workers with known Cr VI exposures levels have shown elevated risk of mortality due to lung cancer. These evaluations highlight the importance of multi-layered control systems to reduce Cr VI exposure levels. This goal {{of this study was to}} investigate occupational inhalation exposures to Cr VI during worker performed tasks for corrosion control for military aircraft. Sample results for three primary tasks, abrasive blasting, sanding, and primer (paint) application, were obtained at a major military aircraft maintnance facility. These results were evaluated to determine if the exposure distribution allowed for establishment of Similar Exposure Groups (SEGs) within the department. The results of this study found Cr VI exposures above the OSHA PEL occurred in each task, but that the mean exposures of each task were not significantly different. A high degree of variability was observed in the overall sample set and the individual tasks. Statistical analysis of the obtained data failed to justify separating the sampled tasks into separate SEGs.

40|$|Granular Activated Charcoal (GAC) was {{prepared}} by using Cordia macleodii tree bark and was {{tested for the}} removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> All the experiments were carried out in batch process. To enhance its metal ions adsorption capacity, activated carbons were impregnated with the chelating agents like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium dodecyl benzeneulfonate (SDBS) and Dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (DOSS) and were tested {{for the removal of}} <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> Adsorption isotherms of Chromium ions in aqueous solution have been experimentally measured on both modified and unmodified charcoal. Effects of adsorbent dose, pH, contact time, initial concentration and temperature were investigated on removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI).</b> Adsorption was confirmed by SEM-EDAX and FTIR morphological analysis. The adsorption data were fitted well by Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Approximately 96. 54 % of hexavalent Chromium was removed at pH 2 within 3 hr. It was found that chemically modified GAC with chelating agents demonstrated better <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal capabilities as compared to pure adsorbents in terms of their adsorption rate. On the basis of present studies, it can be concluded that granular activated charcoal impregnated with chelating agents has a higher <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> adsorption capacity...|$|R

The adsorbent material adopted {{was found to be}} an efficient media for removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ion in continuous mode using fixed bed column. A comparative study has also been done on the adsorption capacity of saw dust of different mesh sizes. The column studies were conducted with a fixed column of diameter 7 cms and a bed height of 50 cms. The flow rate of solution passing through the adsorbent bed was maintained at a fixed value of 1 litre/min. It was found that the metal uptake capacity (amount of removal) of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> ion decreased but the adsorption capacity (percentage of removal) increased with the decrease in the concentration of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> in the initial sample solution. It was also observed that the order of metal uptake capacity & adsorption capacity of saw dust of different ISS mesh size for removal of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal was as follows: (- 30 + 10) > (- 50 + 30) > (- 70 + 50). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{removal of}} <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> from aqueous {{solutions}} by Donnan dialysis {{has been investigated}} in this paper. In this process, two anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) were used: Selemion & 174  AMV and Neosepta & 174 AFN. The amount of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removed was determined {{in terms of the}} following parameters: initial concentration of <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI),</b> type of anion-exchange membrane, concentration of counter-ion and magnetic stirring rate. A 24 full factorial design analysis was performed to screen the parameters affecting the Cr (VI) removal efficiency. Using the experimental re sults, a linear mathematical model representing the influence of the different parameters as well as their interactions was obtained. Analysis of the variance (ANOVA), the F-test and the student’s test show s that the type of anion-exchange membrane is the most significant parameter affecting the <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal.

40|$|Abstract- Hazardous metals such as {{chromium}} {{in industrial}} wastewater followed by leaching to ground water are {{threat to the}} environment because of their toxicity {{and their impact on}} our ecosystem. Among the different heavy metals, <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> is a common and very toxic pollutant being introduced into natural waters from a variety of industrial wastewaters. Chromium (III) is an essential element for organisms that can disrupt the sugar metabolism and cause heart conditions, when the daily dose is too low. <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> is mainly toxic to organisms. It can alter genetic materials and cause cancer. Adverse health effects associated with Cr (VI) exposure include occupational asthma, eye irritation and damage, perforated eardrums, respiratory irritation, kidney damage, liver damage, pulmonary congestion and edema, upper abdominal pain, nose irritation and damage, respiratory cancer, skin irritation, and erosion and discoloration of the teeth. Some workers can also develop an allergic skin reaction, called allergic contact dermatitis. The <b>Chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> discharged from various industries has potential to contaminate drinking water sources {{and is one of the}} most important environmental problems due to its health impacts on human. Adsorption is one of the effective techniques for <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal from wastewater. In the present study, adsorbent has been prepared from Syzygium cumini (L.) seed and studies are carried out for <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> removal.

Considering the versatility of cyanobacteria and their ability to survive under diverse environmental condition, strains originating from different habitats must be studied with respect to their applicability (Hameed and Hasnain 2005). Many microorganisms are known to reduce <b>chromium</b> (<b>VI)</b> to <b>chromium</b> (III).
