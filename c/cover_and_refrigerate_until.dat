The 2 soils used were a Weld loam (fine montmorillonitic, mesic, Aridic Paleustoll) from near Akron, Colorado, and a Duroc loam (fine silty, mixed mesic Pachic Haplustoll) from near Sidney, Nebraska. The Akron soil was uniformly cropped to small grain crop-fallow rotations until 1989 when wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in conventional (stubble mulch) till-fallow, reduced till-fallow, and no-till fallow treatments were adopted.

Solutions of 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 10, and 0. 15 mM were prepared using Johanson solution as the SGL solvent. Seven-day-old bean seedlings grown in vermiculite in a greenhouse were transplanted to the solution. Seven days after transplantation, the beans did not show any sign of phytotoxicity; however, cytogenetic observations showed that SGL {{reduced the number of}} cells in prophase, metaphase, and anaphase stages.

40|$|Background: Tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) {{in blood}} {{might be a}} helpful biomarker in various diseases. However, various authors report that TIMP- 1 is dependent on preanalytical procedures. Our study was performed to determine how storage conditions and time to centrifugation influence TIMP- 1. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six blood specimens were collected from each of 20 volunteers. Two specimens from each person were centrifuged/measured within 1 h after venipuncture and frozen at - 80 degrees C. They were thawed once or twice within 72 h. Eight specimens were stored at 20 degrees C in daylight, 8 at 20 degrees C <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> 8 at 4 C in daylight. Four {{of each of these}} 8 specimens were mixed once a day until centrifugation. A mixed and an unmixed specimen of each group was centrifuged/measured after 3, 6, 24 and 72 h. Results: TIMP- 1 increased after freeze/ thaw (p < 0. 001). Mixing blood specimens more than once caused increased TIMP- 1 (p < 0. 001). TIMP- 1 increased within 3 h of storage (p < 0. 001). The increase was lower in specimens <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: TIMP- 1 is unstable and has to be evaluated carefully. Blood should be centrifuged directly after venipuncture. For routine application, specimen handling must be standardized and carefully followed.

One of the illicit methods used by endurance athletes to gain an advantage is blood doping. These practices are used to raise an athlete's red blood cell count thus increasing the transportation of oxygen to muscle tissue, resulting higher stamina and performance. Blood transfusion fall into two categories: homologous and autologous. Homologous blood transfusions, where an athlete gets blood from another person, can be detected by flow cytometry. However, autologous blood transfusions, where the transfusions are done by taking the athlete's own blood <b>and</b> <b>refrigerating</b> it <b>until</b> future use, cannot be detected directly. My project has been inspired by this inability to detect autologous blood doping and I am establishing a capillary electrophoresis based method to meet this need. By using capillary electrophoresis, I have developed a method that allows me to distinguish between the clean and doped blood samples. The instrument has numerous advantages over other analytical instruments, including: higher resolution, smaller sample volume requirements, and shorter analysis times. A transfusion can be seen based on the electrophoretic mobility differences of the red blood cells. The difference in the mobility of the cells {{is the result of the}} natural aging process of the red blood cells, as well as storage induced changes. In particular the storage of the red blood cells alters the cells size, leading to the mobility differences that we observe.
