40|$|The {{pumping test}} in an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{with and without}} a low-permeability soil was studied experimentally to reveal {{the influence of the}} negative air pressure (NP) caused by the upper layer on the water content (w), the water pressure (Pw), {{as well as on the}} capillary pressure (Pc). The study demonstrates that the NP generated in the vadose zone during pumping in the capper aquifer has a significant influence on w, Pw and Pc. The Pc obtained from the <b>capped</b> <b>aquifer</b> is smaller than that without the upper layer. After the NP reaches a peak, the influence of the NP on Pc is gradually declined as the air inflows through the upper layer which makes the NP gradually return to zero. When the air pressure returns to the atmospheric pressure, Pc in the vadose zone is only correlated with Pw, the same as the case with no upper layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{probably}} {{least expensive}} form of hydrogen storage would be geological storage in formations easy to excavate, such as salt dome intrusions {{near the surface}} (which can be excavated by water flushing) or vertically curved, <b>capped</b> <b>aquifer</b> layers not requiring excavation at all. Such geological formation are already in use for natural gas storage and have proven very stable. Consideration of hydrogen diffusion through the associated cap layers (typically clay) suggests that hydrogen can be stored at pressures somewhat lower than those used for natural gas. Estimates of cost and methods of store construction will be given. The storage of hydrogen is of interest both in an energy system using hydrogen as an energy carrier (e. g. in connection with fuel cell vehicles) and also in an energy system with large contributions from renewable energy sources that cannot be stored, such as wind power or solar power. Scenarios for an energy system using either of these methods have been constructed and one will be pre-sented. The scenario technique allows a calculation {{of the amount of}} storage needed for smoothing the effect of intermittent source flow out of phase with variations in energy demand. It will be shown that for wind power, the required store size for dealing with the variations in wind is only typically a few weeks of average electricity usage. In case hydrogen can also to be used directly, e. g. in the transportation sector, additional surplus power can be converted to hydrogen and thereby diminishing the requirement for centralised storage. If the primary source is solar power, the re-quired storage period may be substantially larger, especially at high latitudes where the solar avail-ability exhibits strong seasonality...|$|E
40|$|Most {{analytical}} and numerical models developed to analyze pumping test data focus on saturated flow below the water table. Traditionally the soil above the initial water table prior to pumping has been {{thought to have}} little influence on the test results and has usually been ignored. It is hypothesized that, if the unsaturated zone is capped by low-permeability soil, airflow in the unsaturated zone may be developed during pumping and may have impact on the drawdown in the aquifer. A transient, three-dimensional and variably saturated flow model is employed to simulate the pumping-induced air and groundwater flows in both the saturated zone and unsaturated zone with a low-permeability layer. The results demonstrate that negative pressure in the unsaturated zone can be generated by pumping. The negative pressure begins to appear as the drawdown rate increases to a maximum, approaches a peak before the drawdown rate becomes zero, and then gradually disappears. Drawdown obtained from the <b>capped</b> <b>aquifer</b> is much greater because {{the water in the}} pores in the unsaturated zone is sucked by the negative pressure and the gravity drainage from the pores is hampered. Consequently, the drawdown versus time curve does not conform to the traditional S-shaped curve for an unconfined aquifer but {{is similar to that of}} a confined aquifer. If the airflow caused by the low-permeability cap is ignored, the error in estimated drawdown could be over 80 % for the specific parameters and aquifer configuration used in the study. The possible errors in parameter estimation when airflow is ignored are explored. Overall, the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can be overestimated and the specific yield of the aquifer underestimated if airflow is ignored. The estimation error for specific yield tends to be greater than that in hydraulic conductivity. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
30|$|Due {{to higher}} {{drawdown}} at {{the heel of}} a horizontal well, the “heel-to-toe effect” occurs which leads to early breakthrough (Li et al. 2013; Li and Zhu 2010; Moen and Asheim 2008; Sagatun 2010). During “heel to toe effect,” as the in-situ oil vacates the region near the heel more rapidly than at the toe, any existing gas <b>cap</b> or <b>aquifer</b> is seen as advancing more quickly toward the wellbore in this regions than at points along the wellbore with lower flux (Atkinson et al. 2004; Tabatabaei and Ghalambor 2011).|$|R
30|$|The {{life cycle}} of oil {{production}} from crude oil reservoirs involves three main stages: primary, secondary and tertiary. During primary recovery, reservoir-related forces, including gas <b>cap</b> expansion, <b>aquifer</b> expansion, dissolved gas expansion, rock and fluid expansion, gravity drainage, {{or a combination of}} these mechanisms provides sufficient energy to enable the oil to be produced through wellbores drilled into the reservoir. The oil production rate decreases as the energy associated with these mechanisms decreases. As a result, some secondary injection methods, mainly gas or water injection, are widely applied to help boost recovery as the impact of primary drive mechanisms decline. Primary and secondary recovery is typically responsible for recovering about 35 % of the in situ reservoir oil (Chatterjee 2006). Tertiary recovery methods, or enhanced oil recovery (EOR), when applied, are typically able to recover substantial additional oil from many reservoirs.|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{about the influence of}} microbial activities on the radionuclide migration is not very extended up to now. The sorption behaviour of the redox sensitive radionuclides " 9 " 5 "mTc and " 7 " 5 Se was investigated under consideration of microbial metabolism and the development of bacterial populations in loose sediments. Recirculation column experiments (aerobe) were carried out as well as batch experiments (aerobe and anaerobe). Sterile experiments were compared with non sterile experiments. The investigation of sterilising methods with low impact on the physico chemical properties of sediments proved gamma irradiation to be the best choice. The addition of nutrients in batch experiments showed an immobilisation of Tc and Se combined with a decreasing redox value (Eh). Non sterile recirculation experiments showed a reproducible fixation of Tc and Se without any observed decrease of the redox value. The immobilisation occurred without any measurable alteration of the marco environment. These results are not understandable taking thermodynamic data into consideration. There was no fixation of Tc and Se within 95 days in sterile column experiments. The addition of micro-organisms isolated from the non sterile columns led to a decreasing redox values. The addition of biocide (5000 ppm NaN_ 3) to the non sterile columns resulted in a remobilisation of Tc but not of Se. To a great extend the micro-orgnisms identified within the non sterile columns were allochthonous. The immobilisation of Tc by living cells is much bigger than by autoclaved (dead) cells. A microbial population in the <b>cap</b> rock <b>aquifers</b> is highly probables {{as well as in the}} disposal site (after the excavation and filling period). The assessment of the <b>cap</b> rock <b>aquifer's</b> retardation capacity for the radionuclide migration may be overestimated not knowing the impact of the autochthonous microflora on those radionuclides interacting with micro-orgnisms.

The IPR was generated for horizontal well with gas and water coning problems, producing from thin oil reservoir sandwiched between gas <b>cap</b> and <b>aquifer.</b> Two empirical IPR equations adopted from SPE paper by Whitson was also presented here. The first empirical relationship was developed based on simulated data for each reservoir pressure (stage of depletion) while the second relationship was developed based on all generated data. A fully implicit black-oil Cartesian model with total grid number of 1480 and 150 ft total thickness was used as reservoir model. The horizontal well extends through the full length of reservoir in y-direction with only one grid number along the horizontal section which makes the model a 2 D problem. Sensor reservoir simulator and Pipe-It software were utilized to generate the IPR data. This work also includes a sensitivity study to understand the effect of several parameters to gas and water coning behavior, well placement optimization, coning collapse study, and the effect of coning to maximum well production rate. In coning collapse study, a relationship between flowing bottom-hole pressure and reservoir pressure when the cone collapse is provided in graphical form.

40|$|Hydraulic Fracturing is a {{technique}} to accelerate production and enhance ultimate recovery {{of oil and gas}} while fracture geometry is an important aspect in hydraulic fracturing design and optimization. Systematic design procedures are available based on the so-called two-dimensional models (2 D) focus on the optimization of fracture length and width, assuming one can estimate a value for fracture height, while so-called pseudo three dimensional (p- 3 D) models suitable for multi-layered reservoirs aim to maximize well production by optimizing fracture geometry, including fracture height, half-length and width {{at the end of the}} stimulation treatment. The proposed p- 3 D approach to design integrates four parts: 1) containment layers discretization to allow for a range of plausible fracture heights, 2) the Unified Fracture Design (UFD) model to calculate the fracture half-length and width, 3) the PKN or KGD models to predict hydraulic fracture geometry and the associated net pressure and other treatment parameters, and, finally, 4) Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) to calculate fracture height. The aim is to find convergence of fracture height and net pressure. Net pressure distribution plays an important role when the fracture is propagating in the reservoir. In multi-layered reservoirs, the net pressure of each layer varies as a result of different rock properties. This study considers the contributions of all layers to the stress intensity factor at the fracture tips to find the final equilibrium height defined by the condition where the fracture toughness equals the calculated stress intensity factor based on LEFM. Other than maximizing production, another obvious application of this research is to prevent the fracture from propagating into unintended layers (i. e. gas <b>cap</b> and/or <b>aquifer).</b> Therefore, this study can aid fracture design by pointing out: (1) Treating pressure needed to optimize fracture geometry, (2) The containment top and bottom layers of a multi-layered reservoir, (3) The upwards and downwards growth of the fracture tip from the crack center...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMultiphase flow {{modelling}} involving gas {{and water}} {{is widely used}} in gas dissolution in aquifers or in aquifer gas storage. The parameters related to the gas are usually well known but {{the parameters of the}} aquifer system are not. In order to obtain reliable forecasts, it is necessary to calibrate the multiphase model on monitored data. This can be done by automatic calibration followed by the determination of the confidence limits of the parameters, and of the confidence limits of the forecasts. This paper presents a three-dimensional multiphase flow model for the simulation of gas-water, or NAPL-water couples. It integrates automatic calibration procedures based on Marquardt's algorithm for all types of parameters: hydraulic conductivity, which is classical, and also multiphase flow constitutive relations, aquifer compressibility and boundary limits. The model may be calibrated simultaneously on observations of different kinds of data, e. g. gas pressure, hydraulic heads, water saturation. A sensitivity analysis method, which integrates spatial or temporal dependence of the observations, follows the automatic calibration. The model is applied to data from a gas storage facility located in a gas <b>cap</b> in an <b>aquifer</b> near Paris (France); it has been monitored by the national Gaz de France company for more than 30 years.

40|$|A seismic {{and gravity}} {{study of the}} McGregor {{geothermal}} system, southern New Mexico T. M. O’Donnell, Jr. ⁄, K. C. Millerz, and J. C. Witcher⁄⁄ Seismic and gravity studies {{have proven to be}} valu-able tools in evaluating the geologic setting and eco-nomic potential of the McGregor geothermal system of southern New Mexico. An initial gravity study of the sys-tem demonstrated that a gravity high coincides with the heat-flow high. A subsequent seismic reflection survey images a strong reflector, interpreted to be associated with a bedrock high that underlies the gravity and heat-flow highs. A single reflection, which coincides with the water table, occurs within the Tertiary basin fill above bedrock. This reflector is subhorizontal except above structurally high bedrock, where it dips downward. This observation is consistent with well data that indicate a bedrock water table 30 m lower than water in the basin-fill aquifer. Velocity models derived from seismic to-mography show that the basin fill has velocities in the range of 800 to 4000 m/s and that the bedrock reflec-tor coincides with high velocities of 5000 to 6000 m/s. Low-velocity zones within the bedrock high are inter-preted as karsted bedrock with solution-collapse brec-cias and cavities filled with hot water. Higher velocity material that flanks the bedrock high may represent an earlier stage of basin fill or older alluvial-fan deposits. The heat-flow anomaly appears to be constrained to the region of shallowest bedrock that lacks these deposits, suggesting that they may act as an aquitard to <b>cap</b> under-lying bedrock <b>aquifers</b> or geothermal reservoirs. Taken together, these observations suggest that the geothermal system is associated with karsted and fractured struc-turally high bedrock that serves as a window for up-welling and outflow of thermal waters.

40|$|A marked {{change in}} ground water {{quality in the}} Safford Valley of Graham County, Arizona, {{averaging}} approximately + 0. 129 x 103 mhos electrical conductivity per year and + 35 parts per million chloride per year, has been documented between 1940 and 1972 with data from ten long -term sample wells. A chloride change map constructed between these two years shows a general increase of 200 to 400 ppm chloride. The 1972 iso- chemical maps show areas of up to 1600 ppm chloride and 8. 0 x 103 mhos electrical conductivity, which is extremely saline and considered threshold level for agricultural waters. The Safford Valley, a structural trough with approximately east -west orientation, averages 12 miles in width and 30 miles in length in the study area. Bounded by typical basin and range province mountains on the northeast and southwest, the valley contains a perennial stream flowing toward the west. A bi- aquifer system constitutes the ground water reservoir of the area with a deep, artesian aquifer of several thousand feet thickness overlaid by a water table aquifer averaging 400 feet in thickness and with the water table rarely over fifty feet from the surface on {{the eastern end of}} the valley, deepening to over 5000 feet at the western end. This bedrock -alluvium interface is the lower vertical constraint for the artesian system, thus the thickness of this aquifer increases downstream (to the west). The basin fill consists of a basal conglomerate overlaid by lacustrine evaporite beds, the <b>aquifer</b> <b>cap</b> beds, and recent alluvial material. The artesian aquifer is shown to be up to ten times as saline as the water table aquifer, and appears to increase in temperature and salinity in a downstream direction (corresponding to increasing thicknesses of lacustrine beds included in the extent of this aquifer). The decrement in the water quality of the surficial aquifer seems to be attributable to four major mechanisms. An increase in salinity may be expected from leakage of saline water from the artesian aquifer. Suck leakage would be stimulated by pumping- caused reduction of confining pressure, and by the puncture of the cap beds by deep wells. Water reaching the aquifer from natural recharge may contribute salts to the system. Such recharging water, if passed through soluble beds, could contribute to the salt content of the aquifer. Lateral movement of water through similar deposits may be a contribution, and the concentration and infiltration of agricultural water could also add to aquifer salinity. Ground water applied to the land surface is concentrated by evaporation and dissolves salts in the unsaturated zone as it re- enters the water table aquifer. Iso- salinity and salinity -change maps show the quality situation of the water table aquifer to be broken up into three major sections. From the eastern limit of the study area to Safford, the quality is relatively high and stable. From Safford to Pima there appears a uniform increase of low magnitude but continued decrement. Beyond Pima the area exhibits extremely irregular salinity conditions with marked increases and high salinity gradients. The salinity pattern corresponds to the extent of the underlying artesian aquifer but may be influenced to an unknown extent by the down- gradient transport of salts. The 1972 iso -chemical maps show chevrons of high quality water protruding into the aquifer at points corresponding to the locations of washes. Such wash bottoms are the principal zones of recharge in arid regions. Recharge from the Gila River is of extremely high quality relative to the salinity of the aquifer. There appear no configurations of iso -chemical lines which are attributable to internal movement through saline deposits. The hydraulic gradient of the water table aquifer is relatively constant and follows the gradient of the land surface. Concentration of irrigation water by evaporation and subsequent leaching while in conveyance to the water table seems to increase the salinity of this percolating water by approximately three -fold. The magnitude of this increase at any one point in space and time {{is a function of the}} volume of water applied to the land surface, the amount of evaporation, the initial chemical composition of the water, the chemical characteristics of the unsaturated zone through which it penetrates, and the transmission properties of the aquifer. The salinity increase seems significant but the extent of the contribution to the salinity of the aquifer is dependent on the amount of infiltration to the aquifer. This amount is currently undetermined, but is probably a sizable volume [...] especially from pre- irrigation applications. A sociologic investigation based on responses from a detailed questionnaire - interview program of 41 farmers (25 percent of the farming population), indicated that there is an awareness of the high salinity of ground water being used for irrigation but relatively little concern about the rate of increase of that salinity. The farmers seem reluctant to leave the area and are willing to take somewhat greater economic losses than expected. Since the farmers of the area are principally Mormon, there may be a tie to this historically Mormon region which is stronger than usual. The economic analysis of the Safford Valley based on the modeling of a "Representative Farm" analog indicates that cotton will remain economical to produce on the basis of the projected salinity trends and ceteris paribus conditions, for a significant time beyond limits of prediction. The analysis indicates that the optimum salt-resistant crops for the area are being cultivated, and that of these, alfalfa, the least tolerant, will cease to be productive in large areas of the valley by 1990. The entire valley will not be able to economically produce alfalfa by 2040, but will remain in production since it is a necessary crop for cotton and the cotton profits should be sufficient to cover the alfalfa losses. Pumping is the only element in the operation of the social, physical and economic systems by which salinity change could be influenced significantly. The area east of Safford is the optimal pumping region while that west of Pima is the worst. The employment of surface water should be maximized, and salt- oriented field methods should be employed. Although agriculture does not seem in danger in predictable time, these practices would increase yield (or slow the decrease) and postpone the day when farming will no longer by profitable in the Safford Valley of Graham County, Arizona...|$|R
