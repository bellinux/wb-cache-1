50|$|Released in 1990, the Sound Blaster 1.5, CT1320C, {{dropped the}} C/MS chips, which {{were no longer}} popular with game developers. Instead, the board had two empty sockets, which could be user {{upgraded}} by purchasing the C/MS chips directly from Creative or Phillips SAA-1099s from another source. Otherwise the <b>card</b> <b>functions</b> identically to the Sound Blaster 1.0. The CT1320U variety has the same layout as the CT1320C.|$|R
50|$|Dolby SR was {{originally}} implemented in Dolby's Cat.280 card, which was pin-compatible with the Cat.22 A-type noise reduction card. Thus, devices {{that took the}} Cat. 22 card could be upgraded from A to SR by replacing the Cat. 22 with the Cat. 280. The Cat.280 <b>card</b> <b>functions</b> in many devices including Dolby's Model 361 frame. Some Dolby Cinema processors require a special version, the Cat.280T, which functions for decoding (playback) only.|$|R
5000|$|This {{situation}} {{existed only}} {{for a short time}} under both APIs. Second-generation pixel shading <b>cards</b> <b>functioned</b> far more similarly, with each architecture evolving toward the same kind of pixel processing conclusion. As such, Pixel Shader 2.0 allowed a unified code path under Direct3D. Around the same time OpenGL introduced its own ARB-approved vertex and pixel shader extensions ( [...] and [...] ), and both sets of cards supported this standard also.|$|R

All unused <b>cards</b> <b>function</b> as the sideboard, which, as in [...] "Constructed" [...] formats, can be freely exchanged between games of a match, {{as long as the}} deck continues to adhere to the forty card minimum. The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply.|$|R
50|$|The Lock service {{allows users}} to shut down their <b>card</b> <b>function</b> {{whenever}} they want, with a swipe on the credit card app. Limit, on the other hand, {{can be used to}} set credit limits for certain time periods. The Virtual Card Numbers prevent card identity theft online by providing users with a set of numbers that can replace the customers’ actual credit card information online. The PayShot makes online shopping easier by simplifying the payment process. Shoppers only need to log into one of seven different online shopping malls when using their Hyundai cards.|$|R
50|$|The AdvancedMC card is {{considered}} powerful enough {{that there are}} situations where the processing functionality is the only requirement. The MicroTCA standard is targeted at supplying a COTS chassis that will allow AMC <b>cards</b> to <b>function</b> without any AdvancedTCA carrier <b>card.</b> The <b>function</b> of the ATCA carrier board and of the ATCA shelf manager are concentrated on one board, which is called the MicroTCA Carrier Hub (MCH). On July 6, 2006 MicroTCA R1.0 was approved. Since this approval, companies like Advantech, Kontron, N.A.T., Annapolis Micro Systems, VadaTech, have launched AMC and MCH products.|$|R

2500|$|The SDIO and SD {{interfaces}} are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices {{built for}} SDIO cards generally accept SD memory <b>cards</b> without I/O <b>functions.</b> However, {{the reverse is}} not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the <b>card's</b> I/O <b>functions.</b> For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO <b>card</b> does not <b>function</b> fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} graphic trade {{cards in}} eighteenth-century consumer cultures in Britain, France and North America. Trade cards were single-sheet commercial notices promoting {{the names and}} locations of individual trades-people alongside {{the goods and services}} they supplied. They formed part of a larger category of prints distributing economic information to buyers and sellers. However, the production, role and <b>function</b> of trade <b>cards</b> made them distinct from other forms of commercial advertising. I examine their modes of production and use to suggest the part they played in the professionalisation of retail practices as well as the fashioning of vocational identities for tradesmen. I consider the consumer profile that trade cards targeted and suggest that they appealed to distinct sets of shoppers who read the cards in conjunction with other texts, graphic prints and educative illustrations in books and magazines. Trade <b>cards</b> <b>functioned</b> as multimedia advertisements for an audience interested in cultures of knowledge as well as shopping and new consumer goods. I examine how early engravers used trade card commissions to raise their profile as imaginative artists. I consider the ways in which trade cards supported long-term socioeconomic relationships between buyers and sellers over time and space, and examine their roles as invoices and gifts in systems of credit. I am particularly interested in understanding how trade <b>cards</b> <b>functioned</b> uniquely as promotional notices and mediatory devices for a limited period in the history of consumer culture. The final chapter examines French and American trade cards. In their national contexts, trade cards advertised through a culturally-encoded graphic and textual vocabulary familiar to native consumers. They helped develop and disseminate the emblems and symbols that promoted national identities, agendas and priorities {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century. I extend this analysis beyond national geographic boundaries to demonstrate how trade <b>cards</b> also <b>functioned</b> as international business cards, supporting commercial networks in global trade.

30|$|In the “member plus fund” model, the “metro prepaid card” {{is used as}} the carrier. Card holders will {{be invited}} to become the members, {{and then with the}} {{reference}} of the internet financial mode of “Yu’e Bao” in China, the <b>card</b> <b>functions</b> will be extended for the investment and wealth management. The return on the investment will be higher than the bank’s time-deposit interest rate. Meanwhile, the <b>card</b> has the <b>function</b> for withdrawal of the demand deposit in order to encourage members to increase their deposit amount. Then, the capital deposit in the prepaid card will be put into the metro industry’s investment fund established by metro enterprises {{for the purposes of the}} metro construction, property development, purchases and self-holding of quality commercial property along the metro. Therefore, metro enterprises will raise low-cost capital fund and, through the investment in the quality projects, realize capital returns and added values while metro members will share a stable and comparatively high yield that will be undoubtedly a win–win result.|$|R
40|$|The transcription-repair {{coupling}} factor (TRCF, {{the product of}} the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair. TRCF uses its ATP-dependent DNA translocase activity to remove transcription complexes stalled at sites of DNA damage, and stimulates repair by recruiting components of the nucleotide excision repair pathway to the site. A protein/protein interaction between TRCF and the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is essential for TRCF <b>function.</b> <b>CarD</b> (also called CdnL), an essential regulator of rRNA transcription in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shares a homologous RNAP interacting domain with TRCF and also interacts with the RNAP β-subunit. We determined the 2. 9 -Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the RNAP interacting domain of TRCF complexed with the RNAP-β 1 domain, which harbors the TRCF interaction determinants.
