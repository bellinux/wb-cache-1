50|$|Van Dyke brown, {{also known}} as Cassel earth or <b>Cologne</b> <b>earth,</b> is a dark brown color named after the painter Anthony van Dyck.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} was probably undertaken during Holbein's {{first visit to}} Britain in 1526-28, and it contains azurite, copper resinate, lead white, lamp black, red earth, <b>Cologne</b> <b>earth</b> and vermilion pigments, held in a linseed oil binder.|$|E
50|$|The 17th and 18th century saw the {{greatest}} use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject {{appeared out of}} the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or <b>Cologne</b> <b>earth.</b> This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown.|$|E

40|$|Fucino basin is {{the largest}} intermountain tectonic {{depression}} of the central Apennines (Abruzzo, Italy). It hosts a thick and continuous succession of fine-grained lacustrine sediments interbedded with several fall-out deposits from the pery- Tyrrhenian Quaternary volcanic centres. In co-operation with international scientific partners (CNR-IGG of Pisa, Institut für Geologie und Mineralogie of <b>Cologne,</b> School of <b>Earth</b> Sciences of Melbourne) we performed multi-proxy geochemical analyses (XRF scanning for Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Rb, Sr and Zr; total organic carbon, TOC; total inorganic carbon, TIC; total nitrogen and sulphur; oxygen and carbon stable isotopes) on a long core (87 m) retrieved from the Fucino basin in June 2015. On {{the basis of a}} tephrostratigraphic age-model developed at the CNR-IGAG in Rome the core span continuously between ca. 3000 and 160, 000 yr. In this thesis we investigated an interval constrained between two Latium tephra layers corresponding to the 84. 6 ± 5. 1 and 36. 2 ± 1. 6 ka time-span. This period of time covers basically the ignition of the last glaciation (the transition between MIS 5 and MIS 4 in the marine isotope scale) and part of the last Pleniglacial period which was characterised by abrupt climatic and environmental changes on both global and regional scale. From time series of our proxy data we recognised complex low frequency trends with superposed higher frequency oscillations. We interpreted observed variations in terms of palaeohydrological and palaeoenvironmental changes in the lake catchment. On the basis of the most significative proxies (Ti, Ca, TOC%, TIC%, δ 18 O) we divided the record into three different periods: the first spanning between 85 and 68 ka, the second between 68 and 50 ka and the third between 50 and 36 ka. In our interpretation, the first period was characterised by low minerogenic input, high lake primary productivity and an enhanced precipitation. The second period had generalised high minerogenic input and low lake primary production, although it was mainly characterised by high-frequency and high- amplitude oscillations suggesting high frequency environmental instability. The beginning of the third period is marked by an abrupt increase in minerogenic input and by a prominent decrease in lake primary production. Overall, minerogenic input was high and lake productivity low. This period was mainly characterised by rather stable environmental conditions which were supported by less intense and abrupt variations in the hydrological regime. The last 2 - 3 ky of our record displayed a restoration of high-frequency and high-amplitude oscillations. By comparing our record with other regional (Monticchio Lake pollen record) and external (North Atlantic marine cores, Greenland ice cores) climatic archives and with Northern Hemisphere insolation curves we recognised a strong climatic coherence at a regional scale. We interpreted the 84, 6 - 68 ka period as representative of late MIS 5 interglacial conditions, the 68 - 50 ka period as representative of the onset of MIS 4 fully glacial conditions and the 50 - 36 ka period as representative of MIS 3 mild glacial conditions over the Western Mediterranean basin. Rapid oscillations in the hydrological regime over the lake catchment and in soil erosion rates can be regarded as the expression of Heinrich events and DO events, recognised in the North Atlantic, over the Mediterranean...|$|R
5000|$|Van Dyck brown, {{known in}} Europe as <b>Cologne</b> <b>earth</b> or Cassel earth, is another natural earth pigment, {{that was made}} up largely of decayed vegetal matter. It made a rich dark brown, and was widely used during the Renaissance to the 19th century It {{takes its name from}} the painter Anthony van Dyck, but it was used by many other artists before him. It was highly {{unstable}} and unreliable, so its use was abandoned by the 20th century, though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments. The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red, or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue.|$|E
