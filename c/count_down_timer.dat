Hitting the Time Rift targets {{to the left}} cause the <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> to add time and the bonus amount to increase by 5 million. Both the time increases and the bonus amount top out once the bonus reaches 25 million; further hits add no extra time or score. Each time the target is hit, a different character speaks. One Artifact is awarded after hitting any 4 Rift Markers (duplicates count).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of the game is}} to capture all of the enemy's planets. Game play is normally between only two teams, the other two quarters of the galaxy being known as [...] "third space", referring to the third-party nature of the non-playing teams. When two teams each have at least four players, the server enters [...] "Tournament Mode", or [...] "T-Mode", in which planets can be bombed and captured. Once one team has only two planets remaining, a twenty-minute <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> for their automatic surrender begins. Capturing a third planet will freeze the counter, while a fourth will remove the threat of automatic surrender.|$|E

He also stated his belief that telling someone the time in which they may die would awaken an alertness for every moment of existence.|$|R
50|$|Also {{provided}} are two programmable 16-bit interval timer/counters with latches. Timer 1 may {{be operated}} in a one-shot or free-run mode. In either mode, a timer can generate an interrupt {{when it has}} <b>counted</b> <b>down</b> to zero. <b>Timer</b> 2 functions as an interval counter or a pulse counter. If operating as an interval counter, timer 2 {{is driven by the}} microprocessor's Ø2 clock source. As a pulse counter, timer 2 is triggered by an external pulse source on the chip's PB6 line.|$|R
40|$|Mobile digital {{behaviour}} changes interventions (mDBCIs) {{are becoming}} increasingly useful and necessary within healthcare and wellbeing. Health interventions need {{to close the gap}} between intention to behave and the behaviour itself. If apps fail to engage users, the behavioural intervention material is never seen. This paper investigates the measurements of engagement using a health based quiz app. Quiz questions were created using the NHS website and fell into the following six categories: “healthy eating”, “losing weight”, “sleep”, “fitness”, “food” and “smoking”. Gamification features such as <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timers</b> were used to encourage user participation. Notifications, with individual goals, were sent out to nudge the users to play the quiz. Engagement was measured in two ways. Firstly, a count of completed quiz questions to illustrate app engagement. Secondly, a participants learning was evaluated using a learning curve. This measured whether a participant understood and retained the health facts, illustrated by an improvement in their answers over time. A comparison between two participants using the first measurement (count of completed quiz questions) would have shown an identical rate of engagement, both answering 44 questions. However, the second measure (engagement with app content) showed a different rate of engagement. One participant improved producing the expected learning curve whilst the other consistently answered questions wrong, showing a lack of engagement with the intervention material. Participants were allowed to select their preferred category of question and in this case chose different areas. This was to encourage them to choose topics of interest to further improve their commitment to the study and provide a more personal experience. Future research would include more participants within each question category for further analysis and direct comparison. However, this research illustrates that these two types of engagement, app and intervention material, separately paint different pictures. To improve the design and effectiveness of mDBCIs engagement analysis, studies need to utilise more than one method of measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{ping-pong}} type {{of movement}} is a typical motion manner in mobile IPv 6 networks, which will bring frequent handovers and thus increase signaling burden. On the other hand, reducing handover delay in this case {{seems to be more}} significant. In this paper we propose a fast seamless handover scheme for the ping-pong {{type of movement}} as an extension to the hierarchical mobile IPv 6. Based on the simulation results, it can be observed that, by setting the reservation active flag (RAF) and the offline <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> (CDT), the scheme significantly reduces QoS signaling cost and handover delay. Furthermore, the simulations work out an optimized CDT for acquiring better cost performance of resource reservation. I...|$|E
40|$|Intersections are {{bottleneck}} in {{the highway}} networks and critical determinant of system&# 8217;s capacity and safety. Recently, several countdown timers had been installed at intersections in Kuala Lumpur {{and some other}} cities in Malaysia. The function of these timers is to aid drivers to judge {{the amount of time}} left for them to get the green signal for moving (starting) their vehicles as well as the amount of green time available for them to proceed across the intersection or to stop safely before the signal turns red. This advance information is supposed to help drivers in reducing their initial delay, especially for the first few vehicles and improving safety level. In the present research six intersections, three with count down timers and three with no-count down timer are analyzed to study the effect of <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> on driver behavior, intersection approach headway and safety levels. The study suggests that countdown timer has got little effect on initial delay but the effect on headway is significant. The violation of traffic light by the drivers for countdown and normal signal is also compared...|$|E
40|$|A new total-on-time {{interlock}} {{has increased}} the operational time limits of the Neutral Beam systems at DIII-D. The interlock, called the Neutral Beam On-Time-Limiter (NBOTL), is a custom built CAMAC module utilizing a Xilinx 9572 Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) as its primary circuit. The Neutral Beam Injection Systems are {{the primary source of}} auxiliary heating for DIII-D plasma discharges and contain eight sources capable of delivering 20 MW of power. The delivered power is typically limited to 3. 5 s per source to protect beam-line components, while a DIII-D plasma discharge usually exceeds 5 s. Implemented as a hardware interlock within the neutral beam power supplies, the NBOTL limits the beam injection time. With a continuing emphasis on modulated beam injections, the NBOTL guards against command faults and allows the beam injection to be safely spread over a longer plasma discharge time. The NBOTL design is an example of incorporating modern circuit design techniques (CPLD) within an established format (CAMAC). The CPLD {{is the heart of the}} NBOTL and contains 90 % of the circuitry, including a loadable, 1 MHz, 28 bit, BCD <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer,</b> buffers, and CAMAC communication circuitry. This paper discusses the circuit design and implementation. Of particular interest is the melding of flexible modern programmable logic devices with the CAMAC format...|$|E

Lock-on mode [...] "sticks" [...] the reticle to enemies, but is less damaging than manually aimed fire. The player can also attack using a powerful energy sword by tapping the fire button when enemies, or {{certain types of}} projectiles, are within close range. Projectiles struck in this manner are bounced back and can potentially inflict great damage on opponents. While the player attacks, a timer {{at the top of}} the screen <b>counts</b> <b>down.</b> When the <b>timer</b> hits 0, the player gradually loses more and more life until he or she either refills the timer or dies.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Intersections are {{bottleneck}} in {{the urban}} highway network and critical determinant of system’s capacity, efficiency and safety. Recently, several countdown timers had been installed at intersections in Kuala Lumpur and some other cities in Malaysia. The function of these timers is to aid drivers to judge {{the amount of time}} left for them to get the green signal for starting their vehicles. This advance information is supposed to help drivers in reducing their initial delay especially for the first few vehicles. In the present research one intersection in a non-CBD area has been analyzed to study the effect of <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> on driver behavior and intersection approach capacity. The data is collected at the same intersection before and after the installation of count down signal in order to exclusively study the effect of timer, keeping other factors the same. The intersection approach capacity of countdown signal is compared with normal signal and other standards. The study suggests that countdown timer has got very little effect on capacity. Though there is large variation in capacity values for different cycles, but the average capacity values for both countdown and normal signal approach are very close to US Highway Capacity Manual values. For the safety level comparison of conventional and timer signalized intersections the data for red light running is analyzed and results are reported...|$|E
40|$|In {{the ancient}} {{paradigm}} of learning process, teacher gave students knowledge passively, which was teacher centered. On the other hand, students were {{just waiting for}} the “knowledge transferring” from the teacher. Teacher play as a main source of knowledge who transfer his knowledge like writing in a blank paper. However, in the reality there are still students who do not interest to learn English. They sometimes feel bored in the learning process. It might be caused by the situation and condition of class, the difficult or uninteresting material. It is like that students who do not interest to learn English may get an unsatisfying achievement. In order to solve this problem, it can be done by increasing the activeness of students’ participation. If students are given a chance to be more active, they can acquire knowledge, ideas by themselves. One of the learning method that is predicted to solve the problems is cooperative - STAD (Student Team - Achievement Division). In this method, each student has individual responsibility to master the material by being active during the learning process. Students will be motivated to encourage and help each others to master material presented by teacher. If students want their team to earn rewards, they must help their team to learn the material well. This research was a pre-experimental research. The subject of the study was the seventh grade students of SMPN 36 Surabaya. The data was the students’ pre-test and post-test in procedures text material. Then, the data was analyzed by using sample paired t-test. The instruments were observation check list and test. Result of post-test score that has been analyzed by using sample paired t- test shows thitung = 10. 86 and tlabel = 2, 02 with significance level 5 % or 0, 05. It means that t hitung> t tabel. So, there is a significance influence on students’ achievement before and after the application of STAD. The result indicated that cooperative learning - STAD method has influence in improving students’ achievement, because the students’ score in post-test is better than in pre-test. Based on the result of this study, researcher suggests that cooperative learning - STAD applied at the certain topics or theme. Further, in order to make time more effective, it may use <b>count</b> <b>down</b> <b>timer</b> or work time framer for each teams and never forget to make a clear explanation. To solve a noisy, it may give students an instant assignment on the board or give them some hand gestures that means they need to be more quite...|$|E
