50|$|Certain {{kinds of}} {{learning}} are very expensive {{in terms of}} energy, i.e., ogdens, while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the <b>content</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School {{is not the only}} place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebodys name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The “mental glue” necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy.|$|E

5000|$|Pedagogical <b>content</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> {{course the}} main reason for {{creating}} an edugraphic. The contents have to be related to a specific subject for the course. For example, in a French course, if the teacher is explaining the vocabulary of the body (head, mouth, eyes, etc.), instead of listing the vocabulary, a simple edugraphic will use a picture or a drawing of a character's body and each part will be pointed out with arrows. But that is a simple edugraphic. What about explaining the use of an auxiliary verb in French (‘avoir’: to be) to the student? The edugraphic could show illustrations of someone's birthday: [...] "j'ai 15 ans", someone who is showing a car as if it were his: [...] "j'ai une voiture", or someone who is really cold : [...] "j'ai froid".|$|E
50|$|Speech {{recognition}} {{consists of}} a transcript of the speech of the audio track of the videos, creating a text file. In this way {{and with the help}} of a phrase extractor can easily search if the video <b>content</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> interest. Some search engines apart from using speech recognition to search for videos, also use it to find the specific point of a multimedia file in which a specific word or phrase is located and so go directly to this point. Gaudi (Google Audio Indexing), a project developed by Google Labs, uses voice recognition technology to locate the exact moment that one or more words have been spoken within an audio, allowing the user to go directly to exact moment that the words were spoken. If the search query matches some videos from YouTube, the positions are indicated by yellow markers, and must pass the mouse over to read the transcribed text.|$|E
