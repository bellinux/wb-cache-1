50|$|By late 1790, {{a surface}} canal {{connected}} Wet Earth Colliery to Botany Bay Colliery. This opened fully in 1791. Fletcher linked this canal to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal enabling him to <b>get</b> <b>coal</b> from <b>mine</b> to the coal wharfs in Manchester some 6 mi away. Although started in 1791, the canal was not linked and navigable until 1800. At the same time, a small canal was cut {{to connect to}} a basin constructed inside the mine next to the shaft to enable coal to be loaded directly onto barges and then to Manchester. This 1½ mile section of canal became known as Fletcher's Canal.|$|R
40|$|As <b>coal</b> <b>mines</b> <b>get</b> deeper, more {{mechanised}} {{and more}} productive the heat {{load on the}} ventilation system increases. In certain cases {{to the point where}} serious environmental problems may arise. To continue mining in these demanding conditions the sources of heat must be identified and evaluated so ameliorative measures may be taken. Due to the trend towards mining at greater rates and further from the shaft, mined coal on the conveyors is being recognised as a heat source of growing importance. This thesis describes its investigation. Reviews of heat sources, psychrometry,heat stress indices and heat transfer are included to provide a background framework. The evaluation of the heat released by conveyed coal itself consists of theoretical treatment and laboratory investigations of heat transfer through broken coal. A model conveyor and its instrumentation constructed in a duct are described along with underground measurements at mines. The information obtained from theoretical, laboratory and on site investigations is analysed and summarised to provide a basis for future prediction...|$|R
40|$|Stability Classification Abstract. Affected by a {{group of}} {{underground}} chambers and gobs of working faces, the track sub-inclined shaft of 430 <b>mining</b> area in <b>Geting</b> <b>coal</b> <b>mine,</b> which crosses coal seam and faults repetitively, lies in high and complex stress environment. Based on geostress results measured in the field, FLAC 3 D numerical simulation software was used to simulate the regional geostress in the area near the roadway, referring to the impact of the gobs and chambers. And the stress variation law along the roadway was given at last. Then the roadway roof structure zone chart was drawn according to the detection results with the rock video detection recorder. Finally, stability of different sections of the roadway and the support advice corresponding to each section was gained. The results show that comprehensive consideration of geostress variation law and surrounding rock structure is necessary in the stability classification and the support of roadways. The research methods and ideas given in this paper is feasible. Project Overvie...|$|R

50|$|The SAB makes {{recommendations}} concerning monitoring {{to characterize}} baseline groundwater quality {{prior to the}} start of <b>mining</b> <b>operations,</b> monitoring to detect any leachate excursions during mining, and monitoring to determine when groundwater quality has stabilized after <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> have been completed. The SAB also reviews the advantages and disadvantages of alternative statistical techniques to determine whether post-operational groundwater quality has returned to near pre-mining conditions and whether <b>mine</b> <b>operation</b> can be predicted not to adversely impact groundwater quality after site closure acceptance.|$|R
