40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>path</b> <b>scheduling</b> is a {{well-developed}} {{tool for}} construction planning at the project level. A {{substantial amount of}} {{research has focused on}} adding probabilistic capabilities to the technique. Simulation-based methods are almost universally accepted as the most effective because of their modeling versatility and power. Some scheduling models based on simulation recognize correlation between activity durations and allow the probabilistic selection of paths within a network. Very few techniques, however, allow activity duration and sequencing to be defined in terms of the dynamic information that becomes available as a project evolves. This paper presents a program for probabilistic CPM scheduling designed as an add-on to the STROBOSCOPE simulation system. The add-on allows the duration of an activity to be specified as a formula that depends on any scheduling information that may be available when the activity starts. This includes the actual start date and duration of activities already started as well as the dates and floats for activities yet to start. This capability and the ability to combine probabilistic scheduling with construction process simulation make the CPM add-on and the STROBOSCOPE simulation system {{one of the most powerful}} project planning tools available today...|$|E

40|$|Timed initial literals {{refer to}} a {{recently}} added feature to the problem domain description language PDDL. Besides the modelling perspective to express exogenous events, this language extension allows to impose deadlines to action execution and to select temporal plans of high quality. For efficiently solving problems with explicit timing requirements, the work in this paper extends a two-stage planning/scheduling system where the sequential plan is built followed by a <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> <b>scheduling</b> phase to find a parallel arrangement. Timed initial literals are included into the plan finding and scheduling process in form of time windows for action execution. Compared to earlier work, the temporal model is refined to include slack and to allow overlappings of dependent actions. The apparently simple scheduling phase is faster than other approaches to establish parallel plans, but expressive enough to cope with current benchmark problems. Through its efficiency, it applies not only to schedule complete plans, but also partial and relaxed plans. Correctness and optimality of the algorithms are shown, and limitations of the approach are discussed. Empirical evidence is given by providing plans for many temporal planning problems...|$|E

40|$|VLIW {{scheduling}}, profile driven scheduling, superblocks, hyperblocks Code scheduling {{to exploit}} instruction level parallelism (lLP) {{is a central}} problem in compiler optimization research, {{in light of the}} increased use of long-instruction-word computers. Unfortunately, optimum scheduling is computationally intractable, and one must resort to carefully crafted heuristics in practice. Ifthe scope of application of a scheduling heuristic is limited to basic blocks, considerable performance loss may be incurred at block boundaries. To overcome this obstacle, basic blocks are coalesced across branches to form either superblocks or hyperblocks, with the branches labeled with branch probabilities obtained via profiling. Then, the goal of the scheduling heuristic is to minimize the expected completion time of the superblock or the hyperblock. In this paper, we analyze the general problem of scheduling with profIle information and present some experimental results on heuristics that are suggested by our analysis. Specifically, we carry out a theoretical analysis on a simplified abstraction of the problem to obtain insight into its structure, and to develop provably good algorithms. Based on the theoretical analysis of the simplified abstraction, we develop a generic scheme for converting any list scheduling heuristic for basic blocks into a heuristic for the superblockslhyperblocks with associated profIle information. Our techniques are applicable to the general case of scheduling on piplined heterogeneous units with unequal latencies.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the chronology, results, and {{lessons learned from}} the development of the SSFF-MIS. This system has been nearly two years in development and has yielded some valuable insights into specialized MIS development. General: In December of 1994, the Camber Corporation and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) were contracted to design, develop, and implement a MIS for Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Station Furnace Facility Project. The system was to be accessible from both EBM-Compatible PC and Macintosh platforms. The system was required to contain data manually entered into the MIS as well as data imported from other MSFC sources. Electronic interfaces were established for each data source and retrieval was to be performed at prescribed time intervals. The SOW requirement that predominantly drove the development software selection was the dual-platform (IBM-PC and Macintosh) requirement. The requirement that the system would be maintained by Government personnel influenced the selection of Commercial Off-the-shelf software because of its inherent stability and readily available documentation and support. Microsoft FoxPro Professional 2. 6 for Windows and Macintosh was selected as the development tool. This is a software development tool that has been in use for many years. It is stable and powerful. Microsoft has since released the replacement for this product, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, but {{at the time of this}} development, it was only available on the Windows platform. The initial contract included included the requirement for capabilities relating to the Work- and Organizational Breakdown Structures, cost (plan and actuals), workforce (plan and actuals), <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> <b>scheduling,</b> trend analysis, procurements and contracts, interface to manufacturing, Safety and Mission Assurance, risk analysis, and technical performance indicators.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Systems Tableau is {{suggested}} as a convenient {{tool for the}} integration of the three phases of systems theory: the synthesis of a model from the analysis of a system; the evaluation of the model; and the decision-making process for the design and control of the resulting system. From a basic consideration of Man-Nature communications, several mathematical, biological, engineering, and management examples of systems models are examined to develop a unified definition of a system. Logical, physical, mathematical, graphic, and computational requirements are postulated for the methodology of models for systems meeting the definition. These requirements are used to formulate the basic tableau as a hybrid of a mathematical mapping matrix and a graphical flowgraph that expresses the interrelationships among the components of a given system. Thus, a tableau is at once a matrix and a network representation of the system. The general (connecting), ordinal (dominating), and technological (directing) relations in the observation (phase) space are illustrated on tableaux for social, economic, management, and engineering examples. Related mathematics of relations are examined. The relationships of these descriptive models to normative models are discussed as synthesis techniques. Orthogonalization of bases, parametric representations (in frequency space as probabilities and statistical distributions), and reductions in state (solution) space are methods introduced with examples in queueing, communication, and information models. In normative models, we are afforded some degrees of freedom expressed in terms of choice of alternatives. This decision requires at least an ordinal, if not cardinal, characterization of each alternative. The ordinally normative models are based on comparatively quantifiable relations originally afforded by the uni-directional flow of time. Theories of Information, Algorithms, and Games were found useful in drawing valuable conclusions (decisions) from these models. Puzzles, games, Turing machines, and biological examples are discussed. The cardinally normative models require decisions based on numerical values. A truly cardinal model must be cardinal resource-wise, time-wise, and information-wise. This inter-dependency of resources in phase space and information in state space, as functions of time expressible in frequency space, is the basis for the proposal of the Cardinal Utility Hypotheses. This concept allows the development of relations as peculiar Laplace-Z transform-pairs, with the utility of Information (usefulness of data for decision-making) serving as the Channel Capacity for a corresponding communication model. The Principle of Optimality of Dynamic Programming was found most useful in Tableau, andits continuous counterpart of Maximum Principle is expected to take a respective place in the Calculus of Variations in Control Theory. The relationship of the controllability and observability of a system and the diagonalization of its Tableau is also illustrated. The linear models of the traditional Tableaux are reviewed and interpreted in the light of Systems Tableau Method, These include Quesney-Leontief Tableau Economique, Hellerman's Tableau, and <b>Critical</b> <b>Path</b> <b>Scheduling</b> Tableau.
