Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed, while glycemic load {{is a measure of the}} total absorbable glucose in foods. The insulin index is a similar, more recent <b>classification</b> <b>method</b> that ranks foods based on their effects on blood insulin levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.|$|E
500|$|Classification of the Golondrina {{point was}} made by Texas Historical Commission {{archeologist}} LeRoy Johnson Jr. in 1964, after {{the discovery of a}} collection of unrecognized projectile points at the Devil's Mouth site in the Amistad Reservoir, Texas. Initially believed {{to be related to the}} Plainview point classification, the new type was termed [...] "Plainview Golondrina" [...] by Johnson, who used a genus-species approach for the naming. This <b>classification</b> <b>method</b> sought to describe the relationship between the two types, placing Plainview as the genus, and Golondrina as the species, to highlight key similarities and differences. But by 1977, the genus-species classification approach had been discarded, and the name Golondrina alone was being used to represent the Devil's Mouth specimens. Subsequent research and technological analysis determined this type to be separate and distinct from the Plainsview point, and the name was shortened to simply [...] "Golondrina" [...] by Thomas C. Kelly in 1982. The type takes its name from a pronounced flaring of the basal corners (stem), which recall the split tail of a swallow (golondrina in Spanish). The Golondrina is considered to be a Plano point.|$|E

40|$|Per-pixel and sub-pixel are {{two common}} <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> in land cover studies. The {{characteristics}} of a landscape, particularly the land cover itself, can affect the accuracies of both methods. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) compare the performance of sub-pixel vs. per-pixel <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> for a broad heterogeneous region; and (2) analyze the impact of land cover heterogeneity (i. e., the number of land cover classes per pixel) on both <b>classification</b> <b>methods.</b> The results demonstrated that the accuracy of both per-pixel and sub-pixel <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> were generally reduced by increasing land cover heterogeneity. Urban areas, for example, were found to have the lowest accuracy for the per-pixel method, because they had the highest heterogeneity. Conversely, rural areas dominated by cropland and grassland had low heterogeneity and high accuracy. When a sub-pixel method was used, the producer’s accuracy for artificial surfaces was increased by more than 20 %. For all other land cover classes, sub-pixel and per-pixel <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> performed similarly. Thus, the sub-pixel classification was only advantageous for heterogeneous urban landscapes. Both creators and users of land cover datasets {{should be aware of the}} inherent landscape heterogeneity and its potential effect on map accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image {{classification}} is arguably {{one of the}} most important applications in remote sensing. Many supervised and unsupervised <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed. Earlier polarimetric <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> were based on the supervised method of the statistical characteristics of PolSAR images. Then Cloude and Pottier presented an unsupervised method based on the entropy H and α angle distribution [1]. In 1998, Freeman and Durden suggested a three-component decomposition method of polarimetric data [2], which introduced a combination of surface, double-bounce, and volume scatterings. A combined use of physical scattering characteristics and statistical properties for terrain classification is desirable. L.

We present the results of a number of experiments designed to evaluate the effectiveness and behavior of different compression-based text <b>classification</b> <b>methods</b> on English text. Among our experiments are some specifically designed to test whether the ability to capture non-word (including super-word) features causes character-based text compression methods to achieve more accurate classification. ...|$|R
