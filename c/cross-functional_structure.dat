40|$|Based on {{a survey}} study of 155 U. S. firms, we {{conducted}} a firm-level assessment {{of the impact of}} different kinds of structures (i. e., functional versus cross-functional) in different kinds of new product development (NPD) processes (i. e., incremental versus radical) on different kinds of firm innovation performance (i. e., derivative versus breakthrough). We observe that most firms opt for similar structures for their incremental and radical NPD processes. At the same time, though, we find strong evidence that (1) firms that apply a <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structure</b> for the radical NPD process perform significantly better in terms of breakthrough innovation performance than firms that apply a functional structure for the radical NPD process and (2) firms that apply a functional structure for the incremental NPD process perform significantly better in terms of derivative innovation performance than firms that apply a <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structure</b> for the incremental NPD process. These latter findings point to the relevance of adopting structural ambidexterity, where firms make an explicit distinction between incremental and radical NPD processes and organize them in a different way.

40|$|Crisis {{management}} (CM) is a {{facet of}} command and control (C 2) characterized by complexity and uncertainty, in addition to high time pressure. In {{order to meet the}} challenges of this kind of unpredictable crisis situations, teams must be able to adapt and coordinate in an effective way. The functional structure (i. e., each team member is allocated a unique functional role) is the most common in CM, but it is not necessarily the most efficient one. Structures that encourage independence and flexibility, like the <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structure</b> (i. e., team functions are shared across all team members), could promote much better performance in this kind of situations. We compared these two structures, functional and cross-functional, in a dynamic situation of CM. C 3 Fire, a forest firefighting simulation, was used to compare team structure on the basis of performance (process gain), communication, coordination and adaptability. Cross-functional team structures presented a better process gain, a more efficient coordination, and less communication. Surprisingly, no differences were seen regarding adaptability...|$|E

Therefore, twenty two and thirty six funds were investigated in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The ranking factor {{is in the form of}} two variables of high ranking and low ranking as well as four factors under study as four representatives of goodwill including inter-group ranking score of funds, size, the fund's age and bank. Data analysis was conducted through <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structure</b> with fixed effects and ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The results confirm the significant linear relationship among the variables of fund age, bank and inter-group ranking score with investors ' sensitivity towards price. This relationship was just confirmed between investors ' sensitivity towards performance with fund age and bank variables. Also, the relationship between ranking of funds and investors ' sensitivity towards performance and price of funds has been confirmed...|$|E
40|$|In this study, our key {{premise is}} that -contrary to what is often assumed- to invest in {{cross-functional}} integration {{is not always a}} productive approach to increase new product development (NPD) success. We find that the effects of cross-functional integration on NPD success is conditional upon the type of market or technology opportunity a company is pursuing -as we hypothesized: if a company pursues an opportunity that is surrounded by much risk, high levels of cross-functional integration are warranted to increase NPD success, but this is not true for low-risk opportunities. In the current business context however, companies tend to decrease their risk tolerance (they become risk averse) and increase their cross-functional integration during periods of lagging NPD performance. Contrary to our expectations, we do not find evidence that <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structures</b> are particularly helpful in assimilating a high quantity of knowledge. These findings suggest a need to differentiate between {{the quantity and quality of}} the knowledge to be assimilated when assessing whether cross-functional integration enhances a NPD team’s information processing capabilities or not...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the strategic process of new service development (NSD). The authors empirically explore the strategic influence of team-based organizational structure, NSD process design, and information technology (IT) choices on the speed and effectiveness of NSD efforts. Several literature-based relationships are tested with a recursive path model using a multi-industry sample of U. S. service organizations. Most results for the service sector {{are similar to those}} found in manufacturing: (a) NSD <b>cross-functional</b> team <b>structures</b> directly influence the effectiveness of the firm’s NSD efforts, (b) more formalized NSD processes indirectly influence the firm’s ability to develop new services by increasing the speed of NSD, and (c) IT choices directly affect both the speed of the NSD process and the general effectiveness of the firm’s NSD activities...|$|R
40|$|Research into {{development}} time performance {{has suggested that}} integration—both in-ternal, adopting <b>cross-functional</b> organizational <b>structures</b> for development, and exter-nal, involving customers and suppliers in the process—can be a powerful driver {{when it comes to}} compressing cycle times and enhancing development punctuality. Some recent studies have also highlighted the compelling role of product vision to obtain high per-formances with product development. What these studies seem to suggest is that product vision guarantees the right goals and clarity of direction that integration mechanisms need to quickly develop new products and to stay on the development schedule. However, past studies have rarely considered or measured product vision as a construct and ex-plicitly tested whether or not product vision acts as a contingent factor in determining the relationships between the aforementioned organizational drivers and {{development time}}. This research study maintains that product vision is crucial to pushing organizational drivers toward increased development efficiency. To find theoretical support for this position and to define a reference framework for the study, previous literature was ana-lyzed. In the framework, both internal and external development integration are assume...|$|R
40|$|Innovation {{is crucial}} for the {{long-term}} survival and growth of organizations. Many manufacturing companies face intense pressures to innovate and develop new products that meet customer requirements. A central component of success in new product development is {{the maintenance of a}} balance between exploration and exploitation. Exploration can be defined as the pursuit of new knowledge of things that might come to be known, exploitation as the use and development of things already known. Organizations encounter various challenges in balancing and organizing these activities as they entail inherent contradictions that need to be managed. This research provides new insights into the antecedents of exploration and exploitation on the individual, team and organizational level. It demonstrates that organizations pursuing both incremental and radical innovation should structure explorative and exploitative processes differently. Incremental innovation requires a functional structure, whereas radical innovation benefits from a <b>cross-functional</b> <b>structure.</b> Besides structural factors, this research stresses the relevance of cognitive factors in explaining innovation performance. In new product development teams, analytical processing of information has a positive impact on the performance of both explorative and exploitative innovation projects. Intuitive processing, however, only has a positive impact on performance of explorative innovation projects, where creativity and experimenting are important. In exploitative projects, where focus lies on efficiency and standardization, intuitive processing has a negative impact on project performance. Exploration and exploitation thus demand different organizational structures, but also different thinking styles. This research also shows how thinking styles of CEOs and investing in exploration and exploitation are linked. Finally, relationships between cognitive and structural factors and how they affect the evolution of exploration and exploitation within a firm are explored in a longitudinal study...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{conceptual}} model that can be used in future research to empirically evaluate to which extent formal and informal intra-organizational communication mediates the links among key antecedents and internal integration. Design/methodology/approach To build up the conceptual model, literature review has been conducted. We also provide a number of hypothesized relationships that can be empirically examined by using structural equation modeling method. Findings The result of this paper is the conceptual model and ten hypothesized relationships that can be used to empirically test the links between three key antecedents centralized organizational <b>structure,</b> <b>cross-functional</b> teams and facility layout, the mediator formal and informal intra-organizational communication and the outcome internal integration. Research limitations In this research we only develop the conceptual model and the hypotheses. In the future research it is planned to empirically test the model. Furthermore, for the future research we suggest to include incentives and reward system as an additional mediator of antecedents to internal integration. The relationship between internal integration and firm performance should also be tested...|$|R
40|$|While {{many firms}} have become adept at {{developing}} incremental innovations, most cannot achieve radical innovation. The extant literature and practice {{has shown that}} <b>cross-functional</b> team <b>structure</b> {{has been the most}} commonly used for incremental innovation, but this structure has little positive impact on radical innovation. An alternative structure, called “skunk works” might be a more appropriate option in achieving radical innovations but has received little attention. The existing skunk works literature has two limitations. In addressing the above limitations, this dissertation aims to answer the following research question: How do successful radical innovations occur within a skunk works? Specifically, this dissertation advances the field’s understanding of the interplay between radical innovation, skunk works {{and the role of the}} individual innovator. This dissertation will be presented in three separate, but integrated papers. The first paper identifies inconsistencies between the extant radical innovation literature and the skunk works literature, resolving these inconsistencies through the theoretical lens of effectuation. The second paper differentiates radical innovation from incremental innovation and empirically investigates the required mechanisms for each with respect to the people, structure and processes required. Based on 50 qualitative interviews, this paper examines what occurs in a skunk works to enable successful radical innovation and contrasts these mechanisms to successful incremental innovation. Integrating agency theory with dynamic capability theory, the findings of this paper extend the radical innovation structure literature in the skunk works context with a focus on the individual radical innovator. The findings also provide a contingency approach to managers in addressing radical and incremental innovation with a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and their differences. The focus of the third paper, using two experiments, is an examination of how structure and cognitive style of the individual innovator affects collaboration and generation of radical ideas...|$|R
40|$|A recent IBM {{survey found}} {{consensus}} among chief executive officers that organisations are bombarded by change {{and many are}} struggling {{to cope with the}} transformation. The gap between expected change and the ability to manage the required transformation has almost tripled since IBM’s previous study in 2006. CEOs are moving aggressively towards global business designs, deeply changing capabilities, and partnering more extensively. This trend has great significance for the program approach to managing the enterprise value chain. It necessitates the introduction of <b>cross-functional</b> program management <b>structures</b> to create synergy in monitoring and controlling operations. To succeed, CEOs and the full staff complement of the enterprise of the future need to be well versed in the principles of project, program and portfolio management. Importantly, as program offices in the organisational structure grow in numbers, the need for an executive position to which portfolio managers report increases. It would be unthinkable that they all report to the CEO who, according to the IBM survey, is already “bombarded by change” and “struggling to cope”. The emergent role of chief portfolio officer, or CPO, aims to solve this proble...|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} {{organizations}} have assimilated team based, <b>cross-functional</b> and collaborative <b>structures.</b> According to Robinson and Harvey (2008), “The acceleration of globalization {{has created a}} chaotic state of change as businesses struggle to adapt new paradigms of leadership, in which the established tried and tested approaches {{may no longer be}} effective ” (p. 466). However, organizations often fail to recognize the full benefit of these models because employees in operational posts still wait for direction from executives rather than embody leadership characteristics. Alternatively, “there are the people who have figured out that the company intranet is actually a pretty great way to ignore the organizational hierarchy, cut through the red tape, and join with other motivated people to get some real work done ” (Weinberger, 1999). Organizational structures that inspire members toward a common mission can allow the task of leadership to shift fluidly to the individual with the highest degree of efficacy at any given point in time. The following parable, based loosely on a book by Mead (1952), helps to illustrate this point. Jill finished business school during an economic downturn. She could not find a job in her field, so she took a job in the mailroom at Federated Package Delivery. The job offered little status and limited income. However, the company had a good benefits package and a culture that encourage...|$|R
40|$|Aerospace firms {{continue}} to outsource increasingly complex components and systems {{for access to}} talent, lower costs, and global presence. In addition to strong competition from Airbus and other emergent companies, Boeing is {{faced with the challenge}} of reducing financial risk and placing work internationally to offset foreign sales obligations. The organization has recognized a need for an integrated framework to consistently make sourcing decisions that limits subjectivity and positions the company for continued success. This thesis is based on a six-month internship study with the Future Production System team based in Seattle, WA and it examines the strategic sourcing decision process at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. A discussion-based strategic sourcing process utilizing a holistic range of factors is proposed to test whether an expensive, complex, and integrated system like a composite airplane wing should be outsourced or if it should be designed and produced internally. This workshop-based strategy development process develops weighted factors through a <b>structured,</b> <b>cross-functional</b> process where multiple proposals can be evaluated based on their performance against a set of quantitative and qualitative factors such as cost, quality, flow, knowledge management, stability, and risk. The development of a baseline sourcing proposal for a composite airplane wing demonstrated the process. Careful assumptions were made and data collected to ensure a realistic scenario for a future single-aisle plane. The documented baseline wing sourcing strategy includes recommendations for proximity, design integration, and production responsibilities. by David T. Hsu. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|In today's {{manufacturing}} environment, due to {{the complexity}} of products, and the progress of technology, organisations are forced to be more responsive to the pressure of the dynamic market by developing, producing and delivering products quickly and before competitors (Bendoly et al., 2012; Gattiker, 2007). As a result, the integration between marketing and operations as core functions of a manufacturing organisation (Slack et al., 2013) has increasingly received attention from many academics and practitioners (e. g., Hausman et al., 2002; O’Leary-Kelly & Flores, 2002; Prabhaker, 2001; Swink & Song, 2007; Tang, 2010). This is because {{of the importance of the}} marketing and operations interface to achieve more rapid responsiveness to market demand through the fit between market requirements and operations capabilities (Slack et al., 2009). Despite the importance of this work, empirical research on how to achieve and develop this integration is still limited in comparison with conceptual work (Felekoglu et al., 2013; Paiva, 2010; Sharma, 2013; Song et al., 2010). Therefore, this study is an attempt to narrow this gap by investigating why and how to manage the marketing and operations functional relationship effectively in order to become more market oriented. The framework of this research consists of four phases namely; the needs (reasons for integration), the methods (cross-functional teams), the development (potential problems), and the achievement (delivery priority). This framework represents a strategic imperative for developing the delivery performance of an organisation based on the fit between strategy (time-based strategy), organisational <b>structure</b> (<b>cross-functional</b> integration), and environment (the competitive position) (Lenz, 1980; Miller, 1988). Empirically, {{due to the}} need to develop the performance of Iraqi public industry sector, two Iraqi public textile organisations were chosen as case studies to conduct this project by using semi-structured interviews and direct observation to gather data. According to the findings of this research, it can be argued that this study would be an approach to implement market orientation in the Iraqi context albeit one which is difficult to execute...|$|R
