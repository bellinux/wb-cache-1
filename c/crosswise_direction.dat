40|$|Torque {{generation}} and flow distribution of a lift-based vertical-axis turbine with an upstream deflecting plate are investigated in water tunnel experiments. The deployment of a deflector {{in front of}} a lift-based turbine is a promising approach to increase local flow velocity and enhance energy conversion efficiency without consideration for complicated control. For the turbine with the deflector, the phase during which the blade passes near {{the front end of the}} turbine has a major contribution to torque increase from the case without the deflector. Meanwhile, the deflector can have a negative effect in torque generation at the phase when the blade moves upstream against free stream if the turbine is placed close to the deflector in a <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction.</b> The change of nearby flow distribution by the deflector is also examined to find its correlation with torque generation. When the blade rotates through the near-wake region of the deflector, the blade can collides with the vortical structure shed from the deflector.

40|$|Two {{types of}} polylactic acid (PLA) films (one {{amorphous}} and one semi-crystalline) were produced by sheet extrusion. Talc {{was used as}} a nucleation agent for the semi-crystalline PLA. The films were annealed above their T-g or were uniaxially orientated in two ways: (1) via a drawing system in front of the extruder and die or (2) via a three-roller stretching system. The slower crystallization rate and lower melting stress of the PLA resulted in amorphous film using the drawing system. Annealing above T-g increased crystallinity and polymer chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both strength and toughness. Stretching above T-g also produced simultaneous crystallization and chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both modulus and toughness. Both modulus and tensile strength in the stretching direction were higher than in the <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction.</b> Talc acted not only as a rigid filler to reinforce the PLA, but also as a nucleation agent for the PLA, especially during annealing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A study {{correlating}} {{the physical}} and sensory texture measurements of hearts of palm in conserve was carried out {{with a view to}} establishing an instrumental texture standard for this product. One hundred hearts of palm sticks in conserve from different brands, 50 of Açaí and 50 of Pupunha, were cut in half cross wise. One of the halves was used for the sensory evaluation and the other for the instrumental evaluation. Fifty consumers were instructed to bite each half-stick received in the <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction</b> and evaluate the hardness on a linear 10 cm scale and the acceptability of the hardness on a nine-point hedonic scale. The instrumental hardness was analyzed using the TA-XT 2 texturometer. The Pearson correlation between the force required to cut the hearts of palm sticks and the acceptability of the hardness was negative and significant at p < 0. 05, that is, the greater the force required to cut the stick, the less the consumer liked it. Considering that the maximum acceptable sensory hardness is 5. 0 on the 10 cm scale, the maximum acceptable values for the physical measurements are: maximum force/area: 20. 4 N/cm 2 and mean force/area: 5. 6 N/cm 2...|$|E

40|$|Discolouration in {{the wood}} of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) was studied in a 60 -year-old birch stand in eastern Finland. Altogether 45 trees were {{analysed}} two and five years after sapping. The boring hole made for sapping caused a strongly flattened, conical- shaped discolouration column down-und upwards from the hole. The discolouration spread only very slightly in the radial or the <b>crosswise</b> <b>directions,</b> but increased rapidly in the longitudinal direction. In many trees the discolouration caused by the sapping hole joined with discolouration originating from branches and butt. After five years, the estimated volume of the discolored area was almost four times bigger in these trees. 486 microbial pure cultures were isolated (191 bacteria, 224 fungi, 77 yeasts or yeast-like fungi). The samples {{from the base of}} the tree contained a larger proportion of fungal isolates than samples from the highest point of discoloura-tion. The number of pure cultures containing bacteria and yeasts was less after five years than after two years since sapping. Even the samples from sound-looking wood con-tained microbes, mostly bacteria. Most of the identified fungi belonged to Phialophora sp. (especially Phialop-hora fastigiata). Penicillium sp. and Cladospora sp. were also common.

The effectiveness of the transformation consists in effective twisting of each fold, so its effort is minimized.

40|$|Falling liquid {{films are}} thin liquid layers flowing down rigid {{vertical}} or inclined walls driven by gravity. In industry falling films {{are used in}} various applications such as refrigeration, cooling of mechanical or electronic systems, chemical processing, desalination and food processing. They generally exhibit higher heat and mass transfer rates compared to flows which are strictly aligned to the rigid wall. This increase in heat and mass transfer {{is caused by the}} wavy topology, which is attended by different types of vortices in the liquid and the gaseous phase. The characteristic vortices in the liquid phase are a circulating eddy in the main wave hump (also called circulating wave) and a vortex in the first capillary minimum associated with the phenomenon of flow reversal. The existence and the physical mechanism involved in those vortices are well-known. However, the flow conditions under which they occur have still been unclear. In addition to films flowing down the upper side of an inclined wall, films flowing down the underside of an inclined plate have been considered. In the latter case, the gravitational force acts destabilizing and, owing to the negative value of the inclination number, this condition is called "negative gravity". Besides the two vortices which can occur in both configurations, a further phenomenon that occurs only in hanging film flows is dripping. In the present doctoral thesis, two model approaches have been utilized, namely the weighted integral boundary layer (WIBL) model and direct numerical simulations (DNS) in order to identify the conditions for the onset of circulating waves, flow reversal, and gravitational dripping. For investigating electrostatically induced spraying of a dielectric fluid, the WIBL model and the numerical code of the DNS have been extended by the electrostatic surface force. From the modeling point of view, the developed equations of the WIBL model revealed that the electrostatic force is similar to the gravitational body force with an additional non-linear contribution. From the knowledge obtained by the simulations, analytical criteria for the onset of circulating waves and flow reversal based on the wave celerity, the average film thickness and the maximum and minimum film thickness have been approximated using self-similar parabolic velocity profiles. This approximation has been validated by second-order WIBL and direct numerical simulations. It is shown that the onset of circulating waves in the phase diagram for homoclinic solutions (waves of infinite wavelength) is strongly dependent on the inclination, but independent of the streamwise viscous dissipation effect. On the contrary, the onset of flow reversal shows a clear dependence on the viscous dissipation. Furthermore, simulation results for limit cycles (finite wavelength) reveal a strong increase of the corresponding critical Reynolds number with the excitation frequency. The phenomenon of gravitational dripping is associated with a pressure gradient in <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction.</b> A criterion for the onset of dripping is derived based on a force balance between gravitational forces of the liquid in the main wave hump and surface tension. This force balance is found to be violated in the simulation results of the WIBL model. The model does not account for a crosswise force balance, owing to the integration of the streamwise boundary layer momentum equation across the depth of the film. As a consequence, the model is found to be not well-suited for the prediction of dripping. However, DNS and WIBL results agree well before dripping occurs. The influence of the electrostatic surface force is found to be well-captured by the WIBL model in a specific range of parameters. Due to a quasi-constant pressure in <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction</b> of the film, the physical mechanisms of electrostatically induced spraying differ from the mechanisms involved in dripping. An explanation for the occurrence of spraying is the non-linear growth of the force with an increase in film thickness. Above a critical value of the electric potential, the increase in the destabilizing electrostatic pressure exceeds the increase of the stabilizing surface tension force. Consequently, small perturbations grow infinitely up to spraying, which finally ruptures the film surface...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{the predictive}} capabilities of statistical URANS and hybrid RANS-LES methods to model complex flows at high Reynolds numbers and {{carrying out a}} physical analysis of the near-region turbulence and coherent structures. This study handles configurations included in the European research programmes ATAAC (Advanced Turbulent Simulation for Aerodynamics Application Challenges) and TFAST (Transition Location Effect on Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction). First, the detached flow in a configuration of a tandem of cylinders, positionned behind one another, is investigated at Reynolds number 166000. A static case, corresponding to {{the layout of the}} support of a landing gear, is initially considered. The fluid-structure interaction is then studied in a dynamic case where the downstream cylinder, situated {{in the wake of the}} upstream one, is given one degree of freedom in translation in the <b>crosswise</b> <b>direction.</b> A parametric study of the structural parameters is carried out to identify the various regimes of interaction. Secondly, the physics of the transonic buffet is studied by means of time-frequency analysis and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), in the Mach number range 0. 70 – 0. 75. The interactions between the main shock wave, the alternately detached boundary layer and the vortices developing in the wake are analysed. A stochastic forcing, based on reinjection of synthetic turbulence in the transport equations of kinetic energy and dissipation rate by using POD reconstruction, has been introduced in the so-called organised-eddy simulation (OES) approach. This method introduces an upscale turbulence modelling, acting as an eddy-blocking mechanism able to capture thin shear-layer and turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces around the body. This method highly improves the aerodynamic forces prediction and opens new ensemble-averaged approaches able to model the coherent and random processes at high Reynolds number. Finally, the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) is investigated in the case of an oblique shock wave at Mach number 1. 7 in order to contribute to the so-called "laminar wing design" studies at European level. The performance of statistical URANS and hybrid RANS-LES models is analysed with comparison, with experimental results, of integral boundary-layer values (displacement and momentum thicknesses) and wall quantities (friction coefficient). The influence of a transitional boundary layer on the SWBLI is featured...|$|E

These units are transcribed with various efficiencies, depending upon the individual promoter strengths, which differ in pBR 322 up to 10 -fold.
