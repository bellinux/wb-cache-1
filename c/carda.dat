2500|$|In {{elementary}} set theory, Cantor's theorem is {{a fundamental}} result that states that, for any set A, the set of all subsets of A (the power set of A, ùí´(A)) has a strictly greater cardinality than A itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem {{can be seen to}} be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets. Counting the empty subset, a set with n members has 2n subsets, so that if <b>card(A)</b> = n, then card(ùí´(A)) = 2n, and the theorem holds because 2n > n is true for all non-negative integers.|$|E

40|$|Histone H 1 and high-mobility group A (HMGA) {{proteins}} compete dynamically {{to modulate}} chromatin structure and regulate DNA transactions in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, HMGA-like domains are known only in Myxococcus xanthus CarD and its Stigmatella aurantiaca ortholog. These have an N-terminal module absent in HMGA that interacts with CarG (a zinc-associated factor {{that does not}} bind DNA) to form a stable complex essential in regulating multicellular development, light-induced carotenogenesis, and other cellular processes. An analogous pair, <b>CarDAd</b> and CarGAd, exists in another myxobacterium, Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans. Intriguingly, the <b>CarDAd</b> C terminus lacks the hallmark HMGA DNA-binding AT-hooks and instead resembles the C-terminal region (CTR) of histone H 1. We find that <b>CarDAd</b> alone could not replace CarD in M. xanthus. By contrast, when introduced with CarGAd, <b>CarDAd</b> functionally replaced CarD in regulating not just 1 but 3 distinct processes in M. xanthus, despite the lower DNA-binding affinity of <b>CarDAd</b> versus CarD in vitro. The ability of the cognate CarDAd‚ÄìCarGAd pair to interact, but not the noncognate CarDAd‚ÄìCarG, rationalizes these data. Thus, in chimeras that conserve CarD‚ÄìCarG interactions, the H 1 -like CTR of <b>CarDAd</b> could replace the CarD HMGA AT-hooks with no loss of function in vivo. More tellingly, even chimeras with the CarD AT-hook region substituted by human histone H 1 CTR or full-length H 1 functioned in M. xanthus. Our domain-swap analyses showing functional equivalence of HMGA AT-hooks and H 1 CTR in prokaryotic transcriptional regulation provide molecular insights into possible modes of action underlying their biological roles...|$|R

Radu Rosetti, Iorga's rival at Via»õa Rom√ÆneascƒÉ, also acknowledged Moruzi as a [...] "writer of talent", his technique [...] "clear and beautiful". According to Eugen Lovinescu, Moruzi and Rosetti alike were in a line of great Moldavian raconteurs, alongside Gheorghe Sion. Critic Mariana Conta-Kernbach praises Moruzi's [...] "flowing and somber style", listing him as one of the neo-classicists in succession to his father's revolutionary-and-optimistic generation. George CƒÉlinescu only wrote a brief note about him, setting down an incorrect birth year; Petre V. Hane»ô, in his 1942 study of Bessarabian writers, devotes much more ample space to analyzing the works of Moruzi. Other commentators note that his novels in particular have a certain Russian influence, probably from the author's reading of Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy.
