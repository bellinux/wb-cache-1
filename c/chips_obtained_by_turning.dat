This paper presents a new approach aimed at extending the method proposed for profile monitoring to surface monitoring. In this case, a geometric specification (such as cylindricity, flatness, etc.) is assumed to characterize the machined surface. The proposed method is based on combining a Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SARX) model (i. e. a regression model with spatial autoregressive errors) to multivariate and univariate control charting.

40|$|Quality of {{mechanical}} components is critically related to both dimensional and geometric specifications. Traditionally, approaches for {{statistical process control}} (SPC) focused on the first type of specification only. When {{the quality of a}} manufactured product is related to geometric specifications (e. g., profile and form tolerances as straightness, roundness, cylindricity, flatness, etc.), the process should be considered in control if the relationship used to represent that profile or surface in the space is stable over time.

The proposed method is based on combining a spatial autoregressive regression (SARX) model (i. e., a regression model with spatial autoregressive errors) with control charting.
