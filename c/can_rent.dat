For example, while white-collar crime rarely results in incarceration, when it does offenders are almost always sent to minimum-security prisons due to them having committed nonviolent crimes. Lower-security prisons are often designed with less restrictive features, confining prisoners at night in smaller locked dormitories or even cottage or cabin-like housing while permitting them free movement around the grounds to work or activities during the day. Some countries (such as Britain) also have [...] "open" [...] prisons where prisoners are allowed home-leave or part-time employment outside of the prison. Suomenlinna Island facility in Finland {{is an example of}} one such [...] "open" [...] correctional facility.

2500|$|From 1964 to 1972, {{developer}} Louis Lesser built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls {{to house}} 3,600 students. The [...] campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State LA {{the largest in}} the California State University system. Maxwell Starkman & Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. The first on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students <b>can</b> <b>rent</b> a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During 1984 Summer Olympics that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Lesser also pioneered “underground parking”, with his Cal State LA development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper section header, [...] "Parking Underground", which described a two-level underground parking lot as a [...] "concept" [...] of [...] "subterranean spaces". A newly debuted Halisi Scholars Black Living-Learning Community, an effort to “enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues of concern to the black community living on campus by offering the opportunity to connect with faculty and peers, and engage in programs that focus on academic success, cultural awareness, and civic engagement.” ...|$|E
