5|$|The Croatian action {{prompted}} {{an intervention}} {{from the federal}} Yugoslav government. Borisav Jović, the Serbian representative on the <b>collective</b> <b>Presidency</b> of Yugoslavia, supported a request by Yugoslav Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević to send the JNA to the scene. The first ten JNA tanks arrived in Pakrac {{late in the evening}} of 1 March and took positions {{in various parts of the}} town; most of them were stationed near the town hospital. The next afternoon, an additional JNA unit led by Colonel Milan Čeleketić arrived in Pakrac, taking positions close to the Croatian special police. Čeleketić was acting on the orders of Major General Jevrem Cokić, commander of the 32nd (Varaždin) Corps. Cokić authorised deployment of three companies of the armoured battalion of the 265th Mechanised Brigade based in Bjelovar.|$|E
5|$|The Socialist Republic of Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia {{was led by}} a {{group of}} {{communist}} party officials, who formed a <b>collective</b> <b>Presidency</b> {{with the president of the}} Presidency at its head. The first democratic elections of 1990 did not elect members of the Presidency directly. Rather, the parliament was tasked with filling these positions as it had done in the socialist period. The HDZ won the elections and its leader Tuđman assumed the presidency on 30 May 1990. On 25 July of the same year, the parliament passed several constitutional amendments, including amendment LXXI, which created the position of President and Vice-Presidents. The Christmas Constitution, passed on 22 December 1990, established the government as a semi-presidential system and called for presidential elections.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{political}} {{leader of the}} state was Josip Broz Tito, but there were several other important politicians, particularly after Tito's death: see the list of leaders of communist Yugoslavia. In 1974, Tito was proclaimed President-for-life of Yugoslavia. After Tito's death in 1980, the single position of president was divided into a <b>collective</b> <b>Presidency,</b> where representatives of each republic would essentially form a committee where the concerns of each republic would be addressed and from it, collective federal policy goals and objectives would be implemented. The head of the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> was rotated between representatives of the different republics. The head of the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> was considered {{the head of state}} of Yugoslavia. The <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> was ended in 1991, as Yugoslavia fell apart.|$|E

50|$|A {{member of}} the Presidency of Yugoslavia for the Socialist Republic of Croatia existed within the <b>collective</b> state <b>presidency</b> from the {{enactment}} of the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia to the breakup of the state in 1991. From 1971 to 1974 the socialist republic was represented by three members per amendments to the 1963 Constitution of Yugoslavia. The member was selected by Parliament.|$|R

25|$|Multiparty {{elections}} {{were held in}} Montenegro {{for the first time}} after the anti-bureaucratic revolution.

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the BiH Constitution (Article 5.5a), BiH Law of defense and BiH Law of service the supreme civilian commander of the Armed Forces Bosnia and Herzegovina is the <b>collective</b> <b>Presidency</b> of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The <b>collective</b> <b>Presidency</b> directs the Ministry of defense BiH and the Armed Forces. Former Bosnia and Herzegovina ministers of defense include H.E. Nikola Radovanović, H.E. Selmo Cikotić and H.E. Muhamed Ibrahimović. The current Minister of defense BiH is H.E. Marina Pendeš. Former Chiefs of Joint Staff AF BiH include LGEN Sifet Podžić and Lieutenant General Miladin Milojčić. The current BiH Chief of Joint Staff is Lieutenant General Anto Jeleč. Conscription was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.|$|E
50|$|Although the President is {{the chief}} of {{military}} and head of state, the Prime Minister {{is the head of}} government who exercises most executive powers. The President and both deputies (<b>collective</b> the <b>Presidency</b> Council of Iraq) are elected by the Assembly with a two-thirds majority. They then propose the Prime Minister from the largest party, who must also be approved with a two-thirds majority; the Prime Minister then proposes the Council of Ministers, who must be approved with a two-thirds majority.|$|R
50|$|He {{belonged to}} the 118 persons {{consisting}} of Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation, which was in May 1944 by the Congress of Përmet selected as the interim parliament and helped the Communists to take power. After {{the founding of the}} People's Republic of Albania on 11 January 1946 he was deputy of the People's Assembly (Kuvendi Popullor) and {{this was one of the}} first term until 4 February 1955 on. At times he was also a member of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, and thus the <b>collective</b> state <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1974 a new Constitution {{was adopted}} which reaffirmed the <b>collective</b> federal <b>presidency</b> {{consisting}} of {{representatives of the}} six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists. The 1974 constitution affirmed Josip Broz Tito with an unlimited mandate which ensured the new office of President of the Presidency would not come into effect until after his death. The first President of the Presidency {{was to be the}} then standing Vice President of the Presidency. When Broz died on 4 May 1980, the then Vice President of the Presidency Lazar Koliševski acceded to the role of President of the Presidency. Subsequent to this the role of President of the Presidency would rotate on an annual basis with each President serving as Vice President the year prior.|$|R
25|$|In 1974, the new Constitution {{provided}} for a collective federal presidency, consisting of {{representatives of the}} six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists, with a Chairman in rotation. Notwithstanding, this constitutional provision was suspended because Tito was declared President for Life, thus chaired the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> on a permanent basis. After his death in 1980, one member was annually elected President of the Presidency and acted as head of state.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ouster}} of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, {{especially}} from Slovenia and Croatia, succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality. As {{a result of these}} reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia. By the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have its own administration, assembly, and judiciary; as well as having a membership in the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> and the Yugoslav parliament, in which it held veto power.|$|E
500|$|While the European Council has {{no formal}} {{legislative}} power, it is a strategic (and crisis-solving) body {{that provides the}} union with general political directions and priorities, and acts as a <b>collective</b> <b>presidency.</b> [...] The European Commission remains the sole initiator of legislation, but the European Council is able to provide an impetus to guide legislative policy.|$|E
500|$|On the Bosnian Serb side, {{opinions}} of the report were initially favourable. The Bosnian Serb media largely supported the report, and Republika Srpska president Mirko Šarović (who in October 2002 became the Serb member of the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency)</b> said that the report [...] "should not be dismissed out of hand but merits careful study". A number of Bosnian Serb political figures made public statements denying that war crimes had happened and a government spokesman called the report a bid to promote [...] "truth and reconciliation". The Republika Srpska Socialist Party leader, Lazar Ristić, welcomed the report and accused the Bosniak side of having [...] "hitherto presented only false reports, in which names were listed of persons who are still alive today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, the YPA's {{leadership}} sought {{permission to}} change the tempo of its operations. Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević informed the Yugoslav cabinet that the YPA's first plan - a limited operation to secure Slovenia's border crossings - had failed, {{and that it was}} time to put into operation the backup plan of a full-scale invasion and imposition of military rule in Slovenia. However, the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> — headed at the time by Serbia's Borisav Jović — refused to authorise such an operation. The YPA Chief of Staff, General Blagoje Adzić, was furious and publicly denounced [...] "the federal organs [...] continually hampered us, demanding negotiations while they [...] were attacking us with all means." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{power had}} seeped {{away from the}} federal {{government}} to the republics and were deadlocked over the future of Yugoslavia with the Slovene and Croatian republics seeking a confederacy and Serbia a stronger federation. Gow states, [...] "it was the behavior of Serbia that added to the Croatian and Slovene Republic's belief that no accommodation was possible with the Serbian Republic's leadership". The last straw was on 15 May 1991 when the outgoing Serb president of the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> along with the Serb satellites on the presidency blocked the succession of the Croatian representative Stjepan Mesić as president. According to Gow, from this point on Yugoslavia de facto [...] "ceased to function".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} to power of Milošević the Memorandum's {{discourse}} became mainstream in Serbia. According to Bennett, Milošević used a rigid control of the media to organize a propaganda campaign in which the Serbs were the victims and stressed the need to readjust Yugoslavia due to the alleged bias against Serbia. This was then followed by Milošević's anti-bureaucratic revolution in which the provincial governments of Vojvodina and Kosovo and the Republican government of Montenegro, were overthrown giving Milošević the dominating position of four votes out of eight in Yugoslavia's <b>collective</b> <b>presidency.</b> Milošević had achieved such a dominant position for Serbia because, according to Bennett, the old communist authorities had failed {{to stand up to}} him. During August 1988, supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were reported to have shouted Greater Serbia themed chants of [...] "Montenegro is Serbia!".|$|E

50|$|In 1989 Stane Dolanc, the Slovenian {{representative}} to the <b>collective</b> <b>presidency</b> of Yugoslavia, retired. The Slovenian Communist Party, aware of upcoming democratisation, decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position. Drnovšek, until then rather unknown to the public, defeated Marko Bulc, the Party's preferred candidate. The Communist leaderships of other Yugoslav republics {{did not agree with}} this new way of selecting the {{representative to}} the <b>Collective</b> <b>Presidency,</b> so the Slovenian Republic Parliament had to confirm the result of the elections. Drnovšek served as chairman of the <b>Collective</b> <b>Presidency</b> from 1989 until 1990. While he was chairman of the presidency, he was also chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement and the commander of the Yugoslav People's Army. Until the end of communist rule he was {{an active member of the}} Communist Party. After the democratic changes in Slovenia, the country seceded from Yugoslavia.
