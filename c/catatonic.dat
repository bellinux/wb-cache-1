25|$|In May 2005, Dr. M. Lopez-Gomez's team {{reported}} {{an association between}} the use of primidone and depression in epilepsy patients; this same study reported that inadequate seizure control, posttraumatic epilepsy, and polytherapy were also risk factors.

Out of all of the risk factors, usage of primidone and inadequate seizure control were the greatest; with ORs of 4.089 and 3.084, respectively. They had been looking for factors associated with depression in epilepsy patients. Schaffer et al. 1999 reported that one of their treatment failures, a 45-year-old woman taking 50mg a day along with lithium 600mg/day, clozapine 12.5mg/day, trazodone 50mg/day, and alprazolam 4mg/day {{for three and a half}} months experienced auditory hallucinations that led to discontinuation of primidone.

There is one case of an individual developing <b>catatonic</b> schizophrenia when her serum concentration of primidone went above normal.|$|E
