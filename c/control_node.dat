The GDI campaign has two endings, depending on whether the GDI Commander uses a GDI-built liquid Tiberium bomb in the final mission. If the bomb is used, the Scrin are defeated at the cost of massive collateral damage. The commander becomes a hero and Granger resigns from the GDI military in disgust. However, if the bomb is not used, Boyle resigns to avoid being tried as a war criminal. The Scrin, meanwhile, plan to invade Earth with a larger force.|$|E

For this problem (i) we propose a metric to quantify {{the difficulty of the}} control problem {{as a function of the}} required control energy, (ii) we derive bounds based on the system dynamics (network topology and weights) to characterize the tradeoff between the control energy and the number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes,</b> and (iii) we propose an open-loop control strategy with performance guarantees. In our strategy we select <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> by relying on network partitioning, and we design the control input by leveraging optimal and distributed control techniques. Our findings show several control limitations and properties. For instance, for Schur stable and symmetric networks: (i) if the number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of network nodes, (ii) if the number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the network dimension, and (iii) clustered networks may be easier to control because, for sufficiently many <b>control</b> <b>nodes,</b> the <b>control</b> energy depends only on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social networks, and epidemics spreading. I...|$|R

40|$|Network {{controllability}} is {{a structural}} property, that is, mild and well-understood {{conditions on the}} network interconnection pattern ensure controllability from a given set of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> for most choices of the edge weights. To ensure network controllability for all choices of edge weights, namely strong structural controllability, more stringent connectivity conditions need to be satisfied. In this paper we derive an alternative algebraic characterization of strong structural controllability of networks with self-loops. This characterization allows us to systematically enumerate all strongly structurally controllable networks with given cardinality and number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes.</b> Differently from the case of (weak) structural controllability we show that, when the ratio of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> to {{the total number of}} nodes converges to zero, then the fraction of strongly structurally controllable networks decreases to zero. Conversely, when the ratio of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> to the total number of nodes converges to one, then the fraction of strongly structurally controllable networks remains lower bounded.

50|$|An {{approach}} {{that has been}} tried since the late 1990s is {{the implementation of the}} multiple three-treatment closed-loop analysis. This has not been popular because the process rapidly becomes overwhelming as network complexity increases. Development in this area was then abandoned in favor of the Bayesian and multivariate frequentist methods which emerged as alternatives. Very recently, automation of the three-treatment closed loop method has been developed for complex networks by some researchers as a way to make this methodology available to the mainstream research community. This proposal does restrict each trial to two interventions, but also introduces a workaround for multiple arm trials: a different fixed <b>control</b> <b>node</b> can be selected in different runs. It also utilizes robust meta-analysis methods so that many of the problems highlighted above are avoided. Further research around this framework is required to determine if this is indeed superior to the Bayesian or multivariate frequentist frameworks.

40|$|Boolean {{models of}} {{regulatory}} networks {{are assumed to}} be tolerant to perturbations. That qualitatively implies that each function can only depend on a few nodes. Biologically motivated constraints further show that functions found in Boolean regulatory networks belong to certain classes of functions, for example, the unate functions. It turns out that these classes have specific properties in the Fourier domain. That motivates us to study the problem of detecting <b>controlling</b> <b>nodes</b> in classes of Boolean networks using spectral techniques. We consider networks with unbalanced functions and functions of an average sensitivity less than 23 k, where k is the number of controlling variables for a function. Further, we consider the class of 1 -low networks which include unate networks, linear threshold networks, and networks with nested canalyzing functions. We show that the application of spectral learning algorithms leads to both better time and sample complexity for the detection of <b>controlling</b> <b>nodes</b> compared with algorithms based on exhaustive search. For a particular algorithm, we state analytical upper bounds on the number of samples needed to find the <b>controlling</b> <b>nodes</b> of the Boolean functions.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{controlling}} stable and symmetric complex networks, that is, the joint problem of selecting a set of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> and of designing a control input to drive a network to a target state. We adopt the smallest eigenvalue of the controllability Gramian as metric for the controllability degree of a network, as it identifies the energy needed to accomplish the control task. In {{the first part of}} the paper we characterize tradeoffs between the control energy and the number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes,</b> based on the network topology and weights. Our bounds show for instance that, if the number of <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of network nodes. Consequently, despite the classic controllability notion, few nodes cannot in practice arbitrarily symmetric control complex networks. In the second part of the paper we propose a distributed open-loop strategy with performance guarantees for the control of complex networks. In our strategy we select <b>control</b> <b>nodes</b> based on network partitioning, and we design the control input based on optimal and distributed control techniques. For our control strategy we show that the control energy depends on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength, and it is independent of the network dimension.

The impact of fed states on survival in traumatically injured humans is unknown. This work uses regulatory networks {{to examine the}} effect of carbohydrate pre-feeding on metabolic response to polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock in a clinically-relevant large animal model. Methods: Male Yorkshire pigs were fasted overnight (n[*]=[*] 64). Pre-fed animals (n[*]=[*] 32) received an oral bolus of Karo before sedation. All animals underwent a standardized trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation protocol. Serum samples were obtained at set timepoints. Proton NMR was used to identify and quantify serum metabolites. Metabolic regulatory networks were constructed from metabolite concentrations and rates of change in those concentrations to identify <b>controlled</b> <b>nodes</b> and <b>controlling</b> <b>nodes</b> of the network. Results: Oral carbohydrate pre-treatment was not associated with survival benefit. Six metabolites were identified as <b>controlled</b> <b>nodes</b> in both groups: adenosine, cytidine, glycerol, hypoxanthine, lactate, and uridine. Distinct groups of <b>controlling</b> <b>nodes</b> were associated with controlled nodes; however, the composition of these groups depended on feeding status. Conclusions: A common metabolic output, typically associated with injury and hypoxia, results from trauma and hemorrhagic shock. However, this output is directed by different metabolic inputs depending upon the feeding status of the subject. Nodes of the network that are related to mortality can potentially be manipulated for therapeutic effect; however, these nodes differ depending upon feeding status...|$|R
