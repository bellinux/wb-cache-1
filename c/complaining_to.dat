5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> senior Police Department figures, {{embarrassing}} them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E

The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.|$|E

Nonetheless, James fathered many illegitimate children. Years after Anne had herself converted, James avowed his Catholicism, {{which was a}} contributing factor to the Glorious Revolution. This was through Anne's influence; she {{had been exposed to}} Catholicism during visits to the Netherlands and France and was strongly attracted thereto. She suffered from advanced breast cancer and died shortly after giving birth to her last child.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{released}} from his WWE contract on May 29, 2009, just four days after his return. In a March 2010 interview with wrestlezone.com, Ken Anderson explained his release was due to fellow wrestler Randy Orton <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> WWE management that Anderson was reckless in the ring, citing a botched backdrop that caused Orton to land {{on his head and}} neck instead of on his back. Orton argued that this could potentially end his career. According to Anderson, Randy Orton also persuaded his friend and fellow wrestler John Cena to complain to Vince McMahon about Anderson's in ring performance, which prompted McMahon to release Kennedy from his contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{this stretch of}} SR52 had many effects on the {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on {{the western part of}} Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR52.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2006, Helms {{suffered}} a broken nose. After <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> Long {{about having to}} wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told Helms {{that he did not}} have to defend his title, but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|Steege {{undertook}} a fighter sector course in January 1943, {{and was given}} command of No.8 Fighter Sector Headquarters in Brisbane. As a result, he later contended, of his petitioning Eastern Area Command for reassignment to combat duties and <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> Group Officer Clare Stevenson that {{there were too many}} WAAAFs in the sector for an unmarried man to supervise, he was posted to command No.14 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters at Camden, New South Wales, on 23May. The following month, the unit deployed to Goodenough Island in New Guinea as part of No.71 (Fighter) Wing, becoming operational on 27June. In August it moved to Kiriwina, under the aegis of No.73 (Fighter) Wing. Steege relinquished command on 1October to take charge of No.73 Wing. The wing's combat units consisted of two P-40 Kittyhawk squadrons and a Supermarine Spitfire squadron. As part of the build-up to the Battle of Arawe in December, the Kittyhawks launched a series of assaults on Gasmata; three days before the Allied landings, Steege personally led a force of thirty-four aircraft in a bombing and strafing attack on the town's landing strip. In January 1944, the wing took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen, New Britain. Steege was promoted acting group captain the following month; the rank was made temporary in July.|$|E

25|$|The new National Park Service agency used {{predator}} control {{agents from}} the bureau to trap wolves, coyotes, and mountain lions within park boundaries. The agency's first director, Stephen Mather saw his primary {{responsibility to the}} new national-park idea as one of building a constituency to support the parks, and feared that if predator populations were not controlled inside park boundaries, they would wander to adjoining private lands to kill livestock. Mather did not want angry ranchers <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> their congressional representatives that the national parks were bad for the ranching business.|$|E

Despite attempts at negotiation, the men were eventually informed that they would be sent to the Immigration Building jail in Vancouver for their refusal to work. Their mistreatment caused several of the men to begin hoping that Japan would win the war and force Canada to compensate them.|$|E

The family reported them missing so the police would reveal their address; Craig applied to be re-housed in Lincolnshire to escape the family's influence, but that application was rejected.

Upon release, he confronted Ratliffe, sporting a seven-shot revolver. During the altercation, the gun was discharged (whether intentionally or accidentally is again a matter where accounts vary), and two bystanders were wounded. Records do not indicate that Stephens ever spent further time in jail regarding this matter, but the dismissive nickname by which his enemies would refer to him {{the rest of his life}} was established.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Grand Duke Andrei joined {{the staff at the}} headquarters of the Northwestern front fighting against Germany. It was a relatively safe position away from combat. On 7 May 1915, he became Commander of the Horse Guard Artillery brigade. This meant little, as the batteries were scattered in many places and were not a united command. He was made Major-General on 15 August 1915 and served as chief of the 130th Infantry Regiment of Kherson. His military duties were ill-defined {{and he was able to}} spend much idle time in Saint Petersburg retaking his social life with Kschessinska.
