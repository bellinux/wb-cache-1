25|$|Copepods are {{sometimes}} found in public main water supplies, especially systems {{where the water}} is not filtered, such as New York City, Boston, and San Francisco. This is not usually a problem in treated water supplies. In some tropical countries, such as Peru and Bangladesh, a correlation has been found between copepods' presence and cholera in untreated water, because the cholera bacteria attach to the surfaces of planktonic animals. The larvae of the guinea worm must develop within a copepod's digestive tract before being transmitted to humans. The risk of infection with these diseases can be reduced by filtering out the copepods (and other matter), for example with a <b>cloth</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

The impact of the intervention in reducing dracunculiasis prevalence was examined by comparing the period prevalence of infection in 1990 and 1991. The findings demonstrate that the intervention had a measurable but limited impact on dracunculiasis prevalence.

50|$|Grain to be {{processed}} into flour is first ground, typically {{in one or more}} steps, then the bran is separated from the flour produced by grinding the grain. The flour produced from the grain is further separated by size through sifting (or bolting). A centrifugal reel or flour dresser is used to perform this separation, producing the finished flour and a number of byproducts, such as bran and dust. A centrifugal reel is a cylinder which a <b>cloth</b> <b>filter</b> is stretched. Inside of the cloth-covered cylinder are beaters which stir and toss the ground grain against the cloth. A brush moving across the outside of the cylinder removes the flour and keeps the cloth functioning. A flour dresser is constructed similarly to the centrifugal reel, but lacks the beaters. A typical mill process involves passing the flour coming off the millstones through successive dressers so as to achieve optimum separation of flour from bran and germ components of the grain.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were lots}} of {{innovations}} from France in the late 18th century. With help from Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, the Archbishop of Paris, the idea that coffee should not be boiled gained acceptance. The first modern method for making coffee using a coffee filter—drip brewing—is more than 125 years old, and its design had changed little. The biggin, originating in France ca. 1780, was a two-level pot holding coffee in a cloth sock in an upper compartment into which water was poured, to drain through holes {{in the bottom of}} the compartment into the coffee pot below. Coffee was then dispensed from a spout on the side of the pot. The quality of the brewed coffee depended on the size of the grounds - too coarse and the coffee was weak; too fine and the water would not drip the filter. A major problem with this approach was that the taste of the <b>cloth</b> <b>filter</b> - whether cotton, burlap or an old sock - transferred to the taste of the coffee. Around the same time, a French inventor developed the [...] "pumping percolator", in which boiling water in a bottom chamber forces itself up a tube and then trickles (percolates) through the ground coffee back into the bottom chamber. Among other French innovations, Count Rumford, an eccentric American scientist residing in Paris, developed a French Drip Pot with an insulating water jacket to keep the coffee hot. Also, the first metal filter was developed and patented by French inventor.|$|E

The thesis consists of two parts – theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part I stated the emission limits of sulphur dioxide, elaborated possible desulphurization methods and described the sorbets suitable for desulphurization. In the practical part I chose a dry desulphurization method with fluid reactor, to which a dry sorbent on the basis of lime hydrate is dosed.
