50|$|For {{the opening}} of the system in 1940, the Seattle Transit System {{purchased}} trolleybuses from two different manufacturers. The Twin Coach <b>Company</b> <b>provided</b> 135 <b>vehicles,</b> while the J. G. Brill <b>Company</b> <b>provided</b> 100. All but the first Brill vehicles were built, under license, by Pacific Car and Foundry (PCF), in the nearby city of Renton, and are commonly referred to as PCF-Brill vehicles or simply Brills. Strong ridership growth during World War II, when the city's economy was booming, brought a need for additional vehicles. Forty-two more Twin Coach trolleybuses were bought in 1942-1943, followed by 30 Pullman-Standard vehicles in 1944. These were the last new trolleybuses acquired until the late 1970s. The fleet's size peaked at that time, at 307, making Seattle's trolleybus fleet the 12th-largest in the United States.|$|R

2500|$|BC Ferries' first route, {{commissioned}} in 1960, {{was between}} Swartz Bay, north of Sidney on Vancouver Island, and Tsawwassen, {{a part of}} Delta, using just two vessels. These ships were the now-retired [...] MV Tsawwassen and the MV Sidney. [...] The next few years saw a dramatic growth of the B.C. ferry system as it took over operations of the Black Ball Line and other major private <b>companies</b> <b>providing</b> <b>vehicle</b> ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. As the ferry system expanded and started to service other small coastal communities, BC Ferries had to build more vessels, {{many of them in}} {{the first five years of}} its operations, to keep up with the demand. Another method of satisfying increasing demand for service was BC Ferries' unique [...] "stretch and lift" [...] program, involving seven vessels being cut in half and extended, and five of those vessels later cut in half again and elevated, to increase their passenger and vehicle-carrying capacities. The vast majority of the vessels in the fleet were built in B.C. waters, with only two foreign purchases and one domestic purchase. In the mid-1980s, BC Ferries took over the operations of the saltwater branch of the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Highways, which ran ferry services to very small coastal communities. This action dramatically increased the size of BC Ferries' fleet and its geographical service area. The distinctive [...] "dogwood on green" [...] flag that BC Ferries used between 1960 and 2003 gave the service its popular nickname [...] "the Dogwood Fleet".|$|R

5000|$|In late 1939, {{immediately}} after the Polish invasion, the Germans slowed down, quietly turning their attentions to Scandinavia, giving much of Europe the {{false sense of security}} known as the [...] "Drole Guerre" [...] (Phony War). In Paris, soldiers were on every corner, and young men stood in long lines to enlist. Most American entertainers fled back to the United States. However, Jackson was having success in Romania, despite the war just across the border. Unlike in Paris, the swastika flew beside the Romanian flag. King Carol made it no secret that he supported the Nazis. As the war continued, she kept busy, performing every night at the La Zissu cabaret. In the summer of 1940, King Carol soon handed over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, causing uproar across Romania, especially as fleeing Bessarabian refugees crowded the streets of Bucharest. To get away from the occasionally crowded city, Jackson often departed to their countryside estate in Craiova, where Barbu spent much of his time running his business, probably more now since the Ford-Romania <b>Company</b> began <b>providing</b> military-grade <b>vehicles</b> for the Germans.|$|R

When Luke's aircraft is shot down during the battle, he contacts OnStar, a <b>company</b> that <b>provides</b> <b>vehicle</b> security.

His first appearance was in [...] "Quagmire's Baby", which first aired shortly before the DVD release of [...] "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side".

The other Beatles are then seen teasing Paul about Heather Mills having one leg, calling her [...] "Peg" [...] and [...] "Eileen". After much maneuvering, Han is able to escape the TIE fighters, eventually parking in a handicapped zone, citing vertigo as his medical condition.

The nearly unintelligible (and innocuous) lyrics were widely misinterpreted as obscene, and the song was banned by radio stations and even investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
