500|$|The European Commission (EC) {{claimed that}} Alcan is in breach of their {{operating}} licence as the station {{has failed to}} [...] "significantly reduce its emissions". The UK Government contested the allegations, as the power station and smelter combined then provided 650 jobs and a contribution of £100,000,000 to the local economy, in an area heavily affected {{by the loss of}} traditional heavy industry. They lost the court case over it and on 22 April 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the plant was subject to the emission limit values of the European directive on Large <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants.</b> As a consequence, the station has to have at least £200 million worth of adaptations made to it so that it conforms to the directive, or be shut down. A date has not yet been given for it to conform, but two options for saving the station are the CCS project, or a switch from coal to biomass as a fuel.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{all three}} main carbon capture {{technologies}} (post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion) {{can produce a}} CO 2 dominant stream, other impurities {{are expected to be}} present in the CO 2 stream. The impurities in the CO 2 stream can adversely affect other processes of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) chain including the purification, compression, transportation and storage of the CO 2 stream. Both the nature and the concentrations of potential impurities expected to be present in the CO 2 stream of a CCS-integrated power plant depend on not only the type of the power plant but also the carbon capture method used. The present paper focuses on the predictions of impurities expected to be present in the CO 2 stream of an oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The main gaseous impurities of the CO 2 stream of oxy-coal combustion are N 2 /Ar, O 2 and H 2 O. Even the air ingress to the boiler and its auxiliaries is small enough to be neglected, the N 2 /Ar concentration of the CO 2 stream can vary between ca. 1 % and 6 %, mainly depending on the O 2 purity of the air separation unit, and the O 2 concentration can vary between ca. 3 % and 5 %, mainly depending on the combustion stoichiometry of the boiler. The H 2 O concentration of the CO 2 stream can vary from ca. 10 % to over 40 %, mainly depending on the fuel moisture and the partitioning of recycling flue gas (RFG) between wet-RFG and dry-RFG. NOx and SO 2 are the two main polluting impurities of the CO 2 stream of an oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> and their concentrations are expected to be well above those found in the flue gas of an air-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The concentration of NOx in the flue gas of an oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> can be up to ca. two times to that of an equivalent air-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The amount of NOx emitted by the oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant,</b> however, is expected to be much smaller than that of the air-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The reductions of the recirculated NOx within the combustion furnace by the reburning mechanism and the char-NO reactions are the main reason for a smaller amount of NOx emitted by the oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The concentration of SO 2 in the flue gas of an oxy-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> can be up to six times to that of an equivalent air-coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> if the recycling flue gas is not desulphurized.

50|$|The Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD, 2001/80/EC) was a European Union {{directive}} {{which required}} member {{states of the}} European Union to legislatively limit flue gas emissions from combustion plant having thermal capacity of 50 MW or greater. The directive applied to fossil-fuel power stations, and other large thermal plant such as petroleum refineries and steelworks. The directive specified emission limits for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and dust. The directive was issued in October 2001.

50|$|On April 4, 2001, the European Council {{approved}} the Protocol on Heavy Metals {{in order to}} reduce emissions of heavy metals that are subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport and are likely to have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The 2001 EU Large Combustion Plant Directive considers stationary <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> as one of the main sources of emission of NOx, SOx, particulates and heavy metals into the atmosphere. With the application of the European Directives 96/61/CE (Integrated pollution prevention and control) and 96/62/CE (Ambient air quality assessment and management) in which emission limits for toxic trace elements, such as mercury, are clearly established, energy production plants using coal must control mercury emissions. In January 2005, the European Commission adopted a mercury strategy for reducing mercury levels in the environment.|$|E
50|$|According to Perlman, “the U.S. {{has more}} coal {{than any other}} country in the world. It’s {{actually}} about as cheap as dirt.” However, the burning of coal for power production is a leading contributor to global warming, mercury poisoning in fish, and acid rain, so environmentalists are pushing to reduce the prevalence of coal <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> in the United States. Greenpeace calls it “climate change enemy #1.”GreatPoint Energy is attempting to bridge economics and environmental responsibility. The process developed by the company is much cleaner and more efficient than existing technology. The Wall Street Journal notes that “coal-gasification plants don’t require the vast quantities of water and chemicals used in hydrofracking, a popular commercial method to extract natural gas from shale, nor do they produce the air pollution, solid and liquid waste associated with coal-combustion power plants”. On top of that, GreatPoint Energy’s patented bluegas™ catalytic hydromethanation process uses only a third of the water and energy consumed by General Electric’s coal gasification plants.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{production}} {{is one of}} the largest sources of air pollution. A feasible method to reduce the harmful flue gas emissions and to increase the efficiency is to improve the control strategies of the existing thermoelectric power plants. This makes the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method very suitable for achieving an efficient combustion control. Recently, an explicit approximate approach for stochastic NMPC based on a Gaussian process model was proposed. The benefits of an explicit solution, in addition to the efficient on-line computations, include also verifiability of the implementation, which is an essential issue in safety-critical applications. This paper considers the application of an explicit approximate approach for stochastic NMPC to the design of an explicit reference tracking NMPC controller for a <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> based on its Gaussian process model. The controller brings the air factor (respectively the concentration of oxygen in the flue gas) on its optimal value with every change of the load factor and thus an optimal operation of the <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> is achieved...|$|R
