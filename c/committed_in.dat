30|$|Q 3 : Which {{changes are}} under work in {{parallel}} (in different clones or different branches) and {{which of them}} are available to be incorporated into others’ clones? New <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> tracked branches of peers can be easily found by looking at Level 3 information (tracked branches, shown in Fig. 18 a and Fig. 20). This view shows to which branch these commits are related and how many new commits exist. If {{we want to look}} at each commit individually, we can look at Level 4 information (<b>commit</b> history, shown <b>in</b> Fig. 16 and Fig. 19) and notice the yellow nodes. Additionally, Level 4 information can be used to find new <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> repositories that are not peers (red nodes), or new <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> non-tracked branches (gray nodes).|$|R
40|$|Information {{contained}} <b>in</b> versioning system <b>commits</b> {{has been}} frequently {{used to support}} software evolution research. Concomitantly, some researchers have tried to relate com-mits to certain activities, e. g., large commits {{are more likely to}} be originated from code management activities, while small ones are related to development activities. However, these characterizations are vague, because there is no con-sistent definition of what is a small or a large <b>commit.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we study the nature of <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> two dimensions. First, we define the size of <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> terms of number of files, and then we classify commits based on the content of their comments. To perform this study, we use the history log of nine large open source projects. ...|$|R

5|$|The Whitechapel murders were <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> or {{near the}} impoverished Whitechapel {{district}} in the East End of London between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891.

30|$|The status {{evaluation}} {{considers the}} existing <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> each repository individually. Due {{to the nature}} of DVCS, old data is almost never deleted, and commits are cumulative. Thus, if commit N is created over commit N – 1, the existence of <b>commit</b> N <b>in</b> a given repository implies that commit N – 1 also exists in the repository. In this way, by using set theory, it is possible to subtract the set of <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> the local repository from the set of <b>commits</b> <b>in</b> its peers, resulting in the set of commits not pulled yet. In this case, local repository will be behind its peers (arrow down in Fig. 8). Conversely, subtracting the sets in the inverse order will result in the set of commits not pushed yet, meaning that local repository is ahead of its peers (arrow up). When both sets are empty, local repository is synchronized (green checkmark in Fig. 8) and when both sets have elements, it is both ahead and behind its peer (arrow up and down in Fig. 8).|$|R

5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group.

30|$|The {{finer grain}} of {{information}} is the CommitInfo, which represents each <b>commit</b> <b>in</b> the topology. A commit is identified by a hash code (hash attribute) and refers to its parents (except for the first <b>commit</b> <b>in</b> the repository, which {{does not have any}} parent). As each commit may not exist in all clones of the topology, we store the list of clones where each commit can be found (foundIn association end). We also store the committer, the commit message (shortMessage attribute), and whether the commits belong to tracked or non-tracked branches (tracked attribute).|$|R
