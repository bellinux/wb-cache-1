40|$|Much of {{the earlier}} work {{presented}} {{in the area of}} on-line fault diagnosis focuses on knowledge based and qualitatively reasoning principles and attempts to present possible root causes and consequences in terms of various measured data.

This paper is concerned with developing a soft sensor to assist in on-line fault diagnosis by providing information on the critical variable that is not directly accessible.

Also, energy consumption for the lab scale is an unimportant issue (ignored) and no extra utility was needed as the quantities of reactants and products were little at laboratory scale, hence recovery issues were not a point in the laboratory-scale operation. However, the design when scaled-up to a commercial level [7] offers the chance of energy savings via appropriate process integration.

40|$|Recently {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) has been successfully applied {{for the evaluation of}} the start-of-run performance of three-dimensional (3 D) coil geometries in steam cracking reactors. However, determining the full economic potential of a coil involves tracking its performance throughout the run and not only at start-of-run.

In this work, mass, energy and momentum balances have been applied to the tube reactors in ethylene dichloride cracker and the obtained differential equations are solved simultaneously using the characterizations of an existing unit and the suitable numerical method to predict the reactor behavior. Profiles of concentration, temperature andpressure along the reactor have been obtained and comparedwith the operating data. Optimization of ethylene dichloride thermal <b>cracking</b> <b>reactor</b> for vinyl chloride monomer production has also been done in this work. The objective function for this problem depends on length of reactor which finds optimum external wall temperature profile along the reactor and can optimize the profile of heat transfer rate to the process fluid along the reactor in order to maximize the VCM product at the outlet of the reactor.

40|$|The steam {{cracking}} process {{is an important}} asset in the hydrocarbon processing industry. The main products are lower olefins and hydrogen, with ethylene being the world's largest volume organic chemical at a worldwide capacity of ~ 120 million tonnes per year. Feed stocks are hydrocarbons such as: ethane, LPG, naphtha's, gas condensates and gas oil. The research goal of this thesis is {{to search for the}} intrinsic optimal {{steam cracking}} reaction conditions, pushing the olefin yields to the maximum that the fundamental reaction kinetic models allow for. To get to that goal we have: firstly, identified and assessed alternative process concepts published in the literature. Secondly, developed the concepts and software for an equation based modelling tool suitable for optimisation of large scale reaction kinetic models. Thirdly, developed a new reactor concept, d-RMix for homogeneous reactions with distributed feed allocation, product removal and macro-mixing. Fourthly, applied the optimisation tool to the new reactor concept model and an advanced reaction kinetic model for steam cracking, SPYRO(r). For four different feed stocks optimisations of ethylene yield and of ethylene plus propylene yields have been carried out. For the cracking of ethane a linear-concave unconstrained temperature profile with a (free) maximum temperature of ~ 1260 K proves optimal. For propane and heavier feed stocks an isothermal profile at the upper temperature bound is optimal, with dips at the beginning and the middle of the reaction volume coordinate. For these heavier hydrocarbon feeds a distribution along the reactor volume coordinate does result in higher yields.

40|$|The {{proposed}} design utilizes 750, 000 metric dry {{tons per}} year of woodchip biomass obtained from the local sawmill and forestry industries. The woodchips are processed and dried before being fed to a gasification system. The gasifiers produce a hydrogen-rich syngas, which is routed through a monoethanol amine (MEA) absorption section to remove the coproduced CO 2. The syngas then enters a novel microchannel reactor where the equilibrium between the synthesis gas, methanol, and dimethyl ether results in a high overall conversion and efficient heat removal. Conversions were modeled using recent experimental data from PNNL. The DME product {{is removed from the}} reactor effluent using a water absorption tower and separated from the water via distillation. The DME and methanol byproduct are then routed to another reactor section where propylene, ethylene, and other hydrocarbon byproducts are produced. This reactor section was designed with near 100 % feed conversion. Propylene and ethylene are separated from the other effluents to be sold as products. The byproduct hydrocarbons are routed back to a steam <b>cracking</b> <b>reactor</b> to form additional propylene and ethylene, which are also feed to the separation train. 145, 000 metric {{tons per year}} of propylene and 35, 000 metric tons per year of ethylene are produced.
