Numerous trees were downed and power outages were reported. Additionally, the nearby Cerrito Rico dam nearly overflowed its banks. In the Tecpan municipality, four rivers overflowed their banks and six people died because of landslides. Many mountainous communities were isolated, thus making in difficult to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, a {{depression}} {{formed by the}} <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo {{is one of several}} ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans has {{prompted}} many government officials to call for many congressional committee hearings and investigations.

5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concrete block wall.

The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Bolton Wanderers {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the fifth round. The match at Bolton's home ground, Burnden Park, remained goalless until the 85th minute when Liverpool midfielder Ian Callaghan scored. The goal caused the Liverpool fans behind the goal to surge forward, {{which resulted in the}} <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden railing. There were no serious injuries and the referee continued with the match, which Liverpool won 1–0, to progress to the sixth round. They faced Leicester City in the sixth round. Despite chances for both teams throughout the match at Filbert Street, neither team scored and the match finished 0–0. The match was replayed at Anfield four days later, which Liverpool won 1–0 when Hunt scored in the 72nd minute.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{large part of the}} heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E
5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant molecular cloud {{of gas and}} dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, {{making it impossible for}} larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
5|$|In sparing the lives, the French {{are awarded}} by God with the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge {{that leads to}} many of the English {{soldiers}} drowning and a quick victory. The English, after losing Tourelles, fall back to the coast to await for reinforcements. Word comes that the Burgundian troops are coming to help the English. Joan meets with the Duke of Burgundy to warn him against a battle before she returns to her men to help bury the dead. Talbot's son comes with reinforcements from England, and the English army attacks the French at Patay. During the battle, Joan is able to kill the son and Conrade is able to kill the father. This causes the English to flee and, in turn, allows the French to retake Rheims. Once Rheims is free, Charles comes and is crowned the King of France. The story ends with Joan telling him to be a good king.|$|E
