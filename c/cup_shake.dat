Yet letters are venerable; and the telephone valiant, for the journey is a lonely one, and if bound together by notes and telephones we went in company, perhaps--who knows?--we might talk by the way.|$|E

40|$|The cups task is {{the most}} widely adopted forced-choice {{paradigm}} for comparative studies of inferential reasoning by exclusion. In this task, subjects are presented with two cups, one {{of which has been}} surreptitiously baited. When the empty <b>cup</b> is <b>shaken</b> or its interior shown, it is possible to infer by exclusion that the alternative cup contains the reward. The present study extends the existing body of comparative work to include human children (Homo sapiens). Like chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that were tested with the same equipment and near-identical procedures, children aged three to five made apparent inferences using both visual and auditory information, although the youngest children showed the least-developed ability in the auditory modality. However, unlike chimpanzees, children of all ages used causally irrelevant information in a control test designed to examine the possibility that their apparent auditory inferences were the product of contingency learning (the duplicate cups test). Nevertheless, the children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to reason by exclusion was corroborated by their performance on a novel verbal disjunctive syllogism test, and we found preliminary evidence consistent with the suggestion that children used their causal-logical understanding to reason by exclusion in the cups task, but subsequently treated the duplicate cups information as symbolic or communicative, rather than causal.

Ay, and he lived in a castle with dark, dull, narrow chambers, all save the hall, where there was ever a tramping and a clamouring, and smells of hot burning meat, and horses, and all sorts of things, and they sat and sat over their meat and wine, and drank health to King Harry and the Red Rose.

I had rather live on these free green hills with the clear blue sky above me, and my good old ewe for my comrade'--and he fell to caressing the face of an old sheep which had come up to him, a white, mountain- bleached sheep with fine and delicate limbs. 'Yes, I love thee, good, gentle, little ewe, and thee, faithful Watch,' as a young collie pressed up to him, thrusting a long nose into his hand, 'far better than those great baying hounds, or the fierce-eyed hawks that only want to kill. If I be a baron, must it be in that sort? Avenge! avenge! what does that mean? Is it, as in Goodwife Dolly's ballads, going forth to kill? Why should I? I had rather let them be! Hark! Yea, Watch,' as the dog pricked his ears and raised his graceful head, then sprang up and uttered a deep-mouthed bark. The sheep darted away to her companions, and Hal rose to his feet, as the dog began to wave his tail, and Hob came forward accompanied by a tall, grave-looking gentleman. 'Here he be, sir.

40|$|In {{tasks that}} involve {{a choice between}} several options, {{inferential}} reasoning by exclusion {{is a process of}} mental manipulation in which the correct selection is deduced by logically eliminating – or “excluding” – the alternatives. A variety of experimental paradigms have been designed to assess the ability of non-human animals and young children to reason in this way. However, this body of research has several significant limitations. First, the findings of even the most rigorous studies are vulnerable to alternative explanations in terms of associative learning. Second, because each paradigm has typically been used to study {{only a small number of}} species, there is a dearth of truly comparative data. Third, much of the research has evaluated subjects’ apparent ability to infer by exclusion using visual information, but not information from other sensory modalities (e. g., auditory). Fourth, although their cognitive capacities are directly relevant to the phylogenetic reconstruction of hominid evolution, lesser apes have received far less research attention than great apes, and no published study has assessed their exclusion reasoning ability. The present thesis aimed to address these limitations. Thus, in Chapter 2, I began by investigating whether the standard procedures associated with two paradigms that have been used to obtain evidence of exclusion reasoning – the cups task (Call, 2004) and the tubes task (Call & Carpenter, 2001) – are appropriate for the physical, motivational and dispositional characteristics of lesser apes. None of the subjects (3 siamangs) completed either task but observations of their behaviour during testing informed modifications to the materials and procedures, which were designed to make both tasks more “gibbon-friendly” (i. e., faster and less intimidating). In Chapter 3, I used the revised tubes task methodology to examine the ability of chimpanzees (n = 2), orangutans (n = 6), gibbons (n = 3) and a spider monkey to make spontaneous inferences by exclusion. Like lesser apes, spider monkeys were overlooked in previous research investigating exclusion reasoning. Since great apes had previously been shown to make apparent inferences in this paradigm, they were included primarily to provide a benchmark against which to judge the other species, given the methodological changes. One orangutan and both chimpanzees made apparent inferences on some trials. However, even the best performer, a chimpanzee, chose incorrectly on his first opportunity to infer by exclusion; hence, one-trial learning could not be ruled out. The spider monkey completed the experiment, but made no apparent inferences. Unfortunately, no gibbon progressed beyond warm-up trials. Two limitations of the tubes task paradigm are that exhaustive search can be used to obtain every reward without penalty, and that it only assesses exclusion reasoning in the visual modality. Hence, in Chapter 4, I utilised the modified cups task procedures to investigate whether chimpanzees (n = 2), orangutans (n = 9) and gibbons (n = 9) would make apparent inferences by exclusion using visual or auditory information when forced to choose (Experiment 1). Apes tested previously on the cups task paradigm had performed surprisingly poorly: Only two gorillas and one bonobo made apparent inferences in both sensory modalities, chimpanzees succeeded only in the visual modality, and orangutans succeeded in neither. However, Experiment 1 yielded prima facie evidence of exclusion reasoning in both domains for two chimpanzees, and in the visual domain for two orangutans. Experiments 2 and 3 tested two associative learning explanations, demonstrating that the performance of subjects who made apparent auditory inferences could not be readily attributed to reliance on either: (a) the sound produced when the baited <b>cup</b> was <b>shaken</b> (via an adaptation of Call’s tape recorder test); or (b) a compound stimulus comprising the shaking motion and the concomitant sound (via the novel duplicate cups test). These experiments provide the strongest evidence to date that chimpanzees have the capacity to make inferences in both the visual and auditory modalities. Although none of the gibbons completed Experiment 1, additional testing of three siamangs and a spider monkey using a further modified, faster method yielded the first prima facie evidence of exclusion reasoning in a lesser ape species (Experiment 4). In Chapter 5, I built on the results presented in Chapter 4 by testing 48 children aged three to five years. Previous comparative studies involving children focussed solely on the visual domain. Like chimpanzees, the children I tested made apparent inferences in both sensory modalities, although three-year-olds showed the least-developed ability with auditory information. Unlike chimpanzees, children of all ages used causally-irrelevant information in the duplicate cups test. Nevertheless, their exclusion reasoning ability was corroborated by their performance on a novel verbal test, and I found preliminary evidence that children used their causal-logical understanding to reason by exclusion in the cups task, but subsequently treated the duplicate cups information as symbolic or communicative, rather than causal. Finally, in Chapter 6, I discuss the implications of the findings and present suggestions for future research...|$|R
