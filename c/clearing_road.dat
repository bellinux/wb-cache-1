5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land <b>clearing,</b> <b>road</b> construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{every year}} the village celebrates the {{traditional}} bronck, which {{dates back to the}} Middle Ages when the people of the village would honour God {{in order to get a}} good harvest. The village is then ruled by a king and his queen. Every four years (most recent occurrence 2004) this position is 'battled' for. Who will be king is determined on Pentecost Monday by a contest where the candidates take turns shooting a wooden bird atop a long pole on the church square. Whoever manages to shoot the bird down will be king. Two weeks after Pentecost the actual celebrations start. During these three days (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) the king and his army make their way through the whole village <b>clearing</b> <b>road</b> blocks (put there as a reminder of the problems they ran into in the old days) along the way. On Sunday there is also a mass and procession through the village. Two weeks after these celebrations, the king and queen treat the whole village to a so-called 'koffietafel' (literally: coffee table). Which includes drinks and the traditional limburgish pastry vlaai.|$|E

[...] Police were also forced to stop at various places due to suspect of landmine on the road or as the bridges were destroyed. Out of the six kidnapped CPIM members, dead bodies of four were found, taking the tally of death of CPIM party members in the post-election violence in Lalgarh area to 10. At about 19:45 IST, {{there has been a}} report of landmine blast near Pirakata Bazaar on SDPO’s car in which two police personnel has been grievously injured. The state government has asked for more 6 companies of CRPF from the Central Government to assist the state police in the operation. At around 21:00 IST there was cross fire between the police and Maoists at Lalgarh Police Station. The Jharkhand border near Ghatshila was sealed to stop the Maoists escaping into Jharkhand.|$|E

Unlike many other types of traffic sensors, these sensors count vehicles in bumper-to-bumper traffic just as well as in widely separated traffic. The devices detect vehicles by detecting the perturbations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by the vehicles. They measure this perturbation using a...|$|E
40|$|Task {{allocation}} {{involves the}} division of tasks among a team of robots, such that each robot is responsible for {{a subset of the}} tasks. Similarly, in role assignment, roles are typically defined to be performed by a single robot whose performance is independent of the composition of its team. Complex tasks, that cannot be sub-divided and require multiple robots cooperating, require the formation of a coalition of robots to complete. We are interested in forming an effective ad hoc team to solve a task, through observations of the robots ’ performance in the task and modeling the synergistic effects among robots in the team. Ad hoc teams are common in sports such as soccer, where human players without prior interactions form a team and are capable of playing the game. Currently, while robots within a team can play soccer well, they are unable to form ad hoc teams with robots developed by multiple research groups. This general problem is also seen in urban search-and-rescue (USAR), where large groups of heterogeneous robots would be deployed to solve complex tasks such as putting out fires, rescuing people and <b>clearing</b> <b>road</b> blockages.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The Douthitt ranch is located I I miles north of US Highway 87, about 25 miles southeast of Big Spring, Texas. The ranch is situated in the intersection of southeast Howard, northwest Sterling, and southwest Mitchell counties. The climate is subtropical with cold dry winters and hot summers. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, 75 % of which falls from April through October. The topography varies from flats (north) to gently rolling hills (central) to steep canyons and breaks (south). The major soils are sandy loams, loams, clay loams, deep clays, shallow clays, and very shallow clays over limestone hills. The vegetation is a mixture of the Edwards Plateau ecoregion to the south and the Rolling Plains ecoregion to the north. The original grasslands have been invaded and replaced by mixed-brush/grass communities consisting primarily of juniper, mesquite, tobosa, and buffalograss. The deeper soils are dominated by a mesquite mixed-brush community. The shallower sites are dominated by juniper and buffalo grass. The vegetation and topography provide quality habitat for white-tailed deer, turkey, quail, mourning dove, fur-bearers, and other wildlife. However, increasing brush densities are currently limiting the hunting opportunities for quail and deer and livestock production potential. the most feasible enterprise options include a recreational hunting operation supplemented with wildlife viewing and custom stocker grazing operations. Existing facilities can be used for the wildlife enterprises. Capitol improvements are numerous with the lodge, kennels, cooler, and livestock working facilities being most significant. Gravel roads make the ranch accessible in all weather conditions. Fences and water developments permit livestock use. Proposed habitat improvement practices will provide increased habitat suitability for wildlife on the ranch. The objectives of habitat management are to maintain optimum cover while providing an abundance of food throughout the year and increased hunting opportunities. The reduction of brush will be limited to 85 % in quail emphasis areas and 45 % in deer emphasis areas. Habitat management practices will include brush control with roller chopping, disking, dragging, grubbing, chemical methods, fire, food plots, road maintenance (<b>clearing</b> <b>road</b> edges 10 - 50 yards), and water development. Wildlife management is aimed at producing sustainable, quality populations in quality habitats. Surveys, harvest management, supplemental feeding, and predator control are recommended to accomplish this goal. A custom stocker operation grazing war-rn season forage from 15 April through 15 October is recommended with an initial stocking of 400 - 600 weaned calves (350 - 500 lbs.) is recommended. The initial stocking rate should be adjusted as improvement practices are completed. Additional water development is recommended to increase livestock and wildlife utilization in remote areas. The appendices list soils, range sites, forage inventories, plant and animal species, and recommended food species for planting. Ranch maps, herbicide application rates, and harvest data collection sheets also are included. ' Scientific names for animal and plants are listed in Appendices D and E...|$|E
