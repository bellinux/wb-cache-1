5|$|With the Buyid troops {{completing}} their {{conquest of the}} Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al-Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the Syrian Desert to the Fatimid-controlled south of Syria. There he became embroiled in the <b>complex</b> <b>power</b> struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with {{members of his family}} starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a Tayy chief and ruler of Ramla. Hoping to sow dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.|$|E

25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less <b>complex</b> <b>power</b> amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E

500|$|Up to this point, {{soap operas}} used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, [...] "critique power relationships, {{especially}} {{the oppression of}} the poor by the rich and of women by men". [...] Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and [...] "failed to capture the <b>complex</b> <b>power</b> relations underlying... violence towards women". [...] The perpetrators were [...] "simply evil or out control", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. [...] The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: [...] "the evil instigator" [...] (Todd); [...] "the good resister" [...] (Powell), and [...] "the mediator between these polarized figures" [...] (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. [...] Brooks called the rapists [...] "a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist", {{because they had a}} different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the [...] "evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. [...] Hayward said, [...] "What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty.

Under attack by the Damascenes, and with {{members of his family}} starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Hoping to sow disunion among the Arab tribes and weaken their power to the benefit of the Fatimids, the local Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih promised Ramlah to Abu Taghlib, even though he himself had previously handed Mufarrij a document from al-Aziz that gave the city to the Jarrahids. When Abu Taghlib, joined by Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, attacked Ramlah, Mufarrij called upon al-Fadl for aid. Al-Fadl agreed, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was defeated and taken captive by Mufarrij. After parading him through Ramlah tied to a camel, Mufarrij killed his prisoner with his own hands to prevent him from being used by the Fatimids against him in the future. This episode cemented Mufarrij's control over Ramlah and marked his and his tribe's rise to a powerful position in local affairs. With their rivals defeated, the Tayy now became [...] "the major bedouin power in the area", according to Hugh Kennedy, and a continuing nuisance to the Fatimids, since although they recognized Fatimid authority, in practice Mufarrij and his followers acted as independent agents.|$|E
