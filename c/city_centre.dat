5|$|Travel {{time from}} Nydalen and Storo {{stations}} to the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> stations {{is about the}} same, independent of which direction on the Ring Line travellers choose. Passengers heading for the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> can therefore take the first train that comes, independent of which direction it is heading, thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five-minute headway service to the <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> The trains are operated by Sporveien T-banen, a subsidiary of Sporveien, on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.|$|E
5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the <b>city</b> <b>centre,</b> KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track was needed to connect the line into the <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{architect}} Charles Holden drew up {{plans to}} redevelop the <b>city</b> <b>centre,</b> but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> eventually began 10years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the <b>city</b> <b>centre,</b> which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, {{with the arrival of the}} University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.|$|E

5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> high rises. As a result, in the 2000s (decade), {{there has been a}} renewed interest in building skyscrapers in Manchester and other cities in Britain.

On matchdays, 400 car parking places and 355 cycle parking places will be available at the stadium. A cycle route exists between the site and the <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{is a major}} retail centre, and is home to many High Street and {{department}} stores as well as designer boutiques.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{representative}} sociological research of Hungarian <b>cities</b> and their <b>centres</b> are showing a Hungarian way in the general development tendencies of the European and East Central-European <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> The processes of transition, the impacts of European and global economic integration have adjusted the characteristic features of Hungarian big <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> to the inner space character of European big cities. According {{to the results of}} research the central areas of Hungarian big cities following the major features of West European big cities re concentrating high social classes: people with high educational level and high professional qualifications and with high incomes. The marketable, younger and more active demographic groups also prefer settling down in the internal zones of urban space 10. The presence of low social classes is higher in suburbs and in backwarded urban peripheries. However handicapped social classes are present in <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> as well and the members of high social classes have also emerged in urban peripheries. The controversial situation of European and East Central European <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> can be well illustrated by the fact that Hungarian big <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> are concentrating not only high social classes and advanced economy (with high-tech infrastructure and sophisticated institutional system and services) but the majority of physical and social problems as well.
