5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree.</b> In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree,</b> C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very spindly, and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} the <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree,</b> including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} podocarp forest contains 500- to 600-year-old matai, totara and kahikatea {{trees as}} well as fruit and flowering species such as kowhai, ribbonwood, mahoe, <b>cabbage</b> <b>trees,</b> kanuka and fuchsia.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base of an old <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> were harvested.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E

5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> moth.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Tree</b> Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Tree</b> Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E
5|$|Wharanui grow to {{the west}} of the North Island's main divide. They have long, broad flaccid leaves, which may be an {{adaptation}} to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in Wellington, Horowhenua and Whanganui, and extends with some modifications to the southern Taranaki coast. In Taranaki, <b>cabbage</b> <b>trees</b> generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves. In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from Cape Campbell to the northern Catlins, and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the Southern Alps. In Marlborough's Wairau Valley, <b>cabbage</b> <b>trees</b> tend to retain their old, dead leaves, lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.|$|R
50|$|The Soutpansberg or “Tha vhani ya muno” (mountain of salt) {{is in the}} {{traditional}} area of the Venda people. It is rich in plant diversity with yellowwood trees, twelve acacia species, including fever <b>trees,</b> giant <b>cabbage</b> <b>trees,</b> proteas and ancient tree ferns. The rocky summits are a haven for birds of prey.|$|R

Hāngi [...] "experts" [...] have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations.

5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Tree</b> Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E
5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a <b>cabbage</b> <b>tree</b> can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
