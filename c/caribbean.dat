5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the <b>Caribbean</b> islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw, only two endemic <b>Caribbean</b> macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix macaw (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the <b>Caribbean</b> islands and from mainland South America to the <b>Caribbean</b> both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. All the endemic <b>Caribbean</b> macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{differences}} in {{morbidity and mortality}} due to non-insulin dependent diabetes in African <b>Caribbeans</b> and Europeans. DESIGN: Cohort study of patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes drawn from diabetes clinics in London. Baseline investigations were performed in 1975 - 7; follow up continued until 1995. PATIENTS: 150 Europeans and 77 African <b>Caribbeans</b> with non-insulin dependent diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause and cardiovascular mortality; prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. RESULTS: Duration of diabetes was shorter in African <b>Caribbeans,</b> particularly women. African <b>Caribbeans</b> {{were more likely than}} the Europeans to have been given a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms and less likely to be taking insulin. Mean cholesterol concentration was lower in African <b>Caribbeans,</b> but blood pressure and body mass index were not different in the two ethnic groups. Prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications was insignificantly lower in African Caribbens than in Europeans. 59 Europeans and 16 African <b>Caribbeans</b> had died by the end of follow up. The risk ratio for all cause mortality was 0. 41 (95 % confidence interval 0. 23 to 0. 73) (P = 0. 002) for African <b>Caribbeans</b> v Europeans. This was attenuated to 0. 59 (0. 32 to 1. 10) (P = 0. 1) after adjustment for sex, smoking, proteinuria, and body mass index. Further adjustment for systolic blood pressure, cholesterol concentration, age, duration of diabetes, and treatment made little difference to the risk ratio. Unadjusted risk ratio for cardiovascular and ischaemic heart disease were 0. 33 (0. 15 to 0. 70) (P = 0. 004) and 0. 37 (0. 16 to 0. 85) (P = 0. 02) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: African <b>Caribbeans</b> with non-insulin dependent diabetes maintain a low risk of heart disease.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether ethnic differences in diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition account for ethnic differences in incident cardiovascular disease. Background: Coronary heart disease risks are elevated in South Asians and are lower in African <b>Caribbeans</b> compared with Europeans. These ethnic differences map to lipid patterns and ectopic fat deposition. Methods: Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 2, 049 Europeans, 1, 517 South Asians, and 630 African <b>Caribbeans</b> from 1988 through 1991 (mean age: 52. 4 ± 6. 9 years). Fatal and nonfatal events were captured over a median 20. 5 -year follow-up. Subhazard ratios (SHR) were calculated using competing risks regression. Results: Baseline diabetes prevalence was more than 3 times greater in South Asians and African <b>Caribbeans</b> than in Europeans. South Asians were more and African <b>Caribbeans</b> were less centrally obese and dyslipidemic than Europeans. Compared with Europeans, coronary heart disease incidence was greater in South Asians and less in African <b>Caribbeans.</b> The age- and sex-adjusted South Asian versus European SHR was 1. 70 (95...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{compares the}} health {{conditions}} of domestic <b>Caribbeans</b> with {{those living in}} the United States to explore how national context and migration experiences might influence substance use (i. e., alcohol or drug) and other {{mental and physical health}} conditions. The study is based upon probability samples of non-institutionalized <b>Caribbeans</b> living in the United States (1621), Jamaica (1216) and Guyana (2068) 18 years of age and over. Employing descriptive statistics and multivariate analytic procedures, the results revealed that substance use and other physical health conditions and major depressive disorder and mania vary by national context, with higher rates among <b>Caribbeans</b> living in the United States. Context and generation status influenced health outcomes. Among first generation black <b>Caribbeans,</b> residing in the United States for a longer length of time is linked to poorer health outcomes. There were differen...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether abnormalities {{of the left}} ventricle differ by glucose tolerance status, to explore reasons for differences, and to assess ethnic differences in these relations.  DESIGN—Population based prevalence study.  SETTING—London, UK.  PATIENTS— 1152 African <b>Caribbeans</b> and Europeans.  METHODS—Echocardiograms, blood pressure, obesity, fasting and two hour blood glucose, insulin and lipids, and urinary albumin excretion rate were measured.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Left ventricular mass index, wall thickness, and early (E) to atrial (A) wave ratio.  RESULTS—Left ventricular mass index was greater in diabetic Europeans than in normoglycaemic Europeans (mean (SE), 95. 6  (5. 0) v 79. 7  (0. 8) g/m 2, p =  0. 001) and in diabetic African <b>Caribbeans</b> than in normoglycaemic African <b>Caribbeans</b> (88. 6  (2. 5) v 82. 4  (0. 9) g/m 2, p =  0. 02). Similar, but weaker associations were observed for the E:A ratio. β Coefficients between left ventricular mass index and fasting glucose in the normoglycaemic range, adjusted for age and sex, were 2. 43  in Europeans (p =  0. 05) and 3. 74  in African <b>Caribbeans</b> (p =  0. 02). These were attenuated to 1. 19  (p =  0. 4) and 3. 03  (p =  0. 08) in Europeans and African <b>Caribbeans,</b> respectively, when adjusted further for blood pressure and obesity. Adjustments for other risk factors made little difference to the coefficients. There were no ethnic differences in risk factor relations.  CONCLUSIONS—Abnormalities of the left ventricle occur in response to glucose intolerance and are observable into the normoglycaemic range. These disturbances are largely accounted for by associated obesity and hypertension. African <b>Caribbeans</b> have {{a greater degree of}} left ventricular structural impairment, emphasising the importance of tight blood pressure control.    Keywords: echocardiography; glucose tolerance; left ventricular mass index; ethnic difference...|$|R
