5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow <b>Clicker</b> for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow <b>Clicker</b> to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E

In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep may learn {{their names and}} many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to <b>clicker</b> training.

25|$|The {{first step}} in <b>clicker</b> {{training}} is teaching the animal to associate the <b>clicker</b> sound (or other chosen marker such as a whistle) with a treat. Every time the click sounds, a treat is offered immediately.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} {{effective}} <b>clicker</b> training is precise timing {{to deliver the}} conditioned reinforcer {{at the same moment}} as the desired behaviour is offered. The <b>clicker</b> is used as a 'bridge' between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by 'luring' where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by 'shaping' where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by 'capturing' where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded. Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the <b>clicker</b> and the treats are faded out.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an initial {{assessment}} on the use of <b>clickers</b> for large class instruction as experienced by students at an Australian branch campus in Malaysia. <b>Clickers</b> were used in a 14 weeks civil engineering 1 st year course. During the 10 th week, students were asked to complete a questionnaire that asked for their views on the use of <b>clickers</b> in the instructional process and how they perceived <b>clickers</b> in assisting their learning. Data from 53 complete questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics of frequencies, means and standard deviations. In addition, independent t-tests were used to look for gender differences. <b>Clickers</b> are fairly easy to use, and provide a fun way to quickly turn traditional classroom lectures into interactive learning experiences. Students overwhelmingly like using <b>clickers</b> and believe that they increase their learning. Findings from this paper can provides lecturers embarking on integrating <b>clickers</b> in their large class lectures with guides and pitfalls to consider in planning their instructions. This paper contributes to the literature on the use of innovative technology such as <b>clickers</b> in large class lectures in the Malaysian higher education context in particular and Asian context in general...|$|R
40|$|Classroom {{response}} systems, aka <b>clickers,</b> {{are documented}} to increase student engagement and participation during class. Although {{they have many}} uses, I have found <b>clickers</b> are particularly useful for encouraging student discussion and for formative assessment of student understanding. Use of <b>clickers</b> allows the instructor to practice agile teaching {{in ways that are}} not possible without this technology. <b>Clickers</b> enable the instructor to rapidly gauge student understanding of the class topic, and rapidly move discussion to points where students are having trouble. They also enable instructors to probe for common misconceptions about concepts, stimulate discussion concerning these misconceptions, and stimulate critical thinking in students in the process. However, there are several aspects that instructors must consider while using <b>clickers</b> to conduct formative assessment and agile teaching. I will discuss several of these considerations, including question design, based on my classroom experiences using <b>clickers...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a study {{published}} in 2009 in the Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education by Addison et. al., student response devices (<b>clickers)</b> were used in an introductory biochemistry course to deliver in-class subject matter questions to which students responded anonymously.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of an audience response system (i. e. <b>clickers)</b> as an engaging tool for learning and examine its potential for enhancing continuing education (CE) activities. METHODS Attendees at a symposium were invited to utilise and evaluate the use of <b>clickers.</b> Electronic data relating to participant demographics and feedback were collected using <b>clickers</b> during the symposium. RESULTS The 60 attendees who used the <b>clickers</b> were mostly pharmacists (76 %) who worked in hospital pharmacy practice (86 %). Attendees strongly agreed or agreed that <b>clickers</b> were easy to use (94 %), enhanced interaction (98 %), allowed comparison of knowledge with that of their peers (78 %), brought to attention their knowledge deficits (64 %) and should be used again (94 %).

500|$|Unexpectedly to Bogost, Cow <b>Clicker</b> {{became a}} viral phenomenon, {{amassing}} over 50,000 players by September 2010.

40|$|How can we {{encourage}} student participation in large classes? More specifically, how can participation best be encouraged with clickers; {{if they are}} used with anonymity for the student, or if the teacher can track each student and her/his performance? In this study, we evaluated student’s experiences of <b>clickers</b> in two settings; one where students used <b>clickers</b> anonymously, and one where <b>clickers</b> were used both for controlling attendance and {{as a part of}} setting the grade for the student in the course. We found pros and cons of both approaches. It seems that students are more satisfied and learn more from clickers’ activities as such when used without control, but that students that have experienced control are more positive to this and that the control as such can force them to participate more in the lectures and, by that, learn more. For both settings, we noted positive attitudes towards <b>clickers,</b> indicating that the use of <b>clickers</b> makes students more positive to the course and its content, irrespective of if <b>clickers</b> are used for control or not.

Students in both courses had positive opinions of the <b>clickers,</b> although we observed some interesting {{differences between the two}} groups of students. Student performance was significantly higher on exam questions covering material taught with <b>clickers,</b> although the differences were more dramatic for the nonmajors biology course than the genetics course. We also compared retention of information 4 mo after the course ended, and we saw increased retention of material taught with <b>clickers</b> for the nonmajors course, but not for the genetics course.

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of {{integrating}} student response technology by Turning Point 2008 ©, simply referred to as <b>clickers,</b> into pre-service science and mathematics and education courses at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), Australia. Many of the pre-service teachers have weak backgrounds in science and mathematics and lack confidence or interest in these subjects. This study investigated the use of <b>clickers</b> as a means of engaging students with science and mathematics classes and enhancing their learning outcomes. The effect of two different pedagogical uses of <b>clickers</b> on students’ perceptions was also explored. In the science education classes, <b>clickers</b> were used as tool to identify prior knowledge and prompt discussion, whereas in the mathematics education classes, the <b>clickers</b> were used at the end of lectures to check that learning had occurred. Surveys were conducted in the science and mathematics classes using measures of students’ perception of <b>clickers</b> and their contribution to overall learning. Although analyses of these data revealed positive student support for the use of <b>clickers</b> in enhancing student engagement and learning in both science and mathematics classes, students’ responses in the science education classes were far more positive. Further, the impact of the approach used in science education on pre-service teachers’ science teaching self-efficacy was evaluated.
