40|$|Purpose – Examine how UK {{companies}} {{account for}} carbon emission allowances under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Design/Method – Annual reports of UK companies are analysed {{to gather information}} about their practices in recognising and measuring carbon emission allowances under the EU ETS when allowances are received for free, purchased, used and surrendered. Also to ascertain where {{and what kind of}} information they disclose about emissions and allowances and the form of disclosure. Findings/Conclusion – Only one quarter of the UK companies analysed disclose their accounting practices regarding accounting for carbon allowances. Most companies recognise allowances received for free and purchased at cost as intangible assets with a corresponding credit entry either to cash or to a provisional liability. Companies are reluctant to disclose their practices regarding revaluation, amortisation and impairment of these intangible assets. When <b>companies</b> <b>emit</b> emissions, a cost is recognised in the income statement and a provisional liability recognised. For surrendered carbon allowances, most companies recognise a provisional liability with the corresponding credit entry to intangible asset. Companies that do disclose their accounting practices for carbon allowances are publicly listed and are in Steel, Cement and Bricks sectors. Most companies disclose their accounting practices in their accounting policy notes in their annual reports. Practical implications – Provides useful information to standard setters and policy makers in developing a comprehensive standard and guidance in how to account for these allowances. Findings could also be useful to other companies searching for guidance about this issue. Double entries for the accounting of allowances during different stages could also be useful for including the topic in accounting textbooks. Originality/value: Provides evidence of how UK companies account for carbon emission allowances during different stages. Provides a comprehensive table where accounts to be debited and credited in the same journal for different stages, can be seen in one glance. This table could be useful to the tertiary accounting education industry for inclusion in textbooks and accounting curriculum...|$|E

5000|$|The UK ETS was a {{voluntary}} cap-and-trade scheme where participants were allocated an allowance of emissions, which included other GHGs {{as well as}} carbon, and if a participating <b>company</b> <b>emitted</b> less than their cap for that year they could trade the remaining allowances. It has now closed to new participants but allowances are still traded. While this may appear as recourse to the market to effectively govern carbon emissions, the fact remains “in order to govern through markets, governments must first create those markets through the exercise of a hierarchical authority”. The UK ETS {{was created by the}} Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the then responsible government department, and it was the government’s ambitious emissions reduction target that “spurred the UK to innovate with” [...] this particular instrument. The Trading Registry for emissions is also run through DECC, exemplifying the government’s centralisation of the process and while it was left to businesses to decide how to manage their carbon emissions, and the market to decide the price, it was the governments desire to reach emissions targets and “reduce (the) economic cost” of doing so that was being represented.|$|R

50|$|Companies {{are allowed}} to exempt {{themselves}} from the tax by participating in a Swiss cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme where they voluntarily commit to legally binding targets to reduce their CO2 emissions. Under this scheme, emission allowances are given to companies for free, and each year emission allowances equal {{to the amount of}} CO2 emitted must be surrendered by the company. Companies {{are allowed to}} sell or trade excess permits. However, should a company fail to surrender the correct amount of allowances, they must pay the CO2 tax retroactively for each tonne of CO2 emitted since the exemption was granted. About 400 companies take part in trading CO2 emission credits under this program. In 2009, {{for the second year in}} a row, the companies returned enough credits to the Swiss government to cover their CO2 emissions for the year. The 2009 report shows that <b>companies</b> <b>emitted</b> only about 2.6 million tonnes of CO2, falling well below the total permissible quantity of 3.1 million tonnes. The Swiss carbon market still remains fairly small, with few emissions permits being traded. Swiss domestic law tends to favor the use of a CO2 tax to achieve emissions reductions and this preference for taxes combined with an immature carbon market could partially explain why Switzerland has not yet joined the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS).|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the impacts environmentally certified office space in Sweden might have on office employees’ assessed health, productivity and image and also to reflect if any positive effects justify a higher rent level. The empirical part of the study implements a quantitative method consisting of twelve questions in a survey. These questions were distributed by e-mail to contact persons of companies working in LEEDcertified office buildings. 84 office workers from at least four different companies responded to the survey. The chapter frame of reference contains material which will not be subject to the empirical survey but that is still deemed necessary for the context of the study and when fulfilling the purpose. The theory chapter covers previous work in the area and represents the bank of information which is to be analyzed against our empirical results.

After those allowances are used, no more can be issued. The Acid Rain Retirement Fund raises money and bids alongside polluters in the annual auctions for as many allowances as their funds can buy. But instead of using or trading them, A.R.R.F. retires them permanently, taking allowances off the market and keeping sulfur dioxide out of the air.

Corporate mercury {{reporting}} in Pollution Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) is compulsory in some countries but disclosure in companies’ annual or sustainability reports is not mandatory. Therefore, mercury disclosure in these reports differs among the companies. This paper aims to identify the current quality of corporate mercury reporting and propose best practice mercury disclosure by analyzing the current disclosure practices of the largest mercury <b>emitting</b> <b>companies.</b> Major corporate mercury emitters were identified from Pollution Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) of the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK and the EU. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify and analyse the contents of 2013 mercury disclosures in the annual report, sustainability report, environmental performance report, or company website. Few companies disclosed mercury information. For disclosing companies the volume and dimensions of mercury disclosure significantly differed. Major dimensions of mercury disclosures include: extent of mercury emissions, sources of emissions, variation in emissions and its reasons, health safety and mercury impacts, mercury control, technologies for mercury reduction, mercury monitoring, and management.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{implementation}} of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in the Czech Republic. Trading in CO 2 emission allowances {{is one of the most}} dynamic and progressive economic instruments of environmental policy. Since coming into force in January 2005, the system has incorporated into company decision making a truly new phenomenon – the price of carbon in the form of allowances tradable on the European market, where the price of the allowance represents the costs of a <b>company</b> when <b>emitting</b> one ton of CO 2. The incentive, given by the opportunity costs should motivate operators of installations emitting CO 2 to analyze options for carbon emission reduction and to behave rationally. In total, the system should result in a quite significant reduction in the compliance costs of CO 2 reduction when compared to alternatives such as taxes or emission limits, as a result of flexibility given by the market. The most controversial and sensitive part of the system is the initial distribution of the allowances to emitters. The so-called National Allocation Plan has to provide answers to very difficult questions – to whom, how and how many allowances will be given.

It intends to give companies a real incentive to lower emissions while fostering technology that makes the job easier. The plan only covers the largest companies that produce 70% of Alberta's emissions. There are concerns that this is a serious omission because the smallest energy producers are often the most casual about emissions and pollution. The carbon tax is currently $20 per tonne. Because Alberta has the highest greenhouse gas emissions in Canada the majority of Albertans are strongly opposed to a nationwide carbon tax. There is a fear that a nationwide carbon tax would cause Alberta's economy to suffer significantly more in proportion to other provinces. Alberta is also opposed to a Cap and Trade system it fears the trades will pull revenue out of the province, a fear not to be dismissed. Alberta's local carbon price allows the money to stay within Alberta.|$|R

Another objective of this project is to quantify errors in emission inventories. It is widely acknowledged that there are certain amount of uncertainty in emission inventories but it is not well known what type of errors and how much of errors reside in them. Thus during quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) work, errors in emission inventories are categorized and quantified. Common errors that were found in this study include using revoked emission factors or assigning wrong source classification codes to the emission processes. Other errors were due to the limitation of the paper survey. For example, sometimes relations between emission processes and their corresponding emission estimates are unclearly defined.

40|$|Reduction {{of carbon}} {{emissions}} is {{of paramount importance}} in the context of global warming. Countries and global companies are now engaged in understanding systematic ways of achieving well defined emission targets. In fact, carbon credits have become significant and strategic instruments of finance for countries and global companies.

We address this challenge {{in the context of a}} global company which is faced with the challenge of determining an allocation of carbon credit caps among its divisions in a cost effective way. The problem is formulated as a reverse auction problem where the company plays the role of a buyer or carbon planning authority and the different divisions within the <b>company</b> are the <b>emitting</b> agents that specify cost curves for carbon credit reductions. Two natural variants of the problem: (a) with unlimited budget and (b) with limited budget are considered.

40|$|The causal {{relationship}} between atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and global temperature is well es-tablished, but {{the degree of}} sensitivity of future temperature rise to both existing levels of CO 2 and continued carbon emissions is still subject to {{a high degree of}} uncertainty. Governments have responded to the future threat of further global warming on economic growth by proposing a variety of carbon emission mitigation approaches such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax mechanisms. Yet, such approaches have two central weaknesses: 1) they are targeted at the wrong variable, C 02 concentration rather than temperature, and 2) by their very design they create incentives for high carbon emitters to circumvent the regulatory systems established and become free riders on those pursing aggressive mitigation policies. Building on the sea level climate derivative concept proposed by Bloch, Annan and Bowles, the authors propose a new range of Climate Derivatives such as Climate Coupon Bond and Climate EOption whose pay-offs are dependent on global temperature rise. The Climate Derivatives would create both a vehicle and an incentive for high carbon <b>emitting</b> <b>companies,</b> industries and countries to help finance new tech-nologies and industries that will reduce carbon emissions in the future. Moreover, the instruments would dynamically reflect and incorporate any new information that helps predict the path of temperature rise through time and, in effect, would put a price on the probabilities associated with a variety of climate change scenarios...|$|R
40|$|International audienceComposite {{stamping}} is a {{two steps}} process that includes an infrared heating oven {{in order to}} melt the composite sheets before forming. This study deals with the numerical simulation of the heating step of the process. The numerical model has been validated using three woven glass and carbon / PA 6. 6 composites provided by Solvay Rhodia. This type of simulation consists in solving the heat equation with a radiative flux that characterizes {{the interaction of the}} material with the IR heating. The model thus considers the IR properties of the material (emission and reflexion). Considering a homogeneous composite, the optical and thermal properties of sheets have been first measured. The material’s emissivity has been measured using a FTIR spectrometer from the reflective and transmitive spectra, by using the Kirchoff law and considering a Lambertian material. Three complementary measurement techniques were used to determine the thermal properties of the composites. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements have been performed to identify the heat capacity of the composites. On another hand, a hot disc system (measurements performed at the LTN, France) has been used in transient conditions to determine the heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the composites is all three directions. Finally, the in-plane thermal matrix of conductivity has also been measured by thermography by using an inverse method. The simulation of composites heating has been performed with Comsol MultiphysicsTM and the simulation procedure was validated by comparison with experimental results. The simulated IR oven is composed of 9 IR emittors provided by Toshiba Lighting <b>Company</b> that <b>emit</b> mainly in short IR wavelength (0. 75 - 2 µm). The emission properties of the tungsten filament were implemented in order to simulate the IR heating. Free convective heat transfer was also taken into account in the oven. In order to validate the model, an experimental set-up was instrumented with a calibrated IR pyrometer that measured {{the back side of the}} heated composite sheets. The experimental results confirm a low thermal gradient through composite thickness, in particular for carbon-reinforced composite. This result is consistent with the low Biot number of the composites. Moreover, experimental and simulated temperatures are in good agreement with an error lower than 15 % in the entire heating stage from room to melt temperature...|$|R
40|$|After {{years of}} highly charged {{political}} and public debate on tackling climate change, Australia started taxing carbon emissions on 1 July 2012. Under the carbon tax, Australia’s biggest carbon <b>emitting</b> <b>companies</b> {{will pay a}} fixed-price levy on their carbon emissions for three years. At {{the end of this}} period, the carbon tax will transition to an emissions trading scheme, from 1 July 2015. Healthcare services and hospitals are not directly affected by the carbon tax, as they are not among the biggest polluting companies in Australia. However, they may experience some indirect flow-on costs, in the form of higher energy prices. Though as this Policy Brief will explain, any overall increases in costs for public hospitals are likely to be minimal at most once the compensatory effects of new hospital funding arrangements are taken into account. Nonetheless, with the health sector responsible for 7 per cent of total carbon emissions from buildings in Australia,  there is significant scope for the sector to reduce its carbon footprint through greater energy efficiency measures. Of course, the health sector also has a much broader interest in the climate change debate: the impacts of climate change on human health. Climate experts now agree that the health impacts of climate change, such as the spread of infectious diseases, and illness and fatalities related to severe weather events, are significant, and pose a significant threat for the future. This Policy Brief will explore each of these issues and outline policy options and other initiatives currently in place to address them...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis various GARCH {{models for}} {{volatility}} and Value at Risk for ECX CO 2 futures contracts have been examined. This {{is of great}} importance for market participants such as CO 2 <b>emitting</b> <b>companies,</b> traders and risk managers. The first chapters of the thesis introduce the carbon market and the different futures contracts, which are later on tested. From the descriptive analysis, we found the futures contracts to be suitable for GARCH modeling, and we also found which specifications we had to include to model the returns and Value at Risk. The applied methods are different univariate and multivariate GARCH models, which have been tested based on evaluation criteria such as Akaike, Log likelihood and numbers of significant parameters. Problem for discussion: Analysis of time-varying volatility in the carbon market and timevarying binary correlation between the carbon market and other energy markets (electricity-, oil-, gas-, and coal market). There are several different CO 2 futures contacts being traded, but for this analysis we found the 2009 and 2010 EUA futures contracts to be most interesting and suitable. To find good models for volatility and Value at Risk, we compared the GARCH results with {{the results from the}} descriptive statistics of raw data. The estimation of Value at Risk is tested for each contract, with the Kupiec test. Monte Carlo simulations have also been implemented to support our findings. The datasets have been tested within the whole trading period, also after the structural break in 2006. Finally we have presented analysis of CO 2 futures contracts in bivariate portfolios with other different energy commodities. The main focus of this thesis has been to find suitable GARCH models for volatility of returns and Value at Risk...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{has been}} going {{through a series of}} political, {{economic}} and social changes since 1994. These changes have transformed it into a state that shows increased commitment to sustainable development. Although the country is considered as one of the largest developing country emitters of pollution, the South African government has recognised the need to move towards a low-carbon society. The country’s participation in international climate mitigation bodies has seen its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 34 % by 2020 and 42 % by 2025. South Africa has committed to achieve these goals provided that it receives the necessary finance, technology and support from the international community. The major objective {{of this study was to}} conduct a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of green taxes in SA and developed countries. Four countries were chosen for the analysis in this study; South Africa, China, the United States and the United Kingdom. The study depends on secondary analysis obtained from published articles, databases and websites providing research on various organisations and government bodies. From my analysis, this study observed that many developed and developing countries have already implemented environmental taxes, and many other countries are considering similar instruments. The findings of this study are that green taxes and environmental taxes in general, are intended to protect the environment. By levying higher taxes on activities and products that harm the environment, businesses are discouraged from developing industries that destroy nature. Based on the findings, this study recommends that South Africa should address the inconsistencies in its policies across various government departments. The study also recommends the need for tax policy reconsideration so as to improve the relevance of environmental and green taxes. However, the study observed that since South Africa is still hampered by the triple constraints of unemployment, poverty and inequality, and in order to address the negative impacts of carbon taxes, it needs to put in place certain mitigation agreements with high pollution <b>emitting</b> <b>companies.</b> Dissertation LLM [...] University of Pretoria, 2014 hb 2014 Mercantile Lawunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from human activities contribute to climate change. To limit {{climate change and}} its consequences, governments set ambitious targets for reduction of greenhouse gasses such as CO 2. The Netherlands aims at a 30 % reduction of greenhouse gasses compared to 1990, to be reached by the year of 2020. To reach this target, the Dutch government is {{looking for ways to}} stimulate people and companies to reduce CO 2 emissions. One such way is to create a market value for CO 2 reductions. This will probably give people and companies a direct financial incentive to reduce emissions. The European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) already realises a market value for CO 2 reductions in the Energy and Industry sectors. The non-industrial sectors do not have a regulated market value for CO 2 reductions. Creating a market value for their CO 2 emissions may aid in realising reductions in these sectors as well. Therefore this study aims to answer the question “Which options for assigning a market value to CO 2 emission reductions in the non-industrial sectors in the Netherlands show potential for future climate policy?”. Three ways for realising a market value for CO 2 reductions in the non-industrial sectors have been studied: 1) By expansion of the EU ETS, 2) By a new project-based mechanism, and 3) By a new emissions trading scheme. For each way a system design has been developed. For expansion of the ETS a design for Clustering is developed. In this design companies can organise themselves into a cluster by assigning a “trustee” that manages all their CO 2 emissions. The trustee will then take part in the EU ETS and control the {{emissions from}} all participating <b>companies.</b> Participants <b>emitting</b> less than the trustee allows them will receive a part of the profit or emission allowances. This design creates the possibility to include part of the emission in the non-industrial sectors with the EU ETS without having high administrative costs. As a project-based mechanism a design for Domestic Offset Projects is developed. Project developers with a sound plan for CO 2 reductions in the non industrial sectors can receive emission rights for (part of) the realised reductions. The emission rights have a market value and can be sold on the international market for emissions trading. The design for Domestic Offset Projects creates a market value for CO 2 reduction projects in the Dutch non-industrial sectors and brings the Netherlands closer to the CO 2 reduction target. The developed design for a new emissions trading scheme is called Compensating for Uncertainty. This design creates the possibility to compensate for the higher uncertainty of emission monitoring in the non-industrial sectors, by using exchange rates. This creates a large market for emissions trading without losing the quality of the tradable emission allowances. Each reduction beneath the emission allowance, will represent a market value. The three designs are analysed on four criteria: environmental integrity, economic effectiveness, fairness and political acceptability. The analysis indicates that out of the three designs, the design for Clustering has the highest potential for future climate policy. The design for Compensating for Uncertainty also shows a high potential but has a limited potential regarding some indicators used in the analysis. Based on the analysis it can be concluded that the design for Domestic Offset Projects shows a low potential for future climate policy. Therefore, further climate policy development should be directed on the designs for Clustering and Compensating for Uncertainty. ...|$|R
