Both concepts employ <b>flow</b> transfer among <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> located in separate {{parts of the}} aircraft {{in order to obtain}} attitude control moments in hover and low-speed flight. The results presented are from a digital computer analysis of the YJ 97 /LF 460 remote drive turbofan, although qualitative conclusions should apply to any remote fan system. The basic operating principles of the two systems are described, and their steady-state moment generating capabilities are discussed.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{assessing}} a novel annular-ducted <b>fan</b> <b>lift</b> system for VTOL aircraft through {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations. The power and lift efficiency of the <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> system in hover mode, the lift and drag in transition mode, the drag and flight speed of the aircraft in cruise mode and the pneumatic coupling of the tip turbine and jet exhaust were studied. The {{results show that the}} annular-ducted <b>fan</b> <b>lift</b> system can have higher lift efficiency compared to the rotor of the Apache helicopter; the smooth transition from vertical takeoff to cruise flight needs some extra forward thrust to overcome a low peak of drag; the aircraft with the <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> system enclosed during cruise flight theoretically may fly faster than helicopters and tiltrotors based on aerodynamic drag prediction, due to the elimination of rotor drag and compressibility effects on the rotor blade tips; and pneumatic coupling of the tip turbine and jet exhaust of a 300 m/s velocity can provide enough moment to spin the <b>lift</b> <b>fan.</b> The CFD results provide insight for future experimental study of the annular-ducted <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> VTOL aircraft...|$|R
