25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers.

40|$|Objective: Objective: Polyaxial pedicle screws are a safe, useful {{adjunct to}} transpedicular fixation. However, the large screw head size can cause soft tissue irritation, high rod positioning, and facet joint injury. However, the {{mechanical}} resistance provided by small and low profile pedicle screws is very limited. We therefore developed a novel, low profile pedicle screw using grooving and blasting treatment that {{is able to}} resist a high <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> load. Methods: We evaluated the <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> force to displacement and yield loads for seven different screw head types that differed {{with regard to their}} groove intervals {{and whether or not they}} had been blasted. Results: The rank order of screw types that had the greatest <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> force to displacement was as follows: (1) universal polyaxial, (2) low polyaxial with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting, (3) low polyaxial with blasting, (4) low polyaxial with 0. 15 mm grooves and blasting, (5) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves and blasting, (6) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves, (7) and low polyaxial. Low polyaxial screws with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting had the maximum yield load and highest <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> force to displacement of all seven polyaxial screw head systems evaluated. Conclusion: Blasting and grooving treatment of pedicle screw heads resulted in screw heads with a high yield load and <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> force relative to displacement because of increased friction.

40|$|AbstractThe {{behavior}} of multilayer elastomeric isolators employing carbon fibers as reinforcement material rather than steel has been considered. This kind of reinforcement {{is used to}} make the isolators lighter and cheaper, since carbon fibers (or Kevlar) are much more resistant per unit weight than steel. From the mechanical point of view, the main difference is that the fiber reinforcement cannot be considered rigid in extension as it is usually done for steel plates. In this paper an analytical model to analyze the <b>compression</b> and <b>bending</b> {{behavior of}} fiber-reinforced rectangular isolators is presented. The model takes into account, for the first time, both the reinforcement extensibility and the compressibility of the elastomer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study {{about the influence}} of through-thicknesstufted fibres on <b>compression</b> and <b>bending</b> properties of sandwichstructures. The tufting process aims to avoid the delamination between the skin and core in order to improve the performance of sandwichstructures, increase the interlaminar strength and damage tolerance of sandwichstructures. To evaluate the effect of tufting in sandwichstructures, an experimental study was developed which included edgewise compression and 3 P bending tests of tufted and non-tuftedsandwich panels made of carbon/epoxy and E-glass/epoxy face-sheets, PVC and polyurethane foam cores and E-glass through-thickness fibres with different tufting densities. A finite element model was formulated to evaluate the effects of tufting spacing on the sandwichperformance under three-point bending.

30|$|We {{measured}} Young's modulus, {{proportional limit}} stress, and bending strength by the <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> test {{and examined the}} applicability of the testing method by comparing it with conventional bending test methods. Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens. A compressive load was axially applied to the specimen supported with pin ends. Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point bending tests were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> tests. Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the <b>compression</b> <b>bending</b> test.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Design of shear walls is {{a complex}} procedure, {{especially}} if the {{cross section of the}} shear wall is not regular in shape. Shear walls are usually treated like cantilevers fixed at the foundation level. Normally, lift wells are designed as shear walls. The design of shear walls takes horizontal forces into account by shear and bending. Design for shear in the walls can be managed by computing the shear stress distribution over the cross-section and reinforcing appropriately. However, published literature is not available that would give the interaction of axial <b>compression</b> and <b>bending</b> moments on the section. This paper presents a methodology developed for generation of interaction diagrams for shear walls, thereby enabling a more accurate description of the capacity of the shear wall cross section under the effect of axial <b>compression</b> and lateral <b>bending...</b>|$|R
