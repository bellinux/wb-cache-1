5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change throughout the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North {{and south of the}} tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E

It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina. Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.|$|E
5|$|Traffic volumes on Highway35 vary {{considerably}} over {{the length of}} the highway, as well as over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> due to its use for recreational purposes, including snowmobiling, cottaging and camping. Along the Highway35 and Highway115 concurrency, the average daily vehicle count is above 20,000. This drops as Highway35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10,000. This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden, at which point the vehicle count drops below 5,000 and tapers off as low as 2,000 at Highway60.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a {{restricted}} free agent. Wilson {{signed a contract}} with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed Bobby Hebert. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after holding out for a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured his left knee in late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the Los Angeles Rams, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed Chris Hakel {{as a result of the}} injury. Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Ivory {{became a}} fan favourite, and {{wrestled}} sporadically in the women's division. In June of that year, {{she had three}} pinfall victories over the WWE Women's Champion, Jazz, but never received a title match opportunity. Her only pay-per-view appearance in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> was on December 14 at Armageddon, where she unsuccessfully challenged Molly Holly for the Women's Championship, after Molly grabbed her tights for leverage, and managed to capture the victory. She {{also served as a}} trainer on the third season of Tough Enough, and did broadcasting duties at WWE events. Ivory also spent eight weeks working as a trainer at WWE's then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In May of that year, she and Todd Grisham began hosting The WWE Experience, a weekly television show that recapped events from Raw and SmackDown!. On July 22, 2005, several weeks before WWE Experience ended in August 2005, WWE announced that Ivory had opted not to renew her contract with the company.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{allegedly}} remarried, {{this time}} to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, {{it is unlikely that}} the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson—undoubtedly Blind Willie—operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.|$|E

5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} {{employment}} rate and a relatively low unemployment level. The overall un{{employment rate}} is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> with lower levels {{during the summer months}} due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Hatoful Boyfriend {{begin in the}} year 2188, when the protagonist, a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird-only St. PigeoNation's Institute, starts her second year of high school. After a hectic and surreal {{freshman}} year of attendance at St. PigeoNation's, the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the only human in a school full of birds, and {{is looking forward to}} her sophomore year. The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist, and the inter-species love and hijinks—of both the mundane high school and quasi-anthropomorphic bird-specific varieties—that ensue as she draws the attention of and attempts to romance {{one of a number of}} eligible birds she comes in contact with over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west {{in the same time}} zone.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of the temple {{hierarchy}} was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies. While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists. Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the lector priest who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen. Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs. In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought asylum within the precinct, or recluses who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household. A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests, {{with tens of thousands of}} non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country. These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore {{has returned to the}} school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, {{it had been in the}} Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed {{the right side of}} his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Petre {{was awarded}} the Military Cross on 14January 1916, and was {{mentioned}} in despatches twice more over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> In May 1916 he contracted typhoid and was sent to India for recuperation. He transferred out of No.30 Squadron in December, and {{was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Order the same month. In February 1917, he was posted to France with No.15 Squadron RFC, a reconnaissance unit operating B.E.2s. Two months later his youngest brother John, a squadron commander in the Royal Naval Air Service and a Distinguished Service Cross recipient, {{was killed in a}} flying accident. Petre subsequently returned to England and took charge of No.5 Squadron AFC (also known as No.29 Squadron RFC), a training unit for Australian fighter pilots, particularly those destined for Palestine. He had hoped to command No.1 Squadron AFC in Palestine but received an adverse report concerning his leadership abilities, and the position went to Richard Williams. Petre was discharged from the AFC as a major on 31January 1918, to take a commission with the RFC. In April that year, he transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force, establishing and commanding No.75 (Home Defence) Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.|$|E
