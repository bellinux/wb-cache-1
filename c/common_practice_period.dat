5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b> Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E

25|$|Scriabin's {{first period}} is usually {{described}} as going from his earliest pieces {{up to his}} Second Symphony Op. 29. The works from the first period adhere to the romantic tradition, thus employing the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> harmonic language. However, Scriabin's voice is present from the very beginning, in this case by his fondness of the dominant function and added tone chords.|$|E

50|$|Alloying metal {{with lead}} became a <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> during the <b>period</b> and {{numerous}} hoards date to this period. In {{common with the}} continental Hallstatt culture, horse harnesses and vehicle fittings were developed and links with the late Urnfield Culture and Hallstatt early C are apparent.|$|R
25|$|The name {{suspended}} {{derives from}} an early polyphonic technique developed during the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or suspended by extending {{the duration of the}} previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the third in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called added ninth and added eleventh chords instead.|$|E
25|$|The major time {{divisions}} {{of classical music}} up to 1900 are the early music period, which includes Medieval (500–1400) and Renaissance (1400–1600) eras, and the <b>Common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1730–1820) and Romantic (1780–1910) eras. Since 1900, classical periods have been reckoned more by calendar century than by particular stylistic movements that have become fragmented and difficult to define. The 20th century calendar period (1901–2000) includes most of the early modern musical era (1890–1930), the entire high modern (mid 20th-century), and the first 25 years of the contemporary (1945 or 1975–current) or postmodern musical era (1930–current). The 21st century {{has so far been}} characterized by a continuation of the contemporary/postmodern musical era.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} era between the {{formation}} and {{the dissolution of the}} hegemony of common-practice tonality. [...] The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.|$|E

2500|$|In the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> musical style {{required}} {{preparation for}} all dissonances, followed by and then resolution to a consonance.

2500|$|Modern quartal and quintal harmony revives the {{polyphonic}} {{traditions of}} medieval Europe. Before the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> European polyphony emphasized unison intervals and octaves and also perfect fifths. From the Renaissance to 1900, Western symphonic music [...] was diatonic, emphasizing the tertian harmony of {{major and minor}} scales, keys, and chords. Much popular music, especially rock, retains diatonic harmony.|$|E
2500|$|In {{music of}} the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> cadences are divided into four types {{according}} to their harmonic progression: authentic, plagal, half, and deceptive. Typically, phrases end on authentic or half cadences, and the terms plagal and deceptive refer to motion that avoids or follows a phrase-ending cadence. Each cadence can be described using the Roman numeral system of naming chords: ...|$|E

50|$|In the Renaissance, the Gregorian melody of the Song {{was set to}} {{polyphonic}} {{music by}} various composers, a <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> during that <b>period.</b> Two of these works, both for four voices, {{can be found in}} the Cancionero de la Colombina, a Spanish manuscript from the second half of the 15th century. The text in them is an abridged version of the Song, in the Castilian language.|$|R
2500|$|This {{passage is}} often overlooked, {{because it is}} brief, and located {{at the very end}} of the introduction. It is even {{indicated}} by Caccini as a [...] "note"; an aside or addendum to the main purpose. It is important to observe, however, that the first explanation of this practice is in the context of an essay about vocal expression and intelligibility. Indeed, it was largely the aim of textual intelligibility that led to the development of this musical style, and to the music of the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Encompassing a {{wide variety}} of post-Romantic styles {{composed}} through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. Modernism (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and serial music. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 1930. Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the [...] "contemporary music" [...] composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{popular and}} jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and {{characters}} indicating their qualities. For example, a lead sheet may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. [...] In {{many types of}} music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with [...] "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval {{in relation to the}} bass. Typically, in the classical <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> a dissonant chord (chord with tension) [...] "resolves" [...] to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between [...] "tense" [...] and [...] "relaxed" [...] moments.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{subsequent}} investigation, {{the notion of}} arson was dismissed as the final determination was that the blaze started from an undetermined cause. Despite this finding, the Home had been operating without a license, had inadequate fire escapes and had no sprinkler system. In addition, there was no alarm system or evacuation plan, while some residents were locked in their rooms, a <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> of that <b>period.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Goldman {{argues that}} [...] "historically {{the use of}} the IV chord in {{harmonic}} design, and especially in cadences, exhibits some curious features. By and large, one can say that the use of IV in final cadences becomes more common in the nineteenth century {{than it was in the}} eighteenth, but that it may also be understood as a substitute for the ii chord when it precedes V. It may also be quite logically construed as an incomplete ii7 chord (lacking root)." [...] The delayed acceptance of the IV–I in final cadences is explained aesthetically by its lack of closure, caused by its position in the circle of fifths. The earlier use of IV–V–I is explained by proposing a relation between IV and ii, allowing IV to substitute for or serve as ii. However, Nattiez calls this latter argument [...] "a narrow escape: only the theory of a ii chord without a root allows Goldman to maintain that the circle of fifths is completely valid from Bach to Wagner", or the entire <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
