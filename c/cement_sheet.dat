40|$|The {{experimental}} performance {{together with}} the theoretical predictions of strains and deflections of thin fibre <b>cement</b> corrugated <b>sheets</b> are principally reported in this thesis. Existing theories of tensile behaviour of fibre reinforced cement are reviewed. Asbestos cement and alternative fibre reinforced cement technologies associated with these sheeting materials are discussed. Asbestos cement and polypropylene network reinforced cement corrugated sheeting have been tested {{under a variety of}} loading regimes and support conditions. Asbestos-free commercial products have also been tested. Finite element analyses based on the LUSAS system have been used to predict the shape of the uncracked load- deflection curves and deflection and strain profiles of various corrugated sheets with different geometrical profiles. Wetting and drying tests on uncracked asbestos cement and polypropylene network reinforced <b>cement</b> <b>sheets</b> have been carried out and a prediction made using the Lusas program of the warping stresses caused by moisture gradients. A new approach has been developed to predict the load-deflection curves and deflection profiles of semi-cracked and severely cracked polypropylene network reinforced <b>cement</b> <b>sheets</b> under various loading regimes. In this approach, cyclic loading characteristics of the tensile specimens were used to estimate the elastic moduli of the cracked composite for various numbers of cracks at two different load levels. Generally, the theoretical predictions show good agreement with the experimental results for uncracked and cracked sheets and hence the mathematical models could, with confidence, be used to assess the performance of a range of corrugated sheeting with various loading configurations...|$|R
50|$|A {{detached}} single garage {{is located}} on the northern side of the building fronting Moray Street. This structure is constructed of rendered masonry, with a hipped corrugated fibrous cement roof and paired timber garage doors.

50|$|The Majestic Theatre at 3 Factory Street Pomona, {{which was}} {{originally}} {{built as a}} social hall with attached shops in 1921, has been promoted as the oldest authentic silent movie theatre in the world, and the longest continuously operating movie theatre in Australia.

50|$|The semi-enclosed laundry area, on the {{southwest}} corner of the house, is separated from the main house by a change in floor level. The floor of the laundry area is a concrete slab on the ground. Located in the crook of the L-shape formed by the main house, it was built {{on the site of the}} original detached kitchen. It also contains a toilet and a shower and is partly enclosed with <b>cement</b> <b>sheeted</b> walls and insect screens.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} Fibre Cement Felts (FCF), which is a non-woven textile substrate acting as a conveyor belt for the manufacturing of Fibre <b>Cement</b> <b>Sheets</b> (FCS). Fibre <b>Cement</b> Felts are a valued component required in the manufacturing process of Fibre <b>Cement</b> <b>Sheets,</b> used in construction for todayâ€™s building industry. Identifying the key factors that most influence FCF will assist in {{understanding of the relationship}} between fibre diameters, carded web, and mechanical bonding. As these factors {{have an effect on the}} performance requirements and characteristics of FCF, this will ultimately impact the production of Fibre Cement Products. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the influence fibres types and parameters selected for manufacturing FCF. In addition the effects of the needling sequence, and the influence of these parameters on the final physical and performance characteristics of FCF. This research recognised that the mechanical properties of the fibre, and the manufacturing methods used both have an effect on the physical parameters and performance attributes of a FCF. These factors affect the performance requirements and characteristics of FCF for the end application for the production of FCS on a Fibre Cement Machine...|$|R
