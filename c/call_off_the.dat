5|$|McKinley {{urged his}} aides {{to break the}} news gently to Ida, and to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, {{a member of the}} operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision.|$|E

5|$|The brigade repulsed a heavy {{attack on}} the morning of 12 March, but settled into a {{relatively}} static position thereafter. On 9 May, the Garhwal Brigade was used as a second wave in the first attacks of the Battle of Aubers Ridge, without success; they saw action again on the night of 15 May, where the leading battalions met heavy resistance and Blackader was forced to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E
5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} that Britain had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> siege at the end of June.|$|E

After his {{encounter}} with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Porter and {{was informed that}} Porter did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Porter to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.|$|E

At the end of the episode, the identity of Gossip Girl is seemingly revealed to be Georgina Sparks.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
50|$|Due to Rail {{blockade}} call on 15 October 110 trains were cancelled and 68 trains were diverted by authorities. The railways operated 12 {{trains and}} Hyderabad metro trains with full police protection. Telangana protestors {{tried to have}} sit in on rail platforms or on railway tracks at various places. Police arrested thousands of protesters including 8 MPs and 4 MLAs. On 16 October public transport employees <b>called</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> strike. Within days other unions too <b>called</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> strike one after another. After 42 days, on 24 October, remaining employees unions <b>called</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> strike. M. Kodandaram said that the strike had impacted the overall thinking of the Centre towards creation of separate State and the movement will continue with other protest activities.|$|R

5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued the abandoned village {{proved that the}} Indians knew about the expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men and burn the abandoned village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march {{for the rest of the}} day, but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E
5|$|In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, {{including}} Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, {{they are}} able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Kraken, Will wants to rescue his father, and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off pretending to lure away the Dutchmans crew. Jones attacks the Pearl with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys {{all but one of the}} Pearls lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of explosives.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attack. But at 16:30, as {{the other}} brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about two miles away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 {{ships of}} the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel {{and cover the}} planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had been reluctant to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral François Rosily to go to Cádiz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon. Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived. On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making {{its way out of}} harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that they appeared to be heading to the west.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Xuân Lộc had been {{entrusted}} to the 18th ARVN Division, {{reinforced by the}} 8th Regiment of the 5th Division, the 3rd Armored Brigade, two Ranger and two artillery battalions, and the 81st Airborne Ranger Group. The week-long fighting that erupted on 8 April raged in and around Xuân Lộc and became the most significant engagement of the entire offensive. The initial attack was conducted by the 341st and 3rd North Vietnamese Divisions, which attacked headlong into the town, a tactic widely used before, hoping to quickly rout the defender. However, they had to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attack after meeting 2 weeks of heavy resistance and effective fire support which cost them dearly. The attackers were then reinforced by the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|With the 79th Infantry Regiment {{having lost}} around 50% of its {{strength}} and with ammunition and food running low (by {{the end of}} the month, they had been reduced to quarter rations), the Japanese divisional commander, Katagiri, made the decision to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attack in order to pull back from Jivevaneng and Katika and regroup on the higher ground further west around the mission. This order was passed on the morning of 24 October, and by the morning of 27 October the Japanese 20th Division's subunits had managed to regroup to the east of Sattelberg. Following this, Katagiri received orders from the 18th Army commander, General Hatazō Adachi, who delivered them personally at Sattelberg, for the 20th Division to prepare to hold the mission and to engage in offensive operations in the immediate vicinity.|$|E

5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza, which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing tightly around Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza. The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually <b>call</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
