25|$|The {{essential}} {{differences between}} a traditional cask and a keg {{are that the}} latter has a centrally located downtube and a valve that allows beer in and gas out when filling and vice versa when beer is dispensed. Also kegs have a simple <b>concave</b> <b>bottom</b> whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or centrifuging, {{or some combination of}} these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional hand pump at the bar.|$|E

Different shapes and sizes of jars were trialed for incubation of eggs and yolk-sac larvae. <b>Concaved</b> <b>bottom</b> round plastic bottles (4 L) and rectangular (3 L) plastic trays gave the best hatchability of eggs and survival of yolk-sac larvae respectively. The best stocking density was 500 eggs/larvae L- 1. Optimised flow rate into the incubation bottles and rearing trays were 2. 70 ± 0. 18 L min- 1 and 5. 40 ± 0. 14 L min- 1 respectively. Two gravel filters (15 L and 20 L) made with discarded and low cost material purified {{the water from the}} incubation containers and directed into a water recirculation system. Production efficiency of this mini hatchery was compared with a hapa breeding method. Two hapas having 10 m 3 size and 1. 6 mm mesh were positioned in an earthen pond. Each hapa was stocked with 40 GIFT broodfish at 1 : 1 female to male ratio. In Phase I of the study (60 days), eggs collected from Hapa I were placed in incubation bottles and hatchability and survival rate were determined. In parallel, free-swimming fry were collected and counted from the Hapa II at every 14 days. The study continued in the same way for Phase II (next 60 days) by interchanging the brood fish between Hapa I and Hapa II.
