6000|$|The second {{question}} which we ask concerning {{a work of}} fiction is, How far does the element of imagination enter into it? For upon the element of imagination depends, largely, our <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of fiction into novels, romances, and mere adventure stories. The divisions here are as indefinite as the border land between childhood and youth, between instinct and reason; but there are certain principles to guide us. We note, in the development of any normal child, that {{there comes a time when}} for his stories he desires knights, giants, elves, fairies, witches, magic, and marvelous adventures which have no basis in experience. He tells extraordinary tales about himself, which may be only the vague remembrances of a dream or the creations of a dawning imagination,--both of which are as real to him as any other part of life. When we say that such a child [...] "romances," [...] we give exactly the right name to it; for this sudden interest in extraordinary beings and events marks the development of the human imagination,--running riot at first, because it is not guided by reason, which is a later development,--and to satisfy this new interest the romance[212] was invented. The romance is, originally, {{a work of fiction}} in which the imagination is given full play without being limited by facts or probabilities. It deals with extraordinary events, with heroes whose powers are exaggerated, and often adds the element of superhuman or supernatural characters. It is impossible to draw the line where romance ends; but this element of excessive imagination and of impossible heroes and incidents is its distinguishing mark in every literature.|$|E

Abstract 2 ̆ 7 Engaging Indigenous Economy: A Selected Annotated Bibliography of Jon Altman’s Writings 1979 – 20142 ̆ 7 is published {{in conjunction with the}} conference ‘Engaging Indigenous economy: Debating diverse approaches’, convened at the Australian National University, 4 – 5 September 2014. The publication and conference coincide with Jon Altman’s retirement from the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR), where he was foundation director from 1990 to 2010. The {{annotated bibliography}} aims to summarise many of the themes to which Altman has dedicated his career to date, and is designed to be a navigational tool for paper presenters, conference delegates and others wishing to engage with Altman’s work. The bibliography was written in conversation with Jon Altman and is structured around the six conference themes selected by conveners Kirrily Jordan, Tim Rowse and Will Sanders to reflect Altman’s writings: comparative modern hunter–gatherer studies; economic hybridity and alternate development; employment and labour markets; land rights and native title; sustainable land-based indigenous livelihoods; and neoliberalism or the return of the guardian state? The bibliography has its basis in an earlier publication, The Hybrid Economy Topic Guide, prepared by Susie Russell as an element of the Australian Research Council Discovery project ‘Hybrid economic futures for remote Indigenous Australia: Linking poverty reduction and natural resource management’. In looking to update this topic guide in early 2014, a decision was made to considerably extend its coverage to encompass a far wider selection of Altman’s published research. Given the breadth of Altman’s research over a long career, it has not been possible to include all of his published work; however, the bibliography covers a large proportion of his written contribution. <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> according to the conference themes has required judgments, as many publications could be allocated to more than one theme.
