25|$|On November 2, 1999, Montana Power {{announced}} it was selling all of its dams and other electric power generating plants to PPL, Inc. for $1.6 billion. The sale was expected to generate $30 million in taxes {{for the state of}} Montana (although MPC said the total would be lower). Subsequently, in May 2000 PPL {{announced it}} would use small steel <b>cofferdams</b> to drain the water around the flashboards and allow their repair without lowering the level of the lake. The cost of using the <b>cofferdams</b> was $300,000. Twenty-one of the dam's 31 flashboards were replaced.|$|E

Since this section crosses the {{shallower}} portion of the bay, the foundations were constructed within sheet-pile <b>cofferdams.</b> By mid-2009, the final connection of the viaduct portion with ground level at the eastern end was being finished and the pedestrian walkway was being attached to the completed sections.|$|E
25|$|Others {{point to}} The Glückauf, another design of Colonel Swan, {{as being the}} first modern oil tanker. It adopted the best {{practices}} from previous oil tanker designs to create the prototype for all subsequent vessels of the type. It was the first dedicated steam-driven ocean-going tanker {{in the world and}} was the first ship in which oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or drums. It was also the first tanker with a horizontal bulkhead, its features included cargo valves operable from the deck, cargo main piping, a vapor line, <b>cofferdams</b> for added safety, and the ability to fill a ballast tank with seawater when empty of cargo. The ship was built in Britain and was purchased by Wilhelm Anton Riedemann, an agent for the Standard Oil Company along with several of her sister ships. After the Glückauf was lost in 1893 after being grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the sister ships.|$|E
500|$|Two large <b>cofferdams</b> were {{constructed}} for the dam, {{but they were}} parallel to the river rather than straddling its width, so drilling into the canyon walls was not required. By the end of 1935 about 1,200 workers completed the west and east <b>cofferdams.</b> The west cofferdam was [...] long, [...] thick and was constructed [...] above the bedrock. The <b>cofferdams</b> allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow {{down the center of}} the riverbed. In , once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam's new foundation. In , MWAK had begun constructing <b>cofferdams</b> above and below the channel between the east and west <b>cofferdams.</b> By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west <b>cofferdams.</b> On , 1936, the Wenatchee Daily World announced that the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{hydraulic}} filling; leaching facility; laboratory test; stability analysis; field monitor. Abstract. The hydraulic filling is {{the construction}} method of joint way in Nanjing Second Yangze Bridge. The leaching facility, drainage time and <b>cofferdam</b> stability in filling are key points in design. By laboratory test, the compaction, direct shear and permeability test of different compaction are investigated. The deformation through field monitor is carried during the <b>cofferdam</b> construction and hydraulic filling. After parameter test and stability analysis according to hydraulic filling, it is {{shown that the}} drainage ditch in base of <b>cofferdam</b> can satisfy drainage requirement, the leaching time is about half of one month. The compactness of <b>cofferdam</b> is 0. 92. The slope of <b>cofferdam</b> during construction and hydraulic filling is in stability by analysis.

In addition, the effects of excavation on the <b>cofferdam</b> and foundation slopes were also studied by using the 3 D FLAC. The calculation {{results show that the}} central core of high-pressure grouting has a prefect anti-seepage effect and therefore is able to strengthen the stability of the <b>cofferdam</b> and foundation slopes. The excavation process has only some local effects on the <b>cofferdam</b> and does not greatly affect the global stability of the <b>cofferdam.</b> Therefore, no failure takes place around slope toes.

500|$|To {{protect the}} {{construction}} site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two <b>cofferdams</b> were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river {{had not yet been}} diverted. The <b>cofferdams</b> were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was [...] high, and [...] thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained [...] of material.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} with compound steel armor. The armored deck was [...] plus [...] thick with 20mm thick slopes. The coaming was [...] thick on [...] thick teak.

500|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} by an armored deck that was [...] thick, with [...] thick sloping armor on the side. The armor {{consisted of two}} layers of steel with a single layer of Krupp steel. The Gazelle-class cruisers were also equipped with cork <b>cofferdams</b> to increase buoyancy. The conning tower had [...] thick sides, with a 20mm thick roof. The guns were protected by [...] thick shields.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{caissons}} {{finished at}} the end of March, they were filled with clay, mud, and rock. [...] Wood platforms were constructed on top of the caissons to support the cranes and derricks to be used to handle the wreck. Once the caissons were filled, water would begin to be drained from inside the <b>cofferdam.</b> Since construction of such a large, deep <b>cofferdam</b> had not been attempted before, the Corps said it would suspend draining {{from time to time to}} assess the performance of the caissons and ensure the <b>cofferdam</b> was still secure. The search for bodies, the Army said, would take precedence over anything else aboard the wreck. Filling the <b>cofferdam</b> again ("rewatering") would not occur until probably the end of December 1911.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has 49 piers of {{different}} heights, extending {{to a maximum}} water depth of 13,8 metres. Each pier rests upon concrete foundations cast on the excavated bed of the sea, inside a <b>cofferdam.</b> Some piers could be excavated and cast with the <b>cofferdam</b> empty of water, where the soil was sufficiently waterproof, but others had to be excavated and cast underwater. Steel sheet piles were driven into the bed around the <b>cofferdam.</b> The foundations were continued upwards to a level 3 metres below the water surface.|$|R
500|$|Even though Shinanos avgas {{tanks were}} {{protected}} by armor that could resist a [...] shell, the IJN attempted {{to isolate the}} tanks {{from the rest of}} the ship with a <b>cofferdam.</b> However the investigation into the loss of Taihō had revealed that her avgas tanks had sprung leaks after she was torpedoed. The resulting fumes then penetrated the <b>cofferdam</b> and exploded. Therefore, the IJN thought it prudent to fill the empty spaces between the tanks and the <b>cofferdam</b> with [...] of concrete to prevent any fumes from escaping.|$|R
500|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{is a small}} {{little space}} left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or collision. Tankers generally have <b>cofferdams</b> forward and aft of the cargo tanks, and sometimes between individual tanks. A pumpable room houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo lines. [...] Some larger tankers have two pumprooms. A pumproom generally spans the total breadth of the ship.|$|E
500|$|Armor {{protection}} for the ships was composed of Krupp steel. The main deck was [...] thick with [...] thick slopes. The forward conning tower had [...] thick sides and a [...] thick roof. The aft conning tower was given only splinter protection, with just [...] thick sides. The 21cm and 15cm gun turrets had 100mm thick sides and 30mm thick roofs. The casemate guns were also given 100mm worth of armor protection. The ships were also equipped with cork <b>cofferdams.</b>|$|E
500|$|The stern section {{seems to}} have descended almost vertically, {{probably}} rotating as it fell. Empty tanks and <b>cofferdams</b> imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the poop deck. The section landed {{with such force that}} it buried itself about [...] deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked down {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides. Debris continued to rain down across the seabed for several hours after the sinking.|$|E
2500|$|The {{foundation}} {{was laid}} in a <b>cofferdam</b> {{protected by a}} crib made from [...] timber and submerged [...] below the surface. [...] The crib was constructed upon slipways at the depot, like building a ship, then launched and towed by tugboats to the reef, where it was sunk and grounded on the site. This crib is massive: [...] and [...] high (...) [...] It created a protected pond, making a base for the <b>cofferdam,</b> a wharf, and worker's quarters. The <b>cofferdam</b> was pumped out to expose the bedrock, upon which the masonry courses were laid.|$|R

The resulting fumes then penetrated the <b>cofferdam</b> and exploded. Therefore, the IJN thought it prudent to fill the empty spaces between the tanks and the <b>cofferdam</b> with 2400 t of concrete to prevent any fumes from escaping.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cofferdam</b> is {{also used}} on {{occasion}} in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, {{when it is not}} practical to put a ship in drydock for repair or alteration. An example of such an application is certain ship lengthening operations. In some cases a ship is actually cut in two while still in the water, and a new section of ship is floated in to lengthen the ship. Torch cutting of the hull is done inside a <b>cofferdam</b> attached directly to the hull of the ship; the <b>cofferdam</b> is then detached before the hull sections are floated apart. The <b>cofferdam</b> is later replaced while the hull sections are welded together again. As expensive as this may be to accomplish, use of a drydock may be even more expensive. See also caisson.|$|R
500|$|When the <b>cofferdams</b> were {{in place}} and the {{construction}} site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, {{it was necessary to}} remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately [...] of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.|$|E
500|$|Lion was {{temporarily}} repaired at Rosyth with timber and concrete before sailing to Newcastle upon Tyne to be repaired by Palmers; the Admiralty {{did not wish}} it known that she was damaged badly enough to require repair at either Portsmouth or Devonport Dockyards lest that {{be seen as a}} sign of defeat. She was heeled 8° to starboard with four <b>cofferdams</b> in place between 9 February and 28 March to repair about [...] of bottom plating and replace five armour plates and their supporting structure. She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty's flagship, on 7 April. She had fired 243 rounds from her main guns, but had only made four hits: one each on Blücher and Derfflinger, and two on Seydlitz. In return she had been hit by the Germans sixteen times, but only suffered one man killed and twenty wounded.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any land {{transportation}} route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from Eureka, about [...] away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site. A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, powerhouse, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the <b>cofferdams</b> needed to clear the Yukon River streambed for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.|$|E

500|$|The flood rapidly {{filled the}} pool behind the Auburn <b>cofferdam</b> to capacity, as the {{diversion}} tunnel could not handle {{all the water}} pouring into the reservoir. At about 9:00 A.M. on February 18, the rising water overtopped the <b>cofferdam</b> near the right abutment, creating a waterfall that quickly eroded into the structure. Although the <b>cofferdam</b> was designed with a soft earthen plug to fail {{in a controlled manner}} if any such event were to occur, the structure eroded quicker than expected. The outflow reached [...] by noon; several hours later the maximum discharge was reached at , completely inundating the construction site and destroying almost half of the <b>cofferdam.</b> When the [...] high <b>cofferdam</b> collapsed, its backed-up water surged downstream into already-spilling Folsom Lake less than a mile downstream, deposited the dam debris and raised the lake level suddenly. Folsom Dam outflow reached , which exceeded the design capacity of levees through Sacramento, but the levees were not overtopped and severe flooding in the city was averted by a close margin. The flood events {{made it clear that the}} American River flood control system was inadequate for the flood potential of the watershed.

500|$|For decades, the THC {{had also}} been searching for the {{wreckage}} of La Belle. In 1995, the shipwreck was discovered in Matagorda Bay. Researchers excavated a [...] cast-bronze cannon from the waters, as well as musket balls, bronze straight pins, and trade beads. Large sections of the wooden hull were intact, protected from the damaging effects of warm salt water by layers of muddy sediment which [...] "essentially creat an oxygen-free time capsule". La Belle was the oldest French shipwreck discovered in the Western Hemisphere to that date. To enable the archaeologists to recover {{as many of the}} artifacts as possible, a cofferdam was constructed around the ship. The cofferdam held back the waters of the bay, allowing archaeologists to conduct the excavation as if it were on land. This was the first attempt in North America to excavate a shipwreck in dry conditions.

The bulkhead bowed in [...] but retained watertight protection of the ship's interior. However, some 600 tons of water flooded the ship. There was no dock in the Ottoman Empire large enough to service Yavuz, so temporary repairs were effected inside steel <b>cofferdams,</b> which were pumped out to create a dry work area around the damaged hull.
