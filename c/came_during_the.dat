5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod.

Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression.

5|$|After {{being dropped}} {{for the second}} half of the {{previous}} season, Harvey had even less opportunities in 1948–49. His only matches for Victoria <b>came</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Christmas period, when he played consecutive fixtures, both against Tasmania. Although the two games had first-class status, they were effectively Second XI fixtures, as the first-choice team was playing Sheffield Shield matches at the same time. Victoria only batted once in each innings and Harvey made 7 and 36 respectively. Harvey captained the team, and they dominated both matches. The Victorians took a first-innings lead of 171 in the first match, but rain interruptions ended the match with Tasmania at 1/100 in their second innings, still 71 runs in arrears. In the second match, Victoria dismissed their opponents for 65 in the first innings to take a lead of 309 runs and they went on to win by an innings and 73 runs. Having seen his previous four matches as captain end in a draw, Harvey ended his first-class career with his only victory as a leader in his final match.|$|E
