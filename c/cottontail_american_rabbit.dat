50|$|The Suriname lowland forest cottontail (Sylvilagus parentum) is a South <b>American</b> {{species of}} <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit</b> {{described}} in 2017. It is {{known from the}} lowlands of western Suriname, and was described from specimens collected by Dutch scientists in the 1980s. Its size relatively large for a South <b>American</b> <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbit.</b> The rabbit is likely already threatened due to environmental degradation in the region, and its discovery could boost conservation efforts in the area.|$|R
40|$|Francisella tularensis is {{a highly}} virulent {{bacterium}} {{that is capable of}} causing severe disease (tularemia) {{in a wide range of}} species. This organism is characterized into two distinct subspecies: tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) which vary in several crucial ways, with some type A strains having been found to be considerably more virulent in humans and laboratory animals. Cottontail rabbits have been widely implicated as a reservoir species for this subspecies; however, experimental inoculation in our laboratory revealed type A organisms to be highly virulent, resulting in 100 % mortality following challenge with 50 - 100 organisms. Inoculation of cottontail rabbits with the same number of organisms from type B strains of bacteria was found to be rarely lethal and to result in a robust humoral immune response. The objective of this study was to characterize the protection afforded by a prior challenge with type B strains against a later inoculation with a type A strain in North <b>American</b> <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Sylvilagus spp). Previous infection with a type B strain of organism was found to lengthen survival time and in some cases prevent death following inoculation with a type A 2 strain of F. tularensis. In contrast, inoculation of a type A 1 b strain was uniformly lethal in cottontail rabbits irrespective of a prior type B inoculation. These findings provide important insight about the role cottontail rabbits may play in environmental maintenance and transmission of this organism...|$|R
40|$|Chordopoxvirinae, genus Leporipoxvirus) 1 is {{a linear}} {{double-stranded}} DNA virus that specifically infects rabbits and hares. If introduced in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cunic-ulus), the virus causes the mostly fatal disease myxomatosis, {{named after the}} prominent mucinous skin lesions. 3 Affected rabbits display conjunctivitis, anorexia, listlessness, and fever. Animals may die within 2 days after onset of symptoms. In a more prolonged disease course, depression and myxomas in the eyelids, nose, lips, ears, vulva, or scrotum are observed. The edematous ears become heavy and droop. Animals usu-ally die within 1 â€“ 2 weeks due to emaciation and dyspnea. 4 In {{the course of an}} outbreak, the virulence is reduced, 6 and the disease is characterized by reduced mortality in young animals and seropositivity of all adult rabbits. 2 The European rabbit is highly susceptible, a fact that has been exploited in the deliber-ate release of MYXV strain Moses in Australia (1950) and strain Lausanne in Europe (1952) to control feral rabbits. 5, 10 Both strains were originally isolated in Brazil. 4, 10 Contrary to the fatal disease in European rabbits, MYXV only produces local fibromas in its natural host, the wild <b>American</b> <b>cottontail</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Sylvilagus spp.). 3, 10 As seen in the Australian out-break in 1950, the virus is efficiently transmitted over large distances by blood-sucking vectors, such as mosquitoes and rabbit fleas (Spilopsyllus cuniculi). 5 In Switzerland, myxomatosis is a notifiable disease, and vaccination is strictly forbidden. 11 A total of 68 cases were reported to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office from 1991 to 201...|$|R
