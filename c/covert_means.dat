5|$|After the {{assassination}} in mid-1584 of William the Silent, {{the leader of}} the Dutch revolt against Spain, English military intervention in the Low Countries was agreed in the Treaties of Nonsuch of 1585. The murder of William the Silent also reinforced fears for Queen Elizabeth's safety. Walsingham helped create the Bond of Association, the signatories of which promised to hunt down and kill anyone who conspired against Elizabeth. The Act for the Surety of the Queen's Person, passed by Parliament in March 1585, set up a legal process for trying any claimant to the throne implicated in plots against the Queen. The following month Mary, Queen of Scots, was placed in the strict custody of Sir Amias Paulet, a friend of Walsingham. At Christmas, she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley. Walsingham instructed Paulet to open, read and pass to Mary unsealed any letters that she received, and to block any potential route for clandestine correspondence. In a successful attempt to entrap her, Walsingham arranged a single exception: a <b>covert</b> <b>means</b> for Mary's letters to be smuggled in and out of Chartley in a beer keg. Mary was misled into thinking these secret letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham's agents. In July 1586, Anthony Babington wrote to Mary about an impending plot to free her and kill Elizabeth. Mary's reply was clearly encouraging and sanctioned Babington's plans. Walsingham had Babington and his associates rounded up; fourteen were executed in September 1586. In October, Mary was put on trial under the Act for the Surety of the Queen's Person in front of 36 commissioners, including Walsingham.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} covert communication over a state-dependent channel, where the transmitter has non-causal knowledge of the channel states. Here, " <b>covert</b> " <b>means</b> that {{the probability that a}} warden on the channel can detect the communication must be small. In contrast with traditional models without noncausal channel-state information at the transmitter, we show that covert communication can be possible with positive rate. We derive closed-form formulas for the maximum achievable covert communication rate (" covert capacity ") in this setting for discrete memoryless channels as well as additive white Gaussian noise channels. We also derive lower bounds on the rate of the secret key that is needed for the transmitter and the receiver to achieve the covert capacity...|$|R

Germany informed the French ambassador in Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported [...] "the manoeuvres of Moscow" [...] by supporting the Republicans.

2500|$|As {{his policy}} for eradicating {{corruption}} inside {{the government had}} included many administrative reforms, he had to face high opposition. During the reformation of the prosecution, to resolve the opposition, he suggested a TV forum. The prosecutors insisted that Roh appointed the major positions of the prosecutor's office without consulting the personnel committee, and Roh answered that [...] "The current members of the personnel committee themselves represent the old prosecution which has to be changed, {{if we do not}} change now, it would sustain the old prosecution at least few months." [...] Three months into his presidency, He commented about the opposition problem, stating [...] "I'm worrying the opposition that maybe I cannot continue the presidency while I get that much of it." [...] That comment was quoted partly by conservative media, ('I cannot continue the presidency') and Roh was beset by skepticism about his ability and experience. Roh set the tone of his administration with a number of adventurous policies, and measures to uncover and reveal the names of the descendants of Japanese collaborators.

2500|$|Douglas had praised Wilde's play Salome in the Oxford magazine, The Spirit Lamp, {{of which}} he was editor (and used as a <b>covert</b> <b>means</b> of gaining {{acceptance}} for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written Salomé in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs [...] "On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs" [...] ("One should only look in mirrors") he rendered [...] "One must not look at mirrors". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and [...] claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: [...] "For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as [...] "the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of tradecraft, covert and clandestine are not synonymous. As noted in the {{definition}} (which {{has been used by}} NATO since World War II) in a covert operation the identity of the sponsor is concealed, but in a clandestine operation, the operation itself is concealed. At least insofar as someone or something that is known to exist by at least two individuals can be [...] "concealed". Put differently, clandestine means [...] "hidden", and <b>covert</b> <b>means</b> [...] "deniable". The adversary is aware that a covert activity is happening, but theoretically and hypothetically does not know who is doing it and certainly not the sponsorship. Separating action from [...] "sponsorship" [...] is a technicality hopefully (for the [...] "sponsor") providing sufficient distance from the action so that the sponsor can claim ignorance in the event the [...] "covert" [...] plot is discovered. Clandestine activities, however, if successful, are completely unknown to the adversary, and their function, such as espionage, would be neutralized if there was any awareness of the activity. Such [...] "neutralization" [...] of the intended goal, actions or results does not grant the sponsor deniability of responsibility, blame and guilt and is not a legal, ethical or moral defense if negative consequences have resulted from the operation. Espionage is espionage {{regardless of whether or not}} the intelligence and information provided to the sponsor – friend or foe – is of benefit or use or not. Even if the information was intentionally misleading, fake or inaccurate the crime is in passing it to a foreign government.|$|E

Several steganography techniques were used to send message secretly during wars through the territories of enemies. The use of steganography dates back to ancient time where it was used by romans and ancient Egyptians [1].

Another technique was to write the secret message underneath the wax of a writing tablet. A third one is to use invisible ink to write secret messages within covert letters [2].|$|R

This reduction in glomerular filtration was related to the loss of kidney substance associated with scarring rather than to vesicoureteric reflux. The glomerular filtration rate was unrelated to the duration of bacteriuria. These findings suggest that in girls aged 4 and over neither vesicoureteric reflux nor covert bacteriuria contributes to the progression of kidney damage...|$|R

Rightful resisters are characterized by the peaceful nature of their protests, which often make use of institutionalized channels of dissent.

40|$|Abstract [...] Steganography is <b>covert</b> communication, which <b>means</b> to {{hide the}} very {{existence}} of a message from a third party. Due to growing need for security of data, image steganography is gaining popularity. The traditional image steganography algorithm is Least Significant Bit embedding, but it can be easily detected by the attackers as it embeds data sequentially in all pixels. Instead of sequentially embedding data, data can be embedded in random pixels, but it causes speckles in the image. A better approach is {{to hide the}} data in the regions like edges. An attacker has less suspicion of the presence of data bits in edges, because pixels in edges appear to be either much brighter or dimmer than their neighbors. So we present a novel technique to hide data in the edges of the image by extending the Least Significant Bit embedding algorithm. This algorithm hides data in the edge pixels and thus ensures better security against attackers...|$|R

In the military context, for which multilevel secure systems were designed, covert channels are increasingly eliminated by physical separation of interconnected single-role computers. Prior work on the remaining network covert channels has been solely based on protocol specifications.
