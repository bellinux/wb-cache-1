25|$|However, as of 2008 this {{technology}} remains too costly for many smaller libraries, and the <b>conversion</b> <b>period</b> {{has been estimated}} at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of €50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off, but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation {{to compensate for the}} reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.|$|E
2500|$|Bede's {{story of}} Cædmon, the cowherd {{who became the}} 'Father of English Poetry' {{represents}} the real heart of {{the conversion of the}} Anglo-Saxons from paganism to Christianity. Bede wrote, [...] "here was in the Monastery of this Abbess (Streonæshalch – now known as Whitby Abbey) a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven." [...] The story of Cædmon illustrates the blending of Christian and Germanic, Latin and oral tradition, monasteries and double monasteries, pre-existing customs and new learning, popular and elite, that characterizes the <b>Conversion</b> <b>period</b> of Anglo-Saxon history and culture. Cædmon does not destroy or ignore traditional Anglo-Saxon poetry. Instead, he converts it into something that helps the Church. Anglo-Saxon England finds ways to synthesize the religion of the Church with the existing [...] "northern" [...] customs and practices. Thus the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons was not just their switching from one practice to another, but making something new out of their old inheritance and their new belief and learning.|$|E

For {{a better understanding of the}} empirical results, and to improve the correct evaluation of managerial decisions, it is necessary to establish a link between accounting ratios and concrete managerial decisions. This paper analyses the relationship established between accounting turnover ratios and the period of time spent concluding and operational process. In order to achieve this purpose, not only a set of possible averages of real <b>conversion</b> <b>periods</b> are defined, but also the conditions that guarantee that accounting turnover ratios offer a good approach to them are established. In general, the conditions which enable to approach accounting turnover ratios on good terms are difficult to accept in firms operating in growing or declining markets, with seasonal demand or with long operating cycles.

40|$|Introduction: Thoracoscopy is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} the treatment of empyema. This study assesses feasibility, efficacy and safety in children. Material and methods: Clinical files of patients who underwent primary thoracoscopy for empyema between 2006 and 2014 were reviewed. Demographic, clinical and surgical data were analyzed and a comparison between the period before (period 1) and after (period 2) the learning curve was performed. Results: Ninety-one patients (53 males, 58 %) were submitted to thoracoscopy at a median age of 4 years. There were 19 conversions to thoracotomy with a steady decrease of conversion rate until 2009 (period 1) and no <b>conversions</b> thereafter (<b>period</b> 2). There was no difference in any of the analyzed parameters between patients submitted to thoracoscopy alone and those requiring <b>conversion</b> in <b>period</b> 1. Six cases (6. 6 %) needed redo-operation (five in period 2) and thoracotomy was the elected approach in four.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{in order to determine the}} effect of the mechanical properties such as maximum force at the skin rupture point, energy at the skin rupture point and the skin firmness on color maturity of tomato by supervised learning algorithms of data mining. In the present study, a total of 88 tomato samples were used, and color measurements for each tomato in 4 different equatorial regions were performed and a total of 352 color measurement units were used. In the classification processes performed according to these mechanical properties, K-Star, Random Forest and Decision Tree (C 4. 5) algorithms of data mining were utilized, and in the comparison of comprising classification models, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), Root relative squared error (RRSE) and Relative absolute error (RAE) values, which are some of the criteria of error variance, were considered to be low, while the classification accuracy rate was considered to be high. As a result of the comparison made, the classification model formed according to K-Star instance-based algorithm [MAE: 0. 004, RMSE: 0. 006, %RAE: 1. 73, %RRSE: 1. 70] has been found to be a better classifier compared to the others. With the classification made according to K-Star algorithm, the maximum force at the skin rupture point on the degree of maturity of tomato and the skin firmness were found to be green, light red, and their effects are non-significant during the color <b>conversion</b> <b>periods,</b> and found significant during other periods while the energy at the skin rupture point is only pink and has been to be significant during the color conversion stages and non-significant during other stages...|$|R
50|$|During {{the medieval}} <b>period</b> <b>conversions</b> in Christian ruled lands were often {{conducted}} by force, {{such as in}} the case of the Alhambra Decree of 1492 leading to the conversos, those converted by force, and Marranos. In Muslim lands dialogue between Jews and Christians was more equal, and Jewish apologists were able to refute Christians openly. In Christian lands those such as Hasdai Crescas (c.1340-1411) could only write refutations of Christian belief at great risk.|$|R
30|$|First, we {{compute the}} {{proportional}} increase in conversions {{due to the}} program as the ratio between the estimated effect in Period III and the counterfactual conversion rate predicted by the model. 13 As {{a share of the}} counterfactual <b>conversions</b> predicted in <b>Period</b> III, the impact of the program amounts to 92 % for young men, 86 % for older women, and 64 % for females under 30. The average effect for all the eligible groups is calculated to be 83 %. This latter figure implies that in order {{to increase the number of}} conversions by one unit, the government has also financed 1.2 conversions that would have taken place even in the absence of the program. Given that our data refer to the universe of all fixed-term contracts (started with a standard type) for workers aged 15 – 65 in Veneto, we can also compute the effect of the scheme in terms of number of contracts by multiplying the number of observations for the estimated probabilities. Among 2, 551 conversions observed in Veneto in Period III, 1, 156 of them are attributable to the program. Moreover, using the information on whether the converted contract is full or part time, we are also able to estimate the average incentive and the average cost per increased conversion. As reported in Table  2, on average, 62 % of the job-relationships subject to <b>conversion</b> in <b>Period</b> III were full-time. Assuming that all the part-times were at half of the standard working time, the average incentive was 9, 693 euros. 14 This implies that the full cost of an actual unit increase in the number of conversions with respect to the counterfactual conversion is 21, 392 euros, as it requires an expenditure of 11, 700 euros for other transformations that would have taken place even in the absence of the policy.|$|R
