40|$|The {{influence}} of the red cell <b>concentration</b> (<b>per</b> <b>cent</b> hematocrit) upon blood viscosity is well known. Some physiology texts (1) portray this relationship {{by means of a}} diagram in which rela-tive or apparent viscosity is plotted against the per cent hematocrit (Figure 1). It has been demon-strated that besides the effect of cell concentration the viscosity of blood varies both {{as a function of the}} shearing stresses developed within the fluid and the rate at which these forces are distributed be-tween the adjacent fluid elements during flow (2 - 4). The relationship or ratio of shear stress to the gradient of velocity, or shear rate, defines the viscosity of the fluid in the absolute dimensions of dyne-seconds-cm', or poise.

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} the spectral distributions of the underwater total and polarized light {{fields in the}} upper photic zone of meso-eutrophic waters (i. e., blue-green waters containing medium to high chlorophyll a <b>concentrations).</b> <b>Per</b> <b>cent</b> polarization levels during the day were always lower than 40 %, but at crepuscular times these values could increase to 67 %. A corresponding change occurred in the spectral distribution, with proportionately more shorter wavelength photons contributing to the total spectrum during crepuscular periods. Electrophysiological recordings from the optic nerve of rainbow trout subjected to light stimuli of varying polarization percentages show that the animal's threshold for detecting polarized light is between 63 and 72 %. These physiological {{findings suggest that the}} use of water-induced polarized light cues by rainbow trout and similar percomorph fish should be restricted to crepuscular time periods. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As for the chick-embryo extracts, the relative tissue growth rate increases in a direct proportion to the concentration of the extracts in the medium, and at the <b>concentration</b> of 15 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> the wandering velocity of pseudoeosinophils is better, and the duration of wandering capacity is longest as well as the regressive degeneration of cells is least; and therefore, the chick-embryo extracts at the <b>concentration</b> of 15 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> is the optimal concentration for the medium of this bone-marrow tissue culture. 2. The first diluted solution from the sediment of the chick-embryo from which extracts taken likewise affects the tissue culture almost {{in the same way as}} the chick-embryo extracts; namely, the relative tissue growth rate increases in a direct proportion to the concentration, and at the <b>concentration</b> of 20 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> the wandering velocity of pseudoeosinophils is better and also the regressive degeneration is least. Therefore, the optimal concentration in the medium of the first diluted solution from the sediment is at 20 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> 3. As for the comparative effects of the 15 % chick-embryo extracts against the 20 % diluted solution from the sediment, the former surpasses the latter in every respects, namely, in the relative tissue growth rate, the wandering velocity of pseudoeosinophils and the lowness in the appearance of regressively degenerated granules. Consequently it is thought that the 15 % chick-embryo extracts is the most suitable culture medium for the rabbit bone-marrow tissue culture by the roller-tube method...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} in a culture medium of heterogenic serum of various concentrations exerts a definite influence on the rate of multiplication of fibroblasts. Dog serum does not inhibit the growth of See PDF for Structure chicken fibroblasts markedly until its <b>concentration</b> reaches 15 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Beyond this figure, each increase of the concentration brings about a rapid decrease {{in the rate of}} cell multiplication. When the concentration reaches from 30 to 45 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> no growth takes place. The inhibiting action of cat serum begins to manifest itself at a <b>concentration</b> of 25 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and prevents cell proliferation completely at a concentration of 55 and 60 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> The ratio, See PDF for Equation can be taken as expressing the action of the serum on fibroblast multiplication; that is, as the growth index of the serum. See PDF for Structure The inhibiting influence of heterogenic serum was found to vary in direct ratio to the age of the animal from which it was obtained. The rate of proliferation of chicken fibroblasts was studied comparatively in media containing varied concentrations of serum from young and old animals. For each concentration of serum, the rate of growth in the serum of the old animal was expressed in relation to the rate of growth in the serum of the young animal. When cat serum was used, the curve obtained in plotting this ratio in ordinates and the serum concentration in abscissæ showed a rapid increase in the inhibiting action of the old serum as soon as the <b>concentration</b> reached 30 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> The same tests were repeated with the serum from young and old dogs.

It may be concluded that under the conditions of the experiments: 1. Heterogenicsera inhibit and prevent the growth of chicken fibroblasts when their concentration is made to vary within certain limits. 2. A relation exists between the rate of growth of chicken fibroblasts, the concentration of the heterogenic serum, and the age of the animal from which the serum is taken.

40|$|By {{means of}} immunofluorescent methods {{it has been}} shown that sera from {{children}} with ulcerative colitis contain antibodies which react with fetal colon cells in tissue culture. 5 out of 13 sera from patients reacted positively when tested for staining antibodies while 12 sera from healthy individuals yielded negative results. The specificity of the staining reactions was confirmed by inhibition experiments. The staining capacity of various sera was correlated to their hemagglutinating titer when tested against phenol-water extracts of human colon. The presence of blood group substances of the ABO system on fetal colon cells in tissue culture could be demonstrated by application of fluorescent H agglutinins from eel. Cross-inhibition experiments indicated that the H agglutinins stained colon antigens which were different from those reacting with the antibodies of ulcerative colitis sera. The reactivity of cultured fetal colon cells with the antibodies in ulcerative colitis sera was retained for up to 12 days, with optimal staining at 4 to 5 days. Reactivity with H agglutinins was present for a longer period, sometimes more than 20 days. Although antigen could be shown to be present on fetal colon cells in tissue culture, exposure of the culture, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, to sera from patients with ulcerative colitis did not lead to any visible cytotoxic damage. In order to investigate the possible cytotoxic effect of the sera with a more sensitive technique, freshly explanted fetal colon was dispersed by trypsinization and the cells labeled with 32 P-orthophosphate.

Aversion to CO 2 is proba-bly due to dyspnoea, an unpleasant sensation of breathlessness [3], which in humans begins at 8 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> CO 2 and becomes severe around 15 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> [5, 6]. Inhalant anaesthetics can be used to induce unconsciousness before eutha-nasia. Rats free to move between chambers spent less time in a chamber containing CO 2 than one containing an inhalant anaesthetic [7, 8]. Rats also show evidence of aversion to the inhalant anaesthetic isoflurane, but this aver-sion occurs once the animals {{are in a state of}} conscious sedation; moreover, initial exposure to isoflurane is less aversive than subsequent exposures [9]. The aim of this study was to use aversion-avoidance testing to compare rat aversion to CO 2 and isoflurane against aversion to bright light. Light is known to be aversive to albino rats [10], and this aversion can be measured using...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{effects of}} {{different}} nitrate applications were studied using the C 4 plant, Amaranthus powellii Wats. Plants were grown {{in a controlled}} environment chamber and watered daily with nutrient solutions containing 45, 10, 5, or 1 millimolar nitrate. Chloride and sulfate were used to keep the cation and phosphate concentrations constant. Total leaf nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, specific leaf mass, leaf area, relative growth rate, relative leaf growth rate, unit leaf rate (increase of dry mass per unit leaf area per day), net photosynthetic rate, and incident quantum yield decreased with decreasing nitrate <b>concentration.</b> The <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> decrease of unit leaf rate {{was similar to the}} decrease of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate; however, the decrease in relative growth rate was less than that of unit leaf rate because leaf area ratio (leaf area per unit dry mass) increased with decreasing nitrate concentration. Essential mineral <b>concentrations</b> <b>per</b> unit leaf area were about equal among all treatments. Leaf expansion, determined by stomatal density, decreased except for the 1 millimolar treatment which showed relatively more cell expansion but less cell division. Decreased nitrate application was correlated with higher osmotic potentials and lower pressure potentials (determined by pressure-volume curves), whereas leaf water potentials were equal among treatments. Even though total leaf area and shoot mass decreased with decreasing applied nitrate, the increase of the leaf area ratio may be related to selection for the highest possible growth rate...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that the {{expression}} See PDF for Equation represents very closely the relation between the volume of the solute and the viscosity of the solution. The formula has been applied to a number of experimental results and found to hold very well for as high <b>concentrations</b> as 50 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> solutions of such substances as sugars, glycogen, casein, and rubber. In the case of various sugar solutions, and also in the case of sulfur suspensions, the volume of the solute as calculated from the viscosity values agrees with the actual volume of the substance in dry state, as determined from specific gravity measurement, while in the case of caoutchouc solutions in benzene the values of ϕ as calculated from the viscosity measurements fit remarkably well in the equation for osmotic pressure...|$|R

The effect of ballistic modifiers on the burn rate and pressure exponent (11) of promisingfonnulations has also been investigated. The data generated on various parameters reveal that (i) nitraniine EDB propellants exhibit relatively superior thennal stability,' (ii) tensile strength andpercentage elongation are drastically altered if RDX <b>concentration</b> exceeds 15 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> (iii) 11 islowered significantly in the presence of ballistic modifiers, (iv) characteristic velocity (C*) values arehigher to that for the control tonnulation, and (v) temperature sensitivity of burn rate is on the lowerside (0, 20 - 0. 25 % / °C as against 0. 40 % / °C) in the presence of ballistic modifiers...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of cyclopropane as an anesthetic agent by Lucas and Henderson (1) in 1929, the question of deleterious action upon the heart had been present {{in the minds of}} most laboratory investigators and clinical anesthetists. This possibly harmful action was first suggested by Lucas and Henderson be-cause of the definitely toxic action of propylene, an isomer of cyclopropane, shown by Caine and Reynolds in 1926 (2). In an investigation by Seevers et al. (3) in 1934, it was found {{that at the time of}} or after respiratory arrest marked changes occur in the heart of dogs anesthetized with cyclopropane as shown by electrocardiographic records. They also found that when artificial respiration was instituted, the rhythm returned to normal and that the concentration of cyclopropane in the in-spired air could be further increased without the recurrence of arrhythmias until the <b>concentration</b> reached 60 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> or more. Kurtz, Bennett, and Shapiro (4) in 1936 reported their findings of an electrocardiographic study on 109 patients during surgical anesthesia produced by various anesthetic agents including cyclo-propane. Similar changes were found with each anesthetic agent, but the frequencies of the various abnormalities varied with the different anesthetics. Displacement of the pacemaker occurred in approximately 60 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the patients under ether and nitrous oxide and in 48 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the patients anesthetized with cyclopropane; ventricular extrasystoles were recorded in 55 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the patients under cyclopropane anesthesia and i...|$|R
40|$|Trials {{have been}} {{organized}} by a Medical Research Council committee {{to assess the}} effectiveness and safety for analgesia in labour of oxygen and nitrous oxide mixtures in different proportions. In a preliminary trial concentrations of 50 % and 60 % v/v nitrous oxide were compared, but, as the replies of 409 mothers revealed little difference between the two, the results of administering either 50 % or 70 % nitrous oxide to 778 mothers were then compared. The data relating to normal labour, obtained on 501 of the mothers in this main trial, showed that the relief of pain given was much the same. There was a suggestion, however, that the higher concentration of nitrous oxide might be useful in abnormal labour. The proportion of mothers with normal deliveries who lost consciousness, though very small, was significantly higher with 70 % nitrous oxide than with the lower <b>concentration.</b> Ninety-two <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> of mothers found the gas and oxygen machine helpful, and midwives reported complete or good co-operation by 77 % of those using it. It is concluded that the 50 % oxygen and 50 % nitrous oxide mixture can safely be used by unsupervised midwives...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method {{for the control}} of the concentration of the alumina in electrolysis cells for the production of aluminium. The method is based upon the well known fact that apparent resistivity of the cell {{is a function of the}} alumina concentration so that the resistivity has the lowest value around the <b>concentration</b> of three <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and increases in both directions. The method uses the cross correlation between a perturbation of the feed flow of alumina into the cell and the resulting response in measured voltage across the cell. The cross-correlation is proportional to the slope of the resistivity against concentration curve, making it possible to control the alumina flow, to achieve a desired slope. The method has much in common with other methods presently in use which require a much more complicated computation scheme...|$|R
