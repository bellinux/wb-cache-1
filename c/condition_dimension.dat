40|$|Lack of {{exercise}} {{has been linked}} to poor health issues (e. g., obesity) in American society. National (e. g., Appalachian Trail) and local trails are a potential resource for championing physical activity. To challenge sedentary lifestyle choices and promote more active ones, an understanding of the benefits perceived to be associated with physical and outdoor activities is needed. A total of 454 Appalachian Trail user surveys were collected. Validity analyses and reliability analyses showed the Benefits of Hiking Scale to be an accurate and consistent measure of the dimensions of recreation benefits. Within the improved <b>condition</b> <b>dimension</b> of Benefits, significant differences were found to exist between day hikers and section hikers (p= 0. 02), day hikers and thru-hikers (p= 0. 03), and multi-use and thru-hikers (p= 0. 04). By increasing participation in physical activities such as hiking on the AT, recreation professionals may aid in the effort to reduce health concerns directly correlated with sedentary lifestyle choices...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. This paper {{considers}} social wellbeing in {{the context}} of three dimensions; material conditions, quality of life, and sustainability dimensions to explore the key factors that affect the wellbeing of fishers in the Western Region of Ghana using 119 respondents. The study first considers descriptive analysis to assess the correlation between level of importance and satisfaction of the three dimensions of wellbeing of the fishers. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify factors under each dimensions to be included in a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to assess their effect on the wellbeing of the fishers. The results revealed that in spite of the low ranking of satisfaction with income related indicators and some social indicators, the fishers are still motivated and keen to work in the fishing subsector. Findings from the PCA revealed that all factors under the material <b>condition</b> <b>dimension,</b> five factors under quality of life dimension and two under the sustainability dimension fulfill the criteria of being included in the SEM analysis. Overall, findings from the SEM analysis demonstrate that material condition, quality of life and sustainability dimensions have positive and significant effect on the wellbeing of Ghanaian fishers in the study area for important policy interventions...|$|E

40|$|National audienceThe "academic" {{method of}} {{manufacturing}} dimensions determination through the decomposition of the manufacturing plan into several steps, each one corresponding to a part holder, is not usable when the part is produced by only one machine, like {{in the case of}} screw machining. The transfer of the <b>condition</b> <b>dimensions</b> in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the setup operator might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine. This results in introducing intermediate control steps into the manufacturing plan.

We propose using the Alkire-Foster multidimensional headcount to address this issue, and devise a simple comparison framework to measure the tension between the incidence of monetary poverty and the overall level of deprivation based on the multidimensional measure. We select six dimensions and their respective indicators for the Peruvian case, and apply this framework using data for 2004 and 2008. Results indicate that we now face a larger risk of classifying as non-poor individuals who still endure significant deprivation if we rely on the conventional monetary dimension. In addition, inter and intraregional comparisons show that deprivations endured by the multidimensional poor are similar across regions and concentrated on the health and dwelling <b>conditions</b> <b>dimensions,</b> in particular, on the lack of adequate water and sanitation services.
