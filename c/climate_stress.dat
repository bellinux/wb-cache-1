30|$|This {{study has}} shown that female-headed {{households}}, households with experience of less than 5  years in the area, household heads with no primary level of education and households headed by divorced and widowed persons, with no access to extension services and early warning information, in particular, are disproportionately likely {{to be affected by}} <b>climate</b> <b>stresses</b> and variability. In times of <b>climate</b> <b>stresses</b> and shocks like drought, these categories of households tend to have fewer options to find other ways of making a living, because their very low levels of literacy reduce their opportunities in coping mechanisms such as wage employment. Similarly, female or divorced and widowed household heads are likely not to be empowered enough in pastoral communities to make household decisions (Nabikolo et al. [2012]) and are frequently without access to credit services and adequate capital assets or not able to own large herds to manage households’ daily requirements. Similar observations have been made by Kakota et al. ([2011]) in Malawi and Tesso et al. ([2012]) in Ethiopia that widowed or divorced household heads are more vulnerable because they rely on income earned by either the father or mother as the bread winners. These findings make a strong case for continuous targeting of pastoralist women in resilience-building interventions in the rangelands.|$|R

40|$|For {{farmers in}} rural Africa, climate change could {{significantly}} alter the natural environment, {{leading to a}} loss of income, food security and well-being; however, much remains unknown about the way a change in climate may affect a person's decision to migrate away from their home. Using a framework based on migration aspirations and capabilities, this paper examines how <b>climate</b> <b>stresses</b> (such as droughts that cause a long-term decline in harvests) and climate shocks (i. e. acute food shortages and sudden flooding) may affect migration decision-making in rural Malawi. Drawing on survey (n[*]=[*] 255), interview (n[*]=[*] 75) and focus group (n[*]=[*] 93) data from rural and urban dwellers, we find that <b>climate</b> <b>stresses</b> typically do not change rural dwellers’ aspiration to leave their homes, except for a small group of younger farmers from better-off households. However, these same stresses may erode human, financial and social capital, thus reducing migration capability. Data also reveal that acute shocks erode both the migration aspirations and capabilities of even the most dedicated would-be migrant. Drawing from these two findings, this paper concludes that climate change is likely to increase barriers to migration rather than increasing migration flows in countries like Malawi where the economy is still predominately rural...|$|R

Methods Prospective study of a large cohort of doctors. The participants were first studied when they applied to any of five UK medical schools in 1990. Postal questionnaires were sent to all doctors with a traceable address on the current or a previous Medical Register. The current questionnaire included measures of Approaches to Work, Workplace <b>Climate,</b> <b>stress</b> (General Health Questionnaire), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), and satisfaction with medicine as a career and personality (Big Five). Previous questionnaires had included measures of learning style (Study Process Questionnaire) and personality. Results Doctors' approaches to work were predicted by study habits and learning styles, both at application to medical school and in the final year. How doctors perceive their workplace climate and workload is predicted both by approaches to work and by measures of stress, burnout and satisfaction with medicine. These characteristics are partially predicted by trait measures of personality taken five years earlier. Stress, burnout and satisfaction also correlate with trait measures of personality taken five years earlier. Conclusions Differences in approach to work and perceived workplace climate seem mainly to reflect stable, long-term individual differences in doctors themselves, reflected in measures of personality and learning style. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{summarise}} {{the work}} of an interdisciplinary network set up to explore the impacts of climate change in the British Uplands. In this CR Special, the contributors present the state of knowledge and this introduction synthesises this knowledge and derives implications for decision makers. The Uplands are valued semi-natural habitats, providing ecosystem services that have historically been taken for granted. For example, peat soils, which are mostly found in the Uplands, contain around 50 % of the terrestrial carbon in the UK. Land management continues to be a driver of ecosystem service delivery. Degraded and managed peatlands are subject to erosion and carbon loss with negative impacts on biodiversity, carbon storage and water quality. Climate change is already being experienced in British Uplands and is likely to exacerbate these pressures. Climate envelope models suggest as much as 50 % of British Uplands and peatlands will be exposed to <b>climate</b> <b>stress</b> {{by the end of the}} 21 st century under low and high emissions scenarios. However, process-based models of the response of organic soils to this <b>climate</b> <b>stress</b> do not give a consistent indication of what this will mean for soil carbon: results range from a very slight increase in uptake, through a clear decline, to a net carbon loss. Preserving existing peat stocks is an important climate mitigation strategy, even if new peat stops forming. Preserving upland vegetation cover is a key win-win management strategy that will reduce erosion and loss of soil carbon, and protect a variety of services such as the continued delivery of a high quality water resource. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Corn growth {{conditions}} and yield are closely dependent on climate variability. Leaf growth, measured as the leaf area index, {{can be used}} to identify changes in crop growth in response to <b>climate</b> <b>stress.</b> This research was conducted to capture patterns of spatial and temporal corn leaf growth under <b>climate</b> <b>stress</b> for the St. Joseph River watershed, in northeastern Indiana. Leaf growth is represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) retrieved from multiple years (2000 – 2010) of Landsat 5 TM images. By comparing NDVI values for individual image dates with the derived normal curve, the response of crop growth to environmental factors is quantified as NDVI residuals. Regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between yield and NDVI residual during the pre-silking period, indicating that NDVI residuals reflect crop stress in the early growing period that impacts yield. Both the mean NDVI residuals and the percentage of image pixels where corn was under stress (risky pixel rate) are significantly correlated with water stress. Dry weather is prone to hamper potential crop growth, with stress affecting most of the observed corn pixels in the area. Oversupply of rainfall {{at the end of the}} growing season was not found to have a measurable effect on crop growth, while above normal precipitation earlier in the growing season reduces the risk of yield loss at the watershed scale. The spatial extent of stress is much lower when precipitation is above normal than under dry conditions, masking the impact of small areas of yield loss at the watershed scale...|$|E

In this study the tillage-induced compaction is discussed {{as an indicator of}} <b>climate</b> <b>stress</b> on arable fields. The research is based on soil condition monitoring and measuring that was started 32 years ago and on short and long-term experiments assessing the compaction impacts on the crops. The survey comprised 1870 monitoring places and 38 experimental plots. The following points were chosen for monitoring: 1. Root zone state (to a depth of 0 - 50 cm). 2. Occurrence of compacted layer (indicating the risk). 3. Extension of the compacted layer (indicating the degree of damage). 4. Long term effects of tillage (deterioration or improvement). 5. Tillage-induced drought and water-logging damage impacts on yield loss. The formation and location of compaction provided information concerning the depth, the method and the type of tillage applied, along with the expected risk for crop production under extreme climate conditions. The main objectives of the study are: 1. Occurrence and the extent of tillage-pan compaction in soils. 2. Consequences on water management in each of the years covered by the experiments. 3.

30|$|This study {{draws upon}} the {{long-term}} disturbance experiment of Paracou, French Guiana, {{to develop a}} modeling approach in order to mechanistically link the endo- and exogenous ecosystem drivers to the ecosystem recovery trajectory after disturbance. More specifically, we ask the following questions: (i) Do regenerating forests recover faster than mature forests given {{the same level of}} disturbance? (ii) Is the local topography an important predictor of the forest recovery rates? (iii) Is the community functional composition, assessed with community weighted-mean functional traits, a good predictor of carbon stock recovery? (iv) How important is the <b>climate</b> <b>stress</b> (drought and/or soil water saturation) to shape the rate of carbon recovery? To do so, we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS (Aboveground Carbon Stock) gain (from growth and recruitment of trees sup 10 cm DBH) and ACS loss (from mortality) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery after disturbance. We model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes (Piponiot et al. 2016 b) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework. We then quantify the effect of (i) endogeneous (forest structure and composition) and (ii) exogeneous (local environment and <b>climate</b> <b>stress)</b> drivers on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state. Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation, an indicator of the ecosystem recovery rate. Disentangling ACS recovery with a demographic process-based approach, i.e. by segregating ACS changes into cohorts (survivors and recruits) and demographic processes (growth, recruitment, mortality), as opposed to an all-in-one model in which only the ecosystem net ACS change is modeled without examination of demographic processes, {{has been shown to be}} essential to reveal mechanisms underlying ACS responses to disturbance and to make more robust predictions of ACS recovery (Piponiot et al. 2016 b).|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} is widely promoted across sub-Saharan Africa as a sustainable farming practice that enhances adaptive capacity to climate change. The interactions between <b>climate</b> <b>stress,</b> management, and soil {{are critical to}} understanding the adaptive capacity of conservation agriculture. Yet conservation agriculture syntheses to date have largely neglected climate, especially the effects of extreme heat. For the sub-tropics and tropics, we use meta-regression, in combination with global soil and climate datasets, to test four hypotheses: (1) that relative yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought and temperature stress; (2) {{that the effects of}} moisture and temperature stress exposure interact; (3) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress are modified by soil texture; and (4) that crop diversification, fertilizer application rate, or the time since no-till implementation will enhance conservation agriculture performance under <b>climate</b> <b>stress.</b> Our results support the hypothesis that the relative maize yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought severity or exposure to high temperatures. Further, there is an interaction of moisture and heat stress on conservation agriculture performance and their combined effect is both non-additive and modified by soil clay content, supporting our second and third hypotheses. Finally, we found only limited support for our fourth hypothesis as (1) increasing nitrogen application rates did not improve the relative performance of conservation agriculture under high heat stress; (2) crop diversification did not notably improve conservation agriculture performance, but did increase its stability with heat stress; and (3) a statistically robust effect of the time since no-till implementation was not evident.
