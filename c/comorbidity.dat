5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and <b>comorbidity</b> of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; <b>comorbidity</b> of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

We therefore aimed to determine the impact of <b>comorbidities,</b> as individual and as whole, on survival in IPF. The database of a tertiary referral centre for interstitial lung diseases was reviewed for <b>comorbidities,</b> their treatments, their frequency and survival in IPF patients. 272 patients were identified of which 12 % had no, 58 % 1 - 3 and 30 % 4 - 7 <b>comorbidities,</b> mainly cardiovascular, pulmonary and oncologic <b>comorbidities.</b> Median survival according to the frequency of <b>comorbidities</b> differed significantly with 66 months for patients without <b>comorbidities,</b> 48 months when 1 - 3 <b>comorbidities</b> were reported and 35 months when 4 - 7 <b>comorbidities</b> were prevalent (p = 0. 004). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses identified other cardiac diseases and lung cancer as significant predictors of death, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and diastolic dysfunction had a significant positive impact on survival. A significant impact of <b>comorbidities</b> associated therapies on survival was not discovered. This included the use of proton pump inhibitors at baseline, which {{was not associated with}} a survival benefit (p = 0. 718). We also established a predictive tool for highly prevalent <b>comorbidities,</b> termed IPF comorbidome which demonstrates a new relationship of IPF and <b>comorbidities.</b> <b>Comorbidities</b> are frequent in IPF patients.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) symptoms and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes [inattentive (ADHD-I) and combined (ADHD-C) ] with or without <b>comorbidities.</b> Overall, 116 ADHD children were interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess ADHD subtypes and <b>comorbidities,</b> and were then divided into four groups according to their subtypes and <b>comorbidities.</b> The CBCL was completed by {{the parents of the}} ADHD children. The association between behavioral symptom severity and groups was examined by comparing the CBCL scales of the four groups. The scores for the Aggressive Behavior (p = 0. 014) and Anxiety/Depression scales (p = 0. 033) were higher in patients with ADHD-I with <b>comorbidities</b> than with ADHD-I without <b>comorbidities.</b> In addition, the score for the Aggressive Behavior scale was higher in patients with ADHD-C without <b>comorbidities</b> than in patients with ADHD-I without <b>comorbidities</b> (p = 0. 011).

40|$|Background: Increased risk of some <b>comorbidities</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in spondyloarthritis (SpA). Recommendations for detection/management of some of these <b>comorbidities</b> have been proposed, and it is known that a gap exists between these and their implementation in practice. Objective: To evaluate (1) the prevalence of <b>comorbidities</b> and risk factors in different countries worldwide, (2) the gap between available recommendations and daily practice for management of these <b>comorbidities</b> and (3) the prevalence of previously unknown risk factors detected {{as a result of the}} present initiative. Methods: Cross-sectional international study with 22 participating countries (from four continents), including 3984 patients with SpA according to the rheumatologist. Statistical analysis: The prevalence of <b>comorbidities</b> (cardiovascular, infection, cancer, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal) and risk factors; percentage of patients optimally monitored for <b>comorbidities</b> according to available recommendations and percentage of patients for whom a risk factor was detected due to this study. Results: The most frequent <b>comorbidities</b> were osteoporosis (13 %) and gastroduodenal ulcer (11 %). The most frequent risk factors were hypertension (34 %), smoking (29 %) and hypercholesterolaemia (27 %). Substantial intercountry variability was observed for screening of <b>comorbidities</b> (eg, for LDL cholesterol measurement: from 8 % (Taiwan) to 98 % (Germany)). Systematic evaluation (eg, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol) during this study unveiled previously unknown risk factors (eg, elevated BP (14 %)), emphasising the suboptimal monitoring of <b>comorbidities.</b> Conclusions: A high prevalence of <b>comorbidities</b> in SpA has been shown.

40|$|International audienceBy 2020, chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{will be the}} third cause of mortality. Extrapulmonary <b>comorbidities</b> influence the prognosis of patients with COPD. Tobacco smoking is a common risk factor for many <b>comorbidities,</b> including coronary heart disease, heart failure and lung cancer. <b>Comorbidities</b> such as pulmonary artery disease and malnutrition are directly caused by COPD, whereas others, such as systemic venous thromboembolism, anxiety, depression, osteoporosis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, sleep disturbance and anaemia, have no evident physiopathological relationship with COPD. The common ground between most of these extrapulmonary manifestations is chronic systemic inflammation. All of these diseases potentiate the morbidity of COPD, leading to increased hospitalisations and healthcare costs.

We illustrated the algorithm with 1, 789 laryngeal cancer patients diagnosed in England in 2013. We aimed to clearly set out and advocate the time-related assumptions specified in the algorithm by providing empirical evidence for them. <b>Comorbidities</b> were assessed from hospital records in the ten years preceding cancer diagnosis and internal reliability of the hospital records was checked. Data were right-truncated 6 or 12 months prior to cancer diagnosis to avoid inclusion of potentially cancer-related <b>comorbidities.</b> We tested for collider bias using Cox regression. Our administrative data showed weak to moderate internal reliability to identify <b>comorbidities</b> (ICC ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 6) but a notably high external validity (86. 3 %).

Methods A retrospective case 2 ̆ 013 control study was conducted on information of 1460 patients (292 BPD patients and 1168 control patients) selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Information on physical and psychiatric <b>comorbidities,</b> which were diagnosed within 30 years before and after enrollment, was collected. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratios of <b>comorbidities</b> between patients with and without BPD. ARM technique was used to study the associations of BPD and two or more psychiatric <b>comorbidities.</b> Results We classified physical <b>comorbidities</b> into 13 categories according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification system, and the results indicated that the 12 categories were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients (except congenital anomalies). However, psychiatric <b>comorbidities,</b> including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, and mental retardation were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients. Furthermore, the associations of BPD and two or more <b>comorbidities</b> were evaluated. Conclusion Most physical and psychiatric disorders were more common in the BPD patients than in the control patients.
