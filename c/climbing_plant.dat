Inspite of their importance, <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> are often neglected. This research was aimed to describe the characteristics of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> communities in three different ecosystems in Rambut Island Wildlife Reserve (RIWR). <b>Climbing</b> <b>plants</b> inventory in dryland, beach and ecotone forest were done by combining transect and quadrat method. The plots made in each ecosystem were 53, 27 and 85 respectively. A total of 37 <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> species consisted of 19 families were identifed and their contribution to species richness in RIWR reached 25, 7 %. The <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> found in dryland, coastal and ecotone forest were 27 species (17 families), 23 species (16 families) dan 16 species (12 families) respectively. The species richness of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> in all ecosystem were low, but the dryland forest was the richest due to the more fertile soils and vegetation structure complexity. In general, the species diversity and evenness in all ecosystem were low because of certain species domination. Dioscorea bulbifera was dominant in dryland and beach forest while Ipomoea violacea was dominant in ecotone forest. The domination of D. bulbifera influenced the similarity of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> communities among ecosystem.
