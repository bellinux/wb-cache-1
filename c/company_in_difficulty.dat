5000|$|Poor {{financial}} operations and the Barcelona fire of 1855 put the <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Boisselot retired {{that same year}} and passed the management of his factories over to his nephew, Franz Boisselot (1845-1902), whose godfather was Franz Liszt, and who completely restored his business to a prosperous situation, delivering 600 to 800 pianos per year, being {{that a large number}} was destined for the export market. In 1867, he was appointed inspector-general of music schools and music theaters in Marseille.

5000|$|In most jurisdictions, a {{floating}} charge is only {{vulnerable to the}} extent that it does not secure new money for the company. [...] So if, for example, a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an [...] "all-monies" [...] floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a security interest which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> from the unsecured creditors. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.|$|E

40|$|Overview Legislation {{governing}} {{the process of}} Examinership was introduced by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990. The current economic climate has left many companies facing extreme difficulties meeting financial obligations and {{has led to the}} doubling of the number of companies applying for Examinership. Grant Examinership assists the survival of a company by making arrangements to reduce creditor balances and protecting the intangible assets of the company. It explores all opportunities to provide for a company’s survival, while control is retained by the Directors. Brain Foley has described Examinership “as the process by which a company is placed under the protection of the court for a period of time, during which claims and debts against it are for the most part, frozen”. Purpose Previous research presented the topic of successful Examinerships solely on a quantitative basis, the current research aims to view Examinership in entirety and provide qualitative explanations on the process with particular focus on the appointment, role and success of Examinerships in Ireland. This will close the gap in the literature which exists at present. Findings There are no definite steps to success as each <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> is different in many ways and therefore should be addressed in a manner suitable to their needs The success of the process should not be viewed on overall statistics alone but on the merits of each case which has survived to confirm the success of the process in Ireland. Importance The process of Examinership is a very powerful restructuring tool, the outcome of the process offered is undoubtedly better than the outcome offered by Liquidation or Receivership. If the results of this research are used in an educational manner then there will be more awareness of this corporate rescue plan...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} financial distress on the investment behavior of companies. The analysis includes companies from Germany, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, UK and USA, which cover {{a wide spectrum of}} different institutional environments. The methodology used is panel data estimation using the Generalized Method of Moments (System-GMM), thereby allowing control of both unobservable heterogeneity and the problems of endogeneity in explanatory variables. The results show that the influence of financial distress on investment is different according to the investment opportunities available to <b>companies.</b> So, <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulties</b> with fewer opportunities have the greatest propensity to under-invest, while firms <b>in</b> <b>difficulties</b> with better opportunities do not present different investment behavior than healthy companies...|$|R

40|$|In the mid- 2000 s, {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} increase in acquisitions of UK companies by private equity funds. The leverage on these buyouts, especially the larger ones, was high. The resulting increase in indebtedness makes those companies more susceptible to default, exposing their lenders to potential losses. This risk is compounded by the need for companies to refinance a cluster of buyout debt maturing {{over the next few years}} in an environment of much tighter credit conditions. From a macroprudential policy perspective it will be important to monitor the use of debt in acquisitions in future episodes of exuberance. But there is also a potential role for private equity to play in promoting recovery in a downswing, in particular at the current juncture, by restructuring <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty...</b>|$|R

40|$|State aid for {{rescue and}} {{restructuring}} (R&R) of <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> causes a significant distortion of competition.

40|$|Unitary {{insolvency}} proceeding was {{the core}} of insolvency code reformation, {{that has been in}} effect since 1991. This law replaced former bankruptcy code and compensation code.

German insolvency law proposes in fact two reorganisation modes. Reorganization according to an insolvency plan and transferred reorganization (asset deals). Especially the transferred reorganization is very popular in practise because of quite fast process and risk and former burden elimination. Twenty years application of this legal regulation proved the insolvency code application in practise.
