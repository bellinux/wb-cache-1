5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was <b>called</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deadliest roads {{in the world at}} the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London <b>called</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most loathsome {{stories of}} the war.

The album has been <b>called</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E
5|$|Since Yellowstone {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{national}} parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been <b>called</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important events in the history of that agency.|$|E
