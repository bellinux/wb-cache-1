5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing {{all of the other}} monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|NHL 17 was {{released}} for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles on September 13, 2016 in North America and September 15 in Europe.

5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended {{for long periods of}} use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
50|$|Air Scouts {{are members}} of the {{international}} Scouting movement with a particular emphasis on an aviation themed programme and/or flying-based activities.

5|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus' helmet, and {{features}} a radar, map, ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Corruption also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has {{the addition of the}} Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.|$|E

50|$|During {{planning}} for its extended missions, various future plans for Cassini were evaluated {{on the basis}} of science return, cost, and <b>time.</b> Some <b>of</b> the options examined include collision with Saturn atmosphere, an icy satellite, or rings; another was departure from Saturn orbit to Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, or a centaur. Other options included leaving it in certain stable orbits around Saturn, or departure to a heliocentric orbit. Each plan requires <b>certain</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and changes in velocity. Another possibility was aerobraking into orbit around Titan.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of a prefix for certain verbs: padìrbti – {{to work for a}} <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> pašaũkti – to call, nukrìsti – to fall. There are very few perfective prefixed verbs that would distinguish themselves from their imperfective unprefixed counterparts only by their perfective meaning, since any prefix almost always has a semantical nuance.|$|E
25|$|Under South African law, {{trademarks}} {{cease to}} be the property of a company {{if they are not}} used for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> McDonald's had renewed the 1968 registration several times, but missed a renewal deadline.

40|$|For vehicle platoons, {{the leader}} {{following}} control architecture {{is known to}} be capable of achieving string stability while maintaining tight formations. In this paper, we study a variety of schemes where the leader state is available to {{the other members of the}} platoon. We show that in some cases it is possible to achieve string stability in the presence <b>of</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> delay in the leader state reception. We also compare other properties of the different schemes and discuss some of their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R

Doing so will send {{a signal to the}} panel, which will pulse the NAC a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> to indicate the zone on which the device is wired to. Silent Walktest will only flash the alarm light on the panel, thus not sounding the signals.|$|R

25|$|Carburizing is {{a process}} used to case-harden steel with a carbon content between 0.1 and 0.3 wt% C. In this process steel is {{introduced}} to a carbon rich environment and elevated temperatures for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and then quenched so that the carbon is locked in the structure; one of the simpler procedures is repeatedly to heat a part with an acetylene torch set with a fuel-rich flame and quench it in a carbon-rich fluid such as oil.|$|E
25|$|Of the Australian oncomerines, {{the bronze}} orange bug (Musgraveia sulciventris) {{is the only}} species {{unequivocally}} documented to lack maternal brooding behavior. This peculiarity might {{be connected to the}} unreliability of the food plant availability for the species (Monteith, 2011). Unlike other oncomerines who can only lay one egg clutch for the <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> it takes to care for them, M. sulciventris can produce multiple egg clutches rapidly because females don't have to care for them. This allows M. sulciventris to rapidly expand their population when conditions are favorable.|$|E
25|$|In Chinese folk {{religions}} {{as well as}} {{the aforementioned}} faiths, people often eat vegan on the 1st and 15th of the month, {{as well as the}} eve of Chinese New Year. Some nonreligious people do this as well. This is similar to the Christian practice of lent and not eating meat on Friday. The percentage of people permanently being pure vegetarian is about the same as the modern English-speaking world, but this percentage has not really changed for a very long time. Many people eat vegan for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in order {{to make up for the}} belief that they have sinned.|$|E

Then, so long as you're not firing your primary weapon, the option bar will turn green again, but if you fire before it fully becomes green again, it resets to black. You can use your {{selected}} option as many times as you want, but must allow for the reload time if you want to use it again.|$|R
50|$|Shun Yashiki (Yashiki Shun) Tsukio's younger cousin. Originally 9th {{place in}} the Fukamichi Tournament, but after losing his rank to Kai, he decided to beat the 8th place holder. He's a ki manipulator. He has a {{technique}} where he uses his ki to create an osmotic punch, which strongly pressures the insides of an opponent's body resulting in a loss <b>of</b> a massive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> liquid within their body, rendering them incapacitated. Since he uses his ki for this technique, he can only use it a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> until he rests to build up his ki again. He teaches this technique to Kaori Sakiyama.

25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} {{its way to}} {{becoming}} a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge {{is directly related to the}} atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.|$|E
25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is blacked out to show he cannot be seen. Often, {{even if he is}} seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|E
25|$|The Artistic Freedom Voucher (AFV) {{introduced}} by Dean Baker {{is a way}} for consumers to support “creative and artistic work.” In this system, each consumer would have a refundable tax credit of $100 to give to any artist of creative work. To restrict fraud, the artists must register with the government. The voucher prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time. Consumers can obtain music for a <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> easily and the consumer decides which artists receive the $100. The money can either be given to one artist or to many, the distribution is up to the consumer.|$|E
50|$|The most {{traditional}} game mode is Capture the Flag. Each side has a flag {{that they must}} protect.
