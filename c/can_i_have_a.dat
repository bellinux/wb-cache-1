[...] There were writs of a somewhat similar nature {{to be found in}} both courts. [...] Bills (writs of complaints) were the method by which a litigant could make his story known in the courts of 13th and 14th century England. [...] Because novel fact patterns frequently emerged, there was a tendency to become creative in the writing of bills of complaint and writs. [...] Against this novelty, was a strong reaction, wanting to keep the number of writs to a minimum. [...] An example is seen from the time of Edward II of England: [...] in 1310â€“1311 John Soke, a litigant appearing in person before the Common Bench, exclaimed in great frustration, [...] "For God's sake, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> writ to attaint this fraud?" [...] Judge Stanton replied, [...] "Make your bill and you shall have what the court can allow." [...] This illustrates the great flexibility of the writing of writs to conform to the changing fact situations as they varied from case to case. [...] At that time, a plaintiff who sued by bill was not liable to fail for defects {{in the form of a}} bill, provided the bill told an intelligible and consistent story.|$|E
