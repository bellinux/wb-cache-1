Air spreading outward from the pressurized zone causes counter-current flow upwards, and co-current flow downwards. This again produces a long, relatively cool <b>calcining</b> <b>zone.</b> Fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 MJ/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned.|$|E
5000|$|Conversion of belite to alite {{requires}} partial melting, {{the resulting}} liquid being the solvent {{in which the}} reaction takes place. The amount of liquid, and hence {{the speed of the}} finishing reaction, is related to temperature. To meet the clinker quality objective, the most obvious control is that the clinker should reach a peak temperature such that the finishing reaction takes place to the required degree. A further reason to maintain constant liquid formation in the hot end of the kiln is that the sintering material forms a dam that prevents the cooler upstream feed from flooding out of the kiln. The feed in the <b>calcining</b> <b>zone,</b> because it is a powder evolving carbon dioxide, is extremely fluid. Cooling of the burning zone, and loss of unburned material into the cooler, is called [...] "flushing", and in addition to causing lost production can cause massive damage.|$|E

To date, a few attempts havebeen made, resulting in models that are either limited to a static global heat balance evaluation or affected by weaknessescaused by too many crude simplifying assumptions. As the main purpose is to control coke quality by controlling the calcination temperature and its rate ofincrease, the key issue is to control the temperature and location of the <b>calcining</b> <b>zone,</b> and in order to do so, it isimportant to introduce the effect of the many critical factors such as emissivities, volatiles and third air into the model. We have succeeded in doing so. Simulation results will be presented and discussed, clearly showing a possibility of optimizingthe operation of the kiln...|$|E

Titrimetric method was used to estimate the main constituents of imported refractory orylex mortar and local river sand. It was observed that silicon fire-clay, fire clay and high alumina refractory binder used in binding bricks at the <b>calcining</b> and safety <b>zones</b> of cement kiln have related constituents as the local river sand and clays. The local refractory mortar was produced by subjecting milled local river sand to heat with subsequent reduction of the sinter size. This is then mixed with prepared sodium silicate solution of various concentrations to give a locally produced composite binder. The product was then tested for stability in electric furnace at 10000 C. The project thus highlighted some possibilities of production of local refractory binding material from locally available raw material...|$|R
40|$|Co-combustion of {{coal and}} natural gas is a {{promising}} technology {{in the production of}} active lime. For this technology, proper fuel proportion of coal {{and natural gas}} (α) {{is one of the key}} parameters that requires significant thought. By means of numerical simulation, contrast studies on co-combustion with five different fuel proportions were carried out. This paper firstly puts forward the models used to describe the system based on the actual conditions. Then, numerical simulation results were analysed in detail to illustrate the co-combustion process and the velocity and temperature distribution in the kiln. Finally, comparisons of high temperature region, char conversion, length of <b>calcining</b> <b>zone,</b> CO and NOx emission and total heat transfer rate to the material bed were made in order to make a decision on fuel proportion. Synthetically considering, α= 30 % is a balance between benefits and costs for the rotary lime kiln studied...|$|E
