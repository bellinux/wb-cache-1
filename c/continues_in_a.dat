This is a trivial case, {{so it is}} usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E

Lifelong e-learningcourses can be different from typical e-learning courses because {{they are designed to}} provide"lifelong, voluntary, and self-motivated" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professionalreasons. This study uses three popular behavioral models to identify factors that can affectstudent intent to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifelong e-learning course. The study integrates elements of theTAM, TPB, and PCI models to create a research model. The study uses the research model topredict student intent to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifelong e-learning course. The study uses randomselection to choose students from members of the SME Online University in Taiwan. The studyuses a survey to collect information concerning student intent to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifelong e-learningcourse. The study uses a partial least squares structural (PLS) model to analyze survey results. Study results show that two factors (perceived usefulness and compatibility) have significantimpacts on student intent to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifelong e-learning course. Study results also show thatthe PCI model predicts student intent to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifelong e-learning course more accuratelythan the TAM and TPB models...|$|R
5|$|MT 48 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MT 1 as a two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds northeastward through rural mining {{land for a}} short distance before intersecting S-273. The roadway continues northeast, running parallel to Spring Creek. After a short distance, the highway passes Bowman Field and several small reservoirs that were created for mining. The road proceeds northeastward through more rural mining land before slightly bending eastward. The highway <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slight northeastward direction {{near the town of}} Warm Springs, crossing the Montana Western Railway. The highway proceeds to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Interstate90's frontage road near exit 201.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder is a {{canalisation}} of the River Calder from Wakefield to Castleford, {{where it}} joins the branch from Leeds, which follows the River Aire. The Aire continues to flow eastwards to Bank Dole Junction, then <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> north-easterly direction to Haddlesey, {{from where it}} follows a winding course to join the River Ouse at Airmyn. The section below Haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation, as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river. Instead, the Selby Canal flows northwards from Haddlesey to the Ouse at Selby. Below Dole Bank Junction, the Knottingley and Goole Canal flows eastards to join the Ouse at Goole. From just before Newbridge, where the modern A614 road crosses the waterway, this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the Dutch River, an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by Cornelius Vermuyden's original diversion of the River Don northwards to the River Aire in 1628.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E

5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Phase, events play in vaguely {{the same}} fashion, {{but there are}} minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle <b>continues.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their memories. In this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle. The story ends with them wishing the Cadet well, saying that they hope to meet them again in a future cycle.|$|E
5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 {{at a time when they}} had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|E

5|$|The New Junction Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal {{leave the}} end of the River Don Navigation, and both head broadly north east, but whereas the New Junction Canal <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{straight}} line for its entire length, the Stainforth and Keadby gradually turns to the east. Shortly after the junction, Bramwith Lock lowers the level of the canal. The River Don, after flowing under the New Junction Canal, joins the canal and continues close to the north bank for several miles. Bramwith Swing Bridge is the first of several swing bridges, most of which are operated by boaters. The tiny village of Kirk Bramwith is just {{to the north of the}} canal and river. Its notable buildings include the church of St Mary, much of which dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a twelfth-century southern doorway. The building is a grade II* listed structure. The hamlet of South Bramwith lies to the south, with Bramwith Hall, a grade II listed 3-storey, 5-bay eighteenth-century country house, which was rebuilt in the early nineteenth century, situated close to the canal. The canal passes to the north of Stainforth, where there is a fixed bridge. A basin, with its former connection to the Don, is now used as moorings by Thorne Cruising Club. This first section is now generally considered to be part of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, although it was originally part of the Don Navigation as far as Stainforth Lock.|$|E
5|$|US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of I-15, {{where it}} acts as I-15's {{frontage}} roads. Just south of I-15's junction with I-215, US-89 splits to the northeast, passing through Bountiful and Woods Cross. A northerly curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypass Centerville and Farmington, where the old road (former US-91, but never US-89) is SR-106, through the narrow strip of land that separates Farmington Bay from the Wasatch Mountains. US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where the Legacy Parkway also ends, and proceeds north on a freeway. This portion of US-89 {{is the only one}} to include exit numbers based on its own mileage, as opposed to the overlapping I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends after US-89 crosses SR-273, the former surface alignment of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east of Layton and Hill Air Force Base. After crossing I-84 in Uintah, US-89 enters Ogden, which it traverses via Washington Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (now SR-26) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, US-89 <b>continues</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general northerly direction along the thin strip between Willard Bay and the Wasatch Mountains to Brigham City, where it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.|$|E
