5|$|An equestrian statue {{designed}} by Launt Thompson, a New York sculptor, was dedicated in 1887 at Exchange Place, Providence, facing <b>City</b> <b>Hall.</b> In 1906, the statue {{was moved to}} <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> Park, which was re-dedicated as Burnside Park.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>Hall.</b> Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|Funding for the <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> {{came from}} several sources. In 1889, the Oregon Legislative Assembly {{approved}} a sale of $175,000 worth of bonds by the City of Portland {{to finance the}} construction of a new <b>city</b> <b>hall.</b> The building ultimately cost $575,000.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how citizen {{spaces are}} used {{and what are}} the intents and the conditions of the construction of citizen spaces based on articles in architectural journals. The following are the findings of this study. 1. Citizen spaces of <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> tend to become larger with the times. However, the ground areas of the <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> do not change, therefore <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> tend to become taller with more levels and the citizen spaces are located near the entrance. 2. In the colder areas, citizen spaces of <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> tend to be constructed inside and those in warmer areas tend to be connected to outside areas. The characteristics of <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> vary by region. 3. Citizen spaces of <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> are designed to stimulate communication. Bigger <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> need to satisfy more diverse demands regarding the citizen spaces and the citizen spaces are expected {{to play a major role}} as a place of communication in the community. 4. Citizen spaces of <b>city</b> <b>halls</b> vary with the design requirements: however, creation of easy-to-access and comfortable citizen spaces that serve the needs of the citizens as a place to promote communication is in demand...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> which was completed in 1905. The <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena <b>City</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Bellevue <b>City</b> <b>Hall</b> is a {{government}} office building and <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> in Bellevue, Washington. The current <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> located in Downtown Bellevue, opened in 2006 after the $121 million renovation of a former Qwest data center. The data center, originally built for Pacific Northwest Bell in 1983, was acquired by the city government in 2002 {{for use by the}} Bellevue Police Department and later approved as the new <b>city</b> <b>hall.</b> It incorporates use of wood interiors and a terra cotta exterior that has been recognized with several design awards since its opening.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E
5|$|An {{advisory}} committee {{was formed by}} the city council in 1956 to propose sites for a new <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> and civic center campus. The city council placed a $250,000 bond issue on the November 1956 ballot to fund {{the construction of a}} new <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> but voters defeated the proposition. City offices instead moved to a former hardware store near the Bellevue Square shopping center in 1960.|$|E

5|$|During the Revolutionary War, <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> {{was home}} to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the {{political}} arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County (which {{at that time was}} the largest county in the colony, extending far past its current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> alongside common criminals. Following the war, <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, in addition to being home to the city and county governments, the jail, courts, and local registry.|$|E

5|$|In 1797 Albany was {{declared}} the official {{capital of the}} state and the Legislature made <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> its home until the first state capitol was opened in 1809. In an effort to move public buildings away from the bustling and expanding waterfront, the new capitol was located atop the State Street hill, on the same land the current building now stands. City surveyor Simeon De Witt, in his , set aside this land as a public square. Also included on this map are depictions of <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> and the new city jail, located at State and Eagle Streets. In 1809, Albany city government moved with the Legislature into the new capitol and remained there until a new <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was opened in 1832. The old Stadt Huys was eventually demolished after a fire in 1836.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Hooker's <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> was {{destroyed}} by fire and a new design was commissioned by Henry Richardson; the building opened in 1883. The new <b>city</b> <b>hall</b> still stands and is {{a fine example of}} Richardson's unique Romanesque style. Architectural critics consider the building to have been designed around the high point of Richardson's career. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Ann Arbor voters {{approved}} a $2.3 million bond issue {{to build the}} current <b>city</b> <b>hall,</b> which was designed by architect Alden B. Dow.
