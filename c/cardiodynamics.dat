Evaluative reports involve participant introspection and self-ratings of internal psychological states or physiological sensations, such as self-report of arousal levels on the self-assessment manikin, or measures of interoceptive visceral awareness such as heartbeat detection. Merits to self-report are {{an emphasis on}} accurately understand the participants’ subjective experience and understanding their perception; however, its pitfalls include the possibility of participants misunderstanding a scale or incorrectly recalling events. Physiological responses also can be measured via instruments that read bodily events such as heart rate change, electrodermal activity (EDA), muscle tension, and cardiac output. Many indices are part of modern psychophysiology, including brain waves (electroencephalography, EEG), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), electrodermal activity (a standardized term encompassing skin conductance response, SCR, and galvanic skin response, GSR), cardiovascular measures (heart rate, HR; beats per minute, BPM; heart rate variability, HRV; vasomotor activity), muscle activity (electromyography, EMG), electrogastrogram (EGG) changes in pupil diameter with thought and emotion (pupillometry), eye movements, recorded via the electro-oculogram (EOG) and direction-of-gaze methods, and <b>cardiodynamics,</b> recorded via impedance cardiography. These measures are beneficial because they provide accurate and perceiver-independent objective data recorded by machinery. [...] The downsides, however, are that any physical activity or motion can alter responses, and basal levels of arousal and responsiveness can differ among individuals and even between situations.|$|E

40|$|The term <b>cardiodynamics</b> {{refers to}} dynamic events {{associated}} with cardiac contraction and relaxation. The occurring wave of excitement spreads very quickly {{along the entire}} atrial musculature and after a brief AV retention it affects all muscle cells of the ventricles. Excitation, that is, the increase in action potentials, precedes the contraction of the myocardium, which follows the 'all or none' rule. Each contraction results in relaxation of the myocardium, so that the contraction and relaxation cycles continually follow each other in succession. The entire <b>cardiodynamics,</b> hemodinamics, i. e. signaling mechanisms of the heart are altered in the remodeling (alternation) condition of the left ventricular myocardium, i. e. the musculature and the whole arterial wall. Remodeling of the cardiac wall and layers of the arterial wall is a negative factor, because it leads to disturbances of the cardiac contraction and relaxation cycles and incites progression of the arterial hypertension, emergence of atherosclerosis and arterial stenosis. Today, the genetic base of the cardiac remodeling {{is the object of}} intensive studies. Cardiomyopathies are primary disorders of the myocardium associated with abnormalities of the cardiac wall thickness, the size of chambers, contractions, relaxations, signal conduct and rhythm.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 21 - 23) An accurate {{ambulatory monitoring}} device which detects hemodynamic values {{outside of the}} laboratory setting could help researchers and practitioners alike. The ability to monitor changes occurring in a subject during {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), could lead to the detection and treatment of many undiagnosed patients. Non-invasive monitoring of hemodynamic variables have gone through many changes since its inception in 1966, when Kubicek et al developed the first impedance cardiograph for NASA. Since then changes have been made to the formula which detects hemodynamic changes, however, the impedance cardiograph is still considered the gold standard for non-invasive monitoring. The current study assessed the accuracy of an ambulatory monitoring device, the Vivometric LifeShirt, compared to the current gold standard impedance cardiograph (<b>Cardiodynamics,</b> Bio-Z), during pre and post rest conditions. Methods:The volunteer subjects included 14 healthy males recruited from California State University, Northridge. The male participants were between the ages of 19 - 33 and all provided written informed consent. Pre and post test values were obtained while the <b>Cardiodynamics</b> Bio-Z and Vivometric LifeShirt simultaneously recorded hemodynamic values. Heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were then analyzed and recorded.

Several basic problems remain unsolved, however. Their resolution has been handicapped by the inability to reproduce chronic congestive heart failure in laboratory animals (11). Chronic pericarditis with effusion resembles congestive heart failure in that both may exhibit congestion, fluid retention, edema and anasarca. We have recently produced chronic pericarditis with effusion in the dog by the introduction of irritative cellophane into the pericardial sac (12). Animals so treated eventually exhibited a syndrome of circulatory failure (insufficiency) with congestion. This experimental approach therefore provides a means for the investigation of the alterations in <b>cardiodynamics</b> and in renal function which lead to fluid accumulation. The changes observed in chronic experimental pericarditis with effusion have been analyzed in an attempt to explain the pathogenesis of fluid retention in this syndrome.

40|$|Background The haemodynamic {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} infusion of the non-selective {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) l-omega monomethyl arginine (l-NMMA) have previously been characterized in humans. Its effect of reducing cardiac index (CI) is an important reason for the increase in mortality in patients with septic shock receiving l-NMMA in a pivotal outcome trial for this indication. The mechanism for the reduction in CI however, is uncertain. Methods In this study, we investigated the haemodynamic and arterial stiffness response to a bolus intravenous infusion of l-NMMA (3 mg kg− 1 over 5 min) in 26 healthy human volunteers to clarify the likely cause of l-NMMA induced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Digital photoplethysmography (MicroMedical Pulse Trace) was used to derive two measures of arterial stiffness: stiffness index, a measure of large arterial stiffness, and reflection index (RI), a measure of small- to medium-sized arterial stiffness. Haemodynamic measurements of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), stroke index and CI were made using a bioimpedance monitor (BioZ <b>Cardiodynamics).</b> Results We found that changes in CI during l-NMMA {{are closely related to}} changes in RI and SVRI. Conclusion The negative inotropic effect of l-NMMA may be a result of an increase in coronary vascular resistance and a resultant decrease in myocardial perfusion. The reduction in CI may also result from a direct reduction of the normal positive inotropic effect of NO by l-NMMA which is closely correlated with its effects on SVRI...|$|E

From an analysis of ventricular pressure pulses, inferences were drawn as to basic determinants of cardiac performance in experimental con-ditions simulating those which arise clinically. The analysis included alterations in ventricular contraction patterns produced by pericardial effusion, hypervolemia, oligemia, arterial hyper-tension of peripheral origin and that due to coarctation of the aorta, aortic and pulmonary steno-sis, idioventricular rhythms, ventricular alternation, coronary occlusion and myocardial ischemia, aortic regurgitation, and mitral insufficiency. WITHIN {{the past two decades}} clinical and experimental studies of cardiac output-per minute and per beat-have yielded much important information con-cerning the nature of cardiovascular disorders. However, a basic understanding of such condi-tions also requires a comprehension of the ways and means by which cardiac output is either maintained or altered. The dynamics of ven-tricular contraction, which concerns itself with the mechanisms through which cardiac output is altered, can be evaluated to a considerable extent by a rigid analysis of pressure pulses recorded from the ventricular cavities. Now it happens that during various periods since 1912 I have used such pressure pulses to study the basic changes in cardiac behavior produced during abnormal circulatory condi-tions in experimental animals.

We hypothesized that hypertension therapy guided by noninvasive hemodynamics with impedance cardiography could aid primary care physicians in reducing blood pressure more effectively. Uncontrolled hypertensive patients on 1 to 3 medications were randomized by 3 : 2 ratio to either a standard arm or hemodynamic arm that used impedance cardiography (BioZ, <b>CardioDynamics).</b> Each patient completed 5 study visits with a 2 -week washout period followed by 3 months of treatment. A total of 164 patients from 11 centers completed the study, 95 in the standard arm and 69 in the hemodynamic arm. At baseline and after washout, there were no differences between arms in number of medications or demographic, blood pressure, or hemodynamic characteristics. Systolic blood pressure reductions in the hemodynamic arm were greater from baseline (19 mm Hg versus 11 mm Hg; P 0. 01) and after washout (25 mm Hg versus 19 mm Hg; P 0. 05). Diastolic blood pressure reductions were also greater in the hemodynamic arm from baseline (12 mm Hg versus 5 mm Hg; P 0. 001) and after washout (17 mm Hg versus 10 mm Hg; P 0. 001). The hemodynamic arm achieved goal blood pressure (140 / 90 mm Hg) more frequently (77 % versus 57 %; P 0. 01) and a more aggressive blood pressure level (130 / 85 mm Hg) more frequently (55 % versus 27 %; P 0. 0001).

Methods: Pigs were randomized to: (1) sham (n = 7), (2) cardiac arrest (CA; n = 16), or 3) cardiac arrest + adenocaine (CA + AL; n = 12). After 7 min of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, start of CPR was followed by infusion of saline (CA) or adenocaine (CA + AL) for 6 min. Haemodynamics, <b>cardiodynamics</b> (pressure–volume loops) and leucocyte superoxide anion generation were assessed.

Left ventricular dysfunction demonstrated by a rightward shift of the intercept of end-systolic pressure–volume relations in CA was avoided in the CA + AL group.

For 95 % of pairs of measurements, HeartSmart&reg; values were between 57 % and 164 % of PAC measurements; additionally, the larger limit of agreement between HeartSmart&reg; and PAC thermodilution (1. 26 L min- 1 &bull;m- 2) suggests that HeartSmart&reg; agrees with PAC thermodilution as closely as PAC thermodilution agrees with itself. HeartSmart&reg; can also estimate CI in the extreme circumstances of shock/sepsis, as indicated by PAC thermodilution CI values that were hypo- or hyperdynamic based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. In CI measurements for hypo- or hyperdynamic values that were matched between HeartSmart&reg; and PAC thermodilution, the difference in total volumes and average CI measurements between the two methods was less than 5 %. For unmatched hypo- or hyperdynamic values, the difference between total volumes and average CI measurements was less than 33 % &ndash; an acceptable percentage of difference or error even for normal values of CI.

This is the most important {{in the light of the}} adoption by some cardiac surgeons of an unvalidated model which hypothesises that the entire myocardial mass can be unravelled to produce one continuous band. It is our opinion that this model, and the phylogenetic and functional correlates derived from it, is incompatible with current concepts of cardiac structure and <b>cardiodynamics.</b> Furthermore, the proponents of the continuous myocardial band have made no effort to demonstrate perceived deficiencies with current concepts, nor have they performed any histological studies to validate their model. Clinical results using modifications of radius reduction surgery based on the concept of the continuous myocardial band show that the procedure essentially becomes ineffective. As we show in this review, if we understand the situation correctly, it was the erstwhile intention of the promoters of the continuous band to elucidate the basic mechanism of diastolic ventricular dilation. Their attempts, however, are doomed to failure, as is any attempt to conceptualise the myocardial mass on the basis of a tertiary structure, because of the underlying three-dimensional netting of the myocardial aggregates and the supporting fibrous tissue to form the myocardial syncytium. Thus, the ventricular myocardium is arranged in the form of a modified blood vessel rather than a skeletal muscle. If an analogy is required with skeletal muscle, then the ventricular myocardium possesses the freedom of motion, and the ability for shaping and conformational self-controlling that is better seen in the tongue. It is part of this ability that contributes to the rapid end-systolic ventricular dilation. Histologic investigations reveal that the fibrous content of the three-dimensional mesh is relatively inhomogeneous through the ventricular walls, particularly when the myocardium is diseased. The regional capacity to control systolic mural thickening, therefore, varies throughout the walls of the ventricular components. The existence of the spatially netted structure of the ventricular mass, therefore, must invalidate any attempt to conceptualise the ventricular myocardium as a tertiary arrangement of individual myocardial bands or tract...|$|E
40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a {{circulating}} hormone, {{released from}} the heart, whose natriuretic and diuretic actions {{play an important role}} in cardiovascular homeostasis. It is stored as a prohormone in cardiac myocytes and converted to a circulating form upon release from the myocytes. Numerous factors have been shown to modulate ANP release, however the principal stimulus for release is believed to be stretch of the atrial wall. [...] Recently it has been demonstrated that the capsaicin-sensitive peptidergic innervation of the rat heart, namely the substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) fibers, is a component modulating the release of immunoreactiveANP (irANP). This research project initially investigated the role of the intrinsic cardiac ganglia on <b>cardiodynamics</b> and irANP release. In Sprague-Dawley rats, in vitro electrical stimulation of epicardial regions dense with cardiac ganglia (50 Hz, 15 - 20 μs, 4 μA delivered in 5 s trains), referred to as 'ganglionic' stimulation, resulted in a dramatic decrease in heart rate followed by a transient period of tachycardia. Cardiodynamic effects were accompanied by a significant increase in irANP release. Results from stimulation of epicardial regions lacking the presence of cardiac ganglia, termed 'non-ganglionic' stimulation indicated that heart rate changes were attributable to excitation of particular components of the ganglia at the site of stimulation, and not simply to spread of an electrical current over the epicardium. [...] Also investigated were the effects of neonatal capsaicin treatment (capsaicin is a chemical that abolishes SP and CGRP cardiac innervation in rats when administered neonatally) on irANP release in the model of cardiac ganglia stimulation and in other models previously demonstrated to release irANP, such as stretch of the right atrium. In ganglionic stimulation experiments, release of irANP was independent of changes in heart rate. The presence of innervation by immunoreactive SP and CGRP was shown to be imperative for significant increase in irANP release after ganglionic stimulation and after stretch of the right atrium. [...] Pharmacological studies were carried out to gain insight into the role of acetylcholine and noradrenaline in the biphasic change in heart rate and release of irANP after ganglionic stimulation. The initial decrease in heart rate was shown to be associated with parasympathetic innervation and similarly, tachycardia was associated with sympathetic innervation. However, release of irANP was demonstrated to be independent from either decreases or increases in heart rate. It is hypothesized that if SP and CGRP innervation are involved in irANP release, and if capsaicin depletes these peptides, then an acute treatment of capsaicin should release stores of SP and CGRP and yield an increased release of irANP. This was the case when vehicle-treated animals were administered an acute dose of capsaicin, however the tissues from animals treated neonatally with capsaicin showed no release of irANP. Acute capsaicin administration had no effect on heart rate in either group. [...] Finally, Northern blot analysis of ANP messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) production was performed to ascertain if neonatal capsaicin treatment was affecting synthesis of ANP and if levels of mRNA expression were equivalent in vehicle- and capsaicin-treated animals. [...] It was concluded that electrical stimulation of the intrinsic cardiac ganglia results in a biphasic change in heart rate associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac innervation. Also, in the models used here, the SP and CGRP cardiac innervation seem responsible for the modulation of the release of irANP. Some preliminary data also suggest that SP and CGRP may be modulating irANP release in in vivo models of atrial pacing as well. Further studies are necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of capsaicin on ANP synthesis.

The mode {{of changes in the}} <b>cardiodynamics</b> was divided into three types, that is, the pressure-(2 ̆ 2 Druckreakreaktion 2 ̆ 2, D.), the volume-(2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2, V.), and normal reaction (N.) accrding to Blumberger. The mode of changes in the vasculodynamics was also classified into three types, i. e., the tension-(2 ̆ 2 Anspannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2, Ans.), the relaxation-(2 ̆ 2 Entapannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2, Ents.) and the normal regulation according to Duesberg-Sehroeder. 1. The abnormal fluctuation of the cardio-vascular dynamics in the recumbent state appears more frequently in the arterial hypertension than in the arterial hypotension. However, among the hypotensives whose subjective disturbances of orthostatism are severe, there occurs not seldom the cardio-vascular dynamics beyond the normal range. The difference between the cardio-vascular dynamical values at 52 ̆ 7 and those at 152 ̆ 7 after standing is not so remarkably found; generally speaking the values at these two time-points show very similar mode of reaction, therefore it may be safe to say that only the values at 52 ̆ 7 after standing is sufficient for the practical study on the type of the orthostatic reaction. 2. The hypotonic (2 ̆ 2 hypotone 2 ̆ 2) form of postural hypotension according to Schellong is usually attended with D. -reaction cardiodynamically and with Ans. -regulation vasculodynamically, whereas the hypodynamic (2 ̆ 2 hypodyname 2 ̆ 2) form is often attended with V. reaction cardio-dynamically and with Ents. -regulation vasculodynamically. However there exists not rarely the exception to the tendency above mentioned and concerning this source the standard deviation, the spontaneous fluctuation of these cardio-vascular dynamical values as the reproducibility of Schellong 2 ̆ 7 s 1 st and 2 nd test were fully discussed. 3. Dern 2 ̆ 7 s analysis was made in arterial hypertension regarding the dynamical optimal state of blood pressure which were gained by the administration of the various sorte of the hypotensive drugs presented after Kikawada 2 ̆ 7 s observation in our clinic, i. e. guanethidine, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, chlorbenzene- 2, 4 -disulfonamide, 1 -α-methyldopa, and some kinds of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. By the singular use of the latter it is difficult to obtain a stable optimal or floor state of blood pressure. Dern 2 ̆ 7 s analysis elucidates the autonomic nervous tonicity after the antihypensive treatment as our collaborators have emphasized. 4. The criterion for the judgement of the severity of the orthostatic dysfunction was made of the constituent factors of blood pressure range which were easily obtainable in the clinical praxis and then according to this criterion three subgroups, i. e. (-), (+) and (⧺) were difined (Tb 1. 6 - 7). 5. When the cardio-vascular dynamical values gained in the hyper-and hypotensives are investigated in the light of W. R.

In 11 essential hypertensive patients (Keith-Wagener II) the average of E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 186. 0 dyne cm^, so that there existed no marked difference as compared with that of normal health. 3. In bronchial asthma not complicated with pulmonary emphysema, the average of E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 285. 0 dyne cm^, whereas in bronchial asthma suffered from this complication it was 454. 4 dyne cm^. 4. In 4 of 5 cases with mitral stenosis, both PA and E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) were found larger than those in normal health in an average; the wedge pressure of all cases was elevated. In 1 of 3 cases with mitral stenoinsufficiency, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was estimated larger than that in normal health. In mitral stenosis, E 2 ̆ 7 p determined in assumption of PV= 0 or PV= 5 showed not seldom the marked deviation from that in assumption of PV=PC. 5. In 2 of 4 cases with aortic regurgitation, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was found within the normal range, whereas in other two it was estimated beyond the normal. Among 3 patients suffered from aortic stenoinsufficiency complicated cardiac asthma, E 2 ̆ 7 p was observed normal in 1 case, and larger than the normal range in 2 cases. 6. In one case with Ayerza 2 ̆ 7 s disease, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 4084 dyne cm^, that is, the largest value among this observation. 7. E 2 ̆ 7 p tended to increase in its amount pararell with the elevation of systolic PA, mean PA, and pulmonary pulse pressure. However there could not be seen so closed relationship between E 2 ̆ 7 p and pulmonary diastolic pressure in the lesser circulation as that between E 2 ̆ 7 and arterial diastolic in the greater circulation. The reverse correlation existed roughly between the fluctuation of E 2 ̆ 7 p and that of Vs in the same individual. 8. There was calculated the ratio of E 2 ̆ 7 p to E 2 ̆ 7 in the patients in whom Vm determined by Fick-Cournand 2 ̆ 7 s method was closely approximate to that by Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s simultaneously performed. Regarding E 2 ̆ 7 p/E 2 ̆ 7, mitral stenosis or stenoinsufficiency, bronchial asthma with or without pulmonary emphysema, essential hypertension of KW II, and normal health could be arranged in the order of the magnitude. In the same individual, the, damping factor in the lesser circulation tended to be observed larger than that in the greater circulation. 9. The intravenous injection of morphine (0. 1 mg per kilo) augmented the E 2 ̆ 7 p of mitral stenosis; thus resulted pulmonary hypertension, though transitory and slight, showed the type of W+E 2 ̆ 7 (Wezler-Boger), whereas in the greater circulation there appeared the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypotension 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg-Schroeder). While the right ventricular dynamical values showed 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger), the left ventricular changed from 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 Normals Reaktion 2 ̆ 2. 10. The intravenous injection of β-oxypropyltheophylline (ca. 2 mg per kilo) showed the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypotension 2 ̆ 2 both in lesser and greater circulation of the patients suffered from bronchial asthma, however the tendency seen in the greater circulation was usually somewhat more marked than that in the lesser circulation. At this moment, bothsided ventricular dynamical values enhanced commonly the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 previously existed more or less. In the essential hypertension of KW II, Vm previously augmented was not seldom rather reduced to some extent. There occurred no significant change upon PA. The intravenous injection of oxytheophylline reduced E 2 ̆ 7 p calculated in assumption of PV= 0 or PV= 5, whereas it augmented E 2 ̆ 7 p determined in assumption of PV=PC. However, in the systemic circulation, E 2 ̆ 7 as well as W tended to become smaller by the injection. As to bothsided ventricular dynamical values, in the cases with marked 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 there could be seen the tendency of the decrease in its degree. 11. The intravenous injection of 0. 25 mg of K-Strophanthin (Sandoz) augmented the Vm except for aortic regurgitation. The fluctuation of E 2 ̆ 7 p remained within normal range. After the recompensation by Strophanthin therapy, the systemic circulation showed the tendency of the normotensive 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg and Schroeder) regarding peripheral dynamics as well as that of 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger) respecting bothsided <b>cardiodynamics.</b> The injection of Strophanthin normalized the pulmonary 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypertension 2 ̆ 2 observed in some cases, whereas at this moment W and E 2 ̆ 7 in systemic circulation increased slightly in their amount. In the patients with mitral stenosis or ravious kinds of valvular diseases complicated with pulmonary hypertension, the injection of Strophanthin lowered PA previously elevated, and reduced. Vm, although of slight extent. E 2 ̆ 7 p and Wp formerly augmented were also diminished a little by the injection. ASZ 2 ̆ 7 (right ventricular 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungszeit 2 ̆ 2) once prolonged tended to decrease in its degree. In the systemic circulation the high output showed the tendency to be reduced, W or E 2 ̆ 7 rather somewhat enlarged. 12. The intravenous injection of 1. 0 mg of Camphidonium salt (Ingelheim) lowered the systolic PA of mitral stenosis previously elevated, at this moment the diastolic PA remained unchanged or was rather raised although of slight extent, and Vm formerly diminished was augmented. E 2 ̆ 7 p in assumption of PV= 0 became smaller, whereas E 2 ̆ 7 p in assumption of PV=PC larger. While the total pulmonary resistance decreased, the pulmonary arteriolar resistance increased in their amount. In the systemic circulation, W and E 2 ̆ 7 were reduced, Vm remained unchanged or slightly increased in their amount. The left ventricular dynamical values showed the decrease in the extent of 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2, whereas those of right ventricle rather the increase although of slight extent...|$|E
