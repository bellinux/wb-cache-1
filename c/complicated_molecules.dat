25|$|The {{synthesis}} of urea by Friedrich Wöhler {{opened a new}} research field, organic chemistry, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules.</b> Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} described a potent anthrax toxin inhibitor, {{based on a}} phage-library-selected peptide sequence, synthesized as a tetra-branched molecule on a lysine core and further modified for improvement of activity [Pini et al., Biochem. J., 2006, 395, 157]. This branched peptide had very low solubility because of several hydrophobic residues in the peptide sequence. This <b>complicated</b> <b>molecule</b> purification and manufacturing. Here we report a rational modification of the peptide sequence, obtained by construction and selection of several mini libraries of branched peptides, containing sequences randomized in non crucial positions of the original peptide. Mini libraries were screened for solubility and inhibitory activity. This procedure enabled us to obtain a new peptide with a better solubility and identical inhibitory activity...|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of liquid water is an assumed requirement, {{as it is}} a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of <b>complicated</b> carbon-based <b>molecules</b> that could eventually lead to the emergence of life. Some researchers posit environments of water-ammonia mixtures as possible solvents for hypothetical types of biochemistry.|$|R
30|$|The silver {{precursor}} has {{a strong}} influence on the reduction process. To realize this, a more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecule</b> can be used, like silver hexafluoroacetylacetonate (1.5 -cyclooctadiene), alias Aghfacac. Contrary to the silver nitrate, this precursor molecule is not entirely broken in the aqueous solution and presents several bonds between Ag and the organic groups. As a consequence, the energy density necessary to produce NP is multiplied by 2.5, and only a slight release of Ag+ ions occurs under the laser irradiation. This {{is the reason why}} the optical spectra exhibit a very weak SPR band after irradiation, contrary to the band at 307 nm ascribed to the precursor, which remains almost unchanged (Figure  4 d). In other words, a nonnegligible amount of complementary thermal energy is necessary to obtain Ag+ ions from this precursor. This heat quantity, coming from the weak absorption of light by the matrix and by the precursor, is also used to grab electrons from the matrix defects.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-four millimeter-wave {{emission}} {{lines of}} ethyl cyanide (CH 3 CH 2 CN) {{have been detected}} in the Orion Nebula (OMC- 1) and seven in Sgr B 2. To derive precise radial velocities from the astronomical data, a laboratory measurement of the rotational spectrum of ethyl cyanide has been made at frequencies above 41 GHz. In OMC- 1, the rotational temperature of ethyl cyanide is 90 K (in good agreement with other molecules), the local-standard-of-rest radial velocity is 4. 5 + or - 1. 0 km/s (versus 8. 5 km/s for most molecules), and the column density is 1. 8 by 10 to the 14 th power per sq cm (a surprisingly high figure for a <b>complicated</b> <b>molecule).</b> The high abundance of ethyl cyanide in the Orion Nebula suggests that ethane and perhaps larger saturated hydrocarbons may be common constituents of molecular clouds and have escaped detection only because they are nonpolar or only weakly polar...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} life is to make more life. From the first {{self-replicating}} molecules to the complex organisms that make up our ecosystems, all life simply aims to function long enough to reproduce. To achieve this trick, life changes its environment, it changes other life, and it changes itself. Self-replicating molecules join forces in cells, parasites merge into hosts, viruses transfer genes across species, different species co-evolve perfect partnerships with each other, and the rocks and air of our planet are transformed from barren volcanic desolation into blue-green paradise. Life has always meant change, evolution, adaptation. Human life is no exception. The {{only difference is that}} humans have so many capabilities to change life, to change our environments and to change ourselves. We also have the capacity to wonder if we should.

50|$|The Barton Reaction {{involves}} a homolytic RO-NO cleavage, followed by δ-hydrogen abstraction, free radical recombination, and tautomerization {{to form an}} oxime. Selectivity for the δ-hydrogen {{is a result of}} the conformation of the 6-membered radical intermediate. Often, the site of hydrogen atom abstraction can be easily predicted. This allows the regio- and stereo-selective introduction of functionality into <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules</b> with high yield. Due to its then unique ability to derivitize otherwise inert substrates Barton used this reaction extensively in the 1960s to create a number of unnatural steroid analogues.|$|E
5000|$|Natural {{compounds}} {{refer to}} those that are produced by plants or animals. Many of these are still extracted from natural sources because {{they would be more}} expensive to produce artificially. Examples include most sugars, some alkaloids and terpenoids, certain nutrients such as vitamin B12, and, in general, those natural products with large or stereoisometrically <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules</b> present in reasonable concentrations in living organisms. Further compounds of prime importance in biochemistry are antigens, carbohydrates, enzymes, hormones, lipids and fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides and amino acids, lectins, vitamins, and fats and oils.|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{depletion of}} intermediate-weight elements O, C, and N from {{the interstellar medium}} is shown to be significantly greater than can {{be accounted for by}} accretion on interstellar dust.

50|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{also applies}} to more <b>complicated</b> atoms and <b>molecules.</b> When {{there is more than}} one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.|$|R
5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of <b>complicated,</b> asymmetric <b>molecules</b> from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically {{in at least one}} dimension.|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} {{molecules}} by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is {{largely based on}} quantum mechanics and {{is essential for the}} understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schrödinger equation for the system can be solved more easily {{due to the lack of}} electron-electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules</b> became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{qualitative}} approach of MO analysis uses a molecular orbital diagram to visualize bonding interactions in a molecule. In {{this type of}} diagram, the molecular orbitals are represented by horizontal lines; the higher a line the higher {{the energy of the}} orbital, and degenerate orbitals are placed on the same level with a space between them. Then, the electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals are slotted in one by one, keeping in mind the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity (only 2 electrons, having opposite spins, per orbital; place as many unpaired electrons on one energy level as possible before starting to pair them). For more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules,</b> the wave mechanics approach loses utility in a qualitative understanding of bonding (although is still necessary for a quantitative approach). Some properties: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mathematical}} {{methods for}} the analysis of diffraction data only apply to patterns, which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from patterns that are generated by fibers and powders, which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules.</b> For example, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample.|$|E
50|$|Riggs and Itakura {{collaborated with}} Herbert Boyer at Genentech, and used {{recombinant}} DNA technology {{to become the}} first to produce a human protein in E. coli. Following the advice of Riggs and Itakura, the group successfully produced the hormone Somatostatin in 1977 as a proof of concept before they attempted to work with the more <b>complicated</b> insulin <b>molecule.</b> They were able to link somatostatin to a larger protein, beta-galactosidase, produce it in E. coli, isolate it, and then separate the somatostatin from the galactosidase. Somatostatin was the first mammalian hormone to be produced in a bacterium.|$|R
5000|$|The FDA {{has been}} slow to adopt {{regulations}} for the introduction of generic versions of biopharmaceutical drugs (known as [...] "biosimilars") because the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals is so much more <b>complicated</b> than small <b>molecule</b> drugs. Innovator companies have emphasized those complications while generic companies, insurance companies, and consumers have advocated for the FDA to finalize their process.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} of formation of RNA {{have been put}} forward. , there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil. Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed {{in the presence of}} various terrestrial minerals. Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more <b>complicated</b> organic <b>molecules</b> include chemical reactions that take place on clay substrates or {{on the surface of the}} mineral pyrite.|$|R
5000|$|By the mid 20th century, in principle, the {{integration}} of physics and chemistry was extensive, with chemical properties explained {{as the result of}} the electronic structure of the atom; Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more <b>complicated</b> <b>molecules.</b> However, though some principles deduced from quantum mechanics were able to predict qualitatively some chemical features for biologically relevant molecules, they were, till the end of the 20th century, more a collection of rules, observations, and recipes than rigorous ab initio quantitative methods. This heuristic approach triumphed in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the double helical structure of DNA by constructing models constrained by and informed by the knowledge of the chemistry of the constituent parts and the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained by Rosalind Franklin.

The Ledlie Prize has been awarded in fields as diverse as chemistry, entomology, sociology, education, physics, and molecular biology. Over the years it has gained prestige as an award, and is prized by members of the Harvard faculty. Upon receipt of her Ledlie Prize, physicist Lene Hau explained her reaction in these terms: “I am very honored to receive the prize.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} death signaling in T cells is regulated in a <b>complicated</b> way. <b>Molecules</b> other than death receptors can also trigger T-cell death. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1) or CD 162 molecules cross-linked by an anti–PSGL- 1 monoclonal an-tibody, TAB 4, can trigger a death signal in activated T cells. In contrast to classic cell death, PSGL- 1 –mediated T-cell death is caspase independent. It involves trans-location of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to nucleus and mitochon-drial cytochrome c release. Ultrastructur-ally, both peripheral condensation of chro-matin and apoptotic body were observed in PSGL- 1 –mediated T-cell death.

N,N’-bis(salicylidene) –thiocarbohydrazide (BSTC) was first synthesized by the reaction of salicylaldehyde with thiocarbohydrazide.
