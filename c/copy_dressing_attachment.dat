40|$|For SU(2) lattice {{gauge theory}} we study numerically the {{infrared}} {{behavior of the}} Landau gauge ghost and gluon propagators with the special accent on the Gribov copy dependence. Applying a very efficient gauge fixing procedure and generating up to 80 gauge copies {{we find that the}} Gribov copy effect for both propagators is essential in the infrared. In particular, our best <b>copy</b> <b>dressing</b> function of the ghost propagator approaches a plateau in the infrared, while for the random first copy it still grows. Our best copy zero-momentum gluon propagator shows a tendency to decrease with growing lattice size which excludes singular solutions. Our results look compatible with the so-called decoupling solution with a non-singular gluon propagator. However, we do not yet consider the Gribov copy problem to be finally resolved.

While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and hardcore subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.

[...] However, the birds on the McQueen original were actually peacocks, and although Temime did manage to change the crest on the bird's heads to make them more 'phoenixy', she neglected to alter any other detail of the birds, including their rather obvious peacock feathers.

5000|$|The Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT) is a semi-projective {{attachment}} measure {{designed by}} Inge Bretherton and colleagues {{to assess the}} internal working model of children between the age of 3 to 9 years old (though it requires modification when used with older children). The measure evaluates a child's attachment style by analyzing how a child resolves a stress inducing story. In a 30-minute recorded interview, five story stems are presented {{through the use of}} props, such as small family figures. The stories are designed to access how that child interacts with their primary caregiver in five situations: separation, confrontation, fear, reunion, and pain. The Interviewer prompts the child to complete each story by saying [...] "show me, or tell me what happens next." [...] The information derived from the interview is later coded according to the organization and content of the story completion. Avoidant attachment, for example, can be disclosed by a child refusing to acknowledge the attachment issue presented in the story stem (through claiming that the event did not take place). A child may also avoid addressing attachment by focusing solely on minor details, such as how the protagonist is <b>dressed.</b> Secure <b>attachment,</b> alternately, is indicated when a child provides coherent and constructive resolutions to the stories.|$|R

New Zealand couturist Jane Yeh worked through the night after the wedding to create another <b>copy</b> of the <b>dress.</b> Chinese dressmakers told news reporters they expected to have knock-offs of the dress available one week from the event; one expressed frustration that it was not leaked in advance so that they could have stock prepared earlier.

There Hawes sold clothing to non-French-speaking Americans and tried to secure new customers.
