The number of holes in the die plate allows simultaneous extrusion of numerous threads on 17 production lines. Each production line includes several post-treatment steps.

Afterwards the threads are rolled up.|$|R

25|$|PEX is a medium- to {{high-density}} polyethylene containing cross-link bonds {{introduced into the}} polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> is enhanced.

25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than impact strength, <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

40|$|The rising concern towards {{environmental}} issues and, {{on the other}} hand, the management of industrial wastes has led to increasing interest about new materials with low environmental impact. In our study, the possibility to use WEE glass waste as raw material in composite materials with a composition typical of a solid surface, converting them from an environmental and economic burden to a profitable added-value-resource, has been investigated. Solid surfaces are manufactured from a polymeric materials, while the fillers are quartz and several granules may also be added to enhance the colour effects.

25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance,</b> UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with aramid in bulletproof vests.|$|E
40|$|High-pressure NMR {{methods for}} the study of the {{kinetics}} of gas–solution reactions are presented, and the importance/interplay of mass transport and <b>chemical</b> <b>resistances</b> are discussed. For reactions that are slow compared with mass transport, the true reaction kinetics can be obtained and used to confirm that the observed species are relevant to the catalytic reaction. Conversely, the ability to determine the catalyst speciation during the catalytic reaction aids interpretation of the kinetic data. When chemical reaction is fast compared with diffusion across the gas–liquid interface, reaction is shown to occur in the liquid layer; for such a transport-controlled reaction, chemical reaction can increase the concentration gradient across the boundary layer, enhancing diffusion both across the phase boundary and within the liquid layer, resulting in apparent positive orders in catalyst, substrate, or both. These dependencies do not reflect the chemical dependence of the reaction rate on these concentrations...|$|R

SAMs can also reduce sticking of NEMS and MEMS components in humid environments. In the same way, SAMs can alter the properties of glass. A common household product, Rain-X, utilizes SAMs to create a hydrophobic monolayer on car windshields to keep them clear of rain. Another application is an anti-adhesion coating on nanoimprint lithography (NIL) tools and stamps. One can also coat injection molding tools for polymer replication with a Perfluordecyltrichlorosilane SAM.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the forming}} process, some containers—particularly those {{intended}} for alcoholic spirits—undergo a [...] treatment {{to improve the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> of the inside, called internal treatment or dealkalization.

2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the <b>chemical</b> <b>resistance</b> of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds. [...] Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) {{have to take this}} in account.|$|E
