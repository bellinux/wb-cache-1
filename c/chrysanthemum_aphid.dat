5000|$|The <b>Chrysanthemum</b> <b>Aphid,</b> (Macrosiphoniella sanborni), is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants.|$|E
5000|$|... 100% of <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>aphids</b> can {{be killed}} by an aqueous {{solution}} of 0.1% hexaethyl tetraphosphate and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. 97% of <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>aphids</b> can {{be killed by}} 3 grams of a 10% solution of the chemical in 1000 cubic feet. 100% of helianthus aphids can be killed by an aqueous solution containing 0.05% each of hexaethyl tetraphosphate and sodium lauryl sulfate. 94% of pea aphids can be killed by exposure for 24 hours to an emulsion containing a concentration of 2.4% of the chemical. 90% of potato aphids can be killed by exposure for 42 hours to a one pint of a 50% solution of the chemical in 100 gallons of water.|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{important}} regulators of gene expression, affecting many biological processes. As yet, {{their roles in}} the response of <b>chrysanthemum</b> to <b>aphid</b> feeding have not been explored. Here, the identity and abundance of miRNAs induced by aphid infestation have been obtained using high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Three leaf small RNA libraries were generated, one from plants infested with the aphid Macrosiphoniella sanbourni (library A), one from plants with mock puncture treatment (library M), and the third from untreated control plants (library CK). A total of 7, 944, 797, 7, 605, 251 and 9, 244, 002 clean unique reads, ranging from 18 to 30 nucleotides (nt) in length, were obtained from library CK, A and M, respectively. As a result, 303 conserved miRNAs belonging to 276 miRNAs families and 234 potential novel miRNAs were detected in chrysanthemum leaf, out of which 80, 100 and 79 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the comparison of CK-VS-A, CK-VS-M and M-VS-A, respectively. Several of the differentially abundant miRNAs (in particular miR 159 a, miR 160 a, miR 393 a) {{may be associated with}} the plant's response to aphid infestation...|$|R
40|$|Florist's {{chrysanthemum}} (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) {{belongs to}} the Asteraceae family and represents {{the second most important}} floricultural crop in the world. Most genotypes are sensitive to aphids and infestations can lower quality and cause transmission of viruses. The protease inhibitor Sea Anemone Equistatin (SAE) carries three domains responsible for the inhibition of both cysteine and aspartic proteases. Artificial diet bioassays showed that SAE is readily toxic when ingested by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii. We transformed chrysanthemum genotype 1581 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation with the SAE gene {{under the control of the}} chrysanthemum RbcS promoter to induce aphid resistance. Non-choice leaf disk and whole plant bioassays were carried out to analyze deleterious effects of SAE on population growth and survival of both Myzus persicae and A. gossypii. After 7 days, M. persicae populations on specific transgenic lines were up to 69 % smaller relative to control populations in a whole plant bioassay. The mortality of cotton aphids was 11 % on control lines and up to 32 % on transgenic lines after 5 days. The results show that SAE may be a promising agent for the control of some aphid species in transgenic plants.
