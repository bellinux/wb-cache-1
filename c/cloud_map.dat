40|$|The high spatiotemporal {{variability}} of clouds requires automated monitoring systems. This study presents a retrieval algorithm that evaluates observations of a hemispherically scanning thermal infrared radiometer, the NubiScope, to produce georeferenced, spatially explicit <b>cloud</b> <b>maps.</b> The algorithm uses atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles and an atmospheric radiative transfer code {{to differentiate between}} cloudy and cloudless measurements. In case of a cloud, it estimates its position by using the temperature profile and viewing geometry. The proposed algorithm was tested with 25 <b>cloud</b> <b>maps</b> generated by the Fmask algorithm from Landsat 7 images. The overall cloud detection rate was ranging from 0. 607 for zenith angles of 0 to 10 ° to 0. 298 for 50 – 60 ° on a pixel basis. The overall detection of cloudless pixels was 0. 987 for zenith angles of 30 – 40 ° and much more stable over {{the whole range of}} zenith angles compared to cloud detection. This proves the algorithm’s capability in detecting clouds, but even better cloudless areas. Cloud-base height was best estimated up to a height of 4000 [*]m compared to ceilometer base heights but showed large deviation above that level. This study shows the potential of the NubiScope system to produce high spatial and temporal resolution <b>cloud</b> <b>maps.</b> Future development is needed for a more accurate determination of cloud height with thermal infrared measurements...|$|R

30|$|Automate drawing {{cannot be}} done by the FLUENT {{software}} because the model is relatively complex. You can import the 2 D and 3 D models drawn by CATIA into the preprocessor GAMBIT for grid. The conditions of the initial and boundary are set to solve the model, thus a lot of time can be saved. It is more convenient to draw a simple model directly from GAMBIT. The grid model with well-defined boundary conditions is imported into the solver. The appropriate solution method is selected by FLUENT based on the specific flow problem, and the solving equation is determined accordingly, which make the calculation process stable and the result more accurate. Finally the basic information is displayed for the flow field through the post-processing module, such as the speed vector, pressure <b>cloud</b> <b>map,</b> kinetic energy <b>cloud</b> <b>map,</b> and the other information required by the user, such as contour maps (including streamline maps, isobaric maps, etc.).

40|$|Abstract. With radar {{tracking}} algorithms, precipitation can be predicted {{up to three}} hours. Especially in road weather forecasts, however, surface temperature and cloudiness are other important objectives. Low surface temperatures while or after rainfall may cause slipperiness, and clearing is one effect pushing temperatures below the freezing level. Cloudiness {{and the difference between}} air and surface temperature both are parameters of the radiation balance. In this contribution, we show the relationship between them, proved at several stations all over Switzerland. We found a quadratic correlation coefficient of typically 60 %. One has to be careful in formulating a single equation for all stations, but we conclude that temperature difference is a signature for nocturnal cloudiness. We investigated nocturnal cloudiness for a case from winter 2002 in the canton of Lucerne in central Switzerland. There, temperature differences detected from an ultra-dense combination of two networks with together 55 stations were converted to a <b>cloud</b> <b>map.</b> A comparison between precipitation seen by radar, <b>cloud</b> <b>map</b> and surface temperatures shows that there are similar structures in all data. But not each area with high temperature difference is associated with clear sky. Especially in precipitation areas and with temperatures near the freezing point, we could identify other important effects (e. g. advection or the influence of melting heat) giving suggestions for ongoing work. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} map {{representation}} method of three-dimensional (3 D) environment by using B-spline surfaces, which are first {{used to describe}} large environment in 3 D map construction research. Initially, a 3 D point <b>cloud</b> <b>map</b> is constructed based on extracted line segments with two mutually perpendicular 2 D laser range finders (LRFs). Then two types of accumulated data sets are separated from the point <b>cloud</b> <b>map</b> according to different types of robot movements, continuous translation and continuous rotation. To express the environment more accurately, B-spline surface with covariance matrix is proposed to be extracted from each data set. Due to the random movements, there must be overlap between extracted B-spline surfaces. However, merging of two overlapping B-spline surfaces with different distribution directions of their control points is a complex problem, which is not well addressed by far. In our proposed method, each surface is divided into overlap and nonoverlap. Then generated sample points with propagated uncertainties from one overlap and their projection points located on the other overlap are merged using the product of Gaussian probability density functions. Based on this merged data set, a new surface is extracted to represent the environment instead of the two overlaps. Finally, proposed methods are validated by using the experimental result of an accurate representation of an indoor environment with B-spline surfaces...|$|E

In this paper we present maps and a catalogue containing the parameters of 29 individual molecular clouds in the complex, although more may be present. The distribution of molecular gas in the N 11 complex is highly structured. In the southwestern part of N 11, molecular clouds occur in a ring or shell surrounding the major OB star association LH 9. In the northeastern part, a chain of molecular clouds delineates the rim {{of one of the}} so-called supergiant shells in the LMC. There appears to be very little diffuse molecular gas in between the individual well-defined clouds, especially in the southwestern ring.
