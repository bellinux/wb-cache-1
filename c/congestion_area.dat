The results provide a portrait of congestion complete with a description of required infrastructure and services, which implemented will contribute significantly to a reduction in congestion.

5000|$|The {{first study}} {{conducted}} by the Department of Energy was completed in 2006. The study developed and compiled metrics of electricity transmission performance related to the magnitude and impact of congestion (e.g. the number of hours per year where the transmission constraint is loaded to its maximum safe operating level, etc.). Based on these data, the DOE identified three categories of congested areas which have higher levels of transmission congestion for the Eastern Interconnection and the Western Interconnection (ERCOT is excluded from these studies as the system is not under the purview of federal authority; no interstate commerce). The study classified areas of concern into three categories: Critical Congestion Areas, Congestion Areas of Concern, and Conditional Congestion Areas. [...] A Critical <b>Congestion</b> <b>Area</b> is an area which is “critically important to remedy existing or growing congestion problems because the current and/or projected effects of the congestion are severe.” Congestion Areas of Concern are areas where a “large-scale congestion problem exists or may be emerging, but more information and analysis appear to be needed to determine the magnitude of the problem and the likely relevance of transmission expansion and other solutions.” Conditional Congestion Areas are areas where there is “some transmission congestion at present, but significant congestions would result if large amounts of new generation resources were to be developed without simultaneous development of associated transmission capacity.” ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of {{compound}} indigo naturalis paster {{in the treatment of}} recurrent oral ulcer (ROU). Methods: A total of 140 patients with ROU who were admitted in our hospital from May, 2015 to May, 2016 were included in the study and randomized into the observation group and the control group with 70 cases in each group. The patients in the control group were given compound indigo naturalis paster, taken after breakfast, lunch, and supper, and 60 min before sleep, continuously for 7 d, vitamin B 2, 5 mg/time, 3 times/d, and vitamin C, 0. 2 g/time, 3 times/d, continuously for 4 weeks. On this basis, the patients in the observation group were given Zhibo Dihuang Pill, 8 pills/time, 3 times/d, continuously for 4 weeks. The <b>congestion</b> <b>area</b> and ulcer area before treatment and 3, 7 d after treatment were detected. FCM was used to detect the peripheral blood T cell subsets (CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 +). The full automatic biochemical analyzer was used to detect the values of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Results: With the extending of treatment time, the <b>congestion</b> <b>area</b> and ulcer area were significantly reduced when compared with the before treatment, and the reduced degree in the observation group was significantly superior to that in the control group. After treatment, CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 + were significantly elevated, while CD 8 + was significantly reduced when compared with the before treatment, and those in the observation group were significantly superior to those in the control group. After treatment, the values of IgG, IgA, and IgM were not significantly changed when compared with the before treatment, and the comparison between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Compound indigo naturalis paster in combined with Zhibo Dihuang pill in the treatment of ROU can effectively regulate the balance state of T cell subsets, improve the immunological function, shrink the <b>congestion</b> <b>area</b> and ulcer area, and enhance the therapeutic effect; therefore, it deserves to be widely recommended in the clinic...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of OpenFlow and Software Defined Networks brings new perspectives into how we design {{the next generation}} networks, where the number of base stations/access points {{as well as the}} devices per subscriber will be dramatically higher. In such dense environments, devices can communicate with each other directly and can attach to multiple base stations (or access points) for simultaneous data communication over multiple paths. This paper explores how networks can maximally enable this multi-path diversity through network programmability. In particular, we propose programmable flow clustering and set policies for inter-group as well as intra-group wireless scheduling. Further, we propose programmable demultiplexing of a single network flow onto multiple paths before the <b>congestion</b> <b>areas</b> and multiplexing them together post <b>congestion</b> <b>areas.</b> We show the benefits of such programmability first for legacy applications that cannot take advantage of multi-homing without such programmability. We then evaluate the benefits for smart applications that take advantage of multi-homing by either opening multiple TCP connections over multiple paths or utilizing a transport protocol such as MP-TCP designed for supporting such environments. More specifically, we built an emulation environment over Mininet for our experiments. Our evaluations using synthetic and trace driven channel models indicate that the proposed programmability in wireless scheduling and flow splitting can increase the throughput substantially for both the legacy applications and {{the current state of the}} art.

40|$|Abstract—Routing in Wireless Networks is {{challenging}} {{because of the}} unpredictable behavior of the medium and the random variations in channel condition. All of these factors lead to poor performance in multi-hop wireless mesh networks specially with the conventional routing. In order to exploit all the advantages that the wireless medium offers, new routing metrics must be explored. These metrics should come from across-layer approach {{in order to make}} the routing layer aware of the local issues of the underling layers. In this paper we investigate a new cross-layer routing metric that takes into account available bandwidth as well as the number of retransmissions, thus aiming to minimize end-to-end delay. The experimental results show that the proposed cross-layer metric improves the performance of routing in terms of end-to-end delay and network throughput by selecting paths with high available bandwidth while also avoiding areas of MAC congestion.

Despite of many advantages of free flight (such as less fuel consumption, minimum delays and the reduction of the workload of the air traffic control centers), it cause many problems such as conflicts (collisions) between different aircrafts.

40|$|Predicting {{potential}} {{consequences of}} Vapor Cloud Explosions (VCEs) {{has always been}} an important issue in safety assessments, because of the devastating damage that this phenomenon can create on (petro chemical) production sites. Although the TNO Multi-Energy method has been {{recognized as one of the}} best methods to predict blast overpressures of vapor cloud explosions, its application has been complicated by the required expert knowledge to choose a blast strength category and the congested fraction of the flammable cloud.
