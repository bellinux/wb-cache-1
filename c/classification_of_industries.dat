40|$|In {{this paper}} the writer {{analysed}} the regional structure of industries in Nara prefecture with new methods. They were {{the adoption of}} a new <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> according to locational characteristics and the drawing of four distribution maps of industrial productive power in Nara prefecture on the basis of crude added value. The new classification is proposed in "Regional stucture of Japnese industries ― a study on the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> according to location factors ―, 1967 " edited by a society for the study of industrial location. Crude added value is obtainable from the Census of Manufacture by Cities, Towns and Villages, 1963 and it is a most suitable index for the industrial productive power or activity, especially its density on a map. The distribution ratio of four groups, by the analysis of crude added value in Nara prefecture on the new classification, is as follows; local resources oriented type is 57. 3 %, living necessities (including printing and publishing) type, 25. 2 %, metal processing type, 9. 6 %, and specific resources oriented type, 7. 9 %. The high percentage of local resources oriented type and the low one of living necessities and metal processing types show that urbanization and industrialization have not been well advanced in Nara prefecture. Moreover, in looking over the four distribution maps of industrial productive power, it has been definitely shown that most of the industrial productive power or activity converge on the Nara basin which is divided into two parts, the northern and the southern parts by a clear line connecting the Yamato and the Hase which was pointed out by Shizue Kurematsu. In the northern part, Nara and Yamatokoriyama cities are the centers and a large percentage of living necessities types which characterize the northern industries, are made up of traditional industries which have grown with the development of those old cities. In the southern part, Yamatotakada city is the center and the majority of local resources oriented and metal processing types which are characteristic of the southern industries, in many ways, depends upon Osaka. Some of them have moved in from Osaka. Recently a considerable change has been coming over the regional structure of industries in Nara prefecture. The number of factories is fast increasing in Yamatokoriyama cities and its outskirts, thus forming a new great industrial center as Nara and Yamatotakada cities. The main factors for this increase are not only the positive luring of industries and the construction of a highwaytraffic network to industrial development areas in accordance with the Kinki Region Redevelopment Plan, but also an overflow of industries from the excessively industrially concentrated Hanshin Region...|$|E

As some kinds of specialization may be more favourable to regional income opportunities than others, there may be winning and losing regions depending on their characteristic specialization pattern. Relying on regional employment data from national data sources in a deep industrial break-down, I study the long-term structural change of regions from four countries depending on their initial kind of specialization, i. e., their initial set of industries with high or low scale economies and with high resource, labour, skill or research intensities. This approach requires a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> according to their characteristics, and of regions according to their industrial mix, by means of cluster analyses. This will help identifying types of regions like the core regions of each country with usually quite diversified industrial structures and a certain focus on more modern industries, like old industrialised regions {{with a focus on}} iron-and-steel or textiles, like peripheral regions with an initial focus on traditional labour intensive industries, and finally like some highly and very specifically specialised regions. The evolution of specialization is then analysed {{in the context of the}} identified type-classes of regions with similar specialization. While the overall change of regional specialization is slow and without a clear direction towards an increase or decrease, the analysis for types of regions yields some more explicit results. ...|$|E
40|$|Modern growth theory {{acknowledges}} that a country's economic prosperity depends {{in large part}} on its capacity for technological innovation. Empirical evidence, however, supports the view that not all sectors are equally innovative. As a result, it seems desirable from a public policy perspective to identify and promote sectors displaying both a high innovation rate and, in an increasingly competitive international economy, a high degree of international competitiveness. It is frequently argued that the high-tech industry sectors, in contrast to low-tech sectors, satisfy both conditions, with the clear implication that public policy should be directed to enhancing the performance of high-tech sectors. This approach raises at least two important issues. The first is whether such classifications can be meaningfully constructed given both the intractability of the concepts involved and the difficulties in data collection. A second issue is the basic assumption that policy emphasis should be placed on technology-intensive industries because they have a greater impact on growth. In this paper, we argue that while {{it may be possible to}} construct indices of technological intensity that are useful for some purposes, the ones that are currently proposed do not, in fact, address questions of economic growth and firm performance very well. In part, this is a reflection of the technicalities involved in formulating and operationalising the indices, but it also reflects problems in the underlying premise, namely technology-intensive sectors are more growth-inducing than low-tech sectors. We call, therefore, for the adoption of a more sophisticated and detailed approach that would provide a sensible <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> and new policy insights.

The matrix has been applied to data from a case-control study of lung cancer in which occupational histories were elicited by means of a postal questionnaire. Estimates of exposure to five known or suspected carcinogens (asbestos, chromates, cutting oils, formaldehyde, and inhaled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were compared with those obtained by detailed review of individual occupational histories. When the matrix was used exposures were attributed to jobs more frequently than on the basis of individual histories. Lung cancer was significantly more common among subjects classed by the matrix as having potential exposure to chromates, but neither method of assigning exposures produced statistically significant associations with asbestos or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Possible explanations for the failure to show a clear effect of these known carcinogens are discussed. The greater accuracy of exposures inferred directly from individual histories was reflected in steeper dose response curves for asbestos, chromates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The improvement over results obtained with the matrix, however, was not great.

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into two parts. The first part is an {{examination}} of the OECD <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> into high, medium and low technology industries, to look at the basis for this classification and to use that as a benchmark with which to classify the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data for the UK into similar groupings. The industries are ranked according to their research intensities and the rankings between the two datasets are compared. Some features of the UK rankings are highlighted and anomalies between the two datasets pointed out. The second part of the paper goes on to use the OECD classification into high, medium and low technology industries, applied to the CIS dataset, to contrast patterns of innovation in high technology industries with those in low technology industries. We build on the three types of innovation surveyed in the CIS, namely product, process and organisational innovation and contrast those types across high and low technology sectors. The expected relationship between high technology industries and product innovation holds - that enterprises tend to do more product innovation, the higher their research intensity. But process innovation does not conform to this pattern and there is not such a clear division between high and low technology industries. However the way they do process innovations differs with high technology industries more reliant on internal resources whereas lower technology industries tend to do it using external resources in collaboration with others. Organisational innovation is more complex, with certain types of innovation done as widely by lower technology industries as by the more research intensive industries. This supports the idea that all types of innovation should be considered, with the diffusion of ICTs making an impact across the technological spectrum of industries and showing up in various forms of organisational innovation...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1977. Bibliography: leaves 98 - 103. Microfiche. vii, 103 leavesThe neoclassical {{theory of}} {{production}} suggests that inter-country differences in labor productivity reflect {{the difference in}} factor proportions, mainly the capital-labor ratios, used by them. A decade ago, Richard R. Nelson questioned {{the validity of the}} neoclassical explanation applied to productivity differences between developed and less developed countries. He argued that the difference would be greater than the capital-labor ratio could explain, and that a key factor explaining productivity differentials would be the existence in less developed countries of large firms using older technology, which had been largely eliminated in the developed countries. He developed a simple two-technology "diffusion" model, tested it for the Colombian-U. S. manufacturing industries, and claimed that the evidence supported his model. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the model developed by Nelson. The model is tested for the comparison of value added per worker between Korea and the United States, Korea and Japan, and Japan and the United States. First, we tested the model by adopting Nelson's method which was used for his empirical test, and then we tested the extended model, which has more variables than the original model, by employing the regression analysis. The data used for the empirical tests was the census of manufactures in the three countries in 1972. We standardized our industrial classification system for international comparability. Basically, our <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> follows the international standard industrial classification scheme. The hypothesis tested for the original Nelson model was that the difference in the labor productivity should be the function of the relative size of the modern subsector in a less developed country. The empirical results of the three bilateral comparisons, Korea/U. S., Korea/Japan, and Japan/U. S., supported the hypothesis. However, the test results of the extended model indicated that the relative size of the modern subsector was not a significant variable. The main explanatory variable was the difference in labor productivity between two countries. The main conclusions we derived from this study were: 1. The neoclassical theory provides the explanation for observed differences in labor productivity between the developed countries. 2. However, when the explanations to be made are between developed and less developed countries, the neoclassical explanation appears to be incomplete. 3. Even though the statistical results do not entirely support the diffusion model, they do show more explanatory power than the neoclassical model...|$|E

We apply panel cointegration tests with group-mean panel dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) estimators suggested in Pedroni (2000, 2001) to examine the BSH. We also use persistence profiles in order to investigate the speed of adjustment to equilibrium in response to shocks on cointegrating relations, and employ them as a complementary tool for checking whether the long run relationships obtained from the tests are actually valid. Our main finding {{is that there is}} not enough evidence in favour of the BSH nor in favour of purchasing power parity (PPP) in either developed or developing countries. In developed countries, there is strong evidence that higher growth countries will experience real exchange rate appreciation. However, this relation does not provide evidence in favour of the BSH. We actually find opposing evidence that as productivity growth in traded goods relative to that in nontraded goods increases, the real exchange rated tends to depreciate. For developing countries, our results support the BSH. However, the speed of reversion to equilibrium is very slow. We also find moderate evidence that comparatively rapidly growing developing countries will experience real exchange rate depreciation.
