5000|$|... #Caption: A PEX <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{makes it}} {{possible}} to join copper and PEX pipes by simply pushing them together for a watertight fit.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{sizes of}} <b>{{compress}}ion</b> <b>fitting</b> {{do not have}} a single nut to compress the ferrule/olive but a flange with a ring of bolts that performs this task. The bolts have to be tightened down evenly.|$|E
5000|$|A {{metal or}} plastic ring used in {{plumbing}} {{as part of}} a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> along with a slip-on nut for making a liquid-tight connection when joining pipe or tubing. (These are informally called [...] "olives" [...] in the U.K.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Joining {{pipes and}} {{fittings}} together using soldering techniques, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> threaded fittings, and push-on fittings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are also}} used {{extensively}} for hot and cold water faucets (taps) and toilet stop valves; <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are well suited to this application, as these valves are usually located in confined spaces where copper pipe {{would be difficult to}} solder without creating a fire hazard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> for {{attaching}} tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules in them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{is determined by the}} ferrule, which is easily prone to damage. Thus care should be taken to when handling and tightening the fitting, although if the ferrule is damaged it is easily replaced.|$|E
50|$|Steam feed {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler, through the burner flame for superheating, and out to a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> on the valve chest. The slide valve is {{controlled}} by a fixed crank on the crankshaft. The engine is not reversible.|$|E
50|$|Compression Fittings: {{primarily}} seen on {{copper pipe}} spudguns, the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> squeezes a metal ring against the pipe between a nut and the fitting body {{to form the}} connection. Easier than solder fittings and requiring only a spanner {{they are much more}} expensive and are of greater weight.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are used}} in {{plumbing}} and electrical conduit systems to join two tubes or thin-walled pipes together. In instances where two pipes made of dissimilar materials are to be joined (most commonly PVC and copper), the fittings will be made {{of one or more}} compatible materials appropriate for the connection. <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> for attaching tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules (or olives in the UK) in them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cable and}} {{satellite}} television entities (as a near standard practice) use <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> with F Type Connectors on customer premises.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are not as}} robust as {{soldered}} fittings. They {{are typically}} used in applications where the fitting will not be disturbed and not subjected to flexing or bending. A soldered joint is highly tolerant of flexing and bending (such as when pipes knock or shake from sudden pressure changes). <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are much more sensitive to these type of dynamic stresses. They are also bulkier, and may be considered less aesthetically pleasing than a neatly soldered joint.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{traditional}} {{types of}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> standard (British type-A/non-manipulative) and flare fittings (British type-B/manipulative). Standard fittings require no {{modifications to the}} tubing. Flare fittings require modification of the tubing with a special tool. Standard fittings are typically used for water and compressed air connections, whereas flare fittings are used for gas and high pressure lines.|$|E
5000|$|An obturating ring is {{a ring of}} {{relatively}} soft material designed to obturate under pressure to form a seal. Obturating rings are often found in artillery and other ballistics applications, and similar devices are also used in other applications such as plumbing, like the olive in a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting.</b> The term [...] "O-ring" [...] is sometimes used to describe this kind of pressure seal.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical grooved {{couplings}} or Victaulic joints {{are also}} frequently used for frequent disassembly and assembly. Developed in the 1920s, these mechanical grooved couplings can operate up to [...] working pressures and available in materials {{to match the}} pipe grade. Another type of mechanical coupling is a Swagelok brand fitting; this type of <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> is typically used on small tubing under 0.75 in in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Copper pipes are {{typically}} joined by soldering, brazing, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> flaring, or crimping.Plastic pipes may {{be joined by}} solvent welding, heat fusion, or elastomeric sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Soft sealant {{technology}} for <b>compression</b> seal <b>fittings</b> {{was developed in}} the 1950s by Conax Technologies. Since then, <b>compression</b> seal <b>fittings</b> have evolved to include multiple variations for different applications. Some applications include: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are the {{industry}} standard for chemical, oil and gas, R&D, Bio-tech, and the semiconductor industry. They are used because {{of their ability to}} provide leak-tight seals. These fittings can be remade.|$|R
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as {{joint compound}} (pipe dope or thread seal tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E
5000|$|The {{straight}} {{sections of}} plumbing systems are called [...] "pipes" [...] or [...] "tubes". A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding, whereas a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe normally has thicker walls {{and may be}} threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing, <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> crimping, or for plastics, solvent welding. These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the piping and plumbing fittings article.|$|E
5000|$|In small sizes, the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> is {{composed}} of an outer compression nut and an inner compression ring or ferrule (sometimes referred to as an [...] "olive") that is typically made of brass or copper. Ferrules vary in shape and material but are most commonly {{in the shape of}} a ring with beveled edges. To work properly, the ferrule must be oriented correctlyâ€”usually the ferrule is fitted such that the longest sloping face of the ferrule faces away from the nut.|$|E
5000|$|Aqua - {{known as}} PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, {{consisting}} of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> In 2005, {{a large number}} of these fittings were recalled.|$|R
50|$|A newer type is push-in <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> These fit {{over the}} end of a tube using a grip ring to hold the sides of the tube and an O-ring to form a seal at the end.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are popular}} {{because they do}} not require soldering, so they are {{comparatively}} quick and easy to use. They require no special tools or skills to operate. They work at higher pressures and with toxic gases. <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are especially useful in installations that may require occasional disassembly or partial removal for maintenance etc., since these joints can be broken and remade without affecting the integrity of the joint. They are also used in situations where a heat source, in particular a soldering torch, is prohibited, or where it is difficult to remove remains of water from inside the pipe which prevent the pipe heating up to allow soldering.|$|R
5000|$|Flare {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{used with}} metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|E
50|$|In lieu of the CCTV system, docking {{distances}} were {{relayed to}} the bridge by portable radio. Berthing was complete within 5 minutes of the original fire alarm and fresh water was taken on board to replenish the Hi-fog fire suppression system whilst all 551 passengers were safely off-loaded. The fire brigade attended and the Hi-fog water mist was deactivated at their request. A nine-month Marine Accident Investigation Branch investigation found the fault to be incorrect fitting of a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> used for a high-pressure fuel line leading to fuel spraying and igniting upon contact with the hot turbo-charger unit.|$|E
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> or {{quick connect}} fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting,</b> {{also known}} as a sealing gland, is {{intended}} to seal some type of element (probe, wire, conductor, pipe, tube, fiber optic cable, etc.) when the element must pass through a pressure or environmental boundary. A <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting</b> may serve several purposes: ...|$|R
50|$|If {{frequent}} disconnection will be required, gasketed {{pipe flanges}} or union fittings provide better reliability than threads. Some thin-walled pipes of ductile material, {{such as the}} smaller copper or flexible plastic water pipes found in homes for ice makers and humidifiers, for example, may be joined with <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{very basic}} <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting</b> is {{composed}} of four mechanical parts: ...|$|R
5000|$|Easier installation. Installing PEX is {{much less}} labor-intensive than copper pipes, {{since there is no}} need to use torches to solder pipes together, or to use glue to attach pipes to fittings. One home {{inspector}} wrote that [...] "Once you've worked with PEX, you'll never go back to that other stinky glue stuff." [...] Builders putting in radiant heating systems found that PEX pipes [...] "made installation easy and operation problem-free". PEX connections can be made by pushing together two matching parts using a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> or by using an adjustable wrench or a special crimping tool. Generally, fewer connections and fittings are needed in a PEX installation.|$|E
5000|$|Taps are {{normally}} {{connected to the}} water supply {{by means of a}} [...] "swivel tap connector", which is attached {{to the end of the}} water pipe using a soldered or <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded [...] "tail" [...] of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink. A fibre washer (which expands when wet, aiding the seal) is used between the connector and the tap tail. Tap tails {{are normally}} 1/2" [...] in diameter for sinks and 3/4" [...] for baths, although continental Europe sometimes uses a 3/8" [...] (still imperial) size. The same connection method is used for a ballcock.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{critical}} to avoid over-tightening the nut or else {{the integrity of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> will be compromised by the excessive force. If the nut is overtightened the ferrule will deform improperly causing the joint to fail. Indeed, overtightening is {{the most common cause of}} leaks in compression fittings. A good rule of thumb is to tighten the nut first by hand until it is too difficult to continue and then tighten the nut one half-turn more with the aid of a wrench; the actual amount varies with the size of the fitting, as a larger one requires less tightening. The fitting is then tested: if slight weeping is observed, the fitting is gradually tightened until the weeping stops.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium is {{sometimes}} used {{due to its}} low cost, resistance to corrosion and solvents, and its ductility. Aluminium tube is more desirable than steel for the conveyance of flammable solvents, since it cannot create sparks when manipulated. Aluminium tubing can be connected by flare or <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> {{or it can be}} welded by the TIG or heliarc processes.|$|R
50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> glue, cement, flanges, or welding.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> (sometimes called [...] "lock-bush fittings") {{consist of}} a tapered, concave conical seat; a hollow, {{barrel-shaped}} compression ring (sometimes called a ferrule); and a compression nut which is threaded onto {{the body of the}} fitting and tightened to make a leakproof connection. They are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|R
