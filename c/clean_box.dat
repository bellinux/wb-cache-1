One hundred beetles were distributed into five polyethylene boxes, {{and then they were}} infected with T. solium eggs. Gravid proglottids of T. solium were crushed and then mixed with cattle feces.

Taenia solium eggs were present in the beetle's digestive system for up to 39 days (13 th sampling day out of 20), gradually reducing in numbers and viability, which was 0 on day 36 post-infection. Egg viability was around 40 % up to day 24 post-infection, with a median number of eggs of 11 per beetle at this time.

We tested (i) if pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca prefer <b>clean</b> nest <b>boxes</b> and (ii) if old nest material affects the number of parasites and the breeding success of pied flycatchers. In the first experiment we offered birds one <b>cleaned</b> nest <b>box</b> and one nest box with old nest material from the previous year.

40|$|Within {{the main}} {{olfactory}} system of mammals, a unique subsystem exists that {{is comprised of}} sensory neurons expressing odorant receptors (ORs) of the OR 37 subfamily. These receptors are exclusive for mammals and are highly conserved across species. The mouse OR 37 receptor subtypes A, B and C were shown to be activated by the long-chain aliphatic aldehydes pentadecanal, hexadecanal and heptadecanal, respectively. The search for biological sources of these compounds showed that bodily secretions from conspecifics activated the OR 37 A, B and C glomerulus. At the same time, the activity of cells in a target region of projection neurons from OR 37 glomeruli, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), was reduced compared with controls (<b>clean</b> test <b>box).</b> A large number of the activated cells in the PVN of mice that were placed into a <b>clean</b> test <b>box</b> were corticotropin-releasing hormone cells, indicating an induction of the stress axis due to the novel environment. The much lower number of activated cells of mice in a box enriched with bodily secretions from conspecifics indicated a reduced stress response. As bodily secretions from conspecifics activated the OR 37 system and simultaneously reduced stress-induced activation of the PVN, it was tested whether the ligands for OR 37 receptors could induce this effect. Indeed, a similarly reduced activity in the PVN was found in mice kept in a <b>clean</b> test <b>box</b> and exposed to a mixture of the OR 37 ligands delivered via an air stream.

40|$|In social animals, the {{presence}} of an affiliative conspecific alleviates acute stress responses, and this is called social buffering. We previously reported that social buffering mitigates the fear responses of male rats to auditory conditioned stimuli that had been paired with foot shocks. Subsequent studies revealed that signals that are perceived by the main olfactory epithelium are important for social buffering. Because olfactory signals are the signal perceived by the main olfactory epithelium, we hypothesized that we could induce the social buffering of conditioned fear responses by presenting olfactory signals that were derived from a conspecific. In order to test this hypothesis, we exposed fear-conditioned subjects to a conditioned stimulus either in a <b>clean</b> test <b>box</b> or in a test box that was odorized by keeping a conspecific in it as an odor donor beforehand. When the subjects were tested in the <b>clean</b> test <b>box,</b> they showed behavioral fear responses and enhanced Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus. In contrast, {{the presence}} of conspecific olfactory signals blocked these fear responses and Fos expression. These results suggested that olfactory signals suppress conditioned fear responses. Fos expression in the posteromedial region of the olfactory peduncle and amygdala suggested that this suppression involves the same neural mechanisms as those of social buffering. Taken together, we concluded that olfactory signals mediate the social buffering of conditioned fear responses...|$|R

Following its death the horse was partially dismembered; its lower jaw was removed, its tail and parts of its skin where cut from it, as were its hind legs and left forelimb, all below the knee. The now bloodied horse carcass was dragged, pulled and handled until it lay centrally within a pit {{on the outskirts of the}} settlement. The horse carcass was placed on its right-hand side, the remains of its head resting on its chest, its one remaining complete leg extended out away from the body. Once in position, soil was thrown into the pit, until the horse carcass was no longer visible. There the horse lay, the remaining soft tissue being slowly consumed by bacteria from the horses’ own gut and the soil which now enclosed it, until only the bones survived.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMammography is a {{radiological}} {{diagnostic method}} which relies on an X-ray examination of breasts {{and is a}} process involving the use of low-dose amplitude-X-rays (usually around 0. 7 mSv). Combining the use of small doses and high quality images requires extensive quality protocols, part of them being included in regulations adopted by the Minister of Health. AimThe {{aim of this study}} was to check the usefulness and efficacy of selected quality tests associated with mammography. Material/methodsThe study was performed in the mammography service of the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Poznan. Following equipment was used: densitometer, sensitometer, mammographic scales, electronic scales, thermometer, hygrometer, PMMA plates, Europhantom, screen film contact phantom, viewing boxes and magnifying glasses. The methods were based on basic mammography tests. Quality control in mammography demands: clean darkroom, marked and clean cassettes, <b>clean</b> viewing <b>boxes</b> with homogenous light. ResultsThe results of the “Development Process” test show that each sensitometer has to be used with an appropriate densitometer. Phantoms with abnormal structures cannot be used to “AEC System – Solidity exposure” test. “Compression – The force of compression” test may only be carried out with suitable scales and compressible material. Analysis of rejected films shows that the main reasons for rejection were wrong collimation and underexposure.
