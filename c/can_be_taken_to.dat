5|$|Edmund {{cannot be}} placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic {{evidence}} suggests he succeeded Æthelweard. According to the historian Susan Ridyard, Abbo of Fleury's statement that Edmund was 'ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus' <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{mean that he}} was descended from a noble and ancient race.|$|E
5|$|Several {{measures}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> control {{infection in}} aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing {{the quantity of}} feed given to fish {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|Scots law {{provides}} for {{three types of}} courts responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and heraldic. The supreme civil court is the Court of Session, although civil appeals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (or before 1 October 2009, the House of Lords). The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at Parliament House, in Edinburgh, which was {{the home of the}} pre-Union Parliament of Scotland with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the Lawnmarket. The sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country. District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by Justice of the Peace Courts from 2008 to 2010. The Court of the Lord Lyon regulates heraldry.|$|E

25|$|Shorter code lengths can be {{used for}} {{palettes}} smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} where doctors {{are unable to}} compel patients to take their treatment (e.g., the UK), some say that urine testing only results in unhelpful confrontations with patients and does not help increase compliance. In {{countries where}} legal measures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> force patients to take their medication (e.g., the US), then urine testing can be a useful adjunct in assuring compliance.|$|E
