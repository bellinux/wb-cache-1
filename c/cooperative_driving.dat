40|$|AbstractChaperonins use ATPase cycling {{to promote}} {{conformational}} changes leading to protein folding. The prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL requires a cofactor, GroES, {{which serves as}} a “lid” enclosing substrates in the central cavity and confers an asymmetry on GroEL required for <b>cooperative</b> transitions <b>driving</b> the reaction. The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT does not have such a cofactor but appears to have a “built-in” lid. Whether this seemingly symmetric chaperonin also operates through an asymmetric cycle is unclear. We show that unlike GroEL, TRiC does not close its lid upon nucleotide binding, but instead responds to the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Further, nucleotide analogs inducing this transition state confer an asymmetric conformation on TRiC. Similar to GroEL, lid closure in TRiC confines the substrates in the cavity and is essential for folding. Understanding the distinct mechanisms governing eukaryotic and bacterial chaperonin function may reveal how TRiC has evolved to fold specific eukaryotic proteins...|$|R

40|$|Enhanced {{coupling}} {{of material}} properties offers new fundamental insights and routes to multifunctional devices. In this context 5 d oxides provide new paradigms of <b>cooperative</b> interactions <b>driving</b> novel emergent behavior. This is exemplified in 5 d osmates that host a metal-insulator transition (MIT) driven by magnetic order. Here {{we consider the}} most robust case, the 5 d perovskite NaOsO 3, and reveal a giant coupling between spin and phonon through a frequency shift of Δω= 40 cm- 1, the largest measured in any material. We identify the dominant octahedral breathing mode and show isosymmetry with spin ordering which induces dynamic charge disproportionation that sheds {{new light on the}} MIT. The occurrence of the dramatic spin-phonon-electronic coupling in NaOsO 3 is due to a property common to all 5 d materials: the large spatial extent of the 5 d ion. This allows magnetism to couple to phonons on an unprecedented scale and consequently offers multiple new routes to enhanced coupled phenomena...|$|R

30|$|Modification mica with {{divalent}} salts to adsorb DNA is more {{simple and}} thus practicable. However, {{the mechanism of}} divalent-ion-mediated DNA adsorption is still in dispute. Hansma et al. [31] initially ascribed that divalent cations penetrate into the “cavities” on mica surface and react with the interfacial hydroxyl groups. However, the subsequent works proposed that DNA adsorption {{is dominated by the}} <b>cooperative</b> effect <b>driving</b> condensation with divalent cations, subsequently reacting with surface groups [32]. More recently, there are several researches considering the binding due to the ion-correlation effect [12, 13, 33]. Anyway, the real binding mechanism still requires us to make it clearer. Besides, it is interesting to indicate that some transitional metals cations (Ni 2 +, Co 2 +, Zn 2 +) are effective in DNA adsorption, whereas others (Mn 2 +, Ca 2 +, Hg 2 +) seem not helpful. Apart from ions species, the DNA immobilization and conformation are also influenced by ionic strength [34], DNA concentration [11, 35] and competition effect among different valence ions [13, 33, 36]. Anyhow, the above-mentioned factors are still not fully understood, and the effects need to be further discussed.|$|R
40|$|Ultimate goal of next {{generation}} Vehicle-to-everything (V 2 X) communication systems is enabling accident-free <b>cooperative</b> automated <b>driving</b> {{that uses the}} available roadway efficiently. To achieve this goal, the communication system will need to enable a diverse set of use cases, each with {{a specific set of}} requirements. We discuss the main use case categories, analyze their requirements, and compare them against the capabilities of currently available communication technologies. Based on the analysis, we identify a gap and point out towards possible system design for 5 G V 2 X that could close the gap. Furthermore, we discuss an architecture of the 5 G V 2 X radio access network that incorporates diverse communication technologies, including current and cellular systems in centimeter wave and millimeter wave, IEEE 802. 11 p and vehicular visible light communications. Finally, we discuss the role of future 5 G V 2 X systems in enabling more efficient vehicular transportation: from improved traffic flow through reduced inter-vehicle spacing on highways and coordinated intersections in cities (the cheapest way to increasing the road capacity), to automated smart parking (no more visits to the parking!), ultimately enabling seamless end-to-end personal mobility.

40|$|Abstract. Modern cars offer drivers {{support with}} the help of a number of driver {{assistance}} systems. Those systems aim to re-lieve drivers through assumption of sub parts of the driving task (e. g. in case of an Adaptive Cruise Control by regulation of vehicle speed and time gap to preceding vehicle). Today, systems are controlled and monitored separately which leads to ef-forts to combine the functionality of all systems in an overlying assistance for drivers. The approach of the University of Tech-nology Darmstadt is called Conduct-by-Wire and can be seen as a <b>cooperative</b> maneuver-based <b>driving</b> paradigm, where the driver gives maneuver command to the systems which are automatically executed. This paper summarizes the results of three studies which investigated the user acceptance of this driving paradigm. Overall, it can be said that the acceptance of the sys-tem depends on personal traits of the driver and on the driving situation. Almost all participants are willing to use Conduct-by-Wire for routine tasks such as commuting, which makes the systems interesting for company cars. Still, there remain a number of drivers who are not willing to use such a highly automated system at all...|$|R

To examine <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> behavior Time Headway, a measure of distance relative to speed, and the participants’ intentions were used to label a behavior as cooperative. Further the participants’ perceived risk and perceived cooperation were recorded. Significant group differences were discovered regarding the intentions, perceived risks and perceived cooperation...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{of information and}} communication technologies (ICT) have enabled vehicles to timely communicate with each other through wireless technologies, which will form future (intelligent) traffic systems (ITS) consisting of so-called connected vehicles. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> with the connected vehicles is regarded as a promising driving pattern to significantly improve transportation efficiency and traffic safety. Nevertheless, unreliable vehicular communications also introduce packet loss and transmission delay when vehicular kinetic information or control commands are disseminated among vehicles, which brings more challenges in the system modelling and optimization. Currently, no data has been yet available for the calibration and validation of a model for ITS, and most research has been only conducted for a theoretical point of view. Along this line, this paper focuses on the (theoretical) development of a more general (microscopic) traffic model which enables the <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> behaviour via a so-called inter-vehicle communication (IVC). To this end, we design a consensus-based controller for the <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> system (CDS) considering (intelligent) traffic flow that consists of many platoons moving together. More specifically, the IEEE 802. 11 p, the de-facto vehicular networking standard required to support ITS applications, is selected as the IVC protocols of the CDS, in order to investigate how the vehicular communications affect the features of intelligent traffic flow. This study essentially explores the relationship between IVC and <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving,</b> which can be exploited as the reference for the CDS optimization and design...|$|E
40|$|With the {{advances}} of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, individual vehicles can now exchange information to improve traffic safety, and some vehicles can further improve safety and efficiency by coordinating their mobility via <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving.</b> To facilitate these applications, {{many studies have}} {{been focused on the}} design of inter-vehicle message dissemination protocols. However, most existing designs either assume individual driving pattern or consider <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> only. Moreover, few of them fully exploit infrastructures, such as cameras, sensors, and road-side units (RSUs). In this paper, we address the design of message dissemination that supports heterogeneous driving patterns. Specifically, we first propose an infrastructure-assisted message dissemination framework that can utilize the capability of infrastructures. We then present a novel beacon scheduling algorithm that aims at guaranteeing the timely and reliable delivery of both periodic beacon messages for <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> and event-triggered safety messages for individual driving. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we develop both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. Extensive numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol...|$|E

40|$|The {{upcoming}} {{deployment of}} vehicular ad-hoc networks does not only facilitate novel telematics applications, but also poses strong requirements on security. Especially {{the adoption of}} active safety applications may raise new threats to road safety if security issues are not properly handled, thus thwarting their initial purpose. In this paper, a special active safety application is considered that enables <b>cooperative</b> foresighted <b>driving</b> through the exchange of local danger warnings, {{which are based on}} individual observations and refer to the current road condition. From a security point of view, the decision whether or not such an application should rely on a reported hazard, is a crucial issue, which cannot be completely protected by conventional security measures. We propose an additional security mechanism based on an information centric evaluation of the plausibility of received hazard messages. We developed four decision methods, which are based on voting schemes, and evaluated them by simulation using two attacks trying to manipulate the decision process by distributing false information. Our results indicate that the proposed information centric evaluation of remote observations is a reasonable means to increase the stability and security of a cooperative local danger warning service. ...|$|R

A stochastic approach to open-system control is developed, using a generalized version of Krotov's iterative algorithm, with {{no need for}} Markovian or rotating-wave approximations. The application to a harmonic degree of freedom reveals <b>cooperative</b> effects of <b>driving</b> and dissipation that a standard Markovian treatment cannot capture.

40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> {{enables a}} more {{efficient}} use of existing infrastructure which reduces the expenditures and land use for new roads. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> is based on intelligent communication between vehicles and between vehicles and their environment. Vehicles can drive closer to each other due to the capability of forming a platoon with <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> technology. Human reaction times are too large to drive closely behind another vehicle and today’s advanced cruise control systems have their own problems. The Grand <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Driving</b> Challenge (GCDC), organized by TNO, aims at accelerating {{the development and implementation}} of <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> technologies. The first finals will be in May 2011, where teams have to negotiate their vehicles as efficiently as possible through a range of predetermined traffic scenarios on public roads. In the Swedish CoAct project students and researchers from Chalmers will develop a platform that will be installed in a Volvo S 60. This platform is divided in different modules, hence this report represents the work on the Rules and Logic. The goal of this part of the project is to determine the state of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>driving</b> platform, by means of communication between vehicles and the environment, and pass this information through to the controller module, and other vehicles on the road. The joining process is essential for the Rules and Logic, therefore every step of the joining scenario’s are explained in detail. Together with the platooning operations and its definitions the functions of the Rules and Logic module are determined. This module is implemented in a stateflow chart based on the state diagram of the GCDC. In order to validate the Rules and Logic and the Controller modules, simulations should be performed. Stability and safety aspects must be proved before implementing the system in the Volvo S 60. Tests on the Volvo S 60 must be performed to validate if the behavior of the vehicle is as expected, matching the results of the simulations. The Rules 2 ̆ 6 amp; Logic module is proved working, with respect to the scope of this project, in the tested simulations. The final version it needs to be improved with more knowledge of the controller. The performance of the joining algorithm is influenced by the following part of the controller and therefore it is important to give this issue sufficient attention. This together with the vehicle to infrastructure communication part on the Rules and Logic Module is for future work...|$|E

Further, the cell of origin of glioblastoma is largely elusive. By targeting a p 53 in-frame deletion mutation to the brain, we show that p 53 deficiency provides no significant growth advantage to adult brain cells, but appears to induce pleiotropic accumulation of <b>cooperative</b> oncogenic alterations <b>driving</b> gliomagenesis. Our data show that accumulation of a detectable level of mutant p 53 proteins occurs first in neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and that subsequent expansion of mutant p 53 -expressing Olig 2 + transit-amplifying progenitor-like cells in the SVZ-associated areas initiates glioma formation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelf-organization in {{developing}} living organisms {{relies on the}} capability of cells to duplicate and perform a collective motion inside the surrounding environment. Chemical and mechanical interactions coordinate such a <b>cooperative</b> behaviour, <b>driving</b> the dynamical evolution of the macroscopic system. In this work, we perform an analytical and computational analysis to study pattern formation during the spreading of an initially circular bacterial colony on a Petri dish. The continuous mathematical model addresses the growth and the chemotactic migration of the living monolayer, together with the diffusion and consumption of nutrients in the agar. The governing equations contain four dimensionless parameters, accounting for the interplay among the chemotactic response, the bacteria-substrate interaction and the experimental geometry. The spreading colony {{is found to be}} always linearly unstable to perturbations of the interface, whereas branching instability arises in finite-element numerical simulations. The typical length scales of such fingers, which align in the radial direction and later undergo further branching, are controlled by the size parameters of the problem, whereas the emergence of branching is favoured if the diffusion is dominant on the chemotaxis. The model is able to predict the experimental morphologies, confirming that compact (resp. branched) patterns arise for fast (resp. slow) expanding colonies. Such results, while providing new insights into pattern selection in bacterial colonies, may finally have important applications for designing controlled patterns...|$|R
40|$|Prefigurative {{politics}} is a resurgent concept, seeking to explain a diverse array of social phenomena, from Occupy Wall Street to car-sharing <b>cooperatives.</b> The <b>driving</b> force behind these activities {{is said to be}} a combination of dashed hopes for a better post-Cold War world and the widespread negative social impacts of neoliberal globalization. Although located in the Global South, Southern Africa is not immune to these pressures and processes. Indeed, the region is rife with a number of activities and organisations demonstrating features of prefigurative politics. Taken together, however, it is unlikely that these activities constitute a ‘prefigurative moment’ in the region’s politics. So ubiquitous in theory and practice is the idea of the modern Western state as locus of ‘a better life for all’ that prefigurative impulses are quickly colonized by state-centered, mainstream actors, forces and factors. At present, significant student movements are underway in South Africa, #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall, suggesting possibilities for meaningful change not through disengagement from the state, but by directly confronting it in deliberate and coordinated ways. This demonstration of what A. O. Hirschman calls ‘voice’ is dissimilar to the general trends of ‘exit’ or ‘loyalty’ among individuals, groups and communities across the region. While all of these activities are indicative of a strong desire for a better life for all, transformational change in southern Africa requires strategic political thinking and action. Only the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall student protests suggest movement, albeit nascent, in this direction...|$|R
