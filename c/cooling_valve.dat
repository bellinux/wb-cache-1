50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid <b>cooling.</b> <b>Valve</b> springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from {{the heat of the}} intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique 14mm AF 32 Autolite sparkplugs specified because of their smaller size (5/8 inch wrench vs. 13/16 inch wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.|$|E

40|$|Good HVAC control schemes in {{buildings}} help reduce energy use and maintain occupant comfort. PID controllers {{are widely used}} in commercial buildings to keep variables such as temperature, pressure and humidity at predefined setpoints. These controllers, {{when they do not}} include autotuners, must be carefully tuned. Also, one must consider the effect of interactions occurring among the control loops during the fine-tuning stage so one loop response is not improved to the detriment of another. This research emphasizes PI-control of dual duct systems. Three tuning methods (Ziegler and Nichols' sensitivity method, simplified IMC-PID method, and Bekker et al. method) were selected and tested on a small scale dual duct system with four decentralized control loops (<b>cooling</b> <b>valve,</b> fan speed, damper and heater). Each controller was tuned according to the best performing set of tuning parameters and the system was then operated under design conditions to observe the interactions among the control loops. Since interaction was minimum, a better understanding of interaction was obtained by introducing a sustained oscillation in each loop, one loop at a time. An oversensitive valve was found to have a severe effect on damper control loop and an oversensitive damper was found to interact with fan speed control. Considering these interaction effects, two sets of optimizing curves were developed for the dual duct system. The use of these curves improved some loop responses without rendering other loops unstabl...|$|E

40|$|Good HVAC control schemes in {{buildings}} help reduce energy use and maintain occupant comfort. During the last 10 years, VAV-HVAC systems {{are widely used}} in commercial buildings because they can reduce energy use significantly and provide good temperature control of the conditioned spaces compared to CV-HVAC systems. However, the controls for VAV systems are somewhat difficult and further {{research in this area}} still needs to be carried out. This research will focus on local control loop interactions and operating strategies for VAV control systems. To reach this objective, experiments were conducted in a two-zone VAV test facility. The facility consists of six control loops (<b>cooling</b> <b>valve,</b> fan speed, two dampers, two electric heaters) activated by DDC PI controllers. Experiments were conducted in this facility and the results were processed, and analyzed in this thesis. The steady state and dynamic characteristics of a VAV-HVAC control system has been studied. The interaction between control loops of a VAV system operating under (i) open-loop, (ii) closed-loop control modes were evaluated. Also six local loops were tuned and optimal range of controller gains for single-loop and multi-loop VAV system operation were determined. Experiments were conducted to compare the operating performance of Pressure Independent Control (PIC) and Pressure Dependent Control (PDC) strategies. The results show that PIC strategy is more stable than PDC. However, a finely tuned PDC strategy gives good room temperature control compared to PIC. The results of this research will help building engineers identify operating problems and interactions between local loops in VAV systems. In addition, the optimal range of controller gains obtained in this research can offer guidelines in PID controller tuning. Moreover, the tests conducted provide experimental data to building engineers and researchers for model development and control desig...|$|E

40|$|Automatic fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) {{can help enhance}} building energy efficiency by facilitating early detection of occurrence of system faults, especially those of air-conditioning systems, thus enabling rectification of the faults before much energy is wasted due to such faults. However, building owners may not invest in FDD unless they are convinced of the energy cost savings that can be achieved. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room air temperature sensor offset, stuck VAV box damper, supply air temperature sensor offset, stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking <b>cooling</b> coil <b>valve.</b> The simulation results indicate that some faults may significantly increase energy use in buildings, for example, negative room air temperature sensor offset, stuck open VAV box damper, negative supply air temperature sensor offset, stuck open outdoor air damper and stuck open and leaking <b>cooling</b> coil <b>valve.</b> Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available. Some other faults, e. g. positive supply air temperature sensor offset, positive room air temperature sensor offset, stuck closed <b>cooling</b> coil <b>valve</b> and stuck closed VAV box damper, may allow less energy to be used but will lead to unbearable indoor environmental conditions, such as high indoor temperature.
