All patients were eligible for BCT according to conventional imaging, and underwent preoperative MRI as part of this study. One hundred and sixty-five patients (166 tumors) were included. MRI was defined to have <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> if conventional imaging underestimated or overestimated tumor extent (by more than 10 mm compared to histology) and MRI assessed the extent accurately. Logistic regression was employed to identify characteristics that are predictive of the <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> of preoperative MRI.

Patients < 58 years old with irregular lesion margins at mammography and discrepancy in tumor extent by more than 10 mm between mammography and ultrasonography had a 3. 2 x higher chance of accurate assessment at MRI (positive predictive value 50 %, negative predictive value 84 %, p= 0. 0002). Preoperative MRI in patients eligible for BCT is more accurate than conventional imaging in the assessment of tumor extent in approximately one out of four patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> of {{information}} from functional capacity evaluation (FCE) for insurance physicians (IPs) who assess the physical work ability of claimants with long-term musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). METHOD: A post-test only design {{was used in the}} context of disability claims. Twenty-eight IPs participated in the study. Claimants with MSD formed the patient population. For each IP, the first claimant who agreed to participate was included in the study, and underwent FCE in addition to the regular disability claim assessment. Firstly, the IP performed the statutory disability claim assessment. Secondly, the FCE assessment took place. Finally, a self-formulated questionnaire was presented to the IPs after they viewed the FCE report. IPs were asked whether they perceived FCE information to be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> to their judgment of the claimant's physical work ability investigated. We considered FCE information to be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> if more than 66 % of the IPs indicated as such. IPs were also asked whether FCE information led them to change their initial judgment about the claimant's physical work ability, and whether they felt this information made them more confident about their ultimate judgement. Finally, they were asked whether they planned to include FCE information in future disability claims and for what type of claimants. Differences between IPs who did or did not experience <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> were explored. RESULTS: Of the 28, 19 (nearly 68 %) IPs considered FCE information to be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> for their assessment of claimants with MSD. Half of the IPs stated that FCE information reinforced their judgment. All but four IPs changed their assessment after reading the FCE report. Sixteen IPs intended to involve FCE information in future disability claim assessments. There were no observed differences between the IPs who did or did not consider the FCE information to be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value.</b> CONCLUSION: FCE information was found to have <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> at present and in the future according to most IPs in the assessment of the physical work ability of claimants with MSD.

30|$|An {{important}} {{strategic decision}} within {{the food industry}} is to achieve the optimal product portfolio allowing an organization to support its customers {{in the best possible}} way. Numerous models exist to categorize products based on their relative metrics like revenue, volume, margin or constructed scores. In order to make a more profound decision whether to keep or to remove a product from the portfolio a closer look into product interdependencies is desirable. Hence, by exploring existing DM-techniques through literature and evaluating those DM-techniques that seem suited in a PPM-context by applying each to a dataset, we aim to identify those techniques that complement a Product Portfolio Management process in the food industry. Three DM-techniques were selected: Dependency Modeling, Change and Deviation Detection, and Classification. Of these three techniques, two were found to be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> in a PPM-context, Dependency modeling and Classification, respectively. Change and deviation detection was found to be of no <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> in a PPM-context due to it forecasting future data points based on historical data, which results in future data points never exceeding the maximum historical data points. However, change and deviation detection could be of <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> in another context. Finally, we propose an algorithm to visualize the data-driven product classifications in a standard portfolio matrix which portfolio managers can intuitively understand.|$|E

40|$|Using a bioinformatics-based strategy, {{we set out}} to {{identify}} hypermethylated genes that could serve as biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) in stool. In addition, the <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> to a Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) was evaluated. Candidate genes were selected by applying cluster alignment and computational analysis of promoter regions to microarray-expression data of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. DNA methylation was measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR on 34 normal colon mucosa, 71 advanced adenoma, and 64 CRC tissues. The performance as biomarker was tested in whole stool samples from in total 193 subjects, including 19 with advanced adenoma and 66 with CRC. For a large proportion of these series, methylation data for GATA 4 and OSMR were available for comparison. The <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> to FIT was measured in stool subsamples from 92 subjects including 44 with advanced adenoma or CRC. Phosphatase and Actin Regulator 3 (PHACTR 3) was identified as a novel hypermethylated gene showing more than 70 -fold increased DNA methylation levels in advanced neoplasia compared with normal colon mucosa. In a stool training set, PHACTR 3 methylation showed a sensitivity of 55 % (95 % CI: 33 - 75) for CRC and a specificity of 95 % (95 % CI: 87 - 98). In a stool validation set, sensitivity reached 66 % (95 % CI: 50 - 79) for CRC and 32 % (95 % CI: 14 - 57) for advanced adenomas at a specificity of 100 % (95 % CI: 86 - 100).

A diagnostic prospective cross-sectional study was chosen as design. Besides clinical routine workup (including TTE/TEE), CTA was performed to assess its diagnostic accuracy and <b>complementary</b> diagnostic/therapeutic <b>value.</b> For the diagnostic accuracy, the reference standard was surgical findings or clinical follow-up. To determine the <b>complementary</b> diagnostic/therapeutic <b>value</b> an expert-panel was used as reference standard. Twenty-eight patients were included.

Diagnostic accuracy of routine clinical workup plus CTA was superior to clinical routine workup alone for the detection of PHV endocarditis in general, vegetations and peri-annular extension. This study demonstrates that CTA and clinical workup including TTE and TEE are complementary in patients with PHV endocarditis.

This research use qualitative research approach and its data analysis applies textual analysis approach, content analysis method, framework for analysis, and coding. This study concludes (1) The mathematical values in the curriculum applied in Victoria are rationalism, objectism, control, progress, openness, and mystery; (2) In the Victorian textbook, the dominant mathematical values are objectism over rationalism, control over progress, and mystery over openness. The mathematical value of rationalism is mainly represented {{by the use of}} context [...] - nil, and its <b>complementary</b> <b>value,</b> objectism, is mostly presented by symbolisation adopted in texts. The mathematical value of control in the Victorian textbook is most frequently presented by the value signal use of imperatives and progress, as its <b>complementary</b> <b>value,</b> is mostly represented by the value signal example of mathematics contributing to societal progress. Predominantly, the mathematical value of openness is represented by interpersonal distance [...] - use of pronoun “you” and related forms and its <b>complementary</b> <b>value,</b> mystery, is mainly conveyed through presenting the value signal use of specialist vocabulary; (3) In the Victorian textbook, objectism values dominate the ideological components and the value signal symbolisation adopted, dominates the objectism values. This supports the Victorian curriculum which stresses the use of symbols. Rationalism, control, openness, and mystery values which frequently appear in the Victorian textbook are in line with the Victorian curriculum which emphasizes these values, even though rationalism is presented not as often as objectism, and openness values are presented much less frequently than mystery as the complementary pair.

ECG-triggered multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), 18 -fluorine-fluorodesoxyglucose {{positron emission tomography}} including low-dose CT (FDG-PET) and three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE) may have additional value. This paper reviews the role of these novel imaging tools {{in the field of}} PHV obstruction and endocarditis. For acquired PHV obstruction, MDCT is of additional value in mechanical PHVs to differentiate pannus from thrombus as well as to dynamically study leaflet motion and opening/closing angles. For biological PHV obstruction, additional imaging is not beneficial as it does not change patient management. When performed on top of 2 D-TTE/TEE, MDCT has additional value for the detection of both vegetations and pseudoaneurysms/abscesses in PHV endocarditis. FDG-PET has no <b>complementary</b> <b>value</b> for the detection of vegetations; however, it appears more sensitive in the early detection of pseudoaneurysms/ abscesses. Furthermore, FDG-PET enables the detection of metastatic and primary extra-cardiac infections. Evidence for the additional value of 3 D-TEE is scarce. As clinical implications are major, clinicians should have a low threshold to perform additional MDCT in acquired mechanical PHV obstruction.
