40|$|Marine soft sediments are {{the second}} largest habitat on Earth. How animal {{communities}} in this habitat are structured is a central issue in marine ecology. Food is an important limiting factor for many benthic populations, and settling organic matter from phytoplankton blooms is of vital importance to them. This thesis discusses the effects of settling phytoplankton blooms on benthic meiofaunal populations in the Baltic Sea and how species interactions affect the fate of settled organic matter. Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea has altered phytoplankton community dynamics, with indications that toxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms may reach the benthos in greater quantity than previously. Paper I found that meiofauna feed on settled cyanobacteria, yet suffer no increase in mortality. However, growth of meiofauna is significantly slower on a diet of cyanobacteria than when fed spring bloom diatoms, indicating that the studied cyanobacteria are nutritionally poor (Paper II). In Paper III {{we found that the}} presence of macrofauna reduces the access of meiofauna to settled organic matter, presumably through interference competition that increases when several macrofauna species are present. We also found that meiofaunal populations influence the provision of ecosystem services by benthic microbes. Paper IV shows that when meiofauna is abundant, mineralization of organic matter is positively affected, presumably through facilitation mechanisms. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>paper</b> V reports that degradation of the contaminant naphtalene decreases significantly at high meiofauna abundance. In conclusion, this thesis shows that type and quality of organic matter available, as well as competition from macrofauna, affect how meiofauna grow and incorporate nutrients. Furthermore we found meiofauna to be an important functional component of the benthic ecosystem, with marked effects on ecosystem processes such as nutrient regeneration and contaminant degradation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the nature of biomaterial interactions with compromised host tissue sites. Both ocular and dermal tissues can be wounded, following injury, disease or surgery, and consequently require the use of a biomaterial. Clear analogies exist between the cornea/tear film/contact lens and the dermal wound bed/wound fluid/skin adhesive wound dressing. The work described in this thesis builds upon established biochemistry to examine specific aspects of the interaction of biomaterials with compromised ocular and dermal tissue sites, with a particular focus on the role of vitronectin. Vitronectin is a prominent cell adhesion glycoprotein present in both tear fluid and wound fluid, and has a role in the regulation and upregulation of plasmin. The interaction of contact lenses with the cornea was assessed by a novel on-lens cell-based vitronectin assay technique. Vitronectin mapping showed that vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion to contact lens surfaces was due to the contact lens-corneal mechanical interaction rather than deposition out of the tear film. This deposition is associated predominantly with the peripheral region of the posterior contact lens surface. The locus of vitronectin deposition on the contact lens surface, which is affected by material modulus, is potentially an important factor in the generation of plasmin in the posterior tear film. Use of the vitronectin mapping technique on ex vivo bandage contact lenses revealed greater vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion to the contact lens surfaces in comparison to lenses worn in the healthy eye. The results suggest that vitronectin is more readily deposited from the impaired corneal tissue bed than the intact healthy tissue bed. Significantly, subjects with a deficient tear film were found to deposit high vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion levels to the BCL surface, thus highlighting the influence of the contact lens-tissue interaction upon deposition. Biomimetic principles imply that adhesive materials for wound applications, including hydrogels and hydrocolloids, should closely match the surface energy parameters of skin. The surface properties of hydrocolloid adhesives were found to be easily modified by contact with siliconised plastic release liners. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>paper</b> release liners did not significantly affect the adhesive surface properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine {{recommends}} Survivorship Care Plans (SCPs) for all cancer survivors. However, it {{is unclear}} whether certain patient groups may or may not benefit from SCPs. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess whether the effects of an automatically generated paper SCP on patients' satisfaction with information provision and care, illness perceptions, and health care utilization were moderated by disease-related Internet use. METHODS: Twelve hospitals were randomized to either SCP care or usual care in the pragmatic cluster randomized Registrationsystem Oncological GYnecology (ROGY) Care trial. Newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patients completed questionnaires after diagnosis (N= 221; response: 74. 7 %, 221 / 296), 6 months (n= 158), and 12 months (n= 147), including patients' satisfaction with information provision and care, illness perceptions, health care utilization (how many times patients visited a medical specialist or primary care physician about their cancer in the past 6 months), and disease-related Internet use (whether patients used the Internet to look for information about cancer). RESULTS: In total, 80 of 221 (36. 2 %) patients used the Internet to obtain disease-related information. Disease-related Internet use moderated the SCP care effect on the amount of information received about the disease (P=. 03) and medical tests (P=. 01), helpfulness of the information (P=. 01), and how well patients understood their illness (P=. 04). All stratified analyses were not statistically significant. However, it appeared that patients who did not seek disease-related information on the Internet in the SCP care arm reported receiving more information about their disease (mean 63. 9, SD 20. 1 vs mean 58. 3, SD 23. 7) and medical tests (mean 70. 6, SD 23. 5 vs mean 64. 7, SD 24. 9), finding the information more helpful (76. 7, SD 22. 9 vs mean 67. 8, SD 27. 2; scale 0 - 100), and understanding their illness better (mean 6. 6, SD 3. 0 vs mean 6. 1, SD 3. 2; scale 1 - 10) than patients in the usual care arm did. In addition, although all stratified analyses were not significant, patients who did seek disease-related information on the Internet in the SCP care arm appeared to receive less information about their disease (mean 65. 7, SD 23. 4 vs mean 67. 1, SD 20. 7) and medical tests (mean 72. 4, SD 23. 5 vs mean 75. 3, SD 21. 6), did not find the information more helpful (mean 78. 6, SD 21. 2 vs mean 76. 0, SD 22. 0), and reported less understanding of their illness (mean 6. 3, SD 2. 8 vs mean 7. 1, SD 2. 7) than patients in the usual care arm did.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the sensitometric properties of a new non-silver halide photographic process called Kalfax. Development of this material is completely dry; it requires only applied heat. Special attention is focused on the Kalfax materials in regard to future military reconnaissance requirements of rapid in-flight processing and photographic materials that are immune to nuclear radiation. The Kalfax materials exhibit properties that fill many of these requirements. The information obtained from this investigation can be utilized for other applications where there is a need for a fast dry photographic process. A brief discussion of the Kalfax process is given to familiarize the reader with the light scattering technique to obtain optical density. The mechanics of using a photosensitive material in a polymeric vehicle to obtain the light scattering centers are explained. The striking differences between the nature of the Kalfax image and conventional silver image are discussed to enable understanding of different processes. The experimental procedure is outlined. A description of the equipment used for processing includes the sensitometer (exposing device) and the developer unit. Data is given for the ultraviolet sources used in the special sensitometers. The various types of heat sources that are useful for developing are examined. Several problems encountered in preliminary tests are described and analyzed. The major portion of this thesis is devoted to a detailed analysis of the photographic behavior of the Kalfax materials. The characteristic curves are given for the papers and films. A comparison is made between the high and low contrast Kalfax emulsions. Sepsitometric quantities such as fog, gamma, relative speed, maximum density and exposure range are given for each material. Printing densities, as well as, ultra violet densities are measured for the films. The true specular densities were determined in addition to the diffuse densities so the Callier factors could be computed. Because of the unusual photosensitive process employed in forming an image with the Kalfax materials, speed shifts are encountered for long exposure times. An explanation of this effect in terms of diffusion properties is given along with the characteristic curves which show these effects. Other exposure effects such as reciprocity failure, development delay and clearing times are examined. A series of tests to determine the effect of pre- and post-sensitization are described and analyzed in regard to speed changes. The effects of varying the development temperature are discussed briefly. A comparison of the Kalfax materials with conventional silver halide materials is made. The Kalfax films are compared with Micro-File under the identical exposure conditions. The Micro-File was 2. 2 x 10 ^ 5 times faster than Kalfax film type 94 (high contrast). Kodak Azo printing paper is compared with Kalfax printing paper under the same exposure conditions and found to be 2. 88 x 10 ^ 4 times faster. The Kalfax materials are lacking in sensitivity but they can be completely processed in dry form in a matter of minutes in a normally illuminated room. This is one of the advantages to be considered in these materials. The use of Kalfax materials in aerial photography is limited at the present time because of the low sensitivity. Considerable theoretical and experimental work is required in order to realize the potential of the Kalfax materials. There is however, a definite use for the Kalfax materials in the reproduction field.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to: • Compare and <b>contrast</b> <b>paper</b> display with {{on-screen}} display. • Examine the state-of-the-art in electronic “paper-like” screen display technology. • Highlight the screen display technologies that are under development and most likely to affect or replace print. • Introduce the subject of printed electronics. • Present comments from leaders in the display technology field. Today’s printing and publishing process involves repurposing content, publishing through multiple channels, and applying XML coding to separate form from content. All of these operations can serve, in one way or another, to disassociate print output from other forms of publishing. The result has been that information that would have been published solely in print is also published, or is exclusively published, for on-screen display. Although on-screen publication, or the presentation of information in some form of digital display, has accounted for a reduction in the relative volume of printing, it must be kept in mind that print-on-paper is just another form of display. As such, printers manufacture displays that are composed of one or more layers of ink on a succession of sheets of pulp-based paper. The recognition that printers are display manufacturers is of critical importance is of critical importance for three reasons. First, it helps to identify where the competition with print exists. Second, it forces printers to be aware of the incredible advances that are being made in the information display field. And, third, it can lead to the identification of ways in which printers can become part of the new generation of display technologies. Printing is the foundation of our information infrastructure, carrying the content that fuels innovation, records progress, chronicles history, delivers information, inspires creativity, supports learning, provides entertainment, and creates delight and amusement. Print, as an information technology, has played an important role in every aspect of human advancement, from the Renaissance to the Space Age. Printing remains the third largest manufacturing industry in the United States, employing over 1. 2 million people. Printed paper is not just a surface that holds information; it is an inexpensive, flexible display carrying a persistent message. Virtually all forms of graphic communication and visual media are expressed in some form of information display: a canvas, a wall, a photograph, a computer monitor, a television or movie screen, a PDA or cell phone display, etc. The relative ease by which readers move from reading on paper, to reading on a computer monitor or other electronic panel, and back again, attests both to the similarity of their functions and to the content that they display. Whereas electronic displays can provide highly accurate renditions of paper-based content, the reverse is not true. In addition, electronic displays are characteristically dynamic in nature, supporting animation and video, whereas the content of printed paper is immutable and permanent. Today, print has been unchained from its traditional paper foundation and been expressed through a variety of electronic channels. Its electronic format or “e-state” makes it suitable for expression in fixed formats, such as CD/DVD-ROM and other Read Only Memory forms; semi-permanent Copyright 2002 Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at RIT - All rights reserved. forms, where it is kept on storage media; or temporary forms, where it may be displayed on a pay-per-view basis. Books that at one time would have only been produced in print, are published in proprietary and non-proprietary electronic formats for e-book readers, and for display on laptop computers and various forms of hand-held digital devices. The market for all forms of electronic books is expected to reach 26 percent by 2015. 5 Virtually all major newspapers, and a majority of smaller newspapers, have editions that are delivered on the Internet (Figure 1. A survey conducted in 1999 by the Newspaper Association of America found that more than half of web users who sought news online went to newspaper web sites to find it. Print is losing its market to various forms of digital expression. An increasing proportion of the work of the Government Printing Office (GPO), for example, one of the largest printers and procurers of printed materials in the world, is going electronic. According to Richard G. Leeds, Jr., Manager, Electronic Systems Development Division, U. S. Government Printing Office: “We are driven by the printed product because that is where our revenues come from, and, actually, as the printed products have gone down and we provide more and more electronic products, basically what happens is the printed product has to cost more to produce the revenue to support these other products. We are in a lot of different areas, and we have been asked by the Supreme Court for a Real Server, RealVideo, RealAudio area, so our RealServer is up, and although print-on demand is not big, we have had different agencies and congressional entities want to have list servers, so we essentially put them up so they can distribute electronically, and although it is kind of like print on-demand, it’s not. “Over the last few years with our on-line products, because we are one of the biggest government on-line sites, where we see it, unfortunately, is not only the hits against our [printed] products, but as our revenue [declines] because the more they get used to using the electronic side, of course they want less and less printing….

40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation {{consists of}} five papers published in different scientific journals. All five papers {{are concerned with}} multi-stage production planning. Due to differing foci of the papers, this dissertation {{is divided into two}} parts. Part A embraces Papers 1 to 4 and contributes to a research stream that investigates energy aspects in multi-stage production planning. Part B features Paper 5 and investigates the influence of worker learning and forgetting on multi-stage production systems. Aside from the differing foci, the five papers also vary in the methodologies employed. The first paper presents a systematic review {{of the state of the}} art of decision support models for energy-efficient production planning. The remaining four papers develop mathematical models for supporting production planning decisions considering different measures to foster energy efficiency (Papers 2 to 4) and considering human factors (Paper 5). Papers 2 to 4 analytically solve the developed mathematical models. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>Paper</b> 5 draws on discrete-event simulation to derive effective production control policies. The following paragraphs summarize the five papers. Paper 1 systematically reviews the literature on quantitative decision support models which integrate energy considerations into mid-term and short-term production planning of manufacturing companies. The sampled articles are then classified and synthesized with regard to the characteristics of the modeling approaches representing different energy aspects. Based on the discussion of the sampled articles, Paper 1 identifies future research opportunities in the area of energy-aware production planning and thereby sets the stage for Papers 2 to 4 of this dissertation. Paper 2 studies how waste heat rejected by manufacturing processes in a two-stage production system can be utilized to foster energy-efficient production planning. Among the different ways of recovering waste heat, Paper 2 focuses on the conversion of waste heat into electricity using an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). To this end, it first describes this thermodynamic conversion process mathematically and then integrates it into a lot sizing model such that the electricity from the recovered waste heat supports the energy supply of the production stages. In a next step, Paper 2 proposes a solution procedure which derives optimal values for the lot size, the production rates of the two production stages, and the number of shipments between the two production stages that minimize production- and energy-related costs. In a numerical analysis, Paper 2 investigates how considering waste heat recovery in production planning can effectively reduce energy consumption in manufacturing and how it impacts production planning decisions. Paper 3 extends the model developed in Paper 2 and studies the use of an ORC-based waste heat recovery system (WHRS) combined with an electrical energy storage system (EESS). With the help of an EESS, generation and consumption of electricity from the WHRS can be decoupled. Using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), Paper 3 proposes a mathematical model that integrates time-varying energy prices alongside the technological processes of the WHRS and the EESS into the production planning problem of a serial multi-stage production system. This MILP model determines when production stages should process and how the WHRS and the EESS should be operated to optimize production- and energy-related costs. In a numerical analysis, Paper 3 examines how attaching an EESS to a WHRS can enhance its relevance for energy-aware production planning, particularly through providing the opportunity to store energy generated from waste heat in times of low energy prices and to then use it in times of high energy prices. Similar to Papers 2 and 3, Paper 4 also contributes to the research stream on energy-aware production planning. However, in contrast to the preceding papers, it focuses on the integration of onsite wind power into production scheduling of a flow shop system. Coordinating production scheduling and the energy supply from an onsite wind turbine poses a major challenge to researchers and practitioners as the intermittent character of wind power due to the vagaries of wind speed adds a stochastic component to production scheduling. The approach suggested in Paper 4 overcomes this challenge by first generating a large number of wind power scenarios that characterize the variability and the time dependence of wind power over time. A systematically reduced subset of these wind power scenarios subsequently serves as an input to a two-stage stochastic optimization procedure. Based on the reduced wind power scenario set, this procedure first computes a production schedule and energy supply decisions that minimize the total weighted flow time and the expected energy cost. The energy supply decisions derive whether the electricity generated by the wind turbine during a given time slot should be used to support the energy supply of the machines or be fed into the grid and thus determine the amount of electricity that needs to be drawn from the grid to guarantee an uninterrupted energy supply of the machines. These energy supply decisions are adjusted in a second step in real time as the actual wind power data are gradually revealed. In a numerical example, the effectiveness of the procedure in incorporating energy supply from non-dispatchable renewable energy sources (RES) in production scheduling is shown under various conditions. Part B of this dissertation consists of Paper 5. As Papers 1 to 4, Paper 5 is also concerned with efficiently managing multi-stage production systems. Papers 1 to 4 concentrated on how to effectively tailor the operation of production stages to energy supply from WHRSs or RES and time-varying energy prices. In contrast to these works, Paper 5 focuses on how to attune the operation of production stages to human characteristics such as individual worker learning and forgetting. To this end, Paper 5 first develops a generic simulation model of a serial multi-stage production system subject to learning and forgetting effects. Subsequently, it carries out an extensive simulation experiment to identify parameters of the production stages and their interactions which exercise a significant influence on system performance. Paper 5 then proposes flexible buffer management rules to counteract the impact of adverse production parameter combinations detected in the preceding simulation experiment. In a second simulation experiment, the performance of these buffer management rules is evaluated under various input parameter combinations...|$|E

[1995] show that only selfish behaviour survives in the deterministic replicator dynamics under the random matching rule. In <b>contrast,</b> this <b>paper</b> shows that, under an assortative matching rule, the fair behaviour may survive at an asymptotically stable state. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the ethnic identity of authors in over 2. 5 million scientific papers written by US-based authors from 1985 to 2008, {{a period in}} which the frequency of English and European names among authors fell relative to the frequency of names from China and other developing countries. We find that persons of similar ethnicity co-author together more frequently than predicted by their proportion among authors. Using a measure of homophily for individual papers, we find that greater homophily is associated with publication in lower impact journals and with fewer citations, even holding fixed the authors' previous publishing performance. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>papers</b> with authors in more locations and with longer reference lists get published in higher impact journals and receive more citations than others. These findings suggest that diversity in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references leads to greater contributions to science as measured by impact factors and citations...|$|R

40|$|In this Introduction, {{we review}} the logic that {{underpinned}} our earlier {{call for papers}} and compare and <b>contrast</b> the <b>papers</b> selected with those selected for a similarly-themed special issue of this journal that was published in 2013. We demonstrate changing research emphases and concerns {{and then go on}} to review the contents of the eighteen selected papers that comprise the current special issue...|$|R
40|$|NLP {{definitions}} of Terminology are usually application-dependent. IR terms are noun sequences that characterize topics. Terms {{can also be}} arguments for relations like abbreviation, definition or IS-A. In <b>contrast,</b> this <b>paper</b> explores techniques for extracting terms fitting a broader definition: noun sequences specific to topics and not well-known to naive adults. We describe a chunking-based approach, an evaluation, and applications to non-topic-specific relation extraction. ...|$|R
40|$|Sorting of soft-bottom macrobenthos {{entangled}} with Posidonia oceanica fibers is {{time-consuming and}} tedious {{because of the}} weak color <b>contrast.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes a staining-destaining technique that produces good contrast between soft-bottom macrobenthos and Posidonia oceanica fibers. The method has been tested on Corsican samples in oligotrophic areas characterized by small-size soft-bottom macrofauna. Our technique saves sorting time (- 24 %) and is simple to implement...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{write about}} democracy and democratization as a desired outcome of state-building, but few analyze authoritarianism. By <b>contrast,</b> this <b>paper</b> focuses primarily on authoritarian tendencies stretching over post-Soviet area. Having reviewed previous methodologies of measuring constitutional presidential power, {{the current research}} develops a new method sensitive to post-Soviet realities. The study also illustrates the relationship between presidentialism and authoritarianism and argues in favor of restricting presidential powers as hindering democratization...|$|R

In <b>contrast,</b> this <b>paper</b> argues that [...] {{in the presence of}} technical change [...] consumption externalities always affect steady state behavior, via their impact on the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption.
