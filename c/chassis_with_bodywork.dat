50|$|Midland Electric Vehicles was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats and other battery electric road vehicles between 1936 and 1958. They were based in Leamington Spa, {{and one of}} their major customers was Midland Counties Dairies, to whom they supplied just the <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> being built by the customer. At least two of their vehicles survive in museums.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, {{the design}} of small school buses {{underwent}} evolution. As the redesigned Ford Econoline and Chevrolet G-Series/GMC Vandura were introduced, the full-size van segment saw {{the advent of a}} new type of commercial vehicle: the cutaway van chassis, a van <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> unfinished beyond the front seats. In the context of school bus manufacturing, this allowed practical small school buses that were no longer adapted from passenger vans or full-size SUVs.|$|E
50|$|TS11 1972-1973 F5000. Based on the TS9 with a Chevrolet engine. Gijs van Lennep won the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship {{driving the}} TS11 and a McLaren M18. A TS11 <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> TS8 <b>bodywork</b> was {{prepared}} to run the 1972 Tasman Series after the TS8 intended for the series was wrecked beyond repair. Hailwood {{finished second in the}} series in this car.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} buses were {{converted}} in 1950 at the company's workshops in Bristol using old buses acquired that {{year with the}} takeover of Cheltenham District Traction. They had AEC Regent III <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Weymann <b>bodywork.</b> Following {{the success of the}} first year's operation, four buses that were more in keeping {{with the rest of the}} local fleet were converted. These had Bristol K <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> 5-cylinder Gardner engines and Bristol bodies.|$|R
50|$|After {{few years}} since its launch, the chassis of the Enviro300 became {{available}} with East Lancs Esteem <b>bodywork,</b> <b>with</b> {{the first two}} for Courtney Coaches entered service in 2006. This {{is the first time}} the Enviro300 <b>chassis</b> being constructed <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> by another manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The {{expanding}} trolleybus {{network in}} Perth, Western Australia, placed {{an order for}} 50 F4 vehicles in 1950/51. These were shipped to Australia as <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> provided on arrival. Ten of the trolleybuses carried bodies by Commonwealth Engineering of Sydney, while the remaining 40 were bodied more locally, by the bus manufacturer Boltons of West Perth. Boltons and Commonwealth Engineering formed a close working relationship during this period, with Boltons effectively working as a sub-contractor. All of the vehicles had 2-axles, with an entrance in {{the centre of the}} vehicle. A variety of configurations was available and Hull Corporation trialled a Roe-bodied Sunbeam in February 1953, which had a separate entrance and exit, and twin staircases. This reduced the seating capacity to 54, but the design, which was specified by the Transport Manager Mr G H Pulfrey, was well-received, and an order for a further 15 such vehicles was placed in April 1953. Electrical equipment was by Metro-Vick.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the later 2500M, the 2500 (marketed as the Vixen 2500 in the United States) was built between 1971 and 1972, and was designed to take advantage of the fact that the Triumph 2.5L inline-six engine had already been certified for US emissions standards (although only in 105 bhp form.) The final production run of the 2500 (comprising 96 cars) used the M Series <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Vixen-style <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
50|$|De Cadenet's Lola was 14th, {{finishing}} the race <b>with</b> a <b>bodywork</b> stuck together <b>with</b> {{a lot of}} adhesive tape. De Cadenet came back in 1976 <b>with</b> the same <b>chassis</b> updated <b>with</b> major <b>bodywork</b> modifications finishing third for what remains the best result of de Cadenet at Le Mans, and the best result of a Lola chassis.|$|R
50|$|In Italy Bandini was {{developing}} {{a car to}} take a Maserati power plant, {{as well as an}} O.S.C.A.-powered Formula Three model, reflecting the excellence of intra-business networking in Italy's industrial north. Meanwhile, a Bandini <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Zagato <b>bodywork</b> was prepared for Alex Raymond. A 1955 Zagato Berlinetta won the Concourse d'Elegance at Rimini in 1957. The Zagato was also the first to race in America. It ran at Sebring and Daytona Beach in 1960 (piloted by Paul Richardson for Racemaster).|$|R
50|$|Both the Type 562 and Type 710 sidecars {{share the}} same <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> only the <b>bodywork</b> being different. Both feature either a 16 Inch or 18 Inch wheel with a 160mm. {{diameter}} single leading shoe drum brake, which is linked, when fitted to a Jawa motorcycle, to the rear brake mechanism to provide balanced braking.|$|R
50|$|In early 2005 Kowloon Motor Bus ordered 25 B9TL <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Wrightbus <b>bodywork,</b> which entered {{service in}} 2005/2006. One of them (fleet number AVBW25) {{had participated in}} the EFE Showbus 2005 event in the UK before delivery. Among these 25 Wright-bodied B9TL, two of them are prototypes - fleet no. AVBW15 and AVBW26 (registration no. MG470 and MH7721 respectively). AVBW15 is fitted with a D9A340 engine coupled to a four-speed Voith DIWA864.5 gearbox instead of the D9A300 engine coupled to a {{six-speed}} ZF6HP592C gearbox, which is unique among the whole Wright-bodied B9TL fleet.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{standard}} body-style was popular, the 127 {{was a common}} basis for conversion to specialist uses, such as mobile workshops, ambulances, fire engines and flatbed transports. In South Africa, the Land Rover assembly plant offered a 127 4x4 with seating for 15. Land Rover also offered the 127 as a bare <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> just front <b>bodywork</b> and bulkhead, for easy conversion.|$|R
50|$|To {{meet the}} new {{regulations}} brought in by the ACO for endurance racing, the AMR-One {{is powered by a}} downsized, 2.0 litre turbocharged straight six petrol engine, which features a blade-fin behind the cockpit. The AMR-One is built around a light carbon fibre monocoque <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> open top <b>bodywork,</b> in contrast to the closed cockpits of the contemporary Peugeot 908 and Audi R18.|$|R
50|$|When Ventura sought new buses in 1992 Leyland {{had ceased}} production, so two Scania L113s and a Volvo B10M with Volgren bodies were {{purchased}} for evaluation. Ventura settled on Scanias after the evaluation period and {{have since been}} the main chassis used in the Ventura fleet with 293 in the fleet as at May 2013. It has also purchased 107 DesignLine bodied MANs. Since 2013 the fleet has switched to Volvo B7RLE's <b>with</b> Volgren <b>bodywork.</b> As of 2015, new deliveries have reverted to Scania, <b>with</b> their K310UB <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Volgren Optimus <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
50|$|ETN 909 W is a Shelvoke & Drewry Emergency Tender {{built on}} a Shelvoke WX SPV (special Purpose Vehicle) <b>chassis</b> fitted <b>with</b> Benson <b>bodywork</b> it was {{supplied}} new to Tyne & Wear Metropolitan Fire Brigade Fossway fire station in the East end of Newcastle. It is fitted with a Boughton 5 ton hydraulic winch and a 10 KW generator, which powers the extending lighting mast.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{fleet of}} Volvo B10L buses in the UK was {{purchased}} by Travel West Midlands, consisting of 80 conventional diesel-powered <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Wright Liberator <b>bodywork,</b> and 14 CNG-powered buses with Alexander Ultra bodies. The Alexander Ultra models are now converted to run on conventional diesel, with seven having been transferred to the training fleet before being returned to normal passenger use to replace the ageing Volvo B10Bs withdrawn from the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|As if the {{existing}} four bodystyles didn't suffice, a beach buggy version was introduced simultaneously. While highly prized by collectors today, the Buggy only sold about 100 examples {{and was only}} available for a single model year. The 440 kg Fellow Buggy was actually not a [...] "real" [...] Fellow, as it was built on a Hijet <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> fibre-reinforced plastic <b>bodywork.</b> The Buggy also used the Hijet's lower powered (...) engine, providing {{a top speed of}} 95 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Harbilt {{also built}} the HSV (higher speed vehicle), {{which was a}} general {{delivery}} truck. The payload was reduced {{to allow it to}} travel at faster speeds in urban traffic, and 30 were supplied to the United States Post Office for mail deliveries in Cupertino, California. The vehicles were supplied in March 1974 as right-hand drive <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>bodywork</b> assembled in Scotts Valley, California and this model was officially the HSV3. The main issue encountered was that the battery liquid dried up rapidly in the hotter conditions of California. Initially, each cell had to be topped up individually, but Chloride batteries developed a reservoir system, which allowed all the cells to be topped up from a single fill, significantly reducing the time spent on maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz W11 was a midsize six-cylinder {{automobile}} {{introduced by}} Daimler-Benz it 1929. It was {{developed from the}} Mercedes-Benz W02 first seen in 1926, and the W11 shared its <b>chassis</b> and <b>bodywork</b> <b>with</b> the W02, but the W11 came with a larger more powerful engine, a new name and a wider list of “standard bodies” from which customers could choose.|$|R
5000|$|While results {{continued}} {{to come with}} the production XK120 model, England and Jaguar boss William Lyons realised {{that it was too}} overweight and aerodynamically compromised to have a serious chance of winning the Le Mans race. Their solution was to take the drivetrain from the XK120 and to install it in a lightweight <b>chassis,</b> clothed <b>with</b> slippery <b>bodywork</b> designed by Malcolm Sayer. The XK120C (for competition), later known as the C-Type, made its debut at the [...] Le Mans race.|$|R
5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{example of}} a car-like dual-mode vehicle is the Alden staRRcar. The staRRcar looked like existing city cars of the era, using a steel <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> fibreglass <b>bodywork</b> on top. Batteries gave the vehicle a 30 mph top speed {{with a range of}} a few tens of miles. For longer distance trips, Alden envisioned concrete guideways similar to the existing interstate highways. When the staRRcar entered the guideway, small wheels {{on either side of the}} vehicle pressed against the sides of the guideways and handled steering, while an on-board guidance system prevented collisions with the vehicle in front - the only collision hazard in this mode of transit. Since the driving was automated, the vehicles could be operated with almost no distance between them, or [...] "short headways, which increased the capacity of the lanes. A single lane of guideway could safely operate at loads twice or greater than a conventional expressway.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{traditional}} kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, {{often called}} [...] "recreational" [...] or [...] "concession" [...] karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (usually from 10 to 30 minutes). They use sturdy <b>chassis</b> complete <b>with</b> dedicated <b>bodywork,</b> providing driver safety. Most of these enterprises use an [...] "Arrive and Drive" [...] format which provide customers {{with all the}} safety gear (helmets, gloves and driver outfits) necessary, {{and allow them to}} show up any time to race at a reasonable price, without the problem of having to own their own equipment and gear.|$|R
2500|$|Caterham {{have had}} {{something}} of a tentative relationship with the installation of motorbike engines into their cars. Since 2000, a Canadian firm has been selling Caterham 7 models using the GSXR1300 engine used in the Suzuki Hayabusa. It reportedly does 0-62 in under 3 seconds. In 2000 the Honda CBR1100 engine was installed into a [...] superlight chassis to create the Caterham Blackbird, delivering [...] at 10,750 rpm (although just [...] of maximum torque).

5000|$|Land Rover 127s {{were built}} on a special {{production}} line, and all started life as 110 4x4 chassis (the model was initially marketed as the 110 crew cab, before the more logical 127 name was adopted). These were then cut in two and the 17 in of extra chassis length welded on before the two original halves were reunited.
