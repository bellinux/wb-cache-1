40|$|Abstract. Certain {{analytical}} elastic {{solution for}} curvilinear track section under uniform thermal loading has been proposed. Track section {{is composed of}} circular arc, transition curves and straight lines. Next step is the analysis of two-dimensional model of the track structure (stress plane, without vertical direction). The rails and the sleepers are assumed as elastic bodies. The fasteners and ballast are modeled as elastic-plastic elements. Non-linear properties of these elements are determined by comparison of numerical data with experimental results. Cyclic uniform thermal field is applied as the load of the system. Pre-buckling analysis is the basic part of the considerations. Certain remarks on the track stability, based on the previous author analyses, are also presented.

40|$|Abstract. Considerable {{longitudinal}} rail {{forces and}} displacements may develop in <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR) <b>track</b> on long-span bridges due to temperature variations. The track stability may be disturbed due to excessive relative displacements between the sleepers and ballast {{bed and the}} accompanied reduction in frictional resistance. For high-speed tracks, however, solving these problems by installing rail expansion devices in the track is not an attractive solution as these devices may cause a local disturbance of the vertical track stiffness and track geometry which will require intensive maintenance. With reference to temperature, two actions are considered by the bridge loading standards, the uniform variation in the rail and deck temperature and the temperature gradient in deck. Generally, the effect of temperature gradient has been disregarded in the interaction analysis. This paper mainly deals with the effect of temperature gradient on the track-bridge interaction {{with respect to the}} support reaction, rail stresses and stability. The study presented in this paper was not mentioned in the related codes so far...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the results}} of {{numerous}} Discrete Cut Panel Pull Tests (DCPPTs) carried out on real track sections have been analysed. The aim is to evaluate the sleeper-ballast lateral resistance curves for a research project on the numerical and experimental study of the <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> stability under thermal loads. The main outcome is the possibility to characterize the ballast behaviour using curves which, if suitably represented, have led to discover an interesting property of the various railway track configurations. It is shown that this property is useful for the numerical simulation of the buckling and post-buckling response of the continued welded rail track under thermal stress. In the present paper, only the main experimental results, together with their graphical representation which allows to highlight the aforementioned property, are reported. Moreover, an analytical interpretation of the curves, which is useful to make easier their implementation in a finite element code, is proposed...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors determining the reliability and safety of operation of the <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> is the temperature of the rails. All conditions of laying, repair and maintenance of the track during the entire cycle of rails operation depend on it. The existing rail temperature monitoring method {{does not take into account}} a few significant factors and that leads to significant errors in determining the actual temperature of the rail bar. The authors propose a new rail temperature measurement method on a special test bench which maximally simulates possible environmental operating conditions for the rail bars, the profile of the roadway (embankment or cut), as well as the actual spatial latitude and meridian location of the rail slabs. At the bench, the studied rails are fastened with the help of rail braces on half ties, in the ballast bed, with sizes in accordance with the existing reference documents. At the first stage, the most common KB- 65 intermediate fastener for the continuous welded rail in Ukraine will be used, while in subsequent stages KPP- 5 fastening will be used...|$|E
40|$|Because thermal {{expansions}} are constrained within <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track,</b> {{the track}} can buckle, and does so {{mainly in the}} horizontal plane. In this paper, a parametric finite element model of railway track is presented, and its sensitivity to the variations of the main parameters that characterise the scenario has been investigated and discussed. Comparison with existing literature shows good agreement. It is found that curved tracks suffer from thermal buckling more than tangent tracks do. To simulate a track misalignment defect, a new methodology has been utilised that does not introduce, as is usual, geometrical discontinuities near the same defect, because it takes into account – in a natural way – the bending stiffness of the whole railway track in the horizontal plane. To contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the safe utilisation of raw experimental data obtained from in situ tests, a deep analysis of the effects on the thermal track buckling response produced by each parameter characterising the sleeper–ballast lateral resistance curve is presented and discussed. It is found that for current ballasted railway tracks, the minimum buckling temperature depends only on the limit lateral resistance, whereas a high value of the initial stiffness can lead to overestimation of the maximum buckling temperature, also taking into account the ‘natural’ decrease in the maximum buckling temperature due to an increase in the railway-traffic-induced defect amplitude...|$|E
40|$|Research {{activity}} currently {{sponsored by}} the Association of American Railroads and carried out by Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) in conjunction with Kandrew, Inc. Consulting Services has focused on improving the performance of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR) <b>track</b> through enhanced <b>rail</b> neutral temperature (RNT) maintenance practices. One issue being investigated {{is the process of}} restoring RNT that has been lowered when the rail is cut or broken at temperatures below the rail’s existing RNT. Readjustment of the RNT is accomplished by restoring the tension that was lost when the rail broke or was cut. This loss of tension is evident by the rail gap that is created at the break/cut location and it influences the rail over some distance each side of the gap. Ideally, the rail in this influence zone will be unfastened and the RNT brought back to a desired condition during the readjustment process. However, influence zone lengths can be long, requiring substantial time and resources for unfastening and RNT readjustment. This paper presents an approach where RNT readjustment lengths can be reduced without compromising the safety of CWR track. This optimized readjustment length is based on allowing a pocket of decreased RNT to remain in the influence zone that is compensated for by overstressing at the location where the rail broke or was cut. It is expected that this uneven readjusted RNT profile will be equalized by subsequent train traffic. ...|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{globally}} accepted standard separating {{high-speed rail}} from conventional railroads; however {{a number of}} widely accepted variables have been acknowledged by the industry in recent years. Generally, high-speed rail is defined as having a top speed in regular use of over [...] Although almost every form of high-speed rail is electrically driven via overhead lines, {{this is not necessarily}} a defining aspect and other forms of propulsion, such as diesel locomotives, may be used. A definitive aspect is the use of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> which reduces <b>track</b> vibrations and discrepancies between rail segments enough to allow trains to pass at speeds in excess of [...] Track radius will often be the ultimate limiting factor in a train's speed, with passenger discomfort often more imminent than the danger of derailment. Depending on design speed, banking and the forces deemed acceptable to the passengers, curves often exceed a 5 kilometer radius. Tilting trains have been developed for achieving greater comfort for passengers, so higher speeds are possible on curvy tracks. Although a few exceptions exist, zero grade crossings is a policy adopted almost worldwide, with advanced switches utilizing very low entry and frog angles. Magnetic levitation trains fall under the category of high-speed rail due to their association with track oriented vehicles; however their inability to operate on conventional railroads often leads to their classification in a separate category.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} the {{conception}} of carrying out investigation work on lateral resistance {{in the course of}} geometrical railway track alignment by using a tamping machine. It is a continuation of the experimental work on the application of the tamping machine to the <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> diagnosis. In earlier articles, attention was concentrated on the determination of axial forces in rails. An analytical approach to the evaluation of lateral resis-tances based on a continuous registration of the displacement and the force used by the tamping machine for the displacement of track on a horizontal plane (so-called slewing or shifting) is presented. The obtained results offer a possibility of estimating a phenomenon tested taking into consideration the state of the track ballast (the layer of crushed rock or gravel upon which the railway track is laid) bed stabilization, the distribution of the lateral resistances occurring along the length of railway track sections under tests, and also the effect of the longitudinal forces appear in track sections. The performed experiments have confirmed the thesis about the use of the tamping machine to diagnose the lateral resistance state in railway tracks. Some trends towards further undertakings in this sphere, of development character intended to polish up the measuring system, and the way of archiving and interpreting the measuring results have been formulated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track,</b> {{compared}} to jointed track not only reduces maintenance costs, but also increases life time of track components and {{the comfort of}} passengers. Since expansion of the rails is hardly possible in CWR-track, a temperature increase will result in high compressive stresses and track buckling may occur. Therefore the 'European Railway Research Institute' commissioned Delft University of Technology to develop a computer program, by which the stability of CWR on plain track and on bridges can be modelled and calculated in three directions. The computer program is called CWERRI {{and will be a}} major tool for railway companies for the implementation of new safety concepts. It further will be used for the revision of the Leaflet 720 R, which code prescribes the laying and maintenance of CWR-track. In this paper the stability of a track model is investigated. It is shown how the parameters of this track model can be derived from measurements. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the most significant parameters affecting the stability. It is concluded that the curvature, the horizontal ballast strength and the misalignment are the important buckling parameters. Only the very stiff fasteners improve the track stability considerably. Low fastener stiffnesses and the longitudinal and lateral ballast stiffness are less significant. Mechanics and StructuresCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{questions}} of operation safety for <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> under dynamic loads. We study the gap value formed in the rail bar in view of its possible break under the conditions of dynamic loads caused by the moving train and varying temperatures. Occurring strains are linked to a variable stiffness of the rail track base (ballast). Methods. We studied longitudinal oscillations in a semi-infinite rod under dynamic loads {{and in the process}} of thermal expansion of the finite length rod on the elastic-damped foundation. Oscillatory processes in a semi-infinite rod on an elastic foundation was modeled using the extended equation of longitudinal vibrations, taking into account the reaction of the foundation, performing the role of a damper. To determine the state of the model after the damping of oscillations we used the time limiting transition. In solving the problem of thermal expansion of the finite length rod on the elastic foundation we used equilibrium equation for small fragment, which takes into account the thermal load and the elastic force of both the rod and the foundation. Main Results. We have calculated the maximum value of the dynamic displacement of the rod end at different values of parameters. We have obtained the distributions of stresses and displacements along the rod length for different stiffness distribution in the elastic foundation. In the event of accidental break in the rail, the gap value after the damping of oscillations is set at the level of 5 - 7 cm. We have shown that the amplitude of these oscillations can reach 10 - 12 cm. The availability of limited stiffness change zones in the rail base causes no significant deformation of rail bars, but can lead to the growth of the gap in the rail bar break. Practical Relevance. The proposed model can be used in the calculation and design of continuous welded rail tracks...|$|E

Rail joints are also an issue, since most conventional rail lines use bolts and fishplates to join two sections of the rail together.
