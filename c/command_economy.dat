5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a <b>command</b> <b>economy.</b> The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E

25|$|The Incan Empire ran a large <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> using quipu, tallies made by {{knotting}} colored fibers.

He returned Czechoslovakia to an orthodox <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> with a heavy emphasis on central planning and continued to extend industrialization.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, by the 1930s, {{the growth}} of the urban economy and the exodus of farmers to the cities had {{gradually}} weakened the hold of the landlords. With {{the growth of}} the wartime economy, the government recognized landlordism as an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation of the Central Agricultural Association, a compulsory organization under the wartime <b>command</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{reversion}} to {{a socialist}} <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> seemed almost impossible. Russia ended 2006 with its eighth straight year of growth, averaging 6.7% annually since {{the financial crisis}} of 1998. Although high oil prices and a relatively cheap ruble initially drove this growth, since 2003 consumer demand and, more recently, investment have played a significant role. Russia is well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic development, with {{a long tradition of}} education, science, and industry.|$|E
30|$|The <b>command</b> <b>economies</b> {{operated}} {{on the so-called}} science-push linear model of innovation, which meant a one-way relationship involving academic science, applied industrial research {{and the introduction of}} new products or technology within socialist enterprises.

25|$|Just {{days after}} the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin resolved to embark on a program of radical economic reform. Unlike Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism—converting the world's largest <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms. In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> to make way for 'free market reforms.' In the early 1990s, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.|$|E
25|$|East Germany was an Eastern bloc state under {{political}} and military control of the Soviet Union through her occupation forces and the Warsaw Treaty. Political power was solely executed by leading members (Politburo) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party (SED). A Soviet-style <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> was set up; later the GDR became the most advanced Comecon state. While East German propaganda {{was based on the}} benefits of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} only {{significantly improved}} after the peace was gradually recovered. By the 1680s the Qing had consolidated its {{control over the}} empire, and favourable economic developments resumed.

25|$|Stalin {{suspected}} {{a possibility}} that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the Eastern Bloc. In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing {{to take advantage of}} the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed—a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree. Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy, something incompatible with the strict Soviet <b>command</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{became the}} first country to adopt a planned economy, whereby {{production}} and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a <b>command</b> <b>economy</b> was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade. After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses. The economy quickly recovered.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{investment}} in the Cuban tourism sector has increased steadily since the tourism drive. This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist <b>command</b> <b>economy,</b> {{to allow for the}} recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An additional factor cited by foreign investors is the degree of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.|$|E

50|$|Various regions have {{experienced}} prolonged depressions, most dramatically {{the economic crisis}} in former Eastern Bloc countries {{following the end of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. For several of these countries the period 1989-2010 has been an ongoing depression, with real income still lower than in 1989. This has been attributed not to a cyclical pattern, but to a mismanaged transition from <b>command</b> <b>economies</b> to market economies.|$|R
40|$|When a {{principal}} gives {{an order to}} an agent and advances resources for its implementation, the temptations for the agent to shirk or steal from the principal rather than comply constitute the fundamental problem of command. Historically, partially centralised <b>command</b> <b>economies</b> enforced compliance in various ways, assisted by nesting the fundamental problem of exchange within that of <b>command.</b> The Soviet <b>economy</b> provides some relevant data. The Soviet command system combined several enforcement mechanisms in an equilibrium that shifted as agents learned and each mechanism’s comparative costs and benefits changed. When the conditions for an equilibrium disappeared, the system collapsed...|$|R
25|$|From 1948 to 1990, Czechoslovakia {{was part}} of the Soviet bloc with a <b>command</b> <b>economy.</b> Its {{economic}} status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949, and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955. A period of political liberalization in 1968, known as the Prague Spring, was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union, assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries, invaded. In 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the Velvet Revolution; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} basic {{services}} were state-funded, {{such as education}} and healthcare. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods. Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice. Under <b>command</b> <b>economy,</b> consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of {{the goods and services}} that the planners could not. Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, Georgia's {{economy was}} within the Soviet model of <b>command</b> <b>economy.</b> Since {{the fall of the}} USSR in 1991, Georgia {{embarked}} on a major structural reform designed to transition to a free market economy. As with all other post-Soviet states, Georgia faced a severe economic collapse. The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis. The agriculture and industry output diminished. By 1994 the gross domestic product had shrunk to a quarter of that of 1989. The first financial help from the West came in 1995, when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund granted Georgia a credit of USD 206 million and Germany granted DM 50 million.|$|E
