60|$|A {{few days}} afterwards, Stannard's party stopped one evening at a small, empty homestead. Thin forest {{surrounded}} the clearing, but {{on one side}} the trees were burned and the bare rampikes shone in the sun. In places the crooked fence had fallen down, tall fern grew among the stumps, and willows had run across the <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground.</b> For all that, the loghouse was good, and since the horses could not go much farther, Stannard resolved to use the ranch for a supply depot. On the rocks the climbing party could not carry heavy loads.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} we started early, and reached Matavai at noon. On the road we met a large party of noble {{athletic}} men, going for wild bananas. I found that the ship, {{on account of the}} difficulty in watering, had moved to the harbour of Papawa, to which place I immediately walked. This is a very pretty spot. The cove is surrounded by reefs, and the water as smooth as in a lake.

After about half-an-hour's walking, all three in profound silence, they approached an old barn, which stood on the edge of some <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground,</b> but remote from everything like a habitation. It was itself, however, tenanted, for there was light in the windows.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{smile on}} her lips as she dropped to the ground to cross a little {{clearing}} where once had stood a native village surrounded by its fields. The ruined huts still stood in crumbling decay. The rank vegetation of the jungle overgrew the <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground.</b> Small trees already had sprung up in what had been the village street; but desolation and loneliness hung like a pall above the scene. To Meriem, however, it presented but a place denuded of large trees which she must cross quickly to regain the jungle upon the opposite side before Malbihn should have landed.|$|E
60|$|Bidding two of {{the peasants}} run to fetch some women, he lifted up the slight figure and carried her up the slope, the two lads following. On turning round {{the foot of a}} sandhill they saw a cottage lying nestled behind it. It was neater and better kept than the {{majority}} of the huts of the peasants. The walls of baked clay had been whitewashed and were half-covered with bright flowers. A patch of carefully <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground</b> lay around it. Jethro entered the cottage. On a settle at the further end a man was sitting. He was apparently of great age; his hair and long beard were snowy white.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Socgo, we rode {{to another}} estate on the Rio Mace, {{which was the}} last patch of <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground</b> in that direction. The estate was {{two and a half}} miles long, and the owner had {{forgotten}} how many broad. Only a very small piece had been cleared, yet almost every acre was capable of yielding all the various rich productions of a tropical land. Considering the enormous area of Brazil, the proportion of <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground</b> can scarcely be considered as anything compared to that which is left in the state of nature: at some future age, how vast a population it will support! During the second day's journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers. The forest abounded with beautiful objects; among which the tree ferns, though not large, were, from their bright green foliage, and the elegant curvature of their fronds, most worthy of admiration. In the evening it rained very heavily, and although the thermometer stood at 65 degrees, I felt very cold. As soon as the rain ceased, it was curious to observe the extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the forest. At the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a dense white vapour, which rose like columns of smoke from the most thickly-wooded parts, and especially from the valleys. I observed this phenomenon on several occasions: I suppose it is owing to the large surface of foliage, previously heated by the sun's rays.|$|E

60|$|The force started {{early and}} marched {{for three hours}} down the valley. Here they came on much <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground,</b> but the kraals had been deserted by the enemy. At four o'clock, as the cavalry were skirmishing at a {{distance}} on both flanks, they came upon a body of Zulus about 2000 strong. The horse fell back upon the infantry, but, as it was now late, Major Dartnell decided to encamp for the night, and to attack in the morning. A messenger was despatched into camp with {{a report of the}} day's proceedings, and some provisions and blankets were sent out, with news that the general would join the troops with reinforcements in the morning.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} {{they arrived at}} the bank of the White Nile. They {{followed}} it for upwards of a mile, and then the sheik, who evidently knew the way, turned off the bank into the river, the others following. The ford, for such it was, was shallow, the water scarcely coming up to the girths of the camels. Although the journey had been a short one, they halted again for the night in <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground,</b> a mile from the river, and Edgar was ordered to pick corn. The fields had already been ransacked, and it was only here and there that he found a head of maize hidden in its brown cases.|$|E
60|$|If {{he could}} walk {{straight}} for half a mile, he would strike a small hollow and by following it he would reach a tract of <b>cultivated</b> <b>ground.</b> This, he thought, should be marked {{by the absence of}} the taller clumps of grass and the short willow scrub which here and there broke through the snow. There would then be a stretch of about two hundred acres to cross before he found the little shack, whose owner had gone away to work on the railroad during the winter. He expected to have some trouble in reaching it, but he must get the letters, and he set off again, breaking through the snow-crust in places, and trying to estimate the time he took.|$|E

60|$|A {{little further}} the path divided into two, one leading along the beach, and across {{mangrove}} and sago swamps the other rising to <b>cultivated</b> <b>grounds.</b> We therefore returned, {{and taking a}} fresh departure from the village, endeavoured to ascend the hills and penetrate into the interior. The path, however, was a most trying one. Where there was earth, it was a deposit of reddish clay overlying the rock, and was worn so smooth by the attrition of naked feet that my shoes could obtain no hold on the sloping surface. A little farther {{we came to the}} bare rock, and this was worse, for it was so rugged and broken, and so honeycombed and weatherworn into sharp points and angles, that my boys, who had gone barefooted all their lives, could not stand it. Their feet began to bleed, and I saw that if I did not want them completely lamed {{it would be wise to}} turn lack. My own shoes, which were rather thin, were but a poor protection, and would soon have been cut to pieces; yet our little naked guides tripped along with the greatest ease and unconcern, and seemed much astonished at our effeminacy in not being able to take a walk which to them was a perfectly agreeable one. During the rest of our stay in the island we were obliged to confine ourselves to the vicinity of the shore and the <b>cultivated</b> <b>grounds,</b> and those more level portions of the forest where a little soil had accumulated and the rock had been less exposed to atmospheric action.|$|R
