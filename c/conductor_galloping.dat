40|$|<b>Conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> {{may cause}} flashovers and even tower collapses. The {{available}} <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> monitoring methods often employ acceleration sensors {{to measure the}} conductor translations without considering the conductor twist. In this paper, a new sensor for monitoring <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> of transmission lines based on an inertial measurement unit and wireless communication is proposed. An inertial measurement unit is used for collecting the accelerations and angular rates of a conductor, which are further transformed into the corresponding geographic coordinate frame using a quaternion transformation to reconstruct the galloping of the conductor. Both the hardware design and the software design are described in details. The corresponding test platforms are established, and the experiments show the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed monitoring sensor. The field operation of the proposed sensor in a conductor spanning 734 m also shows its effectiveness...|$|E

A new method for computing these estimates is presented. The method gives estimates of the amplitude and frequency of galloping limit cycles along with the wind speed at which they occur.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is a {{hysteresis}} phenomenon in the amplitude variation in the iced <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> with the wind velocity, which will have more obvious disadvantages to the overhead transmission lines. But hysteresis characteristics in the <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> have not received much attention. In this paper, a continuum model of the <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> with D-shape ice is derived by using Hamilton principle, where the initial deformation, the geometric nonlinearity caused by the large deformation, and the aerodynamic nonlinearity are considered. The aerodynamic forces are described by using the quasi steady hypothesis, where the aerodynamic coefficients are expanded by the polynomial curves with a third order and a ninth order, respectively. The hysteresis phenomenon is analyzed by using the approximate solutions of the Galerkin discretized equation derived from the continuum model by means of the harmonic balance method. The influence of the different factors, dynamic angle of attack, span length, initial tension, and conductor mass, is obtained in different galloping instability intervals. And two important aspects about the point of the hysteresis phenomenon onset {{and the size of the}} hysteresis region over the wind velocities are analyzed under different conditions...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> {{analysis}} overlaps several academic disciplines. Mechanical vibrations {{covers the}} laws of motion of the conductor and the long conductor acts as a mass suspended by an elastic spring obeying Hooke's law. Within the discipline of Mechanical vibration, <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> is categorized as a self-excited vibration because the forces which generate <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> are generated by the motion itself. One of the early leaders in modern mechanical vibrations, J. P. Den Hartog, described <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> in a chapter on self-excited vibrations in his text book Mechanical Vibrations, copyrighted in 1956 and reprinted by Dover Publications, where he develops general stability criteria for <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> but without a complete mathematical solution. However, <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> analysis also relates to Civil engineering because the electric conductors are carried by towers {{and the study of}} wind influences on structures, including any kind of vibration, has been much studied, especially {{after the collapse of the}} Tacoma Narrows bridge due to Karman vortex shedding from the structural members. In fact, perfectly round electrical conductors experience vortex shedding in certain ranges of the Reynolds number. The underlying behavior in the <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> phenomenon also applies to other civil engineering structural elements such as cables and stays on bridges. A more recent reference related to the analysis of <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> is Flow-Induced Vibrations, An Engineering Guide, by Eduard Naudascher and Donald Rockwell copyrighted in 1994 and still published by Dover Publications in 2005, in which experimental data related to vortex shedding frequencies as well as the aerodynamic forces on various structure shapes including cylinder models for a conductor or cable. Another book titled Flow-Induced Vibration by Robert D. Blevins, 2nd Edition published by Van Nostrand-Reinhold in 1990, also treats <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> while reporting experimental data related to vortex shedding and aerodynamic forces on various structural shapes. Both of the last-mentioned works include references to scientific and engineering journal articles, many of which directly relate to <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop.</b> In aeronautical engineering the term [...] "flutter" [...] is used to describe <b>conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> and analogous other phenomena involving aerodynamic forces interacting with elastic structures having inertial mass.|$|R
50|$|<b>Conductor</b> <b>gallop</b> is the high-amplitude, low-frequency {{oscillation}} of {{overhead power}} lines due to wind. The movement of the wires occur most commonly in the vertical plane, although horizontal or rotational motion is also possible. The natural frequency mode tends to be around 1 Hz, leading the often graceful periodic motion to also be known as conductor dancing. The oscillations can exhibit amplitudes in excess of a metre, and the displacement is sometimes sufficient for the phase conductors to infringe operating clearances (coming too close to other objects), and causing flashover. The forceful motion also adds significantly to the loading stress on insulators and electricity pylons, raising the risk of mechanical failure of either.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOverhead power {{transmission}} lines, their supporting towers, insulators {{and other elements}} create a highly distributed system that is vulnerable to damage. Typical damage scenarios cover cracking of foundation, breakage of insulators, loosening of rivets, as well as cracking and breakage of lines. Such scenarios may result from various factors: groundings, lightning strikes, floods, earthquakes, aeolian vibrations, <b>conductors</b> <b>galloping,</b> icing, and also include sabotage or terrorist attacks. It is impossible to monitor every kilometer of power lines, especially when they pass through inaccessible areas like mountains or swamps. This implies {{that many of the}} damage scenarios mentioned remain unnoticed or are detected too late. In most cases damage of the power system leads to instantaneous blackouts of small regions, but huge blackouts are also possible. Every power outage causes a great financial loss, threats to hospital patients, public transport or even national security. The paper presents a brief introduction to the field of damage detection in transmission towers, emphasizing indexes calculated by simple processing and using artificial neural networks. Problem of line sag monitoring is also mentioned. The paper ends with a short report on possible financial impacts of an SHM system for electric energy transmission and distribution system...|$|R

Considering {{strongly}} nonlinear {{characteristic of}} iced conductor rotating around its {{center of mass}} in the wind-deviation plane, two dynamic equations are constructed by using Den. Hartog criterion and O. Nigol criterion, and galloping characteristics between them are studied, which can provide references for constructing correct iced <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> models. By comparative analysis of two models, the vibration frequency of O. Nigol model is slightly {{higher than that of}} Den. Hartog model, and the amplitude of O. Nigol model is smaller. Then the stability of iced <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping</b> and the effects of parameters on galloping amplitude are discussed, from which can conclude that the trends of two models varying with parameters are basically identical. But for numerical, O. Nigol model is more accurate...|$|E

The paper analyses conductors nonlinear vibration in the case of external condition change to study the movement change of conductors.

40|$|It is pivotal {{to find an}} {{effective}} mathematical model revealing the galloping mechanism. And {{it is important to}} compare the difference between the existing mathematical models on the <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping.</b> In this paper, the continuum cable model for transmission lines was proposed using the Hamilton principle. Discrete models of one DOF, two DOFs, and three DOFs were derived from the continuum model by using the Garlekin method. And the three models were compared by analyzing the galloping vertical amplitude and torsional angle with different influence factors. The influence factors include wind velocity, flow density, span length, damping ratio, and initial tension. The three-DOF model is more accurate at calculating the galloping characteristics than the other two models, but the one-DOF and two-DOF models can also present the trend of galloping amplitude change from the point view of qualitative analysis. And the change of the galloping amplitude relative to the main factors was also obtained, which is very essential to the antigalloping design applied in the actual engineering...|$|E

The results show that we can make supplement reference to the wind tunnel tests through the numerical simulation method. Besides, we adjust the model and make research for the influence of diameter of conductor. The aerodynamic parameters we get can provide some reference to the research of <b>galloping</b> <b>conductor...</b>|$|R
40|$|During their {{long-term}} outdoor field service, overhead transmission lines {{will be exposed}} to strikes by lightning, corrosion by chemical contaminants, ice-shedding, wind vibration of <b>conductors,</b> line <b>galloping,</b> external destructive forces and so on, which will generally cause a series of latent faults such as aluminum strand fracture. This may lead to broken transmission lines which {{will have a very}} strong impact on the safe operation of power grids that if the latent faults cannot be recognized and fixed as soon as possible. The detection of broken strands in transmission lines using inspection robots equipped with suitable detectors is a method with good prospects. In this paper, a method for detecting broken strands in transmission lines using an eddy current transducer (ECT) carried by a robot is developed, and an approach for identifying broken strands in transmission lines based on an S-transform is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes the S-transform to extract the module and phase information at each frequency point from detection signals. Through module phase and comparison, the characteristic frequency points are ascertained, and the fault information of the detection signal is constructed. The degree of confidence of broken strand identification is defined by the Shannon fuzzy entropy (SFE-BSICD). The proposed approach combines module information while utilizing phase information, SFE-BSICD, and the energy, so the reliability is greatly improved. These characteristic qualities of broken strands in transmission lines are used as the input of a multi-classification SVM, allowing the number of broken strands to be determined. Through experimental field verification, it can be shown that the proposed approach displays high accuracy and the SFE-BSICD is defined reasonably...|$|R
40|$|Galloping of {{transmission}} lines creates some cyclic stresses in the conductor and accreted atmospheric ice covering the conductor, which {{may result in}} ice failure leading to shedding. Attempts {{have been made in}} this research to estimate these cyclic stresses and experimental tests have been conducted to study their effects on atmospheric ice. First, galloping of an ice-covered conductor was simulated by appropriate modification of existing models for bare <b>conductors</b> submitted to <b>galloping.</b> Then, the results of simulation were applied as input for a new model developed using ABAQUS. Results show that the layers of atmospheric ice at {{the top and bottom of}} the conductor endure maximum stress. The results of experimental tests with increasing cyclic stress show that ice does not break during galloping at wind velocities below 4. 5 m/s. The tests under cyclic loads with constant amplitude reveal that the ice does not fail under stresses corresponding to wind speeds of 3 and 4 m/s, and sometimes fails under stresses arising at a wind speed of 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{failure of}} {{transmission}} line systems is often attributed to dynamic effects {{such as a}} broken conductor, a broken insulator, or <b>conductor</b> <b>galloping.</b> The focus {{of this research was}} to develop a computer program, DYNTRN, that can analyze the structural response of a transmission line system due to dynamic effects, and present the response in a graphical form. The program uses the stiffness method to analyze a system consisting of conductors, insulators, and support structures. Four types of elements can be used to model the transmission line components: beam elements, cable elements, truss elements, and spring elements. A dynamic condensation method was introduced to efficiently model cable elements. Geometric nonlinearities were accounted for using the Newton-Raphson method. State-of-the-art software tools and object oriented design were used to develop a program that is modular and interactive. An object oriented method was developed to efficiently store and solve the stiffness matrix of the structure. Results obtained from the program were verified using commercial finite element software. The program was also validated using published experimental work. The final product of this research is a computer program that can graphically simulate dynamic behavior of transmission lines...|$|E
40|$|Transmission Lines often face severe ice or {{wind loads}} which may damage them and affect power system reliability. Even when the best design {{criteria}} are met, there are continues risks of extensive damage to overhead lines when extreme wind or ice storms exceed the designing criteria. One of weather related phenomena is galloping. The galloping phenomenon {{has been difficult}} to study due to his random nature. Moreover, utilities should not ignore effects of global warming and changes of climatic loads which may happen. In this paper, the minimum distance required between conductors of new 400 kV transmission line Tirana- Podgorica, is calculated using Davison’s method. The <b>conductor</b> loops during <b>galloping</b> are calculated in different conditions. The results show that in the standard conditions design, the galloping ellipses do not touch each other. Meantime, the 10 % changes of the standard conditions causes the contact between the galloping ellipses, either between the phases or between phases and grounded wires. The minimum distance between conductors and ground wires is suggested. In these spans it is noticed the phenomenon of non – elastic extension (elongation) of metal conductor, due to the fatigue as result of the long – term mechanical strain of the metal conductor...|$|R
