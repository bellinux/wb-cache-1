Clause 6 of the 1980 Social Security Act banned the dependents of strikers from receiving [...] "urgent needs" [...] payments and applied a <b>compulsory</b> <b>deduction</b> from the benefits of strikers' dependents. The government viewed the legislation not as concerned with saving public funds but [...] "to restore a fairer bargaining balance between employers and trade unions" [...] by increasing the necessity to return to work. [...] The Department of Social Security assumed that striking miners were receiving £15 per week from the union, based on payments early in the strike that were not made in the later months when funds had become exhausted.|$|E

The Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificate scheme that offered fixed interest was exempted from the Zakat deduction.The deductions were made {{on the first day}} of Ramadan, with Zia stating that the revenues would be used for poverty relief. Zakat Councils were established to oversee distribution of the funds. [...] The ordinance drew sharp criticism from the Shia sect which was later exempted from the <b>compulsory</b> <b>deduction.</b> Some Sunnis were also critical of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>deduction</b> and the way Zakat was distributed. The taxes have not been found to have eliminated rural and urban poverty or reduced the inequalities in wealth which had become a traditional feature of Pakistani society.|$|E

50|$|Taxes in France {{are made}} up of taxes in the narrow meaning of the word, plus social {{security}} contributions. Most of the taxes are collected by the government and the local collectivities, while the social deductions are collected by the Social Security. There is a distinction to be made between taxes (impôts), which applies to production, importations, wealth and incomes, and social contributions (cotisations sociales), which are part of the total wage paid by an employer when he remunerates an employee. Taxes and contributions together are called in French prélèvements obligatoires (<b>compulsory</b> <b>deductions).</b>|$|R
