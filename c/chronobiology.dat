25|$|The <b>Chronobiology</b> Laboratory {{studies the}} {{biological}} rhythms of insects. It {{was established in}} 1987, when researcher-in-charge Mirian David Marques finished her internship in <b>chronobiology</b> at the University of Minnesota. Research methods used in the laboratory include automated (or visual) records of insect behavior. When rhythms are detected the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of specimens are studied, searching for rhythm-generating centers using histology, histochemistry and molecular biology. Groups studied include springtails (Isotomidae), mosquitoes (Culicidae), crickets (Phalangopsinae), ants (Formicidae) and bees (Apidae).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} chironomid species inhabit marine habitats. Midges {{of the genus}} Clunio {{are found in the}} {{intertidal}} zone, where they have adjusted their entire life cycle to the rhythm of the tides. This made the species Clunio marinus an important model species for research in the field of <b>chronobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its natural-history collections, the Museum of Zoology has a library and laboratories dedicated to <b>chronobiology,</b> electron microscopy, molecular biology, histology and CT-scans. Its library {{has one of the}} most complete zoological collections in South America: over 248,000 volumes (including books, theses and dissertations), scientific journals, specialized magazines, maps, and electronic information-storage media.|$|E
25|$|One gene, coding for {{the protein}} Doubletime (abbreviated DBT), serves a similar purpose to casein kinase 1 epsilon in <b>chronobiology,</b> as it {{plays a role}} in the {{phosphorylation}} of PER. However its gene sequence shows no sequence homology. In addition, casein kinase 1 epsilon does not completely rescue circadian rhythms in fruit fly doubletime knockouts (dbt -/-), suggesting that these enzymes serve similar, but not identical, functions.|$|E
25|$|The MZUSP {{has one of}} {{the largest}} natural-history {{collections}} in Latin America, with over 8.5million preserved specimens of vertebrates (amphibians, mammals, birds, fish and reptiles) and invertebrates (cnidarians, insects, crustaceans, arachnids, myriapods, annelids, mollusks and other marine groups). Each collection is curated independently, and organized according to specific needs. Other facilities in the museum include a library specializing in zoology and laboratories dedicated to research in <b>chronobiology,</b> electron microscopy, molecular biology, histology and CT scans. MZUSP also operates the Boracéia Biological Station in the forest near Salesópolis for field research.|$|E
500|$|... de Candolle {{also made}} {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} <b>chronobiology.</b> Building upon earlier work on plant circadian leaf movements contributed by such scientists as Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, de Candolle observed in 1832 that the plant Mimosa pudica had a free-running period of leaf opening and closing of approximately 22–23 hours in constant light, significantly less than the approximate 24-hour period of the Earth's light-dark cycles. Since the period was shorter than 24 hours, he hypothesized that a different clock had to be responsible for the rhythm; the shortened period was not entrained—coordinated—by environmental cues, thus the clock appeared to be endogenous. Despite these findings, a number of scientists continued to search for [...] "factor X", an unknown exogenous factor associated with the earth's rotation that was driving circadian oscillations {{in the absence of a}} light dark schedule, until the mid-twentieth century. In the mid-1920s, Erwin Bunning repeated Candolle's findings and came to similar conclusions, and studies that showed the persistence of circadian rhythm in the South Pole and in a space lab further confirmed the existence of oscillations in the absence of environmental cues.|$|E
2500|$|The pineal gland was {{originally}} {{believed to be}} a [...] "vestigial remnant" [...] of a larger organ. In 1917, it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin. Dermatology professor Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues at Yale University, hoping that a substance from the pineal might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated and named the hormone melatonin in 1958. The substance did not prove to be helpful as intended, but its discovery helped solve several mysteries such as why removing the rat's pineal accelerated ovary growth, why keeping rats in constant light decreased the weight of their pineals, and why pinealectomy and constant light affect ovary growth to an equal extent; this knowledge gave a boost to the then new field of <b>chronobiology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} sleep {{medicine}} {{belongs to the}} second half of the 20th century. Due to the rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep, including the growth of the research field <b>chronobiology</b> from about 1960 and the discoveries of REM sleep (1952–53) and sleep apnea (first described in the medical literature in 1965), the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, and in many western nations within the two following decades, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and the treatment of its disorders had been founded. Most sleep doctors were primarily concerned with apnea; some were experts in narcolepsy. There was as yet nothing to restrict the use of the title [...] "sleep doctor," [...] and a need for standards arose.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chronobiology</b> is a {{field of}} biology that {{examines}} periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to solar- and lunar-related rhythms. These cycles are known as biological rhythms. <b>Chronobiology</b> comes from the ancient Greek [...] (chrónos, meaning [...] "time"), and biology, which pertains to the study, or science, of life. The related terms chronomics and chronome {{have been used in}} some cases to describe either the molecular mechanisms involved in chronobiological phenomena or the more quantitative aspects of <b>chronobiology,</b> particularly where comparison of cycles between organisms is required.|$|E

5000|$|Beling {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees. Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists (Forel, Buttel-Reepen, von Frisch) and helped inspire further experimentation (Wahl, Renner). Standing on the shoulders of these researchers, Pittendrigh took the field of <b>chronobiology</b> to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern <b>chronobiology.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the early}} work in <b>chronobiology</b> was done in Germany, so {{publications}} were largely written in German. Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today. The father of <b>chronobiology,</b> Colin Pittendrigh, critiqued these terms, saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms. He argues that ‘training’ and ‘memory’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior.|$|E
