5|$|On February 27, Hardy {{announced}} that {{both he and}} Jeff had finally left TNA, following years of speculation, with their contracts expiring that week. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a <b>contract</b> <b>agreement,</b> talks began to break down and changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys' departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys would teleport to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing {{in the arms of}} Decay.|$|E

5|$|If the bid was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights {{to negotiate with the}} player for 30days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a luxury tax when it exceeds $155million. If the MLB team could not come to a <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the {{rights to the}} player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Of the 55Japanese-born {{players who}} have played in MLB, 15 have entered the league using the posting system. Since the system's {{creation}} in 1998, the 22players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4million to $155million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> and five were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each posting and its outcome.|$|E
5|$|The War for Late Night {{chronicles the}} 2010 {{conflict}} surrounding the American late-night talk show The Tonight Show involving Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Carter gives biographical description of other late-night television personalities, including David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. As host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien decided {{to remain with}} NBC after attempts by ABC and Fox to attract him to their networksas NBC executives had told O'Brien that he would become host of The Tonight Show after Leno's retirement. While hosting The Tonight Show and analyzing ratings results, O'Brien told his manager Gavin Polone that he feared that Leno might be {{moved back to the}} program. Carter's book contains details of O'Brien's and Leno's contracts, and describes O'Brien's emotional state during the 2010 conflict. According to Carter, Leno had an advantage during negotiations because of a stronger <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> with NBC, which gave Leno the option to sue NBC if his program was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 2016–17 posting period, 22NPB {{players had}} been posted using the system. Of these, 12signed Major League contracts, three signed minor league contracts, five were {{unsuccessful}} in attracting any MLB interest, and two could not come to a <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> during the 30-day negotiation period. The four highest-profile players that have been acquired by MLB teams through the posting system are Ichiro Suzuki, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, and Masahiro Tanaka. The first three attracted high bids of $13.125million, $51.1million, and $51.7million respectively. Tanaka was the first player posted under the current procedure; he was posted for the maximum $20million allowed under the new rules. However, since its implementation the posting system has been criticized by the media and baseball insiders from both countries.|$|E

5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator {{the use of}} two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E

25|$|On March 6, Chiefs {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that quarterback Trent Green {{was asked to}} restructure his contract to remain with the team. Green was also granted permission to explore options of a trade to another team. The February <b>contract</b> <b>agreement</b> with Damon Huard, {{who would have been}} an unrestricted free agent, was the first public indication that Green’s job was in danger. The first team to have contacted the Chiefs' front office was the Miami Dolphins, but Miami constantly disagreed in negotiations. The Dolphins offered a seventh round draft pick to the Chiefs, but the Chiefs declined, instead seeking a second round pick in exchange for Green. The Detroit Lions, and Cleveland Browns were also interested in Green, who are both looking for a veteran quarterback. Green had told the Chiefs that Miami was his preference being that he previously worked under both head coach Cam Cameron and quarterbacks coach Terry Shea. On draft day, the Chiefs and Dolphins could not reach a deal to trade Green. The Chiefs changed their request to a fourth-round pick while the Dolphins offered a sixth round pick. As weeks passed with some believing that Green would remain with the Chiefs, Green's agent reiterated that Green would not return to play for Kansas City.|$|E
