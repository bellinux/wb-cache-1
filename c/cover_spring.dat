Frost-seeding forage legumes into small grain cover crops {{is an option}} for many farm operations. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the affect of frost-seeding date and small grain cover crop on the establishment and yield of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as well as a red and ladino clover (Trifolium pratense L. and Trifolium repens L) mix. Seeding dates included; early winter, late winter, and spring seedings. Fall planted cover crops included; control of no <b>cover,</b> <b>spring</b> oats (Avena sativa), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), and winter rye (Secale cereale). Seeding date was the most significant factor affecting legume plant populations. The spring seeding resulted in the highest populations and yield in five of six site years. Cover crop use increased plant population and yield, with no large difference among the cover crops used. Results illustrate the risk of frost-seeding, but also indicate the potential success with favorable conditions...|$|E
40|$|A lack of {{long-term}} measurements across Earth's biological and physical systems has made observation-based detection and attribution {{of climate change}} impacts to anthropogenic forcing and natural variability difficult. Here we explore coherence among land, cryosphere and ocean responses to recent climate change using 3 decades (1980 – 2012) of observational satellite and field data throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show coherent interannual variability among snow <b>cover,</b> <b>spring</b> phenology, solar radiation, Scandinavian Pattern, and North Atlantic Oscillation. The interannual variability of the atmospheric peak-to-trough CO 2 amplitude is mostly impacted by temperature-mediated effects of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific/North American Pattern (PNA), whereas CO 2 concentration is affected by Polar Pattern control on sea ice extent dynamics. This is assuming the trend in anthropogenic CO 2 emission remains constant, or the interannual changes in the trends are negligible. Our analysis suggests that sea ice decline-related CO 2 release may outweigh increased CO 2 uptake through longer growing seasons and higher temperatures. The direct effects of variation in solar radiation and leading teleconnections, {{at least in part}} via their impacts on temperature, dominate the interannual variability of land, cryosphere and ocean indicators. Our results reveal a coherent long-term changes in multiple physical and biological systems that are consistent with anthropogenic forcing of Earth's climate and inconsistent with natural drivers...|$|E
