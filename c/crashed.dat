To identify why more people are injured or killed when trucks are involved in the <b>crash,</b> we must examine to quantify the complex causal relationship between severity of the <b>crash</b> and risk factors by adopting the latent factors of <b>crashes.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a structural equation or model based on truck-involved and non-truck-involved <b>crashes,</b> including five latent variables, i. e. a <b>crash</b> factor, environmental factor, road factor, driver’s factor, and severity factor. To clarify the unique characteristics of truck-involved <b>crashes</b> compared to non-truck-involved <b>crashes,</b> a confirmatory analysis method was used.

This cross-sectional study examined variation in motor vehicle <b>crash</b> rates across 100 police patrols {{to investigate the}} association of <b>crashes</b> with key explanatory factors. Eleven <b>crash</b> outcomes (total <b>crashes,</b> injury <b>crashes,</b> fatal <b>crashes,</b> speed related fatal <b>crashes,</b> total fatalities, single-vehicle night-time <b>crashes,</b> rear-end collisions, and collisions involving heavy vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists) were identified from police collision reports and insurance claims and mapped to police patrols. Six potential explanatory factors (intensity of traffic law enforcement, speed limits, climate, remoteness, socio-economic factors, and alcohol consumption) were also mapped to police patrols. We then studied the association between <b>crashes</b> and explanatory factors using negative binomial models with <b>crash</b> count per patrol as the response variable and explanatory factors as covariates. Between 2003 and 2012 there were 1, 434, 239 insurance claim collisions, 386, 326 police reported <b>crashes,</b> and 3, 404 fatal <b>crashes.</b> Across police patrols, there was marked variation in per capita <b>crash</b> rate and in potential explanatory factors. Several factors were associated with <b>crash</b> rates. Percent roads with speed limits ≤ 60 km/hr was positively associated with total <b>crashes,</b> injury <b>crashes,</b> rear end collisions, and collisions involving pedestrians, cyclists, and heavy vehicles; and negatively associated with single vehicle night-time <b>crashes,</b> fatal <b>crashes,</b> fatal speeding <b>crashes,</b> and total fatalities. Higher winter temperature was associated with lower rates of overall collisions, single vehicle night-time collisions, collisions involving heavy vehicles, and total fatalities. Lower socio-economic status was associated with higher rates of injury collisions, pedestrian collisions, fatal speeding collisions, and fatal collisions. Regions with dedicated traffic officers had fewer fatal <b>crashes</b> and fewer fatal speed related <b>crashes</b> but more rear end <b>crashes</b> and more <b>crashes</b> involving cyclists or pedestrians. The number of traffic citations per 1000 drivers was positively associated with total <b>crashes,</b> fatal <b>crashes,</b> total fatalities, fatal speeding <b>crashes,</b> injury <b>crashes,</b> single vehicle night-time <b>crashes,</b> and heavy vehicle <b>crashes.</b> Possible explanations for these associations are discussed. There is wide variation in per capita rates of motor vehicle <b>crashes</b> across BC police patrols. Some variation is explained by factors such as climate, road type, remoteness, socioeconomic variables, and enforcement intensity. The ability of explanatory factors to predict <b>crash</b> rates would be improved if considered with local traffic volume by all travel modes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCrash injury severities are {{recorded}} in ordinal scales with fatal <b>crashes</b> ranking {{highest in the}} scale and property damage minor <b>crashes</b> ranking lowest in the scale. Various researchers have attempted to model injury severity outcomes by taking injury severity levels as either simple categorical variables or ordered categorical variables. The severity level of <b>crashes</b> vary with the collision partners, <b>crash</b> time, roadside activity characteristics and road inventory characteristics. Collision partner is the key attribute in determining the severity outcome of <b>crashes,</b> but severity of <b>crashes</b> vary even if the collision partners remain same. The influence of other factors on severity outcome may be fixed or random. This study makes an attempt to model the <b>crash</b> severity outcome for vulnerable road user involving <b>crashes,</b> <b>crashes</b> involving passenger cars and <b>crashes</b> involving only heavy vehicles using multinomial and ordered models. The model is developed using data from National Highway- 6 (NH- 6,West Bengal, India), considering <b>crash</b> time, roadside activity characteristics and road inventory details as contributing factors.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} <b>crash</b> {{experience on the}} US- 191 corridor using four different <b>crash</b> indicators; <b>crash</b> frequency, severity index, combined safety index, and <b>crash</b> rate per mile distance. The <b>crash</b> frequency {{is the number of}} <b>crashes</b> occurring during the study period for all <b>crash</b> types or for a specific <b>crash</b> type such as the frequency of PDO, injury, or fatal <b>crashes.</b> The severity index takes into account the severity of <b>crashes</b> regardless of its frequency. To calculate the severity index, weights are to be applied to the different severity-type <b>crashes.</b> In this study, weights applied to the PDO, injury, and fatal <b>crashes</b> are 1, 5, and 15, respectively. The severity index is found by multiplying the frequency of each type of <b>crash</b> by its assigned weight, summing all values, and dividing the sum by the total frequency of <b>crashes.</b> The combined safety index takes both frequency and severity into consideration in describing <b>crash</b> experience. Again, this index utilizes different weights for each type of <b>crash,</b> i.e., PDO, injury, and fatal <b>crashes.</b> The weights used in this study are the same as those used for the severity index discussed earlier. To calculate the combined safety index, frequency of the PDO, injury, and fatal <b>crashes</b> are multiplied by their assigned weights and summed together into a single index value. Finally, <b>crash</b> rate by distance (in miles) was also utilized in the analyses involved in this study.|$|R
40|$|Crash-prone drivers {{should be}} {{effectively}} targeted for various safety education and regulation programs because their over-involvement in <b>crashes</b> presents a big {{adverse effect on}} highway safety. By analyzing seven-years of <b>crash</b> data from Louisiana, this paper investigates crash-prone drivers’ characteristics and estimates their risk to have <b>crashes</b> in the seventh year based on these drivers' <b>crash</b> history of the past six years. The analysis results show that quite a few drivers repeatedly had crashes; seven drivers had 13 <b>crashes</b> in seven years; and {{the maximum number of}} <b>crashes</b> occurring in a single year to a single driver is eight. Actually, the 5 % of drivers who had multiple <b>crashes</b> were responsible for 35 % of the <b>crashes</b> that occurred in the seven years in Louisiana. <b>Crash</b> injury rate is also higher for drivers with multiple <b>crashes.</b> The probability of having <b>crash(es)</b> in any given year is closely related to a driver’s <b>crash</b> history; less than 4 % of drivers with no <b>crash</b> in the previous six years; and slightly higher than 30 % for drivers with nine or more <b>crashes</b> in the previous six years. There are variations in drivers’ age, gender, <b>crash</b> contribution factors, and type of <b>crashes</b> by the number of <b>crashes.</b> Based on the results, several suggestions are made on how to improve roadway safety through reducing <b>crashes</b> committed by drivers with much higher <b>crash</b> risk as identified by the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Constrained {{topography}} {{and complex}} road geometry along rural mountainous roads often represent a demanding driving situation. As a result, traffic <b>crashes</b> along mountainous roads {{are likely to}} have different characteristics to <b>crashes</b> on roads in flatter areas; however, there is little research on this topic. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the characteristics of road traffic <b>crashes</b> on rural mountainous roads and to compare these with the characteristics of <b>crashes</b> on non-mountainous roads. This paper explores and compares general <b>crash</b> characteristics including <b>crash</b> type, <b>crash</b> severity, roadway geometric features and environmental factors, and road user/vehicle characteristics. Five years of road traffic <b>crash</b> data (2008 - 2012) for Sabah were obtained from the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research. During this period, a total of 25, 439 <b>crashes</b> occurred along federal roads in Sabah, of which 4, 875 <b>crashes</b> occurred in mountainous areas. Categorical data analysis techniques were used to examine the differences between mountainous and non-mountainous <b>crashes.</b> Results show that the odds ratio of ‘out-of-control’ <b>crashes</b> and the <b>crash</b> involvement due to speeding are respectively about 4. 2 times and 2. 8 times higher on mountainous than non-mountainous roads. Other factors and <b>crash</b> characteristics that increase the odds of <b>crashes</b> along mountainous roads compared with non-mountainous roads include horizontal curved sections compared with straight sections, single-vehicle <b>crashes</b> compared with multi-vehicle <b>crashes</b> and weekend <b>crashes</b> compared with weekday <b>crashes.</b> This paper identifies some of the basic characteristics of <b>crashes</b> along rural mountainous roads to aid future research on traffic safety along mountainous roads...|$|R
