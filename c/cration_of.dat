40|$|The paper {{describes}} the RE-SEARCH ALPS project, {{which aims to}} gather, consolidate, harmonize and make available to different targets (public and private bodies working at local, regional and national level) data about laboratories, research and innovation centers which are active in particular in the regions of seven countries which constitute the Alpine Area (France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein and Slovenia). The project is complemented with a search engine which allows the users to directly query the dataset and to obtain geo referenced data as result. The data will be properly visualized thanks a visualizer developed in the project. From a research perspective, the project has to address hot and challenging Big Data issues, such as big data integration (to join data sources), entity recognition and linkage in large amount of data (to discover the same Institution represented in different sources), data cleaning and reconciliation (to address issues related to different representation of the same real object). The project has been applied in a call for the <b>cration</b> <b>of</b> Open Datasets promoted by the European Innovation and Networks Executive Agency through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding instrument. The project has been recently approved (AGREEMENT No INEA/CEF/ICT/A 2016 / 1296967) : it lasts two years and will start on July 2017...|$|E
40|$|The {{realistic}} {{drawing of}} the human anatomy is a basic lesson in the academic teaching {{of the field of}} visual communication design. This lesson is very important for the <b>cration</b> <b>of</b> illustration, design and as well animation. It is an intresting fact that American graphics novels like the ones of Marvel and Japanese Manga comics have a visible influence of how the human body is portrayed in drawings. While American Comics in Indonesia in the 1970 s, Japanese manga, which entered Indonesia in the Mid- 90 s, seems to taking over the leading role in Indonesia nowadays. The influence of American Comic art on Indonesian comic art was a more pronounced realistic portraying of the human body while Japanese manga had the opposite effect, the human body was portrayed in more distorted way. This development also shows how students of visual communication design actually draw and therefor perceive the human body. For these student, the human body they use in illustration and advertisement in based on the archetype of Japanese Manga art. With this development in mind Universities in the field of visual Communication design are advised in their curriculum to emphasize the teaching of a more realistic style in portraying of the human anatomy. With these efforts students willable to create illustrations, advertisement comic and animations which are both fascinating and imaginative...|$|E

Part of the thesis targets {{is the creation of}} models for analysis of an organisation, projection and follow-up <b>cration</b> <b>of</b> na IS. The thesis also gives the views of IS use [...] there it shows models for human resources and the views of services. The benefits of this thesis is the description of the methods of systém thinking, the application disciplines and their use while creating and using the IS. Other benefit should be the possibility to quicken the IS production and to lower external effects on the process of IS creation. In the domain of IS operation, the possibility of fuction modelling and the possibility of IT department simulation will be shown. In {{the first part of the}} work the topics of system thinking is defined [...] from its definition to division o the problematics. In the same part there is also shown the impact of worldview and the application desciplines are defined [...] such as systém analysis, systém dynamics and systém engineering. In the second part of the thesis, the reader can find the definition and analysis of the IS production [...] mostly from the view of organization, for which the IS is designed. In the last part the readers may find the view of systems thinking and its benefits in the area of IS operation [...] concretely the model, that shows and decribes the possibility of simulation and follow-up optimisation in the organization...|$|E
40|$|LUME, Núcleo Interdisciplinar de Pesquisas Teatrais da UNICAMP, com seus vinte e três anos de existência e experiência é um grupo de teatro - com sede na cidade de Campinas (SP) / Brasil - de grande referência em estudos de processos cênicos nacional e internacionalmente. A presente dissertação "Entre Lumes e Platôs: Movimentos do Corpo-Coletivo-em-Criação (Vivências com o Núcleo Interdisciplinar de Pesquisas Teatrais da Unicamp) " busca compreender possíveis contribuições do LUME à criação de técnicas para o trabalho de ator. Neste trabalho foi possível perceber que tradição, trajetória e técnica são constructos de um plano de consistência da experiência coletiva em teatro. E que este plano de consistência - o processo de experimentação e a contínua criação do corpo-coletivo - reverberará na ética-estética (entendendo estes conceitos como sendo indissociáveis e concomitantes). Em busca de territórios existenciais no campo teatral, foi possível: cartografar a concepção do grupo LUME através da análise de seu projeto escrito por Luís Otávio Burnier; por meio de entrevistas com os atuais integrantes do grupo, mapear relações entre a trajetória e elementos de tradição que o compõe, o tangenciam, o penetram e que transformam a pesquisa técnica do grupo; e ainda, conhecer, identificar, perceber e agrimensar nas entrevistas concedidas pelos integrantes do LUME algumas 'contaminações' que compõem a heterogeneidade do grupo. Com base em estudos conceituais e reflexões sobre as práticas do teatro contemporâneo e com linhas do pensamento filosófico, especialmente contribuições de Gilles Deleuze e Félix Guattari, a experiência da pesquisa se materializa enquanto tensões entre as fronteiras das práticas teatrais e de outras disciplinas. ". ____________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTLume, the Interdidisciplinry Nuclear of Theater Research of Unicamp, with it’s twenty {{three years}} old of {{experience}} and existence, {{is a group of}} theater – with its headquarters on Campina’s city (São Paulo) / Brazil – with major international and national reference of scenic process study. This present dissertation “Between Lumes and Platôs: Movements of the Collective-Body-in-Creation (Experiences with the Interdisciplinry Nuclear of Theater Research of Unicamp) ” Seeks to understand the possible contributions of Lume in to the <b>cration</b> <b>of</b> techniques to the work of actor. In this work was possible to realize that tradition, trahectory and techniques are constructs of a plan consistency of collective experience in theater. And that this plan if consistency – the process of constinous experimentation and creation of the body-collective-will reverberate on the ethical-aesthetic (understanding this concepts as indissociable and concomitant). Searching existential territories in the theater, was possible: to map the conception of Lume through analysis of their project, written by Luis Otávio Burnier; actor’s work through inrerviews with current members of the group, to map relations between trajectory and traditional elements that intergrates it, touch it, penetrate it, and that transforms the group technical research; and ywt, to know, to identify, to percept and measure on the interviews given by memners of the Lume some “contaminations” that compose the group heterogeneity. Based on conceptual studies and reflections on the practies of contemporary theater, with line of philosophical thought, especially the Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari thought, the experience of the research is materialized as tensions between the between the boundaries of theatrical practice and other disciplines...|$|E
