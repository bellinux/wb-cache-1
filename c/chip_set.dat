25|$|As speeds {{increased}} {{with the introduction}} of V.34 and V.90, Hayes increasingly became a follower rather than a leader. By the mid-1990s their modems were also based on the Rockwell <b>chip</b> <b>set,</b> and had little to distinguish themselves from other vendors.|$|E
25|$|Following the Open Graphics Project, {{an effort}} to design, implement, and {{manufacture}} a free and open 3D graphics <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> and reference graphics card, Timothy Miller suggested {{the creation of an}} organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community. Thus, Patrick McNamara founded the Open Hardware Foundation (OHF) in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The console was {{released}} on July 15, 1983 as the Family Computer (or Famicom for short) for ¥14,800 alongside three ports of Nintendo's successful arcade games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye. The Famicom was slow to gather momentum; a bad <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> caused the initial release of the system to crash. Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard, the Famicom’s popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan {{by the end of}} 1984.|$|E

25|$|During 2008, {{a rolling}} {{programme}} of transmitter updates caused approximately 250,000 set-top boxes {{to stop working}} altogether. Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of the}} update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network Information Table (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some set-top boxes. This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal <b>chip</b> <b>set.</b> Affected consumers were advised to buy new set-top boxes.|$|E
25|$|Building a MANET {{is still}} {{untested}} under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one {{goal of the}} laptop {{is that all of}} its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it has not done so.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1985, {{however, the}} {{microchip}} market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also {{due to a}} crowded and non-innovative chip market in the U.S. AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing, devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986, and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions {{were put in place}} to prevent predatory Japanese pricing. During this time period, AMD withdrew from the DRAM market, {{and at the same time}} made some headway into the CMOS market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.|$|E

25|$|The model rocket kits were {{a modest}} success and MITS {{wanted to try}} a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of Popular Electronics {{featured}} the Opticom, a kit from MITS that would send voice over an LED light beam. Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business so Roberts bought his partners out, then began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had just announced a set of six LSI integrated circuit chips {{that would make a}} four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> and was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. This calculator kit sold for $175 ($275 assembled). Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others over the next several years. He often accepted a copy of the kit as payment.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, {{cautions}} {{were published}} separately by Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz regarding the weak encryption and other vulnerabilities {{of the particular}} security scheme as implemented on NXP's MIFARE <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> and contactless electronic card system. In March 2008, articles on the vulnerabilities appeared in newspapers and computer trade journals. A comparable independent cryptanalysis, focused on the MIFARE Classic chip, was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen. On March 7 the scientists were able to recover a cryptographic key from the RFID card without using expensive equipment. With respect to responsible disclosure the Radboud University Nijmegen published the article six months later. NXP {{tried to stop the}} publication of the second article through a preliminary injunction. In the Netherlands, the judge ruled on July 18 that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published.|$|E
2500|$|IEEE 802.11b {{support will}} be {{provided}} using a Wi-Fi [...] "Extended Range" [...] <b>chip</b> <b>set.</b> Jepsen has said the wireless <b>chip</b> <b>set</b> will be run at a low bit rate, 2Mbit/s maximum rather than the usual higher speed 5.5Mbit/s or 11Mbit/s to minimize power consumption. The conventional IEEE 802.11b system only handles traffic within a local cloud of wireless devices {{in a manner similar}} to an Ethernet network. Each node transmits and receives its own data, but it does not route packets between two nodes that cannot communicate directly. The OLPC laptop will use IEEE 802.11s to form the wireless mesh network.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Due to {{the need}} of {{compatibility}} between software and hardware modules of a LCD TV system, we propose a software design with layer architecture for a LCD TV system. With the layer architecture, we need only modify the device driver layer for the different <b>chip</b> <b>sets</b> and the user interface layer for the different operating systems. With this advantage we can shorten the product design cycle for the different <b>chip</b> <b>sets</b> by the reusing most of the previous software modules. To reduce the design complexity of the LCD TV system, we adopt the mechanism of the state/event matrix and message queue instead of the complicated state machine design to control the TV system operation. ...|$|R

2500|$|Abrizio was a fabless {{semiconductor}} {{company which}} made switching fabric chip sets (integrated circuits for computer network [...] switches).

50|$|In 2011, Texas Instruments DLP {{announced}} improved chipsets {{that enable}} brighter images, and LED advances were such that pico projectors using that technology were also increasing in brightness.

2500|$|The Amiga 500 also sports {{an unusual}} feature for a budget machine, {{socketed}} chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips.

An extra-half-bright mode offers 64 simultaneous colors by allowing each of the 32 colors in the palette to be dimmed to half brightness.

Using `goodness of fit' measures the quality of manual segmentation on SAR target chips is presented. Using the expected metrics associated with the manual segmentation process, the performance of automated segmentation techniques can be evaluated.
