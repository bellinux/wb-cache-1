50|$|Durrant {{had left}} town {{to join his}} Signal Corps unit, where he was apprehended the next day, Easter Sunday. He was charged with the murders of Blanche Lamont and Minnie Williams. The trial was covered by major {{newspapers}} all across the U.S. A primary witness against Durrant was Blanche Lamont's sister Maud Lamont. She gave an account of her sister's life before her disappearance. She testified that Durrant often came to pick Lamont up to escort her to church and then home and that he came to her house offering to search for Lamont after her disappearance. The defense challenged her testimony about Lamont's weight, which she stated was approximately 122 pounds, with their claim that she weighed 140 {{and that it would}} impossible for Durrant to carry her up to the belltower. She also identified a diamond <b>chip</b> <b>ring</b> she had given Lamont that a man who was supposedly Durrant had tried to sell. His attorney defended him by citing lack of blood on him or his clothes and shifting blame to the church pastor, but Durrant was convicted and sentenced to be hanged by Judge Carroll Cook. Durrant never confessed to the murders, and stated he was innocent to his death Durrant was granted a temporary reprieve in 1897.

30|$|Nests were {{continually}} monitored using {{a camera}} system {{integrated into the}} nest boxes (Bezouška et al. 2005) from the hatching period {{to the end of}} each nestling period (mean, 16.3 ± 8.0 days/nest). Because Boreal Owls exhibit hatching asynchrony with hatching spans that average 6 to 7 days (Korpimäki 1981 Valkama et al. 2002), both eggs and hatched nestlings were found at nests at the time of camera installation. We recorded the actual foraging situation at these nests at the time of camera installation via the number of nestlings hatched and the number of stored prey items. We had three camera boxes; thus, we could simultaneously monitor three nests. The equipment we used to monitor the parental feeding effort consisted of a camera (DECAM, SINIT, Czech Republic), a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader device (PS 02, ELVIS, Czech Republic), a movement infrared detector (KS 96, KOTLIN, Czech Republic), and infrared lighting (IR diodes, SFH 485 – 2 880 nm, SOS electronic, Czech Republic). The camera viewfinder was installed inside the nest box opposite the opening. The camera device and chip reader device were installed in a special wooden box {{on the roof of the}} nest box. Each time an owl entered the nest box, the IR motion detector triggered the camera, taking digital images of the owl in the nest box entrance (n = 1 to 3 pictures, 1, 024 pictures could be stored in total). During the night, the opening was illuminated by infrared diodes at the moment the photos were made by the camera. To determine which individual entered or left the nest box, adults (12 females and 7 males) were fitted with a PIT tag <b>ring</b> (BR <b>chip</b> <b>ring,</b> BENZING, Schruns, Austria, primarily used for homing pigeons). The PIT tag reader (circle aerial with a 12 -cm diameter) was integrated into the entrance hole of the nest box and registered all movements of marked individuals in and out of the box. For camera boxes, we randomly chose among suitable nest boxes (i.e., boxes where it was possible to remove the old box, appropriate timing, and avoiding boxes located close to roads and paths to avoid attracting the attention of members of the public to the camera boxes). Upon finding a suitable nest, we replaced the old box with a camera box (at the time of late incubation or hatching). No female abandoned her nest as a result of nest box transfer. The entire camera system was powered by a 60 -Ah accumulator (DELPHI, AUTO Štangl, Czech Republic) and changed every 6 to 8 days.|$|R

In this paper, InP/AlGaInAs multiple quantum well (MQW) ring lasers with different cavity structures were designed and fabricated using the optimized process parameters. The measurement results shown that the fabricated microring lasers have a wide bistability operation regime, and are suitable for the all-optical logic gate and the optical random storage memory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for protecting netlist-based Intellectual Property (IP) cores in FPGAs by actively using voltage-controlled side-channel receivers. The receivers are realized by modulating the supply voltage of the chip, {{while at the}} same time detecting these changes from within the <b>chip</b> using a <b>ring</b> oscillator. The levels of the supply voltage can be determined by constantly monitoring the frequency of the ring oscillator. To prove authorship of an IP core, the verifier authenticates himself to the core over the voltage side-channel and sends commands that limit the core's functionality. By monitoring the regular outputs of the overall system, it is possible to detect illegitimately used cores after repeatedly turning them on and off. The working principle of our method is demonstrated by a case study, in which we protect several IP cores and place them on a Spartan 3 FPGA, and show the steps necessary for successful proof of ownership verification...|$|R
40|$|Each H-Disk ring {{assembly}} {{is comprised of}} 24 wedge assemblies. Figures 1 - 1 and 1 - 2 show the wedge mechanical layout. Each wedge consists of sets of two single-sided silicon detectors (referred to as inner and outer detectors, corresponding to their radial positioning) as provided by Moscow State University. Since these detectors are single sided, two mated inner/outer sets are arranged back-to-back such that they effectively become a double-sided detector with a 15 {sup o} angle between the strips on either side. Six SVX II chips are mounted near the outboard edge of each outer detector since this location provides access to bond pads spanning the entire detector surface. Since the detector and chip bond pads are on significantly different pitches (approximately 80 vs. 48 microns), a pitch adapter is used to transition this jump, thus simplifying wirebonding. With the accompanying electronics required to support detector operation placed adjacent to the <b>chips,</b> the mountirig <b>ring,</b> which also acts {{as a means of}} cooling for the wedge, is by necessity located some distance from the chips, which are the primary heat source.

40|$|Various {{processes}} can {{erode the}} surfaces of planetary ring particles. Recent estimates for Saturn's rings suggest that a centimeter-thick surface layer could be eroded from an isolated ring particle in less than 1000 yr by meteoroid impacts alone. The atoms, molecules, and <b>chips</b> ejected from <b>ring</b> particles by erosion will arc across the rings along elliptical orbits. For moderate ring optical depths, ejecta will be absorbed or inelastically scattered upon reintersecting the ring plane. Continuous exchange of ejecta between different ring regions can lead to net radial transport of mass and angular momentum, to changes in particle sizes, and to the buildup of chip regoliths several centimeters deep on {{the surfaces of}} ring particles. Because most of the erosional ejecta are not lost but merely exchanged over short distances, the net erosion rate of the surfaces of these ring particles will be much less than that estimated for an isolated particle. Numerical solutions for time-dependent ballistic transport under various assumptions suggest pile-up and spillover effects especially near regions of preexisting high optical depth contrast, such as the inner edges of A and B rings. Global redistribution could be significant over billions of years. Other features in planetary ring systems {{may be influenced by}} ballistic transport...|$|R

These chips form a single vertical ring network so as to fully exploit {{the flexibility of the}} wireless approach that en-ables us to add, remove, and swap the <b>chips</b> in the <b>ring.</b> To avoid protocol and structural deadlocks in the ring network, we use the bubble flow control which is more flexible and efficient compared to the conventional VC-based deadlock avoidance.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} and design simplicity are paramount concerns in on-chip interconnects for chip multiprocessors. Several proposed {{and a few}} implemented many-core on-chip interconnects are mesh or torus-based. These designs offer good scalability. However, most mainstream commercial <b>chip</b> multiprocessors use <b>rings,</b> in which each network node has relatively simpler ring stop logic. Network traffic injected into the ring continues until reaching its destination, so no flow control or buffering is needed, unlike a mesh. This design simplicity is attractive to implementors of small-to-medium-scale CMPs, and at lower core counts, rings can offer competitive performance with lower die area and energy consumption. Unfortunately, rings do not scale as well as meshes to large core counts. In this paper, we propose a simple hierarchical ring topology and router design, which we call HiRD (Hierarchical Rings with Deflection), to enable better scalability while maintaining the simplicity of existing ring-based designs. Hierarchical ring networks have been proposed before. However, HiRD has two major new contributions. First, unlike past hierarchical ring designs, HiRD requires no in-ring flow control or buffering. Instead, HiRD implements inter-ring transfers using “bridge routers ” which use minimal inter-ring buffering and, when the buffer is full, deflect transferring flits so that they circle the ring and try again. Second, we introduce two simple mechanisms which provide an end-to-end delivery guarantee (despite any deflections that occur) without impacting the critical path or latency o...|$|R

Different polyubiquitin chains have different functions. K 48 -linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation and K 63 -linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair. For this reason, chain topology must be tightly controlled. Using the U-Box E 3 ligase <b>CHIP</b> and the <b>RING</b> E 3 ligase TRAF 6 with the E 2 s Ubc 13 -Uev 1 a and UbcH 5 a, we demonstrate that Ubc 13 -Uev 1 a supports the formation of free K 63 -linked polyubiquitin chains not attached to CHIP or TRAF 6, whereas UbcH 5 a catalyses the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked to CHIP and TRAF 6 that lack specificity for any lysine residue of ubiquitin. Therefore, the abilities of these E 2 s to ubiquitinate a substrate and to elongate polyubiquitin chains of a specific topology appear to be mutually exclusive. Thus, two different classes of E 2 may be required to attach a polyubiquitin chain of a particular topology to a substrate: the properties of one E 2 are designed to mono-ubiquitinate a substrate with no or little inherent specificity for an acceptor lysine residue, while the properties of the second E 2 are tailored to the elongation of a polyubiquitin chain using a defined lysine residue of ubiquitin...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{modification}} by ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitination) {{is responsible}} for degradation of most cellular proteins, and therefore is crucial to most aspects of eukaryotic cells. Numerous diseases, including hypoxia, inflammatory diseases, muscle wasting disorders and cancer, were discovered {{to be affected by}} aberrations in the ubiquitin system. Ubiquitination is a highly regulated system carried out by complex processes through the hierarchical E 1 -E 2 -E 3 enzyme cascade, which involves thousands of enzymes and substrates in human cells. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these complex processes, the specificity of E 1 -E 2, E 2 -E 3, and E 3 -substrate recognition are poorly understood. In this thesis, we describes the protein production of E 3 RING domain, and structural and functional studies on the interaction network of E 2 conjugating enzymes: the complexes of the E 3 ligase c-Cbl RING with the E 2 enzyme UbcH 5 b and that with UbcH 7, and the complexes of the E 2 Rad 6 b with the RING E 3 Rad 18 and ubiquitin. The E 2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UbcH 7 and UbcH 5 B both show specific binding to the RING domain of the E 3 ubiquitin-protein ligase c-Cbl, but UbcH 7 hardly supports ubiquitination of c-Cbl and substrate in a reconstituted system. We found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the E 2 -E 3 interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH 5 B and UbcH 7 in their interaction with c-Cbl. The quick transfer of ubiquitin from the UbcH 5 B~Ub thioester to c-Cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that UbcH 5 B might functionally be a relatively pliable E 2 enzyme. In contrast, the UbcH 7 ~Ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions, indicating that UbcH 7 might be a more specific E 2 enzyme. Our results imply that the interaction specificity between c-Cbl and E 2 is required, but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets. In ubiquitin conjugation, different combinations of E 2 and E 3 enzymes catalyze either monoubiquitination or ubiquitin chain formation. Conjugation enzymes Rad 6 /Rad 18 only monoubiquitinate PCNA to signal for ‘error prone’ DNA damage tolerance. Ubiquitin chain formation on PCNA is catalyzed by a different set of conjugation enzymes: Ubc 13 /MMS 2 /Rad 5. Here we studied the structure of E 3 Rad 18 RING-RING symmetric dimer determined by X-ray, and the Rad 18 RING dimers can bind two Rad 6 b E 2 enzymes. In contrast, binding studies of full-length Rad 18 homodimer with Rad 6 b show that Rad 18 homodimer can bind only to a single Rad 6 b enzyme. Till now, the functional role of this asymmetry E 3 dimers found in not only heterodimeric E 3 ligases but also the homodimeric U-box E 3 <b>CHIP</b> and <b>RING</b> E 3 Rad 18 is poor understood. Furthermore, we show that E 2 enzyme Rad 6 is intrinsically capable of ubiquitin chain formation. The specificity of the reaction is provided by E 3 enzyme Rad 18, which prevents the chain-formation activity to direct the reaction towards monoubiquitination. The R 6 BD of Rad 18 provides the inhibition by competing with ubiquitin for a non-covalent ‘backside’ binding site on Rad 6. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how E 3 enzymes can regulate the ubiquitin conjugation process...|$|R

Besides her workaholic tendencies, Dr. Mizuno is portrayed as a good person who openly resents not having more time to spend with her daughter. Ami's father is never named, but is stated in the manga and anime to be a painter. The manga says that he never visits them, having decided one day not to come home from the forest where he was relaxing and painting, but he sends her postcards on her birthday. Thinking about this, Ami sometimes resents her parents' selfishness in separating, partly because divorce in Japan is taboo. However, in the anime Ami seems to appreciate her father and seems to share some of his artistic traits, at one point even composing matching lyrics for a tune that had none. In the manga, Ami's mother is revealed to be fairly rich, as they live in a condominium. Ami is shown testing the strength of a sword that the Sailor Soldiers received on the Moon by using it to <b>chip</b> a diamond <b>ring.</b> (Classically, a diamond is the hardest mineral.)
